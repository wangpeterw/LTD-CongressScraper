These schools hail from six States and count great African-American leaders such as Eva Clayton, John Lewis, and Martin Luther King, Jr., as members of their illustrious alumni.  The nine include: Alabama State University, Barber-Scotia College, Fayetteville State University, Howard University, Johnson Smith University, Morehouse College, Morgan State University, Augustine University, and Talladega  Their achievements for the past 150 years are remarkable.

It has been nearly 30 years since hardworking Americans have seen any significant changes made to our confusing Tax Our current system is broken. I think we all agree on that. Taxes are too high, and our families and businesses are the ones paying the price, not to mention that nobody understands it.  Two weeks ago, I was proud to cast my vote to cut, simplify, and reform taxes, and now the ball is in the Senate's court. Thankfully, as of yesterday, legislation has passed both the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate Budget Committee, and now we expect a vote in the full Senate as early as this week.  Under the Trump administration, we are growing the economy, but nothing can compare to the effect that tax reform will have on jump-starting the economy, expanding small businesses, and creating jobs.  America, it is time to go back to work. We are now closer than ever to making tax reform a reality, a new reality for families and businesses across America who deserve to keep more of their paychecks and have the opportunity to grow their businesses.  Mr.Speaker, I believe that we will uphold our important promise to deliver tax reform legislation to President Trump's desk soon.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-29-pt1-PgH9476-4.txt,2239,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,29,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these fundamental freedoms is an individual's right to ``keep and bear arms.''  While the original intent of the Second Amendment to the Constitution was the defense against an abusive, tyrannical government, the central principle is to empower Americans to protect themselves, their families, and, as we witnessed in the Sutherland Springs shooting, their communities.  Statistics show annual reductions in murder rates as concealed carry laws have gone into effect and that violent crime has decreased as gun ownership has increased. In fact, according to Gun Owners of America, citizens defend[[Page H9633]]themselves with lethal force against criminals twice as often as police do every year.  The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which I cosponsored, simply allows law-abiding citizens who are licensed to carry a firearm the freedom to travel between States, closes gaps and strengthens due process regarding our national criminal background check system, and maintains the reasonable prohibitions that are in place today, like keeping guns out of the hands of convicted felons.  I urge my colleagues to support it.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-05-pt1-PgH9632-6.txt,1E+14,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,5,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1068,topic-id,767,"Mr.Speaker, I am proud to represent a rural district in west Texas that is home to 14 million acres of farmland and thousands of hardworking farmers and ranchers. These men and women are feeding and clothing the American people. They are bolstering our economy and they are strengthening our national security.  As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, I am committed to delivering results that are in the best interest not only of west Texans, but all I am doing that with my neighbor and strong leader of the Ag Committee, Mike  As we craft the next farm bill, there are a few priorities that, if achieved, will put our United States farmers and ranchers, and our country as a whole, in the strongest competitive position.  The first is that we must maintain America's food and fiber independence from other countries, which, like energy independence, is a national security imperative.  To achieve this objective, we must maintain a viable and responsible safety net for all commodities, which means the committee must work in a bipartisan way to get cotton back in under title I of the farm bill.  We can never again let the World Trade Organization dictate agriculture policy to the United States.[[Page H9628]]  Addressing the gaping hole in the current agriculture safety net for cotton and fixing other shortfalls and risk management for both crops and livestock will ensure a strong, viable agriculture sector for the United States and rural  Ultimately, we must maintain appropriate programs to mitigate against unforeseen global market changes and commodity prices, ensure against adverse weather events, and maintain access to credit so farmers across the country can continue to supply America with abundant and affordable sources of food.  Additionally, as Texas is the top cattle-producing State in the Nation and represents $80 billion in annual cash receipts nationwide, maintaining key livestock disaster programs are equally important to a responsible and effective safety net for our ag producers.  Second, our rural communities need greater access to broadband communications to be viable in the modern era. Increasing access to broadband is fundamental to the survival of rural It is necessary to support critical infrastructure, such as healthcare and education, and for overall economic sustainability so that we can finally close the digital divide between rural and urban  Let me put it to you this way: no rural America; no food, fuel, and fiber for the American people.  Third, we need another generation of farmers and ranchers. The American agriculturist is facing tough times. The average age of a farmer is nearly 60 and the number of people involved in ag production in their thirties and forties continues to decrease dramatically, with less than 1 percent of the American population involved in ag production. The math doesn't look promising.  Operating expenses continue to rise and farmers, particularly the young ones, have less equity to finance their operations. Farmers of all ages need a dependable and flexible operating loan structure with loan amounts that are useful. We must work to ensure that the USDA has the flexibility it needs to extend credit in the most meaningful way.  Fourth, innovation makes it possible for the farmer and rancher to continue to operate. Ensuring adequate and equitable research funding for agriculture colleges across the country is key.  Let's not just pour all of our money into land-grant institutions just because they are land-grant institutions. Let's fund the best ideas. It is call meritocracy. That is what our country was founded on.  As former vice chancellor of research at Texas Tech University, I saw some of the best and most innovative ideas spawned from research go to market and make a difference for our economy and the quality of our lives.  Lastly, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program needs a more focused accountability. As we craft the next farm bill, we should continue to monitor the effectiveness of all programs, especially SNAP, which accounts for 80 percent of all spending in the farm bill.  While the intent is well-meaning, the unintended consequence is an increase of recipients who are work-capable adults without dependents, accounting for nearly 30 percent of all recipients. It is imperative to require that able-bodied adults work in order to receive government assistance not just in SNAP, but all government programs.  Mr.Speaker, in closing, our farmers and ranchers are central to the vitality and security of this great This legislation is extremely critical to the success of our farmers. By including the priorities I have outlined today in the next farm bill, we can ensure a safer, stronger, freer America for our children.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-05-pt1-PgH9627-2.txt,1E+14,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,5,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1797,topic-id,863,"Mr.Speaker, history is replete with examples of prosperous nations and powerful empires whose demise was not as a result of adversaries on the outside but, rather, the enemy within.  Congress and our President face several challenges to ensure the next generation inherits a safe, strong, and free country. There is the rise of global Islamic terrorism, escalating nuclear threats, increasing geopolitical instability, the need to modernize our military and ensure it is prepared to address those threats, and, finally, the need to revive our economy and give more and better jobs to middle and working class  While these are serious issues and they necessitate a sense of urgency and bold actions, they are all but irrelevant if we experience a sovereign debt crisis. This is not a hypothetical. This is a real probability, and if we stay on our current trajectory, we will all but assure our children and grandchildren will suffer the consequences.  If the United States experiences a debt crisis, how are we going to fund a safety net for our agriculture producers and our most vulnerable? How are we going to have transportation and other critical infrastructure to support economic growth? And, most importantly, how are we going to give the tools to our men and women in uniform so they will be successful and safe? How will we fund these national priorities if our government is insolvent?  Today, the United States is $20 trillion in debt--over 70 percent of That is roughly $165,000 per taxpayer. If all current policies stay in place, in the next 10 years, we will be $30 trillion in debt, or nearly 90 percent of GDP, the highest level we have seen since 1947, according to the We will have $1 trillion in annual deficit spending; and, get this, we will spend more on the interest on our debt than we will on national defense.  Just to give you a sense of how quickly this debt is amassing, in the next 24 hours, we will have increased our debt $1.5 billion.  I want to be clear. This is not a revenue problem. Just this past year, according to the monthly Treasury statement, the Federal Government collected record amounts of both individual income tax revenue and payroll tax revenue.[[Page H9439]]  The underlying issue here is runaway spending. We all know it. The American people know it. The lion's share of that spending is for mandatory spending. Mandatory spending is government spending on autopilot.  Today, mandatory spending makes up 70 percent of the entire Federal budget. In terms of growth in spending, over the next 10 years, 90 percent of the growth will come from mandatory spending.  We will never solve the national debt problem on discretionary spending alone. We must deal with mandatory spending, which means entitlement reform is the most serious and realistic opportunity to address our national debt.                              {time}  1215  Many of our entitlement programs are nearing insolvency. Without immediate action, some of these important social safety net programs will not be there for the next generation. With 10,000 baby boomers entering retirement every day--the largest generational retirement in the history of the world--these critical safety net programs, like Medicare and Social Security, will be insolvent; Medicare by 2030, Social Security by 2034.  We no longer have the luxury of kicking the can down the road. We are long overdue for action and we are fast approaching yet another debt ceiling.  The debt ceiling has been in existence since 1941, 70 years, and every time very little has been done to rein in spending as a result. It was supposed to serve as a warning so that we pause and consider the risk of borrowing more money that 74 times we have effectively just blown past through it.  We cannot continue to increase our borrowing capacity every time we hit the debt ceiling without some countervailing action to address our deficit and debt.  At what point is enough enough? How far do we want to put our children and grandchildren in the debt hole before we decide that this is a moral obligation and this is truly a looming crisis?  As Congress works to deal with the debt ceiling and our spending package that is here on the immediate horizon, it is important that we also introduce structural spending reforms. We need to have a balanced budget, for heaven's sake. We need to move some of the mandatory over to discretionary.  We need to set targets for reducing our debt. And if we don't meet those targets because we don't have the courage to do it, then it should be forced on us to cut across the board until we get this debt down to a manageable size for our children and for the future of this country.  Balancing our budget and reducing our country's debilitating debt is the challenge of the 21st century. It is my generation's greatest challenge. It is time for Congress to step up to the plate and get to work addressing the biggest problem facing our country. That means less partisan obstruction and thinking about our political futures and more courageous leadership and thinking about our children's future.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-28-pt1-PgH9438-3.txt,1E+14,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,28,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2063,topic-id,645,"Mr.Speaker, today is a good day for hardworking We are considering legislation that let's taxpayers keep more of their paycheck to save, spend, and invest as they see fit.  Our bill--the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act--will overhaul our broken tax code and finally put the American taxpayer first. Because we can all agree that hardworking taxpayers are the losers under the current system. Right now, our tax code rewards lawyers, lobbyists and loopholes--while leaving hardworking families and job creators behind.  The bill we are considering today will change all of that. To me, there is only one special interest group that matters--and that is the American people.  That's why we simplify the tax code and cut taxes for all Americans to ensure hardworking Americans--like the people I represent in Southeast Texas--can keep more of their hard-earned money.  It has been more than 30 years since the last time we overhauled our tax code. And since then it has grown to more than 70,000 pages.  I like to put it this way . . . our current tax code is now longer than the Bible with none of the good news. Over the past 30 years, Washington has piled up all these carveouts and loopholes for special interests--making things far too complicated and far too expensive for hardworking families.  This needs to end--and today the House will take a historic step to fix that and deliver long overdue tax relief to the American people. Here are the details:  First, we get rid of loopholes. Then we use that money to lower taxes. And then, we simplify the code altogether.  Now, instead of seven confusing tax brackets and carveouts, there will be just four--making things so simple that you can file your taxes on a postcard.  Importantly, we also double the standard deduction, increase the child tax credit, eliminate the Death Tax, and preserve the home mortgage interest deduction.  In addition--to help create more good jobs right here in America--we lower the tax rate on job creators from 35 percent down to 20 percent.  Today, many of America's biggest job producers face the highest tax rate in the world--which makes America less competitive and forces jobs overseas.  We fix that in our bill--because we want companies to invest, grow and produce jobs right here in We also reduce the tax rate on the income earned by small businesses to no more than 25 percent--the lowest tax rate on small business income since World War  Folks, let's not forget. When we reformed the tax system over 30 years ago, it led to an explosion in jobs and economic growth.  With the passage of this bill, we will be on the verge of achieving such greatness again. This is an exciting time--and the American people deserve some good news.  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to quickly follow our lead and get a bill passed so we can deliver a tax relief bill to the American people before  For more details on our bill, please visit www.FairAndSimple.Thank you--and God bless.

This motion has the support of Senators Whitehouse, Donnelly, and Van  I think we need to make our tax system simpler and fairer for hard-working families, businesses--particularly[[Page S7655]]small businesses--and manufacturers, and that is what I have been working for. Unfortunately, this is not the plan being presented today by Senate  Let's be honest with the American people. This bill is largely a tax giveaway to the wealthiest few and big corporations, while millions of middle-class families will get a tax hike. With this partisan bill from across the aisle, big corporations get permanent tax breaks--permanent--while middle-class families will see tax increases. In fact, most Americans earning less than $75,000 a year will see tax increases. That is simply not fair.  It is also not fair that the top 1 percent will end up with over 60 percent of the benefits, and in exchange, 13 million more will lose health insurance. Healthcare premiums will increase by 10 percent, and Medicare and Medicaid have been put on the chopping block to pay for it.  In addition, with the Senate Republican plan, powerful corporations can still deduct their State and local taxes, but they completely eliminate the State and local tax deduction for individual taxpayers. This deduction ensures households aren't taxed twice by the Federal Government on money they have already paid in State and local taxes, including property taxes. But with the current Senate plan, nearly one in three Wisconsinites will lose their personal income, sales, and property tax deductions. A recent study shows that it could decrease the value of home ownership. The average deduction in Wisconsin is $11,653, and nearly $10 billion of Wisconsinites' paychecks would be subject to a double tax--all to pay for a plan that favors those at the top. What is more, by the latest estimation from our own congressional scorekeeper, this plan will add $1 trillion--$1 trillion--to our deficit, breaking our promise to the next generation and sticking them with the bill.  Our Tax Code ought to reward hard work more than it rewards wealth. It doesn't do that today, and it will not do that tomorrow if this bill passes. In fact, this Republican plan's primary purpose is to reward Fortune 500 corporations who will simply reward the wealth of shareholders, not the hard work that drives productivity and growth across our economy.  The primary promise of this legislation makes the same promise that has not been kept to workers for decades. Trickle-down economics has not worked in the past, and it is not going to work now. American workers know that. But my colleagues, rushing to pass this legislation, don't seem to care, because the only thing that matters is delivering for donors, who have too much power and influence in  I want to see loopholes closed, like the one that favors Wall Street hedge funds and allows them to pay a lower tax rate than many Wisconsin workers pay. Earlier this year, I introduced the Carried Interest Fairness Act to close the carried interest tax loophole for millionaires and billionaires on Wall  The carried interest loophole allows certain investment managers to take advantage of the preferential 20 percent long-term capital gains tax rates on the income they get for managing other people's money, rather than the ordinary income tax rates of up to 39.6 percent that American workers pay. My legislation closes the carried interest tax loophole by ensuring that income earned by managing other people's money is taxed at the same ordinary income tax rates as the vast majority of working Americans pay.  As a candidate, President Trump included closing the carried interest tax loophole in his tax reform plan. While campaigning in Detroit last year, he said: ``We will eliminate the carried interest deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and for people like me, but unfair to American workers.''  Then this May, after being asked why his tax reform outline didn't mention carried interest after campaigning on its closure, the President responded by saying:       It's out. Done . . . carried interest was great for me, but      carried interest was unfair and it's gone.  I agree that it is unfair and it should be eliminated. However, it is not gone with this legislation. This loophole for Wall Street is still in the bill. Why? Is it because my Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle simply do not believe a word this President says? Is it because Wall Street lobbyists, big banks, and hedge funds have such a grip on Washington? Is it because these are the very donors that this legislation is meant to serve with a win?  Today I am offering a motion to close the carried interest tax loophole once and for all. It is simply unfair for Wisconsin workers to pay higher income tax rates than a billionaire hedge fund on Wall  If you agree, you will support this motion. If you want to help President Trump keep his promises to the American people, you will support this motion. Let's do right by the American people and close this tax loophole for the wealthy on Wall Let's make sure that our Tax Code rewards hard work as much as it currently rewards wealth.

117,topic-id,946,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of efforts to simplify our outdated and overly complex Tax Code in order to make our economy more competitive and to provide big tax cuts to hardworking American families.  Last night, the House voted to go to conference with the Senate to work out differences between our two versions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs I am confident the conference committee will report a reconciled bill capable of passing both Chambers, because the American people need and deserve tax relief.  Make no mistake: no matter what the tired talking points are on the other side of the aisle, this legislation will be a tremendous benefit to middle- and lower-income Americans who have been hit hardest by the policies of the previous administration. This is a massive victory for low- and middle-income  But don't just take it from me. Let's review the facts.  The House bill takes the lowest 10 percent tax bracket to zero, and it doubles the standard deduction, meaning hardworking Americans can immediately take home more of their paychecks. Specifically, the first $24,000 of family income will be completely tax free under this plan.  We are nearly doubling the child tax credit. The changes to all tax brackets means we are lowering taxes for low- and middle-income taxpayers even as we simplify the Tax Code and broaden the base.                              {time}  1045  A study by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation found that, in Kentucky, this legislation will create 11,782 new full-time jobs and will increase take-home pay by $1,724 by Kentucky households making the median income.  Not only will middle-income families be able to keep more of their paychecks, their paychecks will grow.  A letter signed by 137 economists last week, sent to all Members of the House and Senate, made the case that ``a competitive corporate rate is the key to an economic engine driven by greater investment, capital stock, business formation, and productivity--all of which will yield more jobs and higher wages.''  That is why these economists are urging us to make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act law. They note that our current corporate tax rate of 35 percent, which is the highest in the industrialized world, has made America noncompetitive, resulting in the loss of 4,700 companies to overseas competitors since 2004, lost jobs, and lost wages.  This analysis is confirmed by the Tax Foundation, which concludes that approximately 74 percent of corporate taxes are paid by workers in the form of lower wages. Let's give American workers a pay raise.  Reducing the corporate tax rate will ignite economic growth, allow jobs to return from overseas, increase new private sector jobs through greater investment, and increase paychecks. A win-win-win-win for middle class workers and those looking to get ahead.  Now, the ultimate irony is that if you actually wanted to help the wealthy and the well-connected, then you would vote against tax reform and you would keep the current Tax Code in place. It is a complicated mess of multiple brackets, high rates, and special interest loopholes. The Code is a haven for special interests, tax manipulators, and the well-connected. It is an impossible frustration for ordinary middle class Americans who need to comply with the Code to hire tax lawyers and accountants. So if you want to help the middle class, get rid of this complicated mess.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, I would like to take a moment to respond to my friends on the other side of the aisle who after more than doubling the national debt during the Obama administration and who continue to push massive unpaid increases in spending, such as single-payer healthcare--government-run healthcare--have suddenly become gravely concerned about our national deficit and debt.  Now, let me be clear: I welcome this epiphany. I welcome their change of heart. I hope we can work together to actually address the true cost drivers of our deficit and debt. But last year, the Federal Government took in $3.3 trillion in revenue. Our deficits are not the result of too little revenue. They are the result of Members of Congress who are unwilling to force the government to live within its means. We will never balance the budget or even think about paying down our debt without robust economic growth.  Those on the other side assume that a $1.5 trillion tax cut will increase the debt by $1.5 trillion. But that is based on the absurd assumption that nobody changes behavior when you get a tax[[Page H9629]]cut. It is based on the assumption that the economy is fixed. They are wrong because they don't account for the extra revenue that tax reform will generate by creating more taxpayers and higher paychecks.  As was noted by an analysis by the American Enterprise Institute and U.Policy Metrics: ``If the economy grows an average of 2.6 percent, the Republican tax reform bill would not raise the deficit. If the economy grows faster than 2.6 percent, the deficit would actually fall.''  It should be noted that in the last two consecutive quarters, the U.economy has grown at an annual rate of 3 percent or more. That is, in part, due to the increased confidence by businesses, consumers, investors, and entrepreneurs that we will indeed make good on our promise to complete tax reform this year.  Mr.Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues concerned about the deficit and the debt to join me in supporting the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act when this bill returns to the House floor so that we can ignite economic growth, create new jobs, and give American workers the pay increase that they deserve.  Mr.Speaker, it is their money.

695,topic-id,638,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.1699, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing  Homeownership, for many, is part of the American Dream, but overbroad and burdensome regulations arising out of the Dodd-Frank financial control law are limiting the ability of Americans to realize that dream.  A one-size-fits-all regulation issued by the CFPB makes it harder for lenders to offer mortgages to hardworking Americans who simply want to buy a manufactured home. By expanding the range of loan products considered ``high cost'' under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the CFPB has failed to recognize the unique nature of manufactured housing loans.  Due to the increased legal liabilities and stigma associated with making these so-called high-cost mortgages, many lenders have simply stopped making these loans altogether. In fact, according to the government's own Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, origination of manufactured housing loans of $75,000 or less has plummeted by 22 percent since this regulation went into effect. This data clearly showed that there is a negative impact of these Federal rules on the availability of credit for manufactured homes.  While virtually all mortgage market segments have been growing in the last few years, HMDA data clearly shows continued declines in small dollar loans for manufactured homes.  As a result, this regulation is harming low- and moderate-income families, particularly in rural areas, and existing homeowners are harmed because they will not be able to sell their homes. These regulations are hitting Americans in rural areas of modest means the most.  Take, for example, the hospital worker in And, yes, Mr.Speaker, this is about the hospital worker in Kentucky, not Warren This hospital worker applied for a loan of $38,500 to finance a manufactured home. He had an 8 percent down payment. His monthly income was $2,200 per month--plenty to cover the all-in[[Page H9578]]housing costs of $675 per month. The payment he would have been investing in his own home would have been less than what he was spending on rent. But he couldn't get financing. He contacted his local banks and credit unions, but they no longer finance manufactured homes.  This is not about Warren This is about helping low-income Americans achieve the American The reasons for this crippling lack of credit are unaccountable, unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and their ``high-cost'' loan regulations and the definitions of mortgage originator and loan originator established in the Dodd-Frank  These regulations fail to take into account the unique circumstances associated with manufactured housing and the fixed costs associated with the purchase of any home, large or small. They fail to recognize the simple, mathematical fact that fixed costs on smaller loans translate into higher percentages of the total loan. They fail to recognize that even if interest payments on manufactured homes are more than your average home, the payments are still more affordable than the all-in cost of a site-built home or even rent in many markets.  This is especially the case when one considers that purchasing a manufactured home as opposed to renting allows these owners to build equity leading to financial stability for their families.  This bipartisan bill, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act, recognizes the unique nature of manufactured housing, something that bureaucrats in Washington don't know anything about. They don't know anything about what goes on in rural This fixes these government-caused problems by modifying the definition of loan originators and mortgage originators to exclude manufactured housing retailers and sellers from the definition of a loan or mortgage originator, so long as they are only receiving compensation for the sale of the home and not engaged in loan offerings.  The legislation also increases the thresholds for high-cost loans to accommodate manufactured home purchases of up to $75,000.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

794,topic-id,751,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in favor of this rule that would allow the House of Representatives to debate legislation I introduced, H.1699, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act.[[Page H9532]]  Homeownership, for many, is part of the American Dream; however, overbroad and burdensome regulations arising out of the Dodd-Frank financial control law are limiting the ability of Americans to realize this dream.  Specifically, a one-size-fits-all regulation issued by the unaccountable Consumer Financial Protection Bureau makes it harder for lenders to offer mortgages to hardworking Americans who simply want to buy a manufactured home. By expanding the range of loan products considered ``high cost'' under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the CFPB has failed to recognize the unique nature of manufactured housing loans. Because of the increased legal liabilities and stigma associated with making a so-called high-cost mortgage, some lenders have simply stopped making these loans.  According to recent Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, data that is submitted to the government, the number of manufactured homes of $75,000 or less has plummeted by 22 percent since this regulation went into effect. As a result, the CFPB's overzealous regulation harms lower and moderate-income families, particularly in rural areas, who just want to purchase a manufactured home but, now, cannot access the necessary financing. In addition, existing homeowners are harmed because they won't be able to sell their homes.  These rules are hitting Americans in rural and suburban areas and those with modest means the hardest. Take, for example, the hospital worker, in Kentucky, who applied for a loan of $38,500 to finance a manufactured home. He had an 8 percent downpayment. His monthly income was $2,200 per month, plenty to cover the all-in housing costs of $670 per month. The payment he would have been investing in his own home would have been less than what he was spending on rent, but he was unable to get financing. He contacted local banks and credit unions, but they no longer finance manufactured homes.  The reason for this crippling lack of lending is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and its so-called high-cost loan regulations and the definitions of ``mortgage originator'' and ``loan originator'' established in Dodd-These regulations fail to take into account the unique circumstances associated with manufactured housing and the fixed costs associated with any home purchase, large or small. They fail to recognize the simple mathematical fact that fixed costs on smaller loans translate into higher percentages of the total loan.  Even if interest payments on manufactured homes are more than your average home, the payments are still more affordable than the all-in cost of a site-built home--or even rent, in many markets. That is not predatory lending. That is actually getting people into more affordable housing. This is especially the case when you consider that purchasing a manufactured home, as opposed to renting, allows the owners to build equity, leading to financial stability for those  The Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act recognizes the unique nature of the manufactured housing industry, and it fixes these government-caused problems by modifying the definition of ``loan originators'' and ``mortgage originators'' to exclude manufactured housing retailers and sellers from the definition of ``loan originator'' so long as they are only receiving compensation for the sale of the home and not engaged in the financing of the loans.  The legislation also increases the thresholds for high-cost loans to accommodate manufactured home purchases of up to $75,000 while still retaining tough restrictions on lenders to prevent any borrowers from being taken advantage of.

We need to end government policies that are issued under the guise of consumer protection when those policies actually are protecting Americans right out of homeownership. Again, that is not consumer protection.  So, for these reasons and the fact that about 40 different proconsumer and probusiness trade associations support this legislation, I urge my colleagues to vote for this rule.  This is not the only reason why we should vote for the rule. The other legislation, introduced by my friend from Kentucky, the Ensuring a Qualified Civil Service Act, is another piece of legislation that will help ensure that the U.Federal Government has a competent workforce.  Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Comer for his hard work on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to vote for this rule.

1968,topic-id,1921,"Mr.President, this week, we are debating the Republican tax relief plan.  I had a telephone townhall meeting the other night, along with Senator Enzi, and we talked to the people of Wyoming who have actually done the math and looked at the impact of the things that are included in this proposal--doubling the standard deduction and the child tax credit. People think it is a good deal for them personally, so there is a lot to like in this legislation. It gives tax cuts to hard-working American families; it makes taxes simpler and fairer; it makes American businesses more competitive around the world; and it makes our economy stronger here at home. That is all good news for our country and for the American people.  Now, there is other good news in this legislation, and it is something I continue to hear about at home and heard about over the Thanksgiving recess in Wyoming, which is that it wipes out the ObamaCare insurance mandate tax. This is the tax penalty the Obama healthcare law forced on the American people. Under the Republican plan, people would no longer have to pay a tax penalty to the IRS if they did not want the Democrats' expensive health insurance or if they just couldn't afford it.  We have seen health insurance premiums skyrocket over the past few years in this country, and it is because of the way Democrats wrote the healthcare law. The cost and the deductibles are so high that many people find that even if they have paid for the expensive insurance, they still can't afford to get the care they need. The law says that no matter how expensive the insurance gets or how unusable it is for that individual, by law, people still have to buy it or pay a tax.  Families ought to be able to make decisions about what they want to buy and what works for them, not the government. I believe that if people don't want to buy the ObamaCare insurance, they shouldn't have to pay a tax penalty to the Those are the things we are looking at.  Interestingly, today in the New York Times, there was more than half a page devoted to this. ``Millions Pay Penalty Instead of Buying Who Are They?'' Well, in the State of Wyoming, over 15,000 people paid over $5 million in fines to the This article today says that 6.7 million tax filers paid the penalty in 2015. Who are they? Well, it is not surprising to the Presiding Officer that the great majority of these--8 out of 10 who paid the fine--have an adjusted family income of less than $50,000. It says the $25,000 to $50,000 income range group had the highest share of people paying the penalty in 2015. Why do we think those people aren't able to buy the insurance? It is too expensive. It is not a good deal for them. That is why even the New York Times is reporting that the $25,000 to $50,000 income group--hard-working American families--has the highest share of people paying the penalty.  Then they questioned why they paid the penalty, and it was because they couldn't afford the insurance. It is right here in black and white. It points out that the average penalty in 2017 is $708. That is money those families could use for many other things, but it is not enough compared to the cost of the insurance, which is even higher. A single woman would have to pay a tax of either $695 or 2.5 percent of her income, whichever is higher. That is the rule. The average is over $700. For a couple, the tax would be double. A family with kids would pay additional for each of the children. The majority of Americans say they don't have enough savings to cover a $500 emergency expense if one came up.  Who actually pays? These 16,000 people in Wyoming who paid the penalty are hard-working men and women who are opposed to the fact that Washington--the Federal Government under ObamaCare--says they have to pay a tax if they don't buy a government product that doesn't work for them.  Across the country, over 6 million people were hit with this extra tax. The ObamaCare insurance mandate tax is a direct tax on the working people of this country. I think it is not right. The Republican Party Members of the Senate think it is not right. Washington should not make people pay higher taxes just because they can't afford expensive ObamaCare insurance. People shouldn't be forced to buy a product that is not the right choice for them and their families.  The Congressional Budget Office says that if we get rid of the insurance mandate, 13 million people will eventually decide under their own free will not to have insurance. These people don't view it as a good benefit for them. That is why they may walk away from it. They don't view it as worth their money. Republicans want to give all these people a tax cut. Democrats want to make sure that people still have to pay the tax penalty.  There is a lot that I want to change about how America's healthcare system works. I want to repeal the entire healthcare law that the Democrats wrote a few years ago. I want to return[[Page S7375]]the money and the decisions back to the people or do that at the State level, where people at the local level can make the best decisions about what works best for them and their State, not a one-size-fits-all coming out of I haven't given up on trying to get that done because we need to make healthcare better in this country.  In Wyoming, we are down to just one insurer willing to sell these policies. That is happening more and more around the country. One insurer is not a marketplace but a monopoly. That has left many people at the breaking point.  I got an email from one man in Sheridan, He talked about the fact that his monthly premiums will be going up by more than $700 each month next year. That is for two adults, no children, and there is a deductible of $6,000. He and his wife are stuck in a position where they will have to pay more than $2,400 a month for insurance or pay an extra tax.  A woman from Park County wrote to me that her family had to switch insurance plans a couple of years ago. The coverage they had before was canceled.  Why did 5,000 people in Wyoming lose their insurance? Why was it canceled? It was good enough for them, provided what they needed, but the government said it wasn't good enough for the government. That is wrong.  This lady writes about the incredible increase in the costs. She asked, ``What are we supposed to do?''  I have heard that in all corners of the State of What are they supposed to do? I don't believe these people should face a choice between paying sky-high insurance premiums or a sky-high tax penalty to the People in Wyoming and around the country want to buy insurance that is affordable, that works for them, and that fits their families' needs. They don't want to be forced to buy the insurance that Washington tells them they have to buy because Washington, as we have seen in the past, thinks they know better than the American people. People want the coverage they need so they can go to the doctor they want at lower costs.  I would also point out that the cost of insurance isn't the only problem we are looking at right now. There are other parts of the healthcare law that may actually be harming patients.  As a physician, I receive multiple medical journals. There was a new study out in the American Medical Association cardiology journal that looked at Medicare patients who were hospitalized with heart failure.  Many people across the country are hospitalized for heart failure. It is a chronic condition, and occasionally they have to go back in the hospital for additional treatment.  There is a program in the healthcare law that started to penalize hospitals if that Medicare patient was readmitted to the hospital within 30 days after they had been released from the hospital. There are a number of reasons that may happen, but the goal was to penalize hospitals, and--the goal, the laudable goal, was to give patients better treatment, but that is not what happened. This is the problem: The Democrats wrote into this law and the regulations something that they really had no evidence would actually help patients and save money at the same time. They said: We are going to penalize hospitals. So if every hospital improved its numbers, they were still going to grade it on a curve, so if a hospital didn't improve enough, it was still going to be penalized. That has had huge a impact on hospitals that take sicker patients, regardless of their location, in terms of how they do followup with patients.  Well, it turns out that the study in the Journal of the American Medical Association--a well-respected cardiology journal, their heart issue--says that the death rate actually went up after hospitals faced this new requirement. The study covered over 400 hospitals and over 110,000 patients. The study found that an extra 5,400 people are dying every year just among heart failure patients because of the way the Federal Government has chosen to penalize hospitals around the country when patients are readmitted. It is interesting because what has happened is that the readmission rates in the hospital have actually gone down. The hospitals succeeded in keeping people out to avoid the penalty, but people died in the process.  The Wall Street Journal had an editorial about it last week. They concluded that if you were doing a drug trial on a drug that you were working on inventing to improve the lives of people and you had the same results as this--5,000 people dying--they would have shut it down long ago. That is a deadly, unintended consequence of the ObamaCare healthcare law.  The insurance mandate was supposed to keep premiums from rising. Premiums have gone way up anyway. That is another unintended consequence of the law. In spite of good intentions, that is not what happened under the law that was passed and is the law of the land right now.  I believe we should repeal the entire law. Until we can do that, we should do what we can to help the American people who are struggling to deal with this expensive insurance and what I believe to be an unfair tax and fine that they must pay if they don't buy the insurance because they can't afford it, because it is not a good deal for them and it doesn't work for them or their families. It is not just unpopular, it is un-It took away people's choices. It forced them to buy expensive insurance that wasn't right for them.  It is time for the insurance mandate to go away. We know it is a bad idea. We need to give people relief from this terrible tax. The people of Wyoming and the people of this country simply can't afford to wait any longer. It is time to repeal the mandate of the healthcare law.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Barrasso).

Tax reform should be all about helping those who are in need: Working families, veterans, seniors, small-business owners, just to name a few.  Unfortunately, the plan that the congressional Republicans are currently ramming through the Senate with the vote that could happen just in a few short hours does exactly the opposite.

702,topic-id,308,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Congresswoman Waters, for standing up for consumers.  As I stand here today, first, let me just say I echo all of the comments of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, and I, too, rise in opposition of H.1699, a bill that would put the lowest income and most vulnerable consumers at risk of becoming victims of predatory lending. This bill would increase the chances of consumers being steered into higher cost loans when they could otherwise qualify for lower cost alternatives.  As an aside, it is quite interesting to sit here and listen to my colleagues on the other side have such great interest in affordable housing and low-income residents, and yet, as I have sat on the Financial Services Committee, I have watched them repeatedly cut funds to the budget for low-income residents and not stand up for some of the statements when former Director Richard Cordray came in to talk about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and what they have done to stamp out this type of predatory lending.  It is also quite interesting, and I would be remiss not to mention, that last week President Trump appointed the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, to lead the Bureau, yet he is the same man who spent years trying to eliminate this organization, a man who did not stand up for low-income, affordable housing.  Mr.Speaker, I will end by saying I think we need someone who can stand up for consumers, and I am pleased to hear my colleagues say that they believe in consumer protection and that they are going to advocate for those with low income and they are going to stand up against predatory lending.

193,topic-id,1674,"Mr.President, on the matter that was being discussed--I am on the Finance There has not been a hearing on this bill, not a single hearing. A markup is not a hearing. People might say, well, why is that a big deal? Why is that relevant? Because a hearing is an opportunity for the American people to say whether they want this bill or not. A hearing is an opportunity for an economist to come to the Senate and say whether they want this bill. A markup is a chance for Senators to say what is on their mind, not for the American people to be able to say what is on their mind. That is what I am thinking about today.  I wanted to start my remarks with a little bit of a history lesson because this Chamber seems to forget what it has said, where it has been, and it is only if you have a case of terrible amnesia that you can support this legislation.  When Bill Clinton left the White House, he left his successor a projected surplus of $5.6 trillion. That is what George Bush inherited when he became The Senate was actually having hearings about what to do with the surplus and whether that surplus constituted some sort of threat to the economy. That is what he left behind. Then, George Bush, with this Congress, cut taxes in 2001. They didn't pay for those tax cuts. They didn't need to because they would pay for themselves. That is what they said. It is exactly[[Page S7667]]what they are saying today. It is exactly what they are saying today. In 2003, they passed another tax cut, and they didn't pay for it, but they said it would pay for itself. Incredibly, the 2003 tax cut came after we had invaded Iraq under a pretext by that administration. Not only did we never ask the American people to pay for those wars, we cut their taxes and put the burden on their children. That supply-side economics, which is exactly the same movie we are seeing today, resulted in the worst recession since the Great  We had a 10-percent unemployment rate when Barack Obama became President of the United Guess what else we had. We had a $1.5 trillion deficit, not a $5.6 trillion surplus--a $1.5 trillion deficit because of two unpaid-for wars, because of two tax cuts that weren't paid for that were going to pay for themselves, and because they passed something called Medicare Part D--the prescription drug program for seniors--that they didn't pay for. The minute Barack Obama became President, they said it was his deficit. They wouldn't lift a finger to help working people in America who had lost their jobs in the worst recession since the Great Depression, brought on by their own economic policies and by the fecklessness of some of the largest banks in this country. They wouldn't lift a finger.  Then-Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in 2011--this is in 2011--``Now, we've reached the point where our deficits and debts are so large they're suffocating job growth, threatening the wider economy, and imperiling entitlements.'' That is when we were in the depths a recession we had not seen since the Great  When Barack Obama left office, the deficit was about $550 billion. Today, it is $660 billion. As a result of this plan, J.Morgan was telling us, yesterday or the day before, that this will be the largest nonrecession-caused deficit in our history since World War What a disgrace. And for what? To give taxes to the wealthiest people in  This is an unusual thing to do, but I am putting up the Republicans' chart. This is their chart. The Senator from Pennsylvania is on the floor. This is their chart, where they are telling my farmers and ranchers in rural Colorado that they should be satisfied with these percentages they are giving them, these rate cuts they are giving them. You can't eat percentages. You can't feed your family on rate cuts. You can't run your farm or your ranch on rate cuts.  Do they think they are not going to get it figured out? Colorado's Republicans are too smart for this bill. They are too smart for this bill. So are Colorado's Democrats and Unlike us, they actually have to worry about the next generation of That is all they do. They know our politics is not up to that. It is not up to the aspirations they have for their kids and for their grandkids.  No piece of legislation could illustrate how right they are than this piece of legislation and the mistruths that have been used to sell--the President going to Missouri and saying: This is a middle-class tax cut. This hurts the rich like me.  No, it doesn't. What people are concerned about, and what they will be concerned about is, their aftertax income as a result of the changes that are being made, and this is the best year. I didn't bring out the worst year. This is 2019. This is what you are going to be getting. It is great if you are up here, and you are making more than $1 million--where, by the way, I have not met a person who says they have cashflow problems that this tax cut is going to help them with.  I know a lot of people in Colorado--and I will bet you in Arkansas and in Pennsylvania--who are still struggling because middle-class family incomes have been flat for 20 years, and the costs of housing, higher education, early childhood education, and healthcare are forcing them to make choices that their parents and grandparents never had to make for their kids.  What a shame to be taking healthcare away from 13 million people in this bill, instead of trying to make the system better. This bill rejects all the testimony we had in hearing after hearing on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  This is my final chart. This is the math of this bill. This bill takes $34 billion a year--not 1 year, a year--in tax cuts and gives it to 572,000 taxpayers. You can't even see that. I know you can't see it on the It looks like a pencil line because that is the scale. That is how few people there are in our economy--572,000 people getting $34 billion. If you include the estate tax, which I didn't here, it is $39 billion. It is $40 billion going to families who are lucky enough to make more than $1 million a year. These are the taxpayers who make $50,000 or less in our economy. There are 90 million of them, not 572,000. There are 90 million of them. They get $14 billion out of this bill. That is an average tax cut of $160--$7.50.  These aren't talking points. This is the math that is at the heart of the deal the Republicans have said is a middle-class tax cut. You know what is even worse about it? Just like the 2001 tax cuts, just like the 2003 tax cuts, they are not paying for it. They are borrowing the money from middle-class families all over the country, from the sons and daughters of teachers, firefighters, and police officers. That is who is going to have to pay back that bill. And for what? To end poverty in America? To invest in infrastructure or healthcare or to strengthen our safety net? To fritter it away on $34 billion worth of tax cuts for the wealthiest people in  I am going to close by saying this. Before I got here 9 years ago, I never would have believed that something this cynical could happen on the floor of the I wouldn't have believed it. Colleagues of mine who said for years that this is all just about getting to cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, I would say: No, it is not. People care about this. They want to sort out our fiscal condition. I was wrong. They were right. This is about that. That is what they are going to come back here and do. It is going to be really hard to withstand it.  President Trump, after all this for the last 10 years around here, since we were fighting, trying to fight out of the worst recession since the Great Depression--which we did, by the way--in the name of fiscal responsibility, we had fiscal cliffs; in the name of fiscal responsibility, we had government shutdowns; in the name of fiscal responsibility, we passed 30 temporary budgets that no school district in Colorado could get away with once. Have we managed to restore our fiscal health? Have we piled on more debt for our kids and grandkids? That is what is going to happen here.  It is no wonder, when we elected a President, somebody who told the American people--and was nominated by the Republican Party and elected by the United States of America--President Trump promised that he would eliminate our debt ``over a period of eight years''; that he would deliver ``a giant, beautiful, massive'' tax cut--that was supposed to be for the forgotten man. Unless the people making over $1 million are the ``forgotten man,'' he didn't deliver on that--pass ``one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history;'' while saying, ``I'm not going to cut Social Security . . . and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.''  There is a job that every American has to do for the next generation of Americans; that is, to leave more opportunity, not less, to the people who are coming after us. This bill that has been so falsely described and written in such a way that it actually denies the middle class in America benefits it really could use and does so by putting a bunch more debt on the backs of their children is something this Senate should reject.

That is what we all should be working on in a bipartisan way to try to address. Unfortunately, instead of improving the circumstances for people in the bottom 90 percent of earners, the decision has been made, because of an economic philosophy that has to do with trickle-down economics, to give the benefits to the people who are doing pretty well--and not just pretty well but better than they have done since 1928, and we stated earlier today on this floor what a miracle the tax policies were in the early 1920s.

1646,topic-id,1167,"Mr.President, I only have a few minutes of time on the floor so I want to be relatively brief.  I want to share with you a chart that shows what is actually happening as a result of this proposed tax bill. Here is what is happening. There are 572,000 taxpayers. That is about half a million taxpayers in America who are fortunate enough to make more than $1 million a year. As a result of this proposed plan, they will receive $34 billion in tax cuts. They will receive $34 billion in tax cuts this year, next year, and the year after that. That is an average tax cut of roughly $59,000 a person. That is $34 billion going to 572,000 taxpayers.  What about the middle-class people the Republicans claim this bill is about? There are 90 million taxpayers--not half a million--90 million taxpayers who make $50,000 or less. Do you know what they get under this bill? They don't get $34 billion. By the way, if you include the estate tax, that number is $39 billion, $40 billion. They get $14 billion. That is an average tax cut per taxpayer of $160 a year, and that is in 2019. That is the best year these guys have--after that, it goes negative--and $160 a taxpayer is equivalent to $7.50 a paycheck. So I suppose in 1 year, you could say there is a $7.50 tax cut per paycheck.  That doesn't sound like a tax bill that is a middle-class tax bill to me. These are the tax cut levels under the Republican plan also in 2019. This is the $59,000 number. If you are making between $40,000 and $50,000, you get $492. If you are making between $10,000 and $20,000, you get $48, and so on and so forth.  There is nothing middle class about this tax cut proposal. I was asked today by somebody: How could these Republicans go home and explain--in the States Donald Trump won--how could they explain they didn't vote for that tax bill, when I was saying: I think we still have a chance to defeat this tax bill. How can you say that? How could somebody go home? I can't wait to go home to rural counties in my State that voted 80 percent for Donald Trump--75 percent for Donald Trump--and tell them I voted against this tax bill. My only regret is I will not be able to tell them I voted against it twice.  They are not stupid. People in Washington think that somehow by selling something based on percentages or selling something based on rates, people aren't going to understand what is actually happening to their aftertax income. My farmers and ranchers will understand that. They voted for a guy who said he was going to Washington to drain the swamp. They voted for a guy who said he was going to go to Washington and not help the rich people--or the rich, as the President says. They voted for a guy who said he was going to defend, support, and fight for what he called the forgotten man.  It turns out that when the rubber hits the road, we see the same movie that was happening before he got here--unless you want to argue that the forgotten man is making more than $1 million in an economy where people at the top earn more of that economy than they ever have, at least since 1928. If you want to make that argument, you can. My farmers and ranchers will not believe you. They will not believe that argument. This is a disgraceful bait and switch.  Wait until you have to tell them that in order to make that tax cut for the wealthiest people in America, you are going to borrow the money from their children. You are going to borrow the money from the children of people here to pay for the tax cuts at this end. You are going to borrow the money from teachers' children, and police officers' children, and firefighters' children. You are going to blow a $1.5 to $2.5 trillion deficit. Today, J.Morgan came out and said this will result in the largest nonrecession deficit this country has ever had since World War That is what J.Morgan said.  We do have problems in this economy. In Colorado, we have problems because even though we have one of the most dynamic economies in the country, middle-class families are still having a hard time paying for early childhood education. They are having a hard time paying for housing. They are having a hard time paying for higher education, which this bill makes even worse. They are having a hard time paying for healthcare, which this bill makes even worse. You can't even make it up. They are taking healthcare away from 13 million Americans in a tax bill, and the Congressional Budget Office tells us that because of the tax cuts they are producing for the wealthiest Americans, there is going to be an automatic cut to Medicare of $25 billion in  So I say, let's go after those 80 percent Trump counties and 70 percent Trump counties in Colorado and have a debate. They are not going to like what is in this plan. They will hate what is in this plan. It is the opposite of what they were told they were voting for.  I would implore my colleagues--before I yield the floor--that we stop this. Let's stop this bill. This bill doesn't deserve to be on the floor of the It is a disgrace. There was not a single hearing in the committee of jurisdiction--the Finance Committee--about this bill. There was not one hearing about a bill that touches every recess of our economy. It touches every household in our economy.  It has been 31 years since we did tax reform, and back then we did it right, in a bipartisan way. This time, we don't even have the decency to have a single hearing so the American people can hear what is in this bill and make a judgment about whether it is a good bill or not a good bill.  I am telling you, I know what they are going to say when they know what the details are. We should stop this, and we should work in a bipartisan way.  My colleague from Florida is on the floor. I know how important the child tax credit is to him and my colleague from It is important to me too. That is the basis for a deal.  I believe the corporate rate is not competitive with the rest of the world. That is the basis for a deal, but borrowing money from middle-class taxpayers to finance $34 billion in tax cuts for 572,000 people is not a basis for a deal.

1472,topic-id,813,"Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 17 environmental organizations opposing this legislation.                                                 November 8, 2017.       Dear Representative, on behalf of our millions of members      and activists, we write to urge you to oppose the Republican      leadership's tax legislation, the misnamed Tax Cuts and Jobs      Act (H.1). This plan would lavish huge and permanent tax      cuts to the richest 1% and corporate polluters that are      destined to be paid for by the health and environmental well-     being of communities across the country. The bill's debt-     busting tax cuts for the wealthiest are sure to mean deep      cuts to federal and state programs and safeguards that      protect our air, water, lands, and wildlife that benefit      people across this country every day. The plan puts at risk      our clean energy future by preserving tax breaks for dirty      energy sources while slashing them for cleaner forms of      energy. And if the tax plan itself weren't harmful enough, it      is also being packaged in the Senate with unrelated,      controversial legislation that hands over the pristine and      sacred Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to exploitation by Big            This plan steers most of its tax breaks to the wealthiest      people in this country and corporations and adds at least      $1.5 trillion to the deficit. Americans across the country      will suffer because those tax cuts are likely to be paid for      by slashing services and safeguards that our government      provides, from healthcare to education to environmental      protection. The health of communities across the nation will      suffer if the Environmental Protection Agency is further      hampered in its mission to protect public health and hold      polluters accountable for violating laws like the Clean Air      Act and Safe Drinking Water The people who work in and      benefit from America's thriving outdoor recreational economy      will take a hit if the national parks and other lands      stewarded by the Department of the Interior are forced to      suffer further cuts because of this reckless tax plan.       This tax plan also steers our nation's energy policy in the      wrong direction by leaving in place the vast majority of      existing tax preferences for polluting industries like oil,      gas, coal and nuclear and reducing, phasing-out, and      eliminating incentives for cleaner sources of energy.      Permanent tax breaks for fossil fuels dwarf those for      renewables by a margin of 7:1, yet this bill would suddenly      eliminate the tax credit for purchasing an electric vehicle,      disrupt the wind industry by reducing the credit for future      projects by a third and placing into jeopardy the eligibility      of existing projects, and eliminate the commercial solar      investment credit. While some clean energy technology credits      are reintroduced, they, too, are set to phase out. Meanwhile,      oil companies will receive a new billion dollar hand out      while only the smallest of existing preferences for fossil      fuels are eliminated--leaving more than $14 billion in      permanent annual federal subsidies untouched. Despite      rhetoric from GOP leaders that the tax code shouldn't pick      winners and losers, this bill very clearly picks polluting      energy sectors as winners yet again, putting at risk the      impressive growth of clean energy and robbing us and our      children of a cleaner future.       The GOP leadership's plan is to package this tax      legislation in the Senate with unrelated, controversial      legislation that would open up the iconic Arctic National      Wildlife Refuge to drilling. This legislation would      irreversibly damage one of America's greatest wild places and      is only being included in a desperate attempt to secure      enough votes in the Senate for tax cuts for corporations and      the wealthiest The Arctic Refuge's spectacular      landscape of rugged mountains, boreal forests, and wild      rivers supports more than 250 species including polar and      brown bears, musk oxen, and birds that migrate from all 50      states and 6 continents each year. The indigenous Gwich'in      people call the refuge's coastal plain ``The Sacred Place      Where Life Begins,'' an area that serves as the calving      grounds for the Porcupine Caribou Herd which they rely on as      a primary source of food, and for cultural and spiritual      needs. This provision is being included in an attempt to      generate $1 billion in government revenue to pay for the      package's tax cuts for the wealthy, but multiple analyses      show that it is unlikely to raise anywhere close to that      amount. In short, including drilling in the Arctic Refuge in      the tax legislation is both environmentally and fiscally      irresponsible.       For these reasons, we urge you to oppose H.1 and instead      work together on legislation that will truly benefit our      communities, power our economy with clean, renewable energy,      and protect the environment that we all depend upon for our      health and well-being.

All of us, including Ranking Member Wyden of the Finance Committee, have been more than eager to be reasonable and compromise and seek bipartisan solutions. I truly want to thank Senator Wyden for his leadership on this issue, as well as his insight and his great commitment to the public interest.  We had a hearing earlier this week before the Armed Services Committee about future threats to our Nation and national security, with a panel of experts who testified that more than $1 trillion dollars--maybe trillions--would be necessary for us to invest in the future of our Nation's defense. So many of us asked them whether they thought it would be possible to make that investment at the same time that our Nation is about to incur an additional $1.5 trillion in debt as a result of this misguided, maligned scam, this tax bill, and when we asked that question, they shook their heads no.  The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen, once said--famously now--``The greatest threat to our national security is our national debt.'' The reason our national debt is a threat to our national security is very simply that it prevents us from the kind of commitment and investment in our national defense that we on the Armed Services Committee and we in this body and we the people of America know we have to make to secure our national defense.  Our national defense is about more than just hardware and even the great troops that we deploy--our service men and women who serve and sacrifice with such incredible bravery and dedication and patriotism--it is also about the quality of our society. It is about whether we are equal, whether we give people the mobility to move and make of themselves what their aspirations are and make the American dream real in their lives and develop those skills through education and skill training that are so necessary to us as a nation. We can't produce the submarines and the F-35s and all of the extraordinary, complex hardware that we do without that skilled training. We know that in Connecticut because we produce submarines and jet engines and helicopters. We are proud of that, but we need more people with those skills.  Yet this measure will enhance the divisions in our society. It will divide us from each other as It will diminish the mobility--social and economic mobility--in our great Nation, and it will increase economic insecurity. It will not make Americans more sure about their society, more confident in its equality and justice; it will create more anxiety and anger because at its core, this measure is about benefits to a tiny, minute fraction of Most of the benefits of this measure go there. And it is about hitting the rest of Americans--particularly middle-class families--with initial benefits that may even look good at first but are a classic bait-and-switch because most of those middle-class families will be worse off over the next 10 years. Anybody earning between $50,000 and $75,000 will see their taxes increase over those years.  For all the reasons that my colleagues have so powerfully and compellingly outlined in this Chamber, with statistics that I don't even have time to repeat here, this measure is essentially rotten at the core in its claim to fairness.  Tax reform should be about making our Tax Code simpler and fairer. This measure does just the opposite. My colleagues may say there were hearings, but compared to the mid-1980s when the last major tax reform was passed, there have been no hearings and there has been no real markup.  We are now considering an amendment that was deposited on the floor of this Chamber just minutes ago--barely an hour--and will receive no serious scrutiny or oversight. It will harm our teachers and first responders, our police and our firefighters, who will have less support for their vital services. It will harm the job creators who need more resources to invest in infrastructure. It will harm our educators and the skilled trades. It will harm middle-class  It will hit Connecticut as hard or harder than any other State because of the nondeductibility of State and local taxes and because of the nondeductibility of casualty losses. The homeowners whose foundations are crumbling will lose the ability to deduct the cost of repairs that they must make. That is so fundamentally unfair that it belies the promises that have been made even this day on this floor.  We are adopting this measure literally in the dark of night--a Friday night when few Americans may be aware of what is happening here--comparatively few.  On the passthrough provision that has been added to this bill, unquestionably, some Americans will be aware, including the President of the United He has more than 500 LLCs as part of his organization that will benefit from this passthrough provision. So the President may be celebrating, but most Americans will rue this day.  We will remember this day, all of us who are here, but we in this Chamber will rue it as well. We will remember it because of the black mark on our democracy that resulted from a guilty plea from a former National Security Advisor--a guilty plea for lying to the It is a black mark on our democracy, a sad day for our Nation, and a shadowy moment for this administration, the Trump  But we will remember it also as a self-inflicted wound for our democracy when the actions of the U.Senate drove deeper divisions within our society, created more insecurity, enlarged the anger and angst and anxiety that people feel about themselves, and when we added $1.5 trillion to the national debt that our children and our grandchildren will pay and thereby when we diminished our national security. The national debt may not be the greatest threat to our national security, but it is one of the largest of the dangers to our national security, and we have done nothing to alleviate it. On the contrary, we are adding to it, and that is a shame and a disgrace.  I yield the floor.

1247,topic-id,1695,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Alaska for yielding.  I want to begin where he finished--on the need for a bipartisan approach, one that combines different points of view, one based on compromise. Compromise should not be a dirty word. Compromise is not a four-letter word. Neither is bipartisanship. Yet our Republican colleagues have insisted on a Republican plan--on a plan that they first rammed and rushed through the House of Representatives and now, in the same way, have sought to do on their own, without consultation or compromise with That is why the process has reached this point. It has stalled.  My Republican colleagues are scrambling for a solution to an overwhelming, oppressive debt that they would force on the American people--not on ourselves, but on our children and our grandchildren, generations to come, searching and scrambling for a so-called trigger--another gimmick--to be inserted in this bill that already underestimates the additional debt that will be foisted on our They have estimated it at $1.3 trillion or $1.5 trillion. In reality, it is probably larger, but the main point is that they have foisted it on our children and grandchildren to pay--to shoulder the burden--simply so that the wealthiest in this country and corporations would have tax cuts.  The people of Connecticut and our country face a tsunami of economic[[Page S7550]]harm. This plan, in fact, is deeply unpopular among my constituents in I have listened to them. What they tell me is that they cannot look their children in the eye and show them a chart like this one, which my colleague Senator King of Maine displayed earlier in the Chamber, and see how this insurmountable mountain of debt will result from the Republican plan.  Very simply, Republicans voted for middle-class taxes to rise so that the President's and other billionaires' taxes can go down. Over the next decade, this plan will raise taxes on 87 million middle-class families and half of all taxpayers. This plan is a double standard. It is a bait and switch because it makes a promise that it fails to fulfill. It makes a promise of tax cuts that actually will rise over a 10-year period. It sells a false bill of goods.  The promise of middle-class tax cuts is a lie, plain and simple, a scam.  The President sent the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, Linda McMahon, to Connecticut to announce: ``Everyone will experience a tax cut.'' But the fact of the matter is everybody in certain brackets experiences a tax increase under most circumstances.  Who is harmed? We know who benefits. The wealthiest benefit, and corporations benefit. But the ones harmed, according to the Congressional Budget Office, are the majority of people who earn less than $75,000 a year, and they will be worse off within the next 10 years. In Connecticut that means that 468,200 taxpayers in the bottom 80 percent of income distribution will experience a tax hike under this plan.  The Republican tax plan ends State and local tax deductibility, which means families are going to be taxed twice. It increases the Federal burden on Connecticut families, who already pay more Federal taxes than they receive in Federal funding.  Now, what I hear--again, listening to my friends and constituents in Connecticut--is that they are willing to pay their fair share. They are willing to pay even more than they may receive back from the Federal Government, if they feel the system itself is fair--not rigged in favor of the wealthy or big corporations or special interests. They are the ones who will benefit from this tax scandal.  State and local taxes paid by my constituents in Connecticut are vital to supplying communities with resources that pay for essential local services. We are talking about police and school and, yes, infrastructure--rebuilding roads, bridges, ports, and airports--vital services. In Connecticut 723,773 households deduct State and local taxes. The average deduction is $19,664. Assuming somebody pays a 25- or 30-percent rate of taxes, apply that to $19,000, and we are talking about real money.  The bill also abolishes a critical deduction that provides relief for taxpayers who experience losses on their property, including homeowners in Connecticut--thousands of them--who have a crumbling foundation and are uninsured for those repairs--casualty losses that, under current law, the IRS ruled just last week could be deducted. They will be robbed of those deductions under this cruel, maligned, malicious, misguided bill.  The bill also hits working-class families. It expands the child tax credit, for example, but tips the scales in favor of the wealthiest families. It values a child, fortunate to be born into a wealthy family, to be worth a $2,000 tax credit. Meanwhile, an estimated 140,000 military families who have median adjusted gross incomes of $28,000 will receive a child tax credit worth only $75 or less. If you are wealthy, it is worth $2,000. If you are less well off, with an adjusted gross income of $28,000, it is $75 or less. What is fair or rational about that distinction? In fact, it epitomizes what is wrong about this bill. It increases inequality. It enhances and heightens the insecurity that my colleague from Alaska mentioned earlier. It is wrong. It betrays American values.  First responders are harmed. Earlier this month, the national president of the Fraternal Order of Police wrote a letter to the House and Senate leadership urging Members of Congress to protect the State and local tax deduction as is. If this deduction is eliminated, local budgets will be strained, which include the salaries and equipment that support our law enforcement. No wonder the head of the Fraternal Order of Police objects to eliminating the deduction of State and local taxes.  Teachers are harmed. The National Education Association has found that gutting the State and local tax deduction will seriously harm already underfunded public education, risking nearly 250,000 education jobs. Those are middle-class family jobs in a profession that is profoundly important to our future.  We talk a lot in this Chamber about the importance of skill training and education to the future of our workforce and making sure that jobs are filled by people with the right skills, and here we are gutting our educational system. Those cuts in turn will lead to approximately $250 billion in cuts to public education over the years to come.  Finally, job creators are harmed--the job creators who do the infrastructure work in construction and in skill training. There is common ground here on infrastructure. There is bipartisan support for an infrastructure bank or public financing authority, and a number of those proposals, in fact, would involve repatriating funds at lower tax rates so the money parked abroad--trillions of dollars companies have put there because they want to avoid taxes on those profits--could come back. The money should come back. The money could come back at lower tax rates and be invested in infrastructure, but this proposal makes no such proposal because it is bereft of a realistic view of what is necessary for infrastructure.  The sick are harmed as well. Illness is not about revenue to a Illness strikes any one of us at any time. The Republican tax plan will raise insurance premiums and kick 13 million Americans off their health insurance, all to pay for a massive corporate tax cut, passthroughs that benefit the wealthiest, and other reductions in taxes that are giveaways to people who need them the least.  The corporations that today move overseas to evade taxes and benefit from special interest loopholes to lower their effective tax rates are going to be rewarded under this tax plan. Let's be very blunt. They will have increased incentives to move those jobs overseas. The bill borrows $1.5 trillion to enable them to have lower rates, and those billions will line the pockets of corporate In fact, that $1.5 trillion is equivalent to all veterans healthcare and benefits payments to every single veteran in America over the next decade.  With $1.5 trillion, you could increase the benefits to our veterans, enhance the quality of their healthcare, and train them for jobs that exist now, and, by the way, you could also pay off all the student loan debt in our Think of it for a moment. Think of all those young people whose lives would be different--transformed--if they were absolved of the worry about paying off those hundreds of millions of dollars of loans. For each of them, it is tens of thousands that crush their futures and drive them to jobs that were not their first choices but which they have to do simply to pay off debt.  Rather than working toward bipartisan tax reform that creates opportunity for all Americans, this bill divides our Nation, it increases the division economically and, also, socially and culturally, and, yes, politically. It drives a division in this body between two sides of the aisle--literally, physically--between our Republican colleagues and ourselves.  How wonderful it would be for us to take the time, to use hearings and real markups, and to do what was done in the 1980s when the last major tax reform--true tax reform--was done. The time, the consultation, the discussion, and, yes, the compromise were at the core of that work. What is at the core of this work and this bill are very simply blatant partisanship.  There is no question that our Tax Code needs to be reformed. I am prepared to work on real tax reform, not the lie that we have before us but real tax reform that supports our middle class, drives our economy forward, and creates jobs. That would be the right way to do it, and that would be the way we could do it if we take a step back.[[Page S7551]]  It is not too late. We could do it tomorrow. It is never too late to do the right thing. I urge my colleagues to take the time and to engage in real compromise, legislation that is worthy of the name and a tax reform measure that truly is reform and benefits all  I yield the floor for my colleague from New  The PRESIDING The Senator from New  ",CREC-2017-11-30-pt1-PgS7508-4.txt,2076,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONTINUED,2017,30,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1662,topic-id,1146,"Mr.President, I am honored to follow my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire and begin, actually, where she finished. This massive tax cut has indeed so many ticking timebombs that are unknown at the moment because it has been rushed and rammed through this body, as well as the House, without the kind of regular order that should be given--the intense scrutiny and attention that is due a historic, massive measure of this kind.  The idea that it has regular order is absolutely absurd. If this is regular order, it is surely regular order lite. There have barely been the most cursory of hearings--barely an excuse for hearings--no real markup, no real opportunity for the public to be heard, no real scrutiny of the complicated and numerous provisions that will affect people for years, decades, maybe generations to come.  The last tax cut was in 1985. The last so-called reform, passed in the mid-1980s, involved scores of hearings, meetings, and sessions for the public to be heard, dwarfing, making a mockery of this process. This process has been, in fact, a mockery of democracy. It is a classic bait and switch. It is a promise that is unfulfilled--a tax cut, initially, for people, which then disappears after a couple of years, when the wealthy continue to enjoy their tax cut.  There are winners and losers in this measure. Let's be very blunt. The winners are the wealthy. The losers are the middle class. The winners are special interests. The losers are the American people. The winners are people who already have it made. The losers are people who want to fulfill the American Dream and make it for themselves, people who are pulling up the ladder for others to climb and to make it real for them.  The measure that we have before us is the result of a promise--middle-class tax cuts--and that promise was made by Donald Trump, who said also that he would not benefit. He sent his Small Business Administration Administrator, Linda McMahon, to Connecticut to say: ``Everyone will experience a tax cut.''  This plan is a scam. Yes, some people will receive a tax cut initially, but if you earn less than $75,000 within the next decade, you will be worse off under this plan. In Connecticut that means that 468,200 taxpayers in the bottom 80 percent of income distribution will experience a tax hike under this plan. The majority of people in Connecticut are losers, even though there may be a wealthy segment at the very top of the income distribution who are winners.  Our children and grandchildren are surely losers because they will inherit the whirlwind of additional debt. The $1.5 trillion underestimates the amount of debt that will be added. I saw a cartoon in one of the newspapers that showed a rowboat filled with water, and one of the characters said to the other: Drill another hole in the bottom of the boat to let the water out. And the sea was the Dead That is what this measure does. It fills our boat--not only ours but our children's and grandchildren's boats--with additional debt. They are losers even though the wealthiest are winners.  The losers include, also, first responders. Earlier this month, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police wrote a letter to the House and the Senate leadership urging Members of Congress to protect the State and local deduction as it is. This measure eliminates that State and local deduction, devastating for Connecticut but also for first responders, firemen, and police across the country, and our teachers who depend on the adequacy of Federal funding for essential services, which will be reduced.  Because there is no incentive for State and local taxes--they can't be deducted anymore--States like Connecticut, New York, and California, we know are the losers and our middle-class taxpayers are losers. That is why the National Education Association has found that gutting the State and local tax deduction will seriously harm already underfunded public education, risking nearly 250,000 education jobs, including over 5,000 teacher jobs in the State of It will lead to about $250 billion in cuts to public education over the next decade. While we are talking about education, there is eliminating the deduction for interest on student loans. What could be more stupid at a time when we are encouraging young people to invest in their futures and we should be investing in them?  Ultimately, also, the losers are our job creators, the folks who need infrastructure, which will go unrepaired. Our roads, bridges, railroads, VA facilities, broadband, airports, and ports are all desperately in need of rebuilding--not just repair but true rebuilding, modernization, and innovation.  There is no requirement or opportunity here for repatriation of the trillions of dollars parked overseas. There is no provision for any sort of incentive for companies to repatriate and invest in an infrastructure bank. So we will continue to see neglect and disregard for that very important infrastructure.  It is clear who will be the winners. Despite all these losers, corporations that move overseas to evade taxes and benefit from special interest loopholes to lower their effective tax rates are going to be richly rewarded.  Senate Republicans have decided to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas drilling.  Those special interests are the winners. The bill borrows $1.5 trillion so those special interests and corporations can have those benefits, but it will also line the pockets of those corporate CEOs--not just the corporations but the That is equivalent to the cost of all veterans' healthcare and benefit payments to every single veteran in America over the next decade.  With $1.5 trillion, by the way, you could also pay off all the student loan debt in Think of the difference in lives that would make. Think of all the young students debt free. Think of the vistas and the dreams that could be fulfilled. Think of the economic growth that would be generated.  Think also of the false promises and the bait and switch. When corporate CEOs were asked by the President's chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, how many of them will create jobs with these corporate tax cuts, nary a hand went up in the audience. That is a picture that says a thousand words.  I end my words now simply with a warning that Americans, far from buying this bait and switch, will see the proof in their pocketbooks and wallets. They will see the result of this consummately partisan measure run through without regular order, without real consideration, without the scrutiny that it needs and deserves, without public and popular support if we move ahead as the Republican leadership apparently appears intent on doing. Now is the time for us to show some backbone. I urge my colleagues to do it.  I yield the floor.

2036,topic-id,1803,"Mr.President, unlike past occasions when I have spoken on the topic of gun violence prevention, I am actually pleased to talk about some good news. A powerful alliance across the aisle has enabled us this morning to introduce a measure that will be a modest but significant breakthrough. It is a breakthrough in[[Page S7274]]hopefully providing better data, more complete information for the database that provides for background checks. It is essential that more accurate and thorough data be provided in the database because background checks are no better than the information provided to them, as we have seen again and again, in Sutherland Springs most recently but also Charleston and Blacksburg, where individuals legally barred from accessing firearms were permitted to do so because of gaps in the NICS system. Each of those killers walked out of a gun store having purchased firearms from a federally licensed dealer, even though they should have been ineligible, because of gaps in the reporting system; that is, the information reported to the national system that collects that data and provides the underpinning for this program.  We are a bipartisan group that says, in effect, enforcement must be rigorous, as complete and effective as possible. New laws may be sought, and we will continue to seek a broader background check law, as well as a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We in this coalition may be divided on those issues, but at the very least, we can join arms and link together on this measure.  These provisions will help enforce public safety protections that could mean the difference between life and death. Nonreporting now puts people at lethal risk, riddling with gaping holes a system that should keep guns away from killers. The Federal background check system is only as good as the information provided to it.  I am proud to be part of this alliance. I look forward to the next steps--the prompt passage of this legislation and other measures that perhaps will evoke the same kind of bipartisan spirit across the aisle.  I am working with a number of my Republican colleagues on a measure relating to military reporting, particularly as it concerns domestic violence. All of us who have been attorneys general, as the Presiding Officer has been, know the scourge of domestic violence and how much more dangerous it is--five times more lethal--when there is a gun in the house. More than half of the homicides in this country occur as a result of domestic violence. More effective enforcement requires steps that enable resources as well as awareness in the military and in our civilian courts.                          Judicial Nominations  Mr.President, on the topic of effective enforcement of the law, I rise today on a related topic, which is the quality of our judiciary. Our laws are only as effective as the judges who implement them.  I rise with regret because the administration is attempting to radically reshape our judiciary, to remake the bench in the image of a far-right dogma that basically contravenes what we are and where we are as a nation.  This administration has proposed extreme nominees who will seek to undo decades of critically important progress in recognizing and protecting reproductive rights, LGBT rights, voting rights, workers' rights, environmental protections, and more.  For the last 10 months, this administration has tried its level best to move our country backward by implementing its destructive, deeply unpopular agenda. They want to dismantle the Affordable Care They want to abandon LGBT They want to make it harder to vote, harder to organize, harder to breathe clean air and drink clean water.  If they fall short in carrying out this cruel agenda through Executive action and legislation, this administration has looked to the courts to do its dirty work. The Trump administration seeks to flood the Federal judiciary with judges--appointed for life--who will defend their indefensible goals. This plot is not hidden. It is not secret. It is out in the open. President Trump has made it clear. He claims to have a litmus test for Supreme Court nominees--he will nominate someone who will ``automatically'' overturn Roe v. Just last month, the Senate voted to confirm two circuit court nominees--Allison Eid and Joan Larsen--who had been listed by then-Candidate Trump as potential Supreme Court nominees, indicating that they have passed that litmus test. When I asked both of these nominees whether their records would lead someone to believe that they would ``automatically'' reverse Roe v. Wade, they both demurred. They said they did not know why they were selected for President Trump's Supreme Court short list--no idea. I don't believe it. Then-Candidate Trump laid out his Supreme Court selection criteria in clear, unambiguous terms.  Yesterday we heard testimony from a circuit court nominee, Justice Don Willett, of the Texas Supreme Court, who proudly described himself in 2012 as the ``consensus, conservative choice from every corner of the conservative movement: pro-life, pro-faith, pro-family, pro-liberty, pro-Second Amendment, pro-private property rights, and pro-limited government.'' That is the way that he described himself.  When I asked him what he meant by tying himself to these labels, he refused to give me a straight answer. In fact, he said, in effect, that he was just pandering to the public for votes, that that was part of his reelection pitch. Maybe he didn't believe it, but we have all been around long enough to know what these terms mean to voters and what they mean to the President of the United They aren't dog whistles, literally, but they represent specific ideologies. They are shorthand for specific dogma.  I have no confidence that Justice Willett will be an impartial and objective implementer of the law and enforcer of the measures that we pass here.  Just last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to advance Brett He is someone who wrote that the solution to the Newtown shooting--he wrote it 3 days after that massacre--is to ``stop being a society of pansies and man up.'' He is someone who has written that the country ``overreacted'' and that ``the Second Amendment suffered'' after the murder of 20 children and 6 adults in  After one of the great tragedies of this country in recent years, his reaction was that the Second Amendment suffered. He is someone who has disingenuously written that Democrats want to take away everyone's guns. Even setting aside the fact that he has never tried a case in his career, he is someone who should be nowhere near the bench, at least not as a judge.  I hope my Republican colleagues will revisit their decision to support him.  I want to emphasize that the compromise that we have reached today and that we are introducing in this bipartisan group takes away no one's guns if one is law-abiding and otherwise complies with the law. In fact, it provides incentives and rewards to States that do better reporting. It makes sure that a robust reporting system prevents the sales of firearms to people who are a danger to themselves or others, including convicted domestic abusers.  This exaggeration, distortion, misinformation from Mr.Talley is, I think, emblematic of what kind of judge he would be.  Let us not forget that we are, in fact, judged by the company that we keep. President Trump is willing to nominate someone like Jeff Mateer to a lifetime appointment on the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of He was not on the docket this week, but he could well come before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a hearing in the coming weeks.  This is someone who has called transgender children ``Satan's plan.'' He has proudly said: ``On the basis of sexual orientation, we discriminate.'' He has advocated conversion therapy for LGBT children.  With these nominations, President Trump has shown the type of people he is willing to propose for lifetime appointments on the district court, as well as the court of appeals. As someone who has practiced in the district courts of Connecticut and others around the country, as well as in courts of appeals in the Second Circuit and elsewhere, these appointments have a special meaning to me and to others who are well versed in the way our justice system works.  For many people in this country, the U.district court is the first place they seek justice. They rely on Federal judges to be above politics and to be above personal ideology and dogma of the right or the left wing. The U.district court is the first place they seek justice, and, for many, it is the last place. Adverse rulings for them are often the end of the line because they lack the resources to pursue appeals to[[Page S7275]]the circuit court. Our district court judges are often the voices and faces of justice that the people of the United States most trust and rely on.  What we see in these nominees is a pattern. They have clearly demonstrated through their actions, their statements, their temperaments, and their characters that they are, simply, unfit and unable to serve as impartial judges, especially when it comes to our Nation's most vulnerable communities. Our Nation's most vulnerable communities are often the ones who rely the most on those Federal courts.  There can be no benefit of the doubt for nominees when they articulate the kinds of beliefs and dogma that these individuals have in their pasts and that they refuse to disavow in the present. I will oppose them, and I hope my colleagues will join me. I believe that on both sides of the aisle, we share a commitment to the credibility and trust of our judiciary.  As I have said before on the floor, our judges do not have armies; they do not have police forces. The enforceability of their rulings really depends on the credibility and trust that the people of our Nation have in them as individuals who put on robes, because they are supposed to put aside their personal prejudices and beliefs and fairly, impartially, and objectively enforce the law.  I fear that these nominees lack these qualities, and that is a tragedy for our Nation, whatever your politics. Someday, you will likely be before a judge--maybe not all, but many of you will--and you will want that judge to look at both sides of the courtroom and say that they both have an equal chance to make their cases, not tilt one way or the other because of the judge's personal beliefs. I hope that my colleagues will send a message to the President of the United States that one cannot politicize the American judiciary.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

1919,topic-id,1735,"Mr.President, I thank my colleagues who are on the Senate[[Page S7378]]Finance Committee and the Senate Budget Committee for getting us to the point we are at today. I think we are approaching a vote to move to a full debate on the tax bill, which is absolutely amendable with every idea that has anything to do with taxes and raising money, so people will have every right to be heard.  It has been a process that has gone on for a long time. But what we have seen happen over the last three decades--after an incredible effort in 1986 to simplify the Tax Code, to bring it up-to-date and make it competitive, what we have seen is a tax code that gradually has become more and more complicated.  There are too many loopholes that don't seem to be fair to everyone involved. Sometimes, it is not as much the tax rate you are paying, as your understanding that somebody else has figured out--in a competitive business or not even the same business--how to find that tax loophole, which meant they weren't paying their fair share of taxes.  Our Tax Code depends on a sense of fairness. It depends on a sense of equity. The out-of-date Tax Code means that some of the rates--particularly in international competition that might have been just fine 30 years ago--simply aren't fine today. Other countries have continued to reduce their taxes. They understand, as many of our States do in this country, that a tax policy that works means an economy that grows. Many of our competitors have figured that out. Right now, we have a chance to join them and figure it out as well.  There is a chance here to make a generational change that will last, I would hope, at least for a generation, as the structure. We can do that by lowering corporate rates. In 1986, 35 percent was kind of in the middle of the countries we compete with. In 2017, it is at the very top of the tax structure of the countries we compete with. Even though they are well below us now in terms of the tax burden they put on companies that compete with us, they are lowering their corporate rate already. Even the middle will soon be the top, as it turned out to be in the last three decades. At least this gets us back to the middle.  We will shift to a territorial system where, if you make money in another country, there is no penalty to bring it back here. There is no doubt that we will bring hundreds of billions of dollars back to the U.economy if we pass this bill. Some of the estimates say that we may bring $2 trillion back.  We have had a stimulus plan in the past decade in which every family got $100 or something like that and thought that was a big stimulus. So a $1 trillion stimulus or $2 trillion stimulus is unbelievable. That money has been sitting someplace else; companies have wanted to invest it here but weren't going to bring it back under the old tax system. If they had brought it back, their shareholders would probably have removed them from leadership in the company because it simply would not have been good business. It will be good business to bring that money back if we pass this bill.  We are also going to allow immediate expensing that says: I am going to spend the money now and get credit for it now. Those kinds of things grow the economy. It will make us more competitive worldwide. It will grow investments. When those two things happen, higher paying jobs have always followed and will follow here.  We have been stuck for 8 or 9 years now with no growth in family income for hard-working families. The way to change that, 1, is to take some of the tax burden away right now, and we are doing that in this bill. But, 2, we need to be sure we create more competition for the hard work and skills that workers take to the workplace every day.  We know that growth stemming from tax reform will have a positive impact on voters, and they will see a share of what is happening in the economy that, frankly, they haven't seen in the past. Families in your State and families in my State need this kind of opportunity, and job creators need this kind of relief.  Just last month, the Council of Economic Advisers estimated that the average household income would increase by $4,000 annually, based on reducing the corporate rate to 20 percent. The economy, of course, will grow in response to that.  Another study by a Harvard professor and former Reagan adviser, Martin Feldstein, found a 20-percent corporate tax rate would deliver a wage boost of about $3,500. So whether it is $3,500 by one estimate or $4,000 by another estimate, that makes a real difference to families who haven't seen an increase in their pay in a long time.  This bill is supported by a majority of small businesses--the real engine that drives the economy. There is a section called 179 expensing. Any time you start talking like a CPA, you are in trouble. But that 179 expensing for small- and medium-size businesses, family farms, and others, lets you expense immediately when you have added to investment--when you have bought a piece of farm equipment, something like that. All of that is enhanced in this bill.  I don't think accounting is the most exciting thing to talk about in the world, but this allows for the kinds of accounting measures that businesses say they need to really simplify how they report and how they do business. And that is right here.  There are some specific Missouri examples, just as there are in every one of our Jim Sheldon owns a business called DT Engineering, which is a manufacturing company in Lebanon, They produce industrial automation systems. When Jim was interviewed by the National Association of Manufacturers and asked what tax reform would mean to his company in terms of investment, hiring, and growing his business, he said:       More business! Bringing work back to the [United States]      will increase order rates, inventory, and development. This      will create growth for DT  Jim also said that benefits from tax reform will allow him to ``reinvest to reinvent.'' Spending more money in what they are doing and figuring out ways to do it better is how to compete.  Mike DeCola, who owns a business called HBM Holdings in Louis, was interviewed by Remember, this is the National Association of Manufacturers; these are people who make things, and any time we get into that economy and strengthen that economy, we strengthen take-home pay. But he was interviewed by He was asked what this tax reform would mean to his business, and he said: ``Tax reform will unleash investment not just for us, but for our customers.'' That is where his quote ends, but that is a really important point to understand. When everybody is doing better, whatever you are doing is likely to get better as well. Not only does the business get better for you, but, suddenly, the people to whom you sell things are more interested in also innovating, investing, and improving.  The Senate bill also recognizes a couple of tools that really help us go in and revitalize areas that are not doing so well. One is called new market tax credits. New market tax credits have provided an effective incentive for the private sector to invest in communities outside the economic mainstream. These are usually communities that already have the water system, the electrical system, the sewer system, and the sidewalks, but they have buildings that no longer serve the purpose they used to serve, and the new market tax credits look at those buildings and other areas.  In our State of Missouri, the new market tax credits have financed a sauce manufacturer in Hazelwood; a heating system manufacturer in Cuba, MO; a plumbing fixture manufacturer in Kansas City; a training center for sheet metal workers in Louis; the first grocery store in more than a generation in Pagedale, MO; and a lot more things beyond that. This bill recognizes that.  It also acknowledges the importance of historic tax credits. I was talking with Patt Lilly from Joseph about that. He made the point that Joseph is an older community, a historic community. The western movement and the wagon trains outfitted there 150 and 175 years ago. The Pony Express started there. The stockyards thrived after the Civil  Those old buildings--many magnificent buildings--didn't have the kind of uses they used to have, but over the past 10 years, historic tax credits have leveraged almost $100 million in redevelopment in those older buildings.[[Page S7379]]Housing developed there. Businesses developed there. They restored and revitalized distressed areas of the city.  A recent example is the restoration of the German American Building by Mosaic Life Care in the Joseph downtown area. That is a building that wouldn't have been able to be saved without some special assistance, which was made available because of historic tax credits. Again, not only was the historic building saved, but all of the services that were already there and served that building that wasn't being used now serve a building that is being used, and they don't have to be replaced.  The bottom line is that this is a bill that will create a better future for American families and a better future for American jobs. This is an opportunity to do something that is hard to do, and it only gets done once every 25 to 30 years. This is the moment. It is time to do this.  We will have a debate on the floor that allows everybody to make every reasonable amendment. I don't mean reasonable in that it might be reasonable to do it, but reasonable in that it deals with taxes and you figure out some way to pay for it. So you do something here, and you add something there. That is what this debate will be. We have talked about this topic now for years and intensely for months. It is time to get this job done.

1151,topic-id,2727,"Thank you very much, Mr. If you look at the United States of America today compared to when my dad grew up, we have seen very disturbing trends in our economy. In fact, right now, we do not have the same economy--the same bargain--that we had in my parents' generation.  Someone who had a minimum wage job back in the fifties or sixties made the equivalent of over $20 an hour today. The bargain in the United States of America was that if you were willing to work hard, willing to sweat, struggle, and sacrifice, you could make ends meet, and you could make it work.  What we have seen, disturbingly, over the last few decades is that economy twist and contort. We have seen massive disparities in income come about in our Nation, with the wealthy getting wealthier and wealthier, doing better and better, compounding and doubling down on their privilege, but we have seen the middle class shrinking in the United States of America and the poverty trap, where people are playing by the rules, where people are working hard. They see their wages stagnate while the cost of everything is going up, such as prescription drug costs, the cost of food and child care, the cost of college. The bargain in our country is not working now, and we need to do something to change this.  At a time when American families are feeling the burn and the challenge of high taxes, low incomes, and high costs, we could be targeting middle-class Americans, and we could be targeting low-income earners in a bipartisan tax bill that would not only help those who are struggling in America, but when we give a tax break to those folks, that money gets reinvested in our economy because people spend that money, and we literally have a turbocharge boost to our overall economy. But that is not what we are seeing right now.  As the Republicans scramble for votes, we are on the verge tonight of doing something completely counter to what evidence, facts, and logic would tell us to do if we were going to devise a tax plan to truly help the middle class, truly help working Americans, truly help those struggling, wondering why they are not doing as well as their parents did.  Understand this: 90 percent of baby boomers in America, by the time they turned 30, were doing better than their parents economically. That has now been cut in half in the United States of If you are a millennial, born in the eighties, it is now half who are doing better than their parents because of the challenges I am describing, because of the economic hardships. The bargain isn't working. Everything is going up, but wages are stagnant.  We know factually that for the past 40 years, while workers' wages have failed to rise alongside increased productivity--workers are getting more and more productive, but for 40 years now, workers' wages have failed to rise alongside of that increase in productivity. What we have seen is that corporations' profits have reached a 60-year high.  In our country, it is disturbing when we see indices of social mobility--the ability for someone born poor to make it out of poverty--we see other nations, from Canada to classist England, doing better than we are in increasing social mobility. We see other countries ``out-Americaning'' us, taking what is the very idea of the American dream--that every generation should do better than the one before--and showing more progress toward that dream than we are.  Social mobility, which is integral to our country, is disappearing. Wages are stagnating. Corporate profits are at an alltime high. Costs are skyrocketing. Everyone here knows it. I live in the Central Ward of Newark, I see it in the faces of families at grocery stores, hard-working families who are working full-time jobs, sometimes dual earners, finding it hard to make their money stretch to meet their families' needs, often finding themselves with more month at the end of their money than money at the end of the month. Families all across America, sitting at their kitchen tables, are finding it hard to balance their budgets. Parents who are working two jobs are trying to figure out how their kids are going to get to college and come out without tens of thousands--over $100,000 worth of debt.  The bargain is not working, and we should be working in this body to figure out a way to empower the overall economy and empower middle-class workers. We are not doing enough to help American workers' incomes grow. We are not doing enough to make the bargain work. We are not doing enough.  I will tell you this: The tax plan that seems to be moving to the floor today will not help restore that American bargain. It will not help reinstate the American progress. It won't get us back to those days. It won't help American workers. It will actually make things worse over the long term.  We can debate philosophies about tax codes all we want, but we cannot debate facts. The fact is that this plan is not pro-growth; it is anti-middle class. It is not pro-worker; it is an even more severe violation of that bargain between American workers and this Nation that created our modern economy. It is an affront to the idea of hard work and earning a living wage in  This plan is not investing in the success of American workers. It is not a plan to give hard workers a break or a boost. It isn't going to make our economy more fair. The bill is poorly designed and devised by the President of the United States and by Republicans in Congress to give a tax cut to those who need it least, on the backs of those Americans who need it and deserve it most.  Again, this is not partisan rhetoric. A recent nonpartisan report from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation found that, on average, Americans earning less than $75,000 will face a tax increase over the next 10 years under this plan. Remember, adding insult to that injury, the corporate tax provisions of this plan are permanent, but the individual tax provisions are not. In other words, this plan actively targets the folks who are struggling the most. It targets them with a tax increase and a sunsetting of the provisions that were intended to help them.  Meanwhile, on the other hand, the biggest corporations and the wealthiest individuals will receive a massive tax cut, and they will receive that tax cut--this is not free money. This is borrowed money. The $1.5 trillion added to our deficit is borrowed money that we will have to pay for over the long term. It is a massive giveaway to the wealthiest of people in our country and corporations, all under the theory that somehow this is going to benefit the average American worker. It will blow up the deficit and pump more money to the wealthiest in our country at a time that wealth disparities are already greater than they have been in a century.  Some of my colleagues are going to argue that this bill giving $1 trillion to corporations will somehow result in a trickling down of things like raises for workers and somehow create new jobs, but that is a fantasy. I am a believer that you look at facts and you look at[[Page S7523]]history, and we don't have to look that far. This fantasy has been disproved, this idea of giving it to the wealthiest and it somehow trickling down, of giving it to corporations and it somehow trickling down to job creation. This has been disproved time and time again by economic data, historical data, and by the words of corporate leaders themselves.  Listen to the facts. A new survey found that the majority of small business owners--these are the people who are the backbone of our economy, who create jobs--oppose this plan. Six in ten think it benefits wealthy corporations the most. Well, that is not just them thinking that; those are actually the facts of this plan.  Take the word of leading economists. The University of Chicago's IGM Forum--a collection of many of the top economists in this country from a range and a spectrum of political philosophies--recently surveyed its members, asking ``If we pass a bill similar to the one being considered by Congress, will the U.GDP be substantially higher a decade from now than it is currently under the status quo?'' Will this bill help our economy grow? Of the 42 respondents, 41 said: No, it will not. There was only one dissenter.  These are some of the world's preeminent economists. We didn't invite them to the Senate to hear their opinions. We didn't have hearings. We didn't have an open process where we brought in the best economic minds from both sides of the political aisle, from both sides of the political spectrum. We did not have a process that brought in the best and the brightest to inform the investments we are making--$1.5 trillion. And what they are saying now is that this will not do what Republican leaders say it will do.  Senate Republicans wrote a budget to free up $1.5 trillion--that is what this will do to our deficit--to create these tax cuts. They can distribute these resources any way they see fit, and somehow they have managed to create, astonishingly, a tax bill that will increase taxes on low-income and middle-income people, especially in States like New Jersey, by getting rid of the State and local taxes provisions. This is why Republican Congresspeople in my State are against this, because this plan has been devised to hurt middle-income families, doubling down in States like mine.  They have created a bill that small businesses don't like because they know that the benefits are largely going to the wealthiest and the biggest corporations, and the kicker is that economists say it won't even spur economic growth. Then when major corporations see their earnings go higher or get an influx of capital, what is going to happen? Well, it is far more likely that their executives and shareholders--not their frontline workers--will benefit.  Don't take my word for it; look at what has happened over the last decade. We have seen record corporate profits, and what is happening with those profits? Eighty, ninety percent of those profits are not being invested in hiring more people or increasing pay; the overwhelming majority of the profits that corporations are seeing are going to paying dividends and doing stock buybacks. That is what happens when corporations get more resources.  Don't take my word for it; look at what corporate leaders themselves are saying. They have made it clear time and time again that increases in profits will not trickle down to workers. Major American companies have said point blank that they will not use their huge tax windfalls to raise wages for workers. Companies from Cisco, to Pfizer, to Coca-Cola, to Vanguard have said that their tax breaks will go to dividends for shareholders, not wages for workers. According to Bloomberg, on an earnings call in reference to the tax plan, one CEO said: ``We'll be able to get much more aggressive on the share buyback.'' That is where corporate profits have been going for a decade or more, creating more wealth for the wealthiest and not for the average American worker, who has seen decade after decade of stagnant wages. This shouldn't be surprising. Corporate profits are at a record high right now, and we see wages at a record low. That is a fact. And to double down on what we know is not factual, that we know is not happening now--it is just a fantasy.  Corporations are making more money today than they have in over 80 years, but the average worker's wages are at their lowest point in six decades. This plan gives more wealth to corporations and not direct tax relief to middle-class workers and low-income workers.  We could have gotten rid of carried interest--something even the President of the United States talked about on the campaign trail--and targeted the child tax credit or the earned-income tax credit, but that is not what this plan does. This tax plan is a fundamental and costly misdiagnosis of the problems facing American workers across the country, and the right way to go about addressing them is not being done.  So here is an idea: Instead of giving massive tax breaks to corporations and hoping it somehow gets to workers, let's just give the money directly to workers by giving the lion's share of this tax break to middle-class, working-class, and low-wage earners. This is not complicated. We don't need some fancy system of hoping things will trickle down. Let's cut out the corporate middleman. That is a bill I would support.  We should have been discussing in bipartisan meetings and hearings how we can empower American workers and the middle class, because the problem with the economy today is not that the rich are not getting richer, it is that middle-class workers are not seeing their wages grow. We should be discussing what we can do to break up this culture amongst financial institutions across the country that prioritizes short-term returns over long-term worker investments, that is making CEO after CEO focus on stock buybacks that manipulate their stock prices up and increase their incentivized pay but are doing nothing for the corporation's long-term strength or the workers who are on the frontlines doing the work and actually earning the profits.  Right now, despite record profits, investing in the long-term success of their companies and employees through things like pay raises, pathways to promotion, innovation--that has become the exception in American society and not the rule for too many corporations.  We have a problem, and this tax bill doesn't address it. It will make it worse.  There is no evidence that suggests that the Senate tax plan, which hands 80 percent of that $1.5 trillion borrowed from the Chinese and other countries that own our Treasury bonds--80 percent of that $1.5 trillion is going to corporations and business owners and the top 0.1 percent of the wealthiest estates. There is no evidence to suggest that this will somehow reverse the trend and increase wages for workers. This is insanity. This is folly. This is fiction being foisted upon the American people.  Too many employers are failing to hold up their end of the bargain when it comes to fair wages, safe workplaces, and workforce investments, and now Republicans in Congress want to reward them with $1 trillion and more. This is bad policy. This is unfair. This is bad faith. This is going to worsen the erosion of the American dream and the American bargain that people who play by the rules, who work hard, who sacrifice for their families can get ahead. It is not going to stop the trend of stagnating wages. It is not going to stop the trends of everything going up but our salaries. It is not going to be the change that we need.  No matter how it is disguised, trickle-down economics doesn't work, and Republicans' attempts to camouflage it as tax reform is offensive and won't work for American workers. We have proven that we are a country and a society that can create wealth. We have that covered. What we haven't proven and what this tax bill fails to do is to show that we can be a society that creates great wealth and great opportunity for all.  We have gotten off the tracks from where we have been generations before. We have to get this train back moving in a direction that takes all of its cars--all of the American people--to the promised land where this country needs to be, must be, and was designed to be. This is the challenge before us right now--to stop a tax bill that will make our problems and the disturbing[[Page S7524]]trends worse and design one that is directly targeting middle-class Americans, working-class Americans with enlightened policies that will help our Nation to be one that fulfills its promise and its dream.

2172,topic-id,395,"Mr.President, today I wish to express my gratitude for a community of individuals who are unfailing in their commitment to protecting the public health in my home State of New Jersey, across the United States, and abroad. From preventing chronic disease to responding to pandemics, epidemics, and natural disasters, to ensuring our Nation is prepared in the event of bioterrorist attacks, to reducing health disparities in ways that promote access, participation, and opportunity, the extraordinary and diverse contributions of public health professionals have profound impacts on American lives.  The breadth of functions for which public health departments are responsible and the depth of expertise the public health workforce possesses are truly remarkable. Among their many responsibilities include Zika response and awareness; ensuring restaurants, local parks, and other venues are safe and clean; monitoring air and water quality; tracing and containing disease outbreaks; conducting health screenings; providing health education; investigating potential cancer clusters; fielding questions on everything from animal welfare to newborn screening, and the list goes on.  The importance of public health research and practice is clearly evident as neglected diseases of poverty emerge and spread in the U.While these bacterial and parasitic infections primarily affect low- and middle-income countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, they are increasingly evident in the U.In fact, illnesses including Zika, toxoplasmosis, and Chagas disease have collectively impacted millions of Despite significant gaps in awareness and resources, our public health workforce has made great strides in monitoring and preventing these diseases; their efforts benefit both Americans and communities across the globe.  Placing a high priority on public health not only improves quality of life, it helps drive economic growth. By preventing disease and promoting healthy behaviors, we can reduce both direct healthcare costs and economic losses due to reduced productivity. The fiscal benefits of public health are clear--according to the American Public Health Association, every dollar we spend on childhood vaccinations saves $16.50 in future health costs. Additionally, an estimated 75 percent of health spending in the U.is related to preventable chronic diseases--investing in community health initiatives that reduce the rates of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes saves both money and lives.  It is with gratitude for their invaluable contributions to the health and security of communities across New Jersey, our Nation, and the world, that I recognize Public Health Thank You Day on Monday, November 20, 2017.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-27-pt1-PgS7331-2.txt,2194,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONTINUED,2017,27,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

340,topic-id,780,"Mr.President, I thank Senator  Mr.President, if we want to cut taxes for the middle class, as my colleagues keep saying, then let's cut taxes for the middle class. Instead of giving the money to the corporations and hoping it trickles down, let's cut out the middleman. Let's put the money directly in the pockets of working families.  I will say that again. Instead of giving the money to corporations and hoping it trickles down, cut out the middleman and put the money directly in the pockets of working families. I will keep saying this, because tax reform should be that simple.  I spent the last 2 weeks, and in particular the past 2 days, working with Senators Rubio and Lee on a good-faith effort to bring the child tax credit into this conversation.  I don't believe their proposal goes far enough because it fails to index the CTC for inflation. For inflation, it is temporary. Remember, the tax cuts for individuals are temporary; the tax cuts for corporations are permanent. It continues to be tied only to payroll taxes. It ignores the burdens we place on working families.  We can find trillions--trillions--for corporations. This is all we can do for working families?  Unfortunately, while Senators Lee and Rubio were making a real effort at middle-class tax cuts, and I thought we were close to a bipartisan bill that could save this bill, it didn't happen. Republican leadership--coming down the hall from Senator McConnell's office--swooped in and made it clear that this bill is being written to benefit one class of people: corporations that shift jobs overseas and their  While Senators' sons and daughters will do just fine under this proposal--they will get the full tax cut for their children--working families will pay the price.  What we should do--frankly, what we must do--is vote this bill down and start over.  Senators Rubio and Lee and I could work together, along with our colleague, Senator Bennet, to pass real middle-class tax cuts built around a compromise that begins with our shared goals on the child tax credit. That is where we start because, right now, this bill is not a tax cut for working families. Everybody on this side of the aisle knows it. Every single person knows it. Whether they were personally a CEO, whether they were an accountant, whether they were a lawyer in a small town, they all know this is not a cut for middle-class families.  Right now this bill is a massive giveaway to multinational corporations that outsource American jobs. We know the companies shut down in Mansfield, OH, in Zanesville, in Lima, and in Chillicothe, they get a tax break, they move overseas, build a new factory, and sell those products back into the United We know that is what has been happening. We choose not to fix that and instead we do more of the same.  Even before we take into account the loss of healthcare coverage for tens of millions of Americans, a full 62 percent of these tax cuts will go to the top 1 percent of households by the end of the decade. Sixty-two percent of these tax cuts go to the top 1 percent of households. Even with the Bush tax cuts, which were clearly weighted way too much to the wealthiest people in our country--the most privileged--that was only 27 percent of those tax cuts, those benefits that went to the wealthiest 1 percent.  So let's end the charade that this bill is a tax cut for ordinary It is simply not.  Their CEO pals have let the cat out of the bag. Bloomberg said this morning: ``Instead of hiring more workers. . . .'' My friends on the other side of the aisle say, if we cut taxes on corporations, it will raise wages, and they will hire more workers.  Bloomberg said: ``Instead of hiring more workers or raising their pay, companies say they will first increase dividends or buy back their own shares.''  That is what they always do. They take the money for themselves. They take the money for stockholders and stock buybacks and more executive compensation. The corporate CEOs couldn't be clearer: They are keeping the money for themselves. It is not going into the pockets of workers.  Again, take out the middleman. If you want to do tax cuts for the middle class, then do tax cuts for the middle class. If my colleagues mean what they say--if they want to cut taxes for the middle class--work with us bipartisanly on a good child tax credit that will really work for working families and cut taxes directly for the middle class.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-12-01-pt1-PgS7655-2.txt,2106,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONTINUED,2017,1,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

556,topic-id,2738,"Mr.President, I thank the majority leader for recognizing me.  Last week, the Senate gave tax handouts to millionaires, billionaires, and multinational corporations that ship jobs overseas, and the middle class got almost nothing. This week, it is the banks' turn, and just like last week, working people get ignored again.  The bill the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee will take up tomorrow, 2155, puts taxpayers at risk of another bank bailout and puts homeowners at risk of the same traps that led to the foreclosure crisis, all while, again, doing virtually nothing for hard-working  While Congress has been preoccupied doing the bidding of special interest lobbyists, American families started getting notices in the mail that their Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, health insurance will be yanked away. There are 209,000 children in my State, the sons and daughters of low-income workers making 8, 10, or $12 an hour and who don't have insurance. Having started bipartisan and having always been enacted and renewed in a bipartisan manner over the last 20 years, the CHIP program will be yanked away. Virginia will be next, then Ohio, and then other States where parents will go to their mailbox and open up a letter from the government saying: Sorry, your children's health insurance is gone.  The Senate is doing nothing to stop it. Instead this body, made up of Senators who have insurance paid for by taxpayers, devotes its energy to helping banks of all sizes that are making record profits. In the third quarter of this year, the five largest U.banks--just the five largest U.banks--raked in a combined $21 billion in profits. In the third quarter only, the five banks have $21 billion in profits. In fact, profits at the five biggest banks are even higher than they were before the crisis. Meanwhile working Americans haven't gotten a raise in 16 years.  I sat at my high school reunion in Mansfield, OH, about a year ago, with a woman who has been a teller at a large bank for 30 years. Her income, after 30 years at this bank, is $30,000 a year. She is working for one of those largest five banks. Yet those banks, as I said, have $21 billion in profits in the third quarter.  Forty-four million Americans are saddled with student loan debt. Communities are littered with abandoned homes and hollowed-out factories. Yet this bill has no help for Americans burdened with student loan debt, no help for homeowners still underwater, and no help for workers who haven't had a raise in years.  Congress, especially the Banking Committee, have a collective amnesia about the financial crisis. It is like it didn't even happen 10 years ago. They have a collective amnesia about the housing crisis and the devastation it brought to families across the country. We know how many people lost jobs 10 years ago because of Wall Street's overreach. We know how many people lost their savings. We know how many people lost their homes. Families in Ohio don't have the luxury of this collective amnesia. Families don't have the luxury in my neighborhood of forgetting what happened 10 years ago because so many of them are still digging out.  We passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation to protect those families and make sure a crisis like we saw 9 years doesn't happen again. Stress tests were put in place to ensure that banks could weather the next downturn without putting the economy at risk. According to the President's designee to be Chair of the Federal Reserve and according to so many others who understand these issues and understand banking, stress tests are one of the most effective tools we have to prevent taxpayers from being asked once again to bail out the banks.  This bill weakens stress tests for all large banks, which together took $239 billion--that is $239,000 million--in taxpayer bailouts last time. They are banks like JPMorgan Chase and other Wall Street megabanks that are designated as global systemically important banks--we call them G-SIBs around here--which means their collapse could cause harm that ripples throughout the world. It is not just the damage it does to Main Street in Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Cleveland, or Toledo, but it would do damage to the economy all over the world. Without rigorous, annual stress tests, taxpayers could once again be on the hook if those too-big-to-fail banks collapse and we don't have the right tools in place to see it coming.  So I ask my fellow Senators: Are you willing to go back to your homes, are you willing to go back to your States and tell taxpayers you work for that you are willing to gamble another $240 billion of their money on a bill like this? For some other large banks, those stress tests could be even easier under this bill. Make no mistake, these aren't small banks we are talking about, and I am not talking about the largest 10 banks. I am talking about the banks in more detail affected by this bill. Together these banks--about 30 of them--hold $4 trillion in combined assets. That is $4,000 billion in combined assets. That is more than one-quarter of all assets across the entire banking industry. Would you trust your family's health to a doctor who only passed a dumbed-down version of their board exams? Why would we trust the health of our economy to banks that only passed diluted weakened stress tests?  This bill doesn't stop at stress tests. It allows these same large banks to[[Page S7822]]borrow more money than they can afford by weakening capital requirements. It exempts dozens of the largest banks from making plans called living wills. These are plans that make sure that if a bank fails, taxpayers will not be paying the bills once again.  It weakens oversight of foreign megabanks operating in the United States, the same banks that have repeatedly violated U.laws. Let's run through a few of their rap sheets. Santander, I believe, is a Spanish bank. It illegally repossessed cars from members of our military. It repossessed cars from our servicemen and servicewomen who were serving our country overseas. Are we giving them a break? Are we going to deregulate them?  Deutsche Bank manipulated the benchmark interest rates used to set borrowers' mortgages. Barclays manipulated electric energy prices in the western United Credit Suisse illegally did business with UBS sold toxic mortgage-backed securities. So are we going to give these banks a break? They have repeatedly violated U.law. Are these the banks we want to help?  The bill also puts American homeowners at risk of the same sorts of mortgage abuses that brought us to foreclosure crisis. My wife and I live in Cleveland, OH, in ZIP Code 44105. In the first half of 2007, my ZIP Code had more foreclosures than any ZIP Code in the United States of It is pretty hard for most of us to imagine here what it might be like to be kicked out of our homes. I ask my colleagues to try for a minute to put yourselves in the shoes of one of these families. Pope Francis exhorted his parish priests to go out and smell like the flock--go out and listen to people, see the kinds of lives, ask them questions about the kinds of lives they live.  So what happens when a family is thrown out of its house? Before you are thrown out, you give up the family pet to try to save money even though that dog may have been your son's or daughter's. My son and my grandson and granddaughter just got a little stray that their father picked up when he was out jogging and picked a little dog. It has only been a week and a half, and they love this beautiful little dog. So families give up the pet to try to save money. When that is not enough, you sit the kids down and you have to tell them you are moving. They will have to change schools. Mom will not be around as much because mom has gotten a second job.  These are the impossible decisions and painful conversations millions of Americans were forced to have in 2007, 2008, and 2009 because of the big banks' greed and, in some cases, their illegal activity. Trillions of dollars of housing wealth were destroyed. African-American and Hispanic families lost more than half of their accumulated wealth--wealth they still have not fully recovered.  We can't go back there. These stakes are too high. That is why some of the provisions in this bill are so troubling.  Let me run through a few of them. This bill permits mortgages for homes up to $400,000 in some areas to be offered without an appraisal to verify the home is worth what you are paying. Without an appraisal, you know what would happen. You could end up in an underwater mortgage on day one. It no longer requires banks to set up accounts that help you budget for your property tax and homeowner's insurance. Instead of manageable payments built into your monthly mortgage, you could end up with an unexpected tax bill at the end of the year. You could end up with an unexpected insurance bill at the end of the year. If you can't pay, then, the foreclosure proceedings start.  It allows some banks to sell you an adjustable rate mortgage without the bank assuming any responsibility for whether you can afford your payments once the initial rate expires. People don't always know what it means with an adjustable rate mortgage. It might be in the small print. We know forced arbitration is in the small print, too. We know how that works out. Say you are a customer in Youngstown, and you could take out a mortgage at 4 percent. Say your payment is $400 a month. After 3 years, your interest rate jumps to 9 percent, so your monthly payment is all of a sudden almost $700. Your bank knows you can't afford that. The bank knew it when it sold you the mortgage or it should have known. That is the bank's job. That is the law today. It is not the law under this bill.  Under this bill, when your mortgage suddenly spikes, when you have to start having these tough conversations around the dinner table with your partner, with your children, the bank that sold you the mortgage is protected. It gets off scot-free. Today, you could go to a judge and fight to stay in your home. You might not be able to under this bill. What is fair about that?  This bill blocks some homeowners from going to court to stop banks that foreclosed on them. Sound familiar?  Not that long ago Vice President Pence came to the Senate floor to sit in the chair that the Senator from Oklahoma is sitting in, and he came to the floor late at night to stop customers like those 140 million cheated by Equifax and several million cheated by Wells Fargo from having their day in court. When the Vice President shows up in this body to break a tie, Wall Street wins every single time.  Now, this bill blocks homeowners from having their day in court. It is the context under which we will consider this bill. American families and American taxpayers, who stand to lose the most, get almost nothing--no help with student debt and no help with underwater mortgages. But we are hearing consumers being told: Don't worry. Trust us. Trust us.  The Trump administration regulators will make sure everything is just fine. Trust us. Trust people like Vice President Pence, who cast the tie-breaking vote to strip consumers from their day in court. Trust Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, whose former bank made a fortune kicking families, including veterans, including people in the Army and the Marines and seniors, out of their homes and has now merged into a new bank that gets relief under this bill.  Trust Secretary Mnuchin's colleague at that same foreclosure machine, Joseph Otting, now leading the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the financial watchdog in charge of overseeing the national banks. Think about that. Trust him.  Trust Mick Mulvaney, installed as the new part-time head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, despite what the law says, whose first action on the job was to stop payments to veterans, to seniors, to consumers, and to stop payments to people who had been cheated by banks. These payments were on their way. The banks had been found guilty of cheating their customers, and Mick Mulvaney's first action as head of the consumer bureau was to stop those payments.  Trust Randy Quarles, the new head of Supervision at the Federal Reserve Board, who was a Treasury official in the years leading up to the crisis and who said on the eve of the financial crisis: ``Fundamentally, the economy is strong, the financial sector is healthy, and our future looks bright.'' He was in the Treasury Department in a highly placed job in the Bush administration. As the economy started to implode, that was his observation of the state of housing and that was his observation of the state of the economy. He is now head of bank supervision at the Federal  Is this track record what taxpayers and homeowners are supposed to trust? Is this the track record that gives Senators the confidence to take a gamble with taxpayer dollars? Are these guys going to protect us from another crisis or prevent another bailout?  I don't know about my colleagues, but I will tell you that when I am home in Ohio and when my friend from Delaware is at home in Wilmington, we meet a lot of people who feel invisible. Entire communities feel invisible. They feel used, they feel abused, and they feel some other things I can't say on the Senate floor by banks, by mega corporations, by Wall Street and, yes, by Washington and by this U.Too often, they are right. They are being used and abused by banks and by mega corporations and by Wall Street and by people in this body.  We have a chance to show these people that we see them, we hear them, we work for them, and that we will do our jobs and fight for them. We do that by blocking this bill.  As I conclude, I want to say something about some people who are affected by this bill that makes sense. Regional community banks provide[[Page S7823]]critical services to customers and homeowners and small businesses. I respect my colleagues' desire to support them. I do support efforts to help community and regional banks fill important needs. I don't support efforts to roll back accountability measures on the largest banks, with nothing to help hard-working Americans who have the most to lose.  It is this simple: If we want to help the middle class, let's help the middle class.  We sat here the last couple of weeks--both in the Finance Committee and on the floor--on the tax bill. I heard ad nauseam my colleagues say that this tax bill is for the middle class. Well, it really wasn't for the middle class. If you want to cut taxes for the middle class, you cut taxes for the middle class. Same here. If we want to help the middle class, let's help the middle class, whether it is the Tax Code or banking laws. You don't grow our economy by handing out more money to the people at the top, whether it is Wall Street banks or whether it is large corporations that outsource jobs. You don't give handouts to the wealthiest people with sort of a bank shot. Get rid of the middleman. If you want to help the middle class, darn it, help the middle class. Don't filter it through the largest banks and the largest corporations, hoping something will trickle down. We grow our economy by putting money directly into the pockets of middle-class families.  Let's cut the corporate middleman. Let's throw out the Wall Street lobbyists. Let's provide relief for student loan debt and mortgages and community banks. Let's help workers who haven't seen a raise in over a decade. Let's show the people of this country that we actually do, in fact, work for them.  I yield the floor.

I brought it up to the whole group--the Patriot Corporation Act, on which I will speak in a moment. It does exactly what President Trump wants to do. It rewards corporations that pay good wages, that pay decent benefits, and that keep their production in this country. The President said that he liked it. He had had an interview with either Forbes or Fortune Magazine not too much earlier, and he had talked about it. Then I brought up to the President the Working Families Tax Relief Act, which puts money directly in the pockets of people who are making $25,000 and $50,000 and $75,000 a year. The President said that he liked that.  But do you know what happened? He said it then, and he said it in a phone call that a group of us were on a little bit later. Do you know what happened? We know exactly what happened. They all went down the hall here to the majority leader's office. All of my Republican friends walked into that office, and they had their Wall Street lobbyists with them; they had their drug company lobbyists; and they had their tobacco company lobbyists. That is where they wrote the bill. There was no light of day on this.  Then my colleagues on this committee told us that it was a legitimate process on the night that we had the markup in the Finance They call it legitimate, but they give us a bill with almost no warning. They try to jam it through. They change it in the middle of the night. Then we talk about it the next day. Then they change it in the middle of the night again. They add a healthcare provision about which the Congressional Budget Office said 13 million people will lose their insurance; rates will go up; premiums will go up 10 percent a year. If you are paying $500 a month today, you will pay $550 next year, and you will pay $605 the following year, and you will pay $660-something a month the following year.  I mean, don't even insult us by saying that this is a legitimate process. I don't even want to talk about the process, because that really doesn't mean much to people.  In this letter that my friend mentioned, the first line states: ``We write to express our interest in working with you on bipartisan tax reform.'' That is what Senator Wyden said, if you would like to look at it.  I want to talk about my amendment, which is exactly what Candidate Trump campaigned on, exactly what pretty much everybody on this side of the aisle stands for, but most importantly, it is exactly what the American people have asked for.  It is simple. It is called the Patriot Corporation If a company does the right thing, if a company pays good wages and provides decent healthcare and retirement benefits to its employees and does its production in the United States, it will get a significant tax break based on the number of employees it hires--a significant tax break. President Trump said he liked that. He told Forbes that he wanted a bill with economic development incentives for companies. The President has said repeatedly that he wants legislation--a tax bill that supports companies that stay here and are patriotic, and he said that we should penalize companies that don't do their production in this country.  This bill now--comments from my friend from Pennsylvania notwithstanding--gives a massive, permanent tax cuts to large, multinational corporations, and it gives them more incentives to move offshore.  The Presiding Officer grew up in the Cleveland suburbs. A plant shuts down in Cleveland or Garfield Heights or Mansfield, where I grew up, it moves overseas, and it gets a tax break now. Don't you think we should fix that? Instead, this bill greases the wheels to send more jobs overseas. Of all the things we should fix, that is it. That is what the President wants to do, and that is what Senate Democrats want to do. Instead, Senate Republicans--again, that deal was struck back there in Senator McConnell's office--Senate Republicans are writing a bill that gives huge tax cuts to the wealthiest people in this country.  The Center for Budget Priorities just yesterday came out with this, done precisely according to the numbers. In 2001 and 2003, 27 percent of the Bush tax cuts went to the top 1 percent. I thought that was too high at the time. This bill more than doubles that--61 percent of the benefits. It is not going to the middle class, and they know that when they say it over and over. In addition, it kicks 13 million people off of their insurance. We know that.  Under this bill, U.companies would pay a rate of 20 percent on profit earned in a manufacturing plant in Akron, That same plant can shut down, lay off its workers, build a new factory in Asia, and get a tax deduction for the cost of moving. Do you know what they pay? They potentially likely pay a zero-percent tax rate. So what are they going to do? Even in the Senate Finance Committee, where people are not as quick as one might think they are, 20 is a larger number than zero. Even we can figure that out. At 20 percent, what that means is that there is an even greater tax incentive to go overseas.  The Presiding Officer knows Cleveland well. He knows that my wife and I live in a neighborhood in Cleveland, Our neighborhood ZIP Code is 44105. There were more foreclosures in my neighborhood in the first half of 2007 than any ZIP Code in the United States of Why? It wasn't the Wall Street scam that caused so many foreclosures later; it was mostly because of the loss of manufacturing jobs. Do you know why that is? Partly because of trade agreements like NAFTA, other trade policies, PNTR with China, and all that. Much of it was about tax legislation giving incentives to move overseas. Why are we doing more of it? This bill rewards companies for sending jobs overseas.  Our legislation, the Patriot Corporation Act, will work to keep jobs here. We know these corporate tax cuts are not going to end up in the pockets of ordinary working  Senator Hatch and I had a very public discussion in the Finance Committee a couple Thursdays ago when the bill was voted out. We talked about a number of things. One of the things we talked about was this promise, this assertion, this myth that if we give a company a big tax cut, then we know what they are going to do. They are going to hand it out to their employees. They are going to give a $4,000 or $5,000 or $6,000 or $7,000 a year raise. That doesn't happen. That has never happened. When this body passed a tax holiday a decade-plus ago, the money that was brought back from overseas at a lower tax rate went to executive compensation, to stock buybacks, and to dividends--almost all of it. Workers didn't get raises and they didn't invest more in our economy.  Companies are sitting on large stacks, huge caches of cash. Those companies can hire more people now. They can raise wages now. They are not doing any of that.  What we ought to do, instead of shoveling more money to the top, to these large corporations that outsource jobs, we ought to cut out the middleman and put the money directly into the middle class. If my friends want to give a tax cut to the middle class, why don't we[[Page S7514]]give a tax cut to the middle class? Why don't we directly put the money there?  I know the President said that he is a big loser on this bill personally, that it will cost him zillions of dollars--whatever he said. We know that is not even close to true. But if we really care about the middle class, I say to my colleagues, let's give a tax break to the middle class.  Think about it. They are not even hiding what they are doing. These cuts go to corporate stockholders. They don't go to raise wages; they go to executive compensation. They don't go to create jobs; they go to stock buybacks. They don't go to middle-class Ohioans, Oregonians, Texans, Pennsylvanians, or We know what will happen. Do you know what will happen? As Senator Rubio said, after we pass this bill and the President signs it into law, the budget deficit will explode again. Do you know what will happen? Senator Wyden knows. This will come back, and you guys will say: You know, we have this budget deficit, and we are going to have to raise the Social Security retirement age. Do you know what that means to a barber in Garfield Heights? Do you know what that means to a construction worker in Warren, OH? Do you know what that means to somebody who is working in manufacturing in Mansfield, OH? They can't work until they are 70. We can all work until we are 70, if our constituents allow us, because we have these jobs. Well, a lot of our constituents can't. And if that is the scenario--and it is almost inevitable--if we pass this bill, if we do this bill, if we pass this bill of big tax cuts for the wealthiest people in this country, we will drive a hole in the budget deficit, and then we will come back and make the middle class and working families pay to fill that hole. That is irresponsible. That is morally reprehensible.  I yield.  The PRESIDING The majority whip.

I hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle disingenuously say: Well, as for the Democrats, because they don't like our tax plan, that means they are for the tax system the way it is. Of course, we don't like the tax system the way it is, and we particularly don't like it in States like mine and, I would say, especially in places like Eastern Oregon, where companies shut down production in Lima, OH, or Springfield, OR, and move to Wuhan or Beijing and get a tax break for doing it. We want to close that loophole, but you know what, this bill explodes that loophole. It explodes it, because, as I said a few minutes ago, if a plant shuts down in Barberton or it shuts down in Xenia or it shuts down in Zanesville, the company, under this bill, would pay a rate of 20 percent on profits. If it shuts down and moves to Asia, it can build a new factory and get a tax deduction for the cost of moving, still, and pay a U.tax rate of zero. So why wouldn't they move?

1137,topic-id,493,"Madam President, I reclaim my time.  Of course, I don't believe that is the new normal. It is the same old game they played before. If you are not for our tax plan, then you are not for tax reform. Nobody believes that.  Of course, we don't think 1.5 percent is the normal. But do you know what else we know? We know that the last time, 20 years ago, when we focused on the middle class and cut taxes on the middle class during the Clinton years, the economy exploded. There were 22 million private sector jobs.  But do you know what happened a dozen years ago? President Bush did two tax cuts for the wealthy, under the view that it trickles down and everybody will do better. During 8 years of President Bush, there was no net job growth.  Yes, during the last few years, we have had this low level of GDP growth for a whole lot of reasons, but you don't fix it--you don't grow the economy--by giving tax cuts for the rich with the hope of it trickling down. One of the ways you fix that is to do the patriot corporation legislation. If a company does the right thing, if a company pays good wages, if a company provides decent health benefits and retirement benefits and keeps its production in the United States, that company gets a better tax rate--$1,500 for workers, the way this amendment would work. That is how you grow the economy. That is what Candidate Trump said and then President Trump said to me in a meeting with all my Finance Committee Republicans in the room--in the President's Cabinet room. Now, we know that. That just goes without saying, in spite of the myth that we continue to propagate on the floor.  Before I turn it to Senator Durbin, who is one of the original authors of the patriot corporation legislation, I want to say one other thing. We have seen some pretty charts on this floor about middle-class tax cuts. Well, what we didn't hear mention was that on about the third year of this bill, the tax cuts go down and down and down and then they cross zero, and then you have tax increases. The Tax Policy Center said that, in 2019, 13 million[[Page S7517]]households will have a tax increase; in 2025, 19 million households will have a tax increase; and in 2027, 87 million will have tax increases. Those aren't the Trump family that will have tax increases. Those aren't Senators' families that will have tax increases. Those are working families in Toledo, in Dayton, and working families in Omaha and in East Louis, They are the ones who are going to get hit with these tax increases while the wealthy continue to get more tax breaks.

1459,topic-id,3178,"Mr.President, right now, as we all return from Thanksgiving--some of the American people did not have to work over Thanksgiving weekend, but many, many people in this country do and struggle and continue to work two jobs--and as Congress returns from Thanksgiving, the priorities of this Congress are becoming pretty darned clear to the American people. People want to know the answer to a fundamental question. In this body we all stand up for election every 6 years--in some cases, a little more often--and people fundamentally want to know which side you are on. Are you on their side? Are you on the side of Wall Street or the side of corporations that outsource jobs?  So the question is this: Whose side are you on? The question is this: Are you going to stand with multinational corporations that ship jobs overseas, all to pad their own executives' fat bonus checks? Are you going to stand with banks that rip off consumers or that steal their information and get off scot-free? Maybe some of their executives give their bonuses back, but that is about the only penalty they pay. Are you going to stand with American workers who have been working too hard for too long for too little pay and who are just looking to catch a break? Are you going to stand with children whose parents work two jobs to put food on the table when, unfortunately, both jobs that they work do not pay for health insurance? These are the choices we face.  Right now, the leader of the Senate--the majority leader, who works in that office down the hall, the majority leader back in that office there--negotiates with lobbyists, negotiates healthcare bills, and writes healthcare bills in the back room with drug company lobbyists and insurance lobbyists. Now he has written a tax bill in the back room. We voted on it last week in committee, but it just keeps changing. That is all done in the back room with Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, and his lobbyist friends from corporate America--with the corporate America that ships jobs overseas, with the Wall Street banks that fleece Main Street taxpayers, and with other corporations, which are the drug companies and oil companies and the Koch brothers and all of that. These are the choices that we face. The leaders of the Senate have made it really clear whose side they are on--period.  While the Senate spends its time on a bill to cut taxes for corporations that send jobs overseas--that is the bill that Senator McConnell is negotiating, is writing, is drafting with his lobbyist friends in that office down the hall--children here in America, pure and simple--there is no other way to say it--are about to be kicked off of their health insurance through the Children's Health Insurance As soon as this week, families of young children are going to get letters in the mail that will bring devastating news--that their children will lose their health insurance--period. There are 209,000 of them who live in my State of Ohio--209,000 of them alone.  This is what this program is. It was founded more than two decades ago. Senator Hatch--I give him credit as chairman of the Finance Committee--doesn't seem as interested, frankly, in this bill today as he was when he started, when he wrote the bill, because it has passed out of his committee, and Senator McConnell is too busy to put this bill on the floor so that we can pass it.  The bill works this way: If there is a family and the parents lose their insurance, as many families do, the children still get insurance. That is why 209,000 children--tens of thousands of families in my State--rely on the Children's Health Insurance But this fall, because this Congress is too busy giving tax cuts to rich people, because this Congress is too busy giving all kinds of breaks to the Nation's banks, because this Congress is too busy doing the bidding of the drug companies and the health insurance companies and the bidding of the oil companies, this Congress let CHIP expire.  States are beginning to run out of money for States are preparing to shut down this lifeline for 9 million children in Kansas, Ohio, Florida, and all over the country. Folks in this body--don't forget, we all get our health insurance funded by taxpayers, but we haven't done our job. As a result, families of 209,000 children in Ohio and 9 million children in the United States are going to pay the price.  Think about how devastating it would be to get that letter in the mail. It is already an expensive and stressful time of year. Parents are worried about all kinds of things--higher heating bills, visits to their families for the holidays, the cost of childcare when kids take off from school for the holidays. They are scraping together what they can for gifts. They are already stressed enough. Imagine having to tell your daughter: I am sorry, honey, Santa probably isn't bringing much this year. We won't have any presents under the tree.  You try not to let the child see the worry in your eyes because you are wondering how you are going to afford the debt for regular checkups each year, or God forbid she gets an ear infection or something happens and she needs to go to the doctor. But, oh my gosh, no, we got this letter in the mail that says--and I don't know if the letter will say it this way, but it should--that because Congress failed to do its job--a bunch of elected officials who have insurance paid by taxpayers failed[[Page S7327]]to do their job to reauthorize and fund this bill so that 209,000 children in Ohio will be protected, as well as 9 million people in the country--Ohio, Arizona, California, Minnesota, and Oregon are all expected to run out of CHIP money by the end of the year, early Some States will need to start notifying families right now that they could lose their coverage. Virginia will have to start sending out notices as early as this week. Many other States expect funds to run out the first of the year.  This is not just a few children whom maybe we don't want to think about; this is 9 million children--209,000 children in my State, tens of thousands of children in Kansas, and it is hundreds of thousands of children in Senator Nelson's These are working families who don't qualify for Medicaid but can't afford private insurance. They are families with two working parents who often aren't lucky enough to work for companies that provide health insurance. They are families with children who have special needs. CHIP helps provide access to specialty providers so the kids are never faced with a situation where their family can't afford the therapy or the expensive prescription drugs they need.  Healthcare for all of our children is something on which we ought to be able to come together, wouldn't you think--especially at the holiday season. Leading into Christmas, wouldn't you think we could agree on that, that we ought to take care of the Children's Health Insurance Program?  There has never been a gap for funding in the CHIP program. It was created in a bipartisan way. Senator Kennedy, who sat over here, Senator Rockefeller, who sat over here, and Senator Hatch, who is still in this body, all worked to create this program.  In those days, Senator Hatch said: ``As a nation, as a society, we have a moral responsibility'' to ensure our children have healthcare. We have maintained that bipartisanship ever since, until now--until Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell, who would rather worry about tax cuts for the rich, would rather worry about helping banks keep consumers from having their day in court, would rather worry about helping the Koch brothers and the drug companies. That is way more important than taking care of 209,000 children in I guess it is more important for Senator McConnell to go back in that room and write a bill with his lobbyist friends from the Koch brothers, oil companies, drug companies, and Wall Street--all his special interest buddies. He can write a bill for those big tax breaks for those companies but just not get around to taking care of these kids.  Two years ago, with the support of advocates all over the country, we extended funding for CHIP with bipartisan support. We did it for 2 more years. We put kids first in this body, acted early to extend CHIP so families wouldn't have to worry. This year, in committee--and I give credit to Senator Hatch in this case, as well as Senators Portman, Wyden, and others. We passed a 5-year extension of CHIP, and almost all my colleagues voted for it, but passing it out of committee and patting ourselves on the back doesn't get the job done.  I ask all my colleagues who sit here--again, with health insurance paid for by taxpayers--for one time this Christmas season to set partisanship aside and actually do the right thing. Let's forget the tax bill for just a few days. Let's forget helping the Wall Street banks for a few days. Let's forget about helping the oil companies and billionaire contributors on whom Senator McConnell and his colleagues rely. Let's forget about that just for a few days, and let's take care of 209,000 children in Ohio and tens of thousands of children in Kansas and 9 million children around the country.  My friend Bill Considine is the CEO of Akron Children's He is the longest serving CEO of any children's hospital in the country. He said: ``The fact that this reauthorization has been delayed for political reasons, for shallow campaign promises, is inexcusable.'' I have known Bill Considine for 25 years. I don't know if he is a Republican or a Certainly, I don't think he cares much about that. What he cares about is taking care of kids. He says that the fact that we are putting these children and families at risk in the country we live in--there are no words we can use to justify it. He is right. There is no way to justify Congress's negligence. We need to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program this week--now.                  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  Mr.President, another test we face right now to make it clear to the American people whose side we are on is unfolding at the Consumer Financial Protection Our job is to look out for the people we serve, not Wall Street banks and corporations trying to scam consumers. That is why we must protect the independence of the Consumer Financial Protection  In 2008, when the big banks crashed the economy, which cost millions of Americans their homes and jobs, it was obvious that no one was looking out for the public. While predatory lenders were getting rich on families who were taking out a second mortgage to make ends meet, the people who were supposed to be looking out for those families were asleep at the switch. That is why we passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with one mission: to protect consumers, to stand up for bank customers, homeowners, servicemembers and veterans, student loan borrowers and seniors, and all the millions of Americans who, when it comes to the financial marketplace, need somebody on their side.  With these transactions that people do in an increasingly complex financial world, with all the fine print and all the documents people sign to buy a home or get a credit card or sign up for an account with a bank or insurance company, the public needs somebody on their side. They need someone to look out for them who is not obedient to the Wall Street bottom line.  Some in this body have tried to roll back the Dodd-Frank rules that protect taxpayers and homeowners from Wall Street abuses. It is all the more important that Americans have a strong, independent consumer protection bureau on their side.  The Bureau's actions have resulted in $12 billion in relief for more than 29 million American consumers who had been ripped off by debt collectors, for-profit colleges, and payday lenders. Some were cheated by almost iconic American companies, such as Wells Fargo and  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has a special Office of Servicemember Affairs run by Holly They took on the payday lenders and car title lenders that targeted servicemembers on military bases across the country. I know firsthand. I know up close how they do that. At Wright-Patterson Air Force Base--the largest single site employer in the State of Ohio, near Dayton--the predators, payday lenders, and financial service predators set up shop right outside the base. They can't set up shop on the base. They prey on people who are a little less sophisticated financially. They don't have a lot of money, they are young, and in many cases, they are servicemembers who aren't paid very well and are already struggling. For somebody who is overseas--they prey on the spouse when the person is overseas. They prey on them, and when they are overseas, they prey on their families.  Even Sheila Bair, a former George Bush appointee, was on TV this morning talking about how important this agency's work is to working families.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been able to do all this because it is not beholden to Wall Street, special interests, and is not beholden to the people in this body. It is strong because it is independent.  The people in this body who want to take away the CFPB say that it is a bureaucracy that is not accountable to anybody. Do you know what they mean? When I hear my friends in the Banking Committee say that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is not accountable to anybody, what do they mean? They mean the banks can't influence them, the big Wall Street officials can't influence them, the Members of Congress who shill for the banks can't influence them, and the Members of Congress who front for the big Wall Street firms can't influence them. That is what they mean when they say it is not accountable. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau[[Page S7328]]is accountable to the public. It is accountable to the people who get hurt by some of these financial transactions.  A couple of weeks ago, the administration sent the Vice President down here under the cover of night. We know that when the Vice President comes down here to the Senate floor, it is about to be a victory for Wall Street, and that is what happened. The Vice President came here to the Senate floor under the cover of night to overturn a consumer bureau rule that would have guaranteed that hard-working Americans get their day in court when cheated by a big bank. The Vice President comes in and breaks a tie, and consumers lose, but Wall Street wins. Wall Street is indebted to this Vice  Now the administration ignores the law and hands over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to a person who doesn't even think it should exist. The man they want running this consumer watchdog bureau has said that the agency ``is a sick, sad joke.'' He voted to repeal it.  I guess that is why he thinks he could do this job part time. The President sent a member of his Cabinet who already has a full-time job at the Office of Management and Budget to also run the consumer bureau at the same time. I have never heard of anything quite like that, but he is a reliable Wall Street crony who will do the bidding for Wall Street and do everything he can if he gets the chance to undercut it.  When he says it is a sick, sad joke, it is no joke to the people who have been cheated by Wall It is no joke to the tens of thousands of servicemembers who rely on the consumer bureau to fight for them against bankruptcy. Think about that. Think about these banks that prey on servicemembers--19, 20, 25-year-old men and women who are serving their country. Some of them are overseas. Their spouses are raising the kids, struggling every day on a servicemember's pay. The banks have abused them. Who stood up for them? It wasn't Members of Congress who stood up for them; it was the Consumer Financial Protection That is why they are there. It was no joke to the 29 million American consumers who have money in their pockets now because the consumer bureau stood by them. It is no joke that in his first act today, Mulvaney says he wants to put an end to payments to working families who have been cheated by banks and financial institutions.  We need this agency to be able to continue its work fighting back against Wall Street abuses and fighting for the American people. Americans need a full-time cop on the beat with a proven track record of fighting for them, not a part-time Director who has another job in the President's Cabinet--who ever heard of such a thing?--especially since that part-time Director had a reputation when he was in Congress down the hall. Now that he is in the President's Cabinet, he has a record of working for Wall  In 2016, Candidate Trump said: ``[T]his election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.'' If President Trump wants to keep that promise, he should take his own advice. He should allow the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to carry out its mission to protect American consumers, free of Wall Street special interests. You don't drain the swamp by putting a toady from Wall Street into the consumer bureau to do the bidding of Wall It is pretty darn simple.  The President has a chance to stand beside the American people. He told us last year that he would drain the swamp, stand up to special interest groups, and that he would punish Wall Street if Wall Street overreached. He should keep that promise. He should allow the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to continue doing its work.  Anyone who stands on the side of hard-working Americans should make it clear that they support Deputy Director English as the Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection It is about whose side you are on.

Right now, the law treats those who make loans on manufactured houses similarly to those who are refinancing mortgages on their homes. The reality is that these are completely different transactions.  Buying a $20,000 manufactured home is simply not the same as financing a $200,000 home with a 30-year mortgage. The borrower is in a different position with very different needs. The lender is making a loan that is often secured differently for a much smaller amount, but with similar paperwork and similar costs.  The Federal Government, since Dodd-Frank, has been treating both of these transactions similarly from a regulation perspective. It has hurt borrowers trying to buy a piece of their American  In The Wall Street Journal, lenders suggested that they would not make these loans if they continued to suffer under this faulty regulation scenario.

Mr.Speaker, Durham has always been a progressive city, a city where I attended undergraduate school and law school at North Carolina Central Durham has always been a progressive city, above the average, but under Bill Bell's leadership, the city has become a thriving Southern city rivaling Charlotte and even Atlanta,  Bill Bell's work as mayor is but part of a long tenure of service to Durham that spans more than four decades. This week, I join the entire Durham community in thanking Mayor Bill Bell for his many, many years of public service. With Mayor Bell's retirement last evening, December 4, 2017, he leaves his office having literally transformed the Durham community.  The city's leadership has now been passed to a new mayor, Steve Schewel, who is also a friend and a visionary leader. The city of Durham, North Carolina, is in good hands.  Born William Bell in 1941, Bill grew up in Winston-Salem, North He received a degree in electrical engineering from Howard University here in Washington, D.C., and then went on to receive his master's degree in electrical engineering from New York After graduating, Bill returned to North Carolina, where he worked as a senior engineer at IBM Corporation in  Bill Bell has been a community development trailblazer not only as mayor, but as vice president and chief operating officer of United Durham Incorporated since 1996, where he used the acronym  Even during his days as a young engineer, Bill Bell had a unique vision for his beloved community. This vision led to Bill's election to the Durham County Board of Commissioners in 1972. At the time, Bill was one of two African-American commissioners on the five-member board. Bill Bell served on the board of county commissioners until 1994, and again from 1996 to the year 2000, even serving as its chairman from 1982 to 1994.                              {time}  1015  In 2001, Mr.Speaker, Bill Bell was elected mayor of the city of He was then reelected seven--yes, that is seven--times, serving as Durham's longest serving mayor for 16 years.  Mayor Bill Bell will be remembered for leading the city of Durham toward great progress. His legacy includes heading up the transformation of downtown Durham from boarded-up windows to a city which is a top destination and is now home to a variety of thriving businesses and technology startups as well as major projects, such as the Durham Performing Arts Center and the American Tobacco  It is a thriving city, Mr.Speaker, and I encourage anyone to take a look at Durham and see how impressive this city is. From leading the transformation of downtown Durham to placing a renewed emphasis on even addressing gun violence in the community, Mayor Bell has always fought to improve the lives of his constituents.  It has been a pleasure to work with Mayor Bell on behalf of the citizens of Durham in the first district. The Durham community is stronger thanks to Bill Bell's leadership. He is, without a doubt, a visionary trailblazer who will go down in history having left a positive mark on his city.  Yesterday, Mr.Speaker, Mayor Bill Bell turned over the office now to Mayor Steve Mayor Schewel served on the Durham City Council since 2011, and I know he will continue to build on this legacy.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, I am told that Mayor Bell's daughters, Tiffany Bell, Anjanee Nicole Bell, and Kristen Vaughan Bell-Hughes, are all excited about their dad's decision to enjoy a life of retirement. I don't believe Bill Bell is going to actually retire. I am sure he is going to spend less time in public service, but I am sure he will continue his advocacy in some significant way.

170,topic-id,1308,"Mr.President, I come to the floor with my colleague from Maryland to talk about the State and local tax deduction.  I thank the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee for his hard work on trying to articulate what is fair tax policy for Senator Wyden and I come from parts of the country with probably some of the most unique tax codes. He doesn't have a sales tax in We don't have an income tax in  We are not an expensive tax We are not an expensive tax There are other States such as Texas, Nevada, and Florida that also don't have an income tax. Under this bill, those States and the citizens of those States, like many others, are going to be penalized. Middle-class Americans are going to have their taxes raised to give a tax break to corporations.  So while we might want to discuss what is fair tax policy as it relates to the competitiveness of our economy, the good news for the people of the State of Washington is that we have very competitive businesses, whether it is Microsoft or Amazon or Starbucks or Costco or They are all working hard. They are all working in multiple places, and yes, they are all doing really, really well.  The question is, Do we need to reduce their corporate rate so significantly, and to do so, take money out of the pockets of middle-class families across the United States of America?  The reason I mention Senator Wyden and the States of Oregon and Washington, is that, even though we have a unique tax code, our State's economy has grown faster than the national average every year since World War That is to say, the uniqueness of our tax code has not hurt us, and yet in the State of Washington we have had the highest minimum wage for a long time in the United Now we are raising it in various parts of our We have had a unique view of where our revenue should come from.  Why now? Why now? After 100 years of tax deductibility by taxpayers in this country, why are you taking away their ability to deduct only to give a tax break to corporations that are making record profits? After 100 years, why are you doing this?  Well, I think some of my colleagues have said it best. They have called it double-taxation. You are going ahead after 100 years and saying it is OK to tax the same amount that we pay to the State that you also are going to tax at the Federal level. As one article mentioned, ``Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers said the Federal Government might try to monopolize taxation to the entire exclusion and destruction of State governments.''  That is right. Our Founding Fathers said: Do not have double taxation. So for 100 years--100 years--we protected the citizens of this country. Yet someone over there is thinking: Do you know what? I need $1.4 trillion. Where can I get it? Let's do it on the backs of middle-class families, because they might not notice until 2019 when their tax bill comes and they have a different equation.  I get that my colleagues think they have solved this problem by getting rid of the deductions and now all of a sudden giving you a double standard deduction. I have done the math. I have done the math for us in Washington State, and over 300,000 people in Washington will see their taxes go up immediately, probably paying anywhere from $750 to $1,000 more in taxes. Is that fair? They are sitting in the shadow of these large companies who are making record profits and doing quite well, asking why are they the funders of this tax break. Why are they? Why are we getting rid of a policy that has existed in our country for over 100 years and penalizing them just to give this corporate break?  I can tell you I don't buy the notion that this is going to trickle down to productivity and wage growth. I know what is driving productivity and wage growth in my It is a great, educated, skilled workforce. It is staying ahead of innovation whether it is making software or new ways of doing business, and, yes, it is a constant challenge. Those businesses tell me all the time we need more infrastructure, we need more affordable housing, we need a better transportation system, we need better education. So they are very concerned about the ideas in this legislation.  So you are going to tax immediately about 300,000 Washingtonians with a higher tax rate and, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation and other entities, probably by the time this is done, at the end of this bill, over a million Washingtonians are going to pay more money. That is why I am so concerned, along with other States that have been fighting this battle for so long. Why now? Why now? What is the urgency that you are taking away the ability of my citizens to deduct their local sales tax, their property tax, and, in the House case, other expenses, whether they are medical or education or their mortgage? It is just beyond me, when the middle class has suffered so much and has not recovered from the downturn in the economy, that you think the best economic strategy is to take money out of the middle-class taxpayer.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the National Governors Association from Governor Sandoval from I mentioned they don't have an income tax. They are highly sensitive to this issue.[[Page S7662]]  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               National Governors Association,                                               September 22, 2017.     Richard Neal,     Ranking Member, Committee on Ways & Means, U.Senate,          Washington,       Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Schumer,      Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi, Chairman Hatch, Ranking      Member Wyden, Chairman Brady, and Ranking Member Neal: The      nation's governors appreciate congressional efforts to reform      and improve federal tax policy. Federal and state tax systems      are complex and often interconnected. Therefore, as Congress      considers reforms, we urge you to maintain the balance      between state and federal tax systems by preserving the      income exclusion for municipal bond interest and the      deductibility for state and local taxes.       The financing engine that drives U.infrastructure is the      $3.8 trillion municipal bond market. Changes to federal laws      and regulations should not increase issuance costs to states      for municipal bonds or diminish investor demand for them. If      federal changes make issuing municipal bonds cost-prohibitive      for states and local governments, then fewer projects could      be funded, taxes could rise, fewer jobs created, and economic      growth will suffer.       Governors also believe that no federal law or regulation      should preempt, limit, or interfere with the sovereign rights      of states. A mark of sovereignty includes the ability to      develop and operate revenue and tax systems. Deductibility of      state and local taxes has contributed to the stability of      state revenues that are essential for providing public      services. We encourage you to avoid changes to the tax code      that would undermine the ability of state and local      governments to meet the needs of the citizens whom we all      serve.       Eliminating state and local tax deductibility, moreover,      exposes a higher share of an itemizing taxpayer's income to      federal taxation because it adds back mandatory payments of      state and local taxes already paid, as taxable income.       Federal tax reform requires an intergovernmental      partnership because decisions at the federal level will      affect state and local governments profoundly. We look      forward to working with Congress on bipartisan tax reform to      maintain balance between our systems and modernize the      federal tax system to meet the needs of our citizens.           Sincerely,     Brian Sandoval,       NGA     Steve Bullock,       NGA Vice  ",CREC-2017-12-01-pt1-PgS7655-2.txt,172,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,1,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So the notion that we have the National Governors Association, the homebuilders, the Realtors, so many people concerned about this is falling on deaf ears. I guarantee you it will not fall on deaf ears when the citizens have a chance to respond to this.  The notion that we not only are taking away this ability to deduct, but we are also in this legislation making a change to the way inflation is calculated, what is called Chained CPI--I am not going to bother to explain the details to you, but I will tell you this. It will change your tax bracket, and you will be in a higher tax bracket. So besides giving you less deductibility, they are changing a formula and making you pay more taxes.  This bill needs to slow down. It needs to focus on what will help our economy grow, and economists don't believe this bill is going to do much to help the economy grow. It is going to give those corporations money to pay for dividends. Seventy-five to eighty percent will go to their shareholders, and those shareholders and the stock market will do well.  What we also need to focus on is the investment that middle-class families need to stay in their home, to make education affordable, to pay for healthcare, and to have communities work.

I thought they were there to protect the uniqueness of the Tax Code to say that States have rights, to say that States ought to be able to decide their own future.

391,topic-id,3364,"Mr.President, my amendment strikes the title requiring oil development in the Arctic National Wildlife This refuge is the largest refuge in our Nation and the last pristine ecosystem for the Arctic in North  Requiring oil development in the heart of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge should not be in this bill.  Although the bill text has been changed to address Byrd Rule violations, the Congressional Budget Office continues to estimate that it will raise less than $1 billion over 10 years.  Opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling doesn't even meet the $1 billion reconciliation instruction.  It certainly doesn't represent a serious offset to huge deficits in the Republican bill.  To put this in perspective, this represents less than seven one-hundredths of 1 percent of the $1.5-trillion-dollar increase in the national debt that the Republican tax policies will cause.  Drilling in the Arctic has nothing to do with serious budgetary policy, but it has everything to do with evading regular order to pass something that could never be enacted on its own.  In addition to drilling in the Arctic refuge, this bill would sell 7 million barrels of oil from our Nation's strategic petroleum reserve.  A portion of that sale is necessary simply to meet the committee's reconciliation instructions. The sale of oil from the reserve would also provide for a $300 million windfall to four States: Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and  So this bill is selling off oil from our strategic petroleum reserve in order to pay for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife  It doesn't make any sense.  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the crown jewels of the national wildlife refuge system.  The U.Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the refuge, describes it as ``the only conservation system unit that protects, in an undisturbed condition, a complete spectrum of the arctic ecosystems in North America.''  It is home to an incredible diversity of wildlife: 47 different species of mammals, including polar bears, grizzly bears, wolves, Dall's sheep, moose, musk-ox, and the Porcupine caribou herd.  The refuge provides important habitat for over 40 species of fish and more than 200 species of migratory birds whose lives depend on the Arctic refuge.  The refuge was first established by the Eisenhower administration. Congress later protected this amazing Arctic ecosystem in 1980. It did so specifically to protect wildlife and wildlife habitat in its natural diversity.  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is known as the Last Great Wilderness and is truly one of our last great wild places.  But the provisions of this bill turn the purpose of the Arctic refuge on its head.  It would make oil and gas development on the refuge's coastal plain one of the statutory purposes of the wildlife refuge.  Under this bill, our Nation's most pristine national wildlife refuge will become the only refuge where oil and gas development is required by law.  It opens up the entire 1.5-million-acre coastal plain for oil and gas exploration and requires leasing of at least 800,000 acres.  It requires leasing of areas with the highest oil and gas potential, no matter the consequences for wildlife or the environment.  The bill requires that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge be managed as a petroleum reserve, which is unprecedented and undercuts managing the refuge for wildlife.  The bill includes no clear requirements to comply with environmental laws or to protect wildlife. Its sponsors, however, say they are not preempting environmental laws, and that, in fact, laws like the National Environmental Policy Act will ``fully apply.''  Given the assurances that environmental and wildlife refuge laws will continue to apply, I do not understand why their bill adds oil development as a purpose of the Arctic National Wildlife  Adding oil development as a purpose of the refuge seems contrary to its primary purpose, which is to protect wildlife.  What a no-brainer: The purpose of a wildlife refuge is to protect wildlife. Refuges must be managed that way.  At every other national wildlife refuge in the country, development within the refuge is only permitted to the extent it is compatible with the primary purpose of the refuge: protecting wildlife.  But because the bill makes oil and gas development a refuge purpose, oil drilling in the refuge will no longer be subject to a meaningful ``compatibility determination.''  This bill essentially waives one of the most important management protections that applies to every other national wildlife refuge.  They have to do this because they know that oil and gas isn't compatible with protecting wildlife--it is just the opposite.  This bill does not provide energy security. There is no prohibition in the bill against exporting oil from the Arctic refuge. In all likelihood, much of this oil will end up being exported.  The Republican majority agreed to include only one amendment during the Energy Committee's consideration of this issue, and that amendment required the sale of 5 million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve to give $300 million to the States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and  The bill has now been amended to require the sale of 7 million barrels from our strategic petroleum reserve.  So at the same time as we are being told we need to ruin a pristine national wildlife refuge to drill for more oil, the very same bill is selling off millions of barrels out of our strategic oil reserve, which was used most recently during this hurricane season to protect Americans from gas price spikes.  The impact of oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the danger to its wildlife cannot be overstated. The importance of the refuge for wildlife such as polar bears and caribou have been documented in letters I have received from biologists and other scientists who have worked in the  I ask unanimous consent that the letters be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   The Jane Goodall Institute,                                                November 14, 2017.       Dear United States Senator: It seems that each day brings      ever more dire news about what we humans are doing to harm[[Page S7708]]     our planet, the animals that share it with us and, by doing      so, harming ourselves also. You have an important opportunity      to make a difference both now, and for future generations, by      voting to oppose oil development in one of the world's most      spectacular wilderness areas--the Arctic National Wildlife            This Refuge is a truly wonderful place--nearly 20 million      acres of pristine and ecologically significant habitat. There      is compelling scientific evidence as to why it is truly      important to protect this place. For one thing, it provides      key breeding habitat for the millions-upon-millions of birds      that migrate there from six of our planet's seven continents.      It is also a calving ground for the 200,000-strong Porcupine      caribou herd. And it is one of the most important denning      habitats on earth for polar bears. Moreover it plays a      significant role in helping to protect us from the onslaught      of climate change.       But the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is more than that.      Its very wildness speaks to our deeply rooted spiritual      connection to nature, a necessary element of the human      psyche. The Gwich'in people understand this and call the area      ``The Sacred Place Where Life Begins''.       If we violate the Arctic Refuge by extracting the oil      beneath the land, this will have devastating impact for the      Gwich'in people for they depend upon the caribou herds to      sustain their traditional way of life. Around the globe so      many indigenous people have been harmed in the name of      `progress'--let us not add one more tragedy to the list. We      have other sources of energy.       And so I beg you: Please use your voice and your vote as a      U.Senator to protect the Gwich'in people and the American      treasure that is the Arctic National Wildlife       America has helped lead the world in the conservation of      wildlife and your voice has been so meaningful in this      regard, your example so powerful. Please take this      opportunity to demonstrate your commitment to the natural      world and to future generations and stand with me to protect      the Arctic National Wildlife       Please vote against oil development in the Arctic National      Wildlife           Sincerely,                                     Jane Goodall, DBE, Ph.D.,                              Founder--the Jane Goodall Institute,     & UN Messenger of                                  ____                                                November 26, 2017.     Maria Cantwell,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,          U.Senate, Washington,       Dear Senator Cantwell: Research across North America      including Alaska has revealed much about how we can monitor      and mitigate the effects of industrial activities on      migratory tundra caribou. We have learnt that, although the      Prudhoe Bay oilfield displaced calving and post-calving      caribou of the Central Arctic herd, the effects were offset      by reduced hunting. Consequently the herd increased but      between 2010 and 2016 the herd is declining at the rate of      halving every 4 years. We have also learnt that industrial      activities including roads can displace caribou by larger      distances than previously realized.       Caribou across North America are part of a global decline.      The Porcupine herd is the only herd of migratory tundra      caribou in North America that is not currently declining. It      has the diversity of ranges and habitats that allow the      caribou to respond to the changing climate by choosing the      best habitats for their survival. This is true for calving as      the PCH calves in the 1002 area and the western Canadian      coastal plain depending on weather. The coastal plains are so      narrow that even a small footprint for oil and gas activities      may be too much for the caribou already trying to adapt to a      changing climate.       The Porcupine herd is jointly managed between the Alaska      Department of Fish and Game (ADFG), the US Fish and Wildlife      Service (USFWS), and the Yukon, NWT and Canadian governments.      Collaboration on monitoring and research has been coordinated      by the Porcupine Caribou Technical Committee, a group      recognized in the International Porcupine Caribou Agreement      signed by Canada and the US in 1987.       The question is not just what would development in 1002      lands mean to caribou but it is what it means to the people      in USA and Canada who depend on the caribou. Faced with      uncertainty about the caribou, the cautionary approach is to      do no harm until we have a better understanding. The oil and      gas is secure in the ground; the caribou and the people are      not.

Maria Cantwell,     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,          U.Senate, Washington,       Dear Senator Cantwell: I've studied polar bears for 37      years--solving many of the mysteries about their life cycle.      I led polar bear research in Alaska for 30 years, and my      research team at the USGS provided the information that led      Interior Secretary Kempthorne to list polar bears as a      threatened species. I am currently the chief scientist at      Polar Bears       I am reaching out today because I'm concerned about the      likely impacts on Alaska's polar bears should the Arctic      National Wildlife Refuge be opened to oil and gas      development.       The ANWR coastal plain is vitally important to polar bears.      Pregnant female polar bears head to this area every fall to      create snow dens where they give birth to their young. In      fact, the region has higher concentrations of polar bear      maternal denning habitat than other coastal areas on Alaska's      North In recent years, the ANWR has become even more      important as a polar bear denning site because the      deterioration of historically stable sea ice in the Beaufort      Sea has forced more polar bears to den onshore, rather than      risk giving birth on unstable ice.       In addition to the ANWR's importance as a critical denning      area for polar bears, the region faces profound impacts from      climate change unless we transition away from fossil fuels.      Warmer temperatures mean less sea ice habitat, which polar      bears rely on to catch their seal prey. In addition,      encouraging more fossil fuel usage, as opening the ANWR would      do, will only add to ongoing global warming.       If we continue to follow a ``business as usual'' reliance      on fossil fuels, average annual temperatures in Alaska's      Arctic are projected to be more than 10 degrees Celsius (18      degrees Fahrenheit) higher, at century's end, than they are      now. Such high temperatures would assure ice-free summers in      the Arctic, with devastating impacts on polar bears and other      Arctic wildlife. And, of course, ramifications reach the rest      of life on Earth--including humans.       With ``on the ground'' drilling activities posing a threat      to polar bear denning sites, and prolonged reliance on fossil      fuels continuing to melt the sea ice polar bears need to      catch their prey, oil and gas development in the ANWR would      serve a double whammy. Opening the ANWR to drilling,      therefore, is a path we should avoid--for the sake of polar      bears, our children, and our grandchildren.           Respectfully,                                            Steven Amstrup,                                                  Chief Scientist,     Polar Bears                                  ____                                                 November 9, 2017.     Lisa Murkowski,     Maria Cantwell, Ranking Member     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,     U.Senate, Washington,       Dear Senators Murkowski and Cantwell: As scientists who      have either conducted research in Arctic Alaska or traveled      in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we are writing to      highlight for you the fundamental importance of fully      protecting its 1.5-million acre coastal plain. Based on our      experience in the Arctic, we oppose oil exploration,      development and production in the Arctic Such      activity would be incompatible with the purposes for which      the refuge was established, including ``to conserve fish and      wildlife populations and habitats in their natural      diversity.''       When the original Arctic National Wildlife Range was      established in 1960 by the Eisenhower Administration, it was      done with the foresight and wisdom to protect an entire      ecosystem, both south and north of the Brooks Range,      including the rich coastal plain. Decades of biological study      and scientific research within the Arctic Refuge have      confirmed that the coastal plain specifically is vital to the      biological diversity of the entire refuge. Within the narrow      (15-40 miles) coastal plain, there is a unique compression of      habitats which concentrates a wide array of wildlife native      to the Arctic, including polar bears, grizzly bears, wolves,      wolverines, caribou, musk oxen, Dolly Varden char, Arctic      grayling, and many species of migratory birds. In fact,      according to the U.Fish and Wildlife Service, the Arctic      Refuge coastal plain contains the greatest wildlife diversity      of any protected area above the Arctic       In 2003, the National Research Council (NRC) published a      report on the ``Cumulative Environmental Effects of Oil and      Gas Activities on Alaska's North Slope.'' Led by Gordon      Orians, University of Washington, this report was prepared by      a panel of prominent scientists following an extensive review      of the literature and consultations with experts. It remains      the best, most comprehensive synthesis of the effects of oil      development on wildlife and the landscape of Arctic      Among the report's ``major findings'' (Chapter 11) are the      following:       Three-dimensional seismic surveys require a high spatial      density of trails. ``Seismic exploration can damage      vegetation and cause erosion, especially along stream      banks.''       The effects of roads, pads, pipelines, and other      infrastructure extend far beyond the physical footprint      itself, and the distances at which impacts occur vary with      the environmental component affected. ``Effects on hydrology,      vegetation, and animal populations occur at distances up to      several kilometers . . .''       ``Roads have had effects as far-reaching and complex as any      physical component of the North Slope oil fields.''[[Page S7709]]       Denning polar bears are among the animals that ``have been      affected by industrial activities on the North Slope.''       Readily available food supplies in the oil fields attract      higher-than-normal densities of predators, which then prey on      birds and their eggs and young. The reproductive success rate      of some bird species in the developed parts of oil fields      ``has been reduced to the extent that it is insufficient to      balance mortality.''       The spread of industrial activity, especially to the east      where the coastal plain is narrower than elsewhere [i.e., the      Arctic Refuge], ``would likely result in reductions in      reproductive success'' for caribou.       Although oilfield technologies continue to improve, the      NRC's findings are still of concern today. Indeed, proposals      that would limit the ``footprint'' of oil development to      2,000 acres on the coastal plain within the Arctic Refuge are      of little value, since those acres may be spread over much of      the coastal plain. This would be especially true if oil      reserves are scattered in multiple pockets across the refuge,      as is suggested by the U.Geological Survey (Fact Sheet      0028-01). Since the effects of industrial activities,      starting with seismic surveys, are not limited to the      footprint of a structure or to its immediate vicinity, it is      highly likely that such activities would result in      significant impacts on a variety of wildlife in the refuge's      narrow coastal plain.       Development of yet another oilfield would further set back      efforts to limit the carbon emissions that are fueling the      dramatic changes in climate now affecting Polar      bears--listed as ``threatened'' under the Endangered Species      Act--are already struggling with deteriorating sea ice and      increasingly are forced to den on land on the eastern      Beaufort Sea coast, including the coastal plain of the Arctic      In fact, three-fourths of the refuge coastal plain is      designated as critical habitat for polar bears, which are      highly vulnerable to disturbance due to oil and gas      activities.       The NRC report and subsequent work done in Arctic Alaska      strongly indicate that the cumulative impact of many      seemingly small changes is significant. New development on      the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge, one of the nation's      and planet's premier protected areas, will only contribute to      these harmful impacts on wildlife. For all these reasons, we      oppose oil and gas exploration, development and production on      the coastal plain of the Arctic       Thank you for your consideration.

392,topic-id,426,"The Arctic Refuge's coastal plain and nearby waters are designated as critical habitat for polar bears, which were designated as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act in 2008. Female polar bears head to this area every fall to create snow dens where they give birth to their young.  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is also famously known as the summer calving grounds for the Porcupine caribou herd. The herd's range extends into A treaty between our countries protects the herd and its habitat.  The almost 200,000-member herd has an annual migration of hundreds of miles--and in some cases thousands of miles--wintering south of the refuge.  These caribou are an important food source for many Alaska Natives, but in particular the Gwich'in people, who live south of the refuge. Wildlife biologists argue that the risk to the caribou herd--and those who rely on this herd--could be quite significant.  Do you know what Webster's definition of stewardship is? The careful and responsible management of something entrusted to one's care. Since 1960, under President Eisenhower, this iconic refuge has been protected. Tonight, unless you help strike this, you will be joining the ranks of those that believe in polluting a wildlife refuge, and you will be joining an administration that I guarantee you is going to go down in history as getting an F in stewardship.  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is too special and important; it is one of the crown jewels of the National Wildlife Refuge  We should not destroy this pristine landscape and allow it to be turned into an oil field.  I want to remind my colleagues of the words of the great environmental steward Olaus  After decades of scientific exploration in Alaska, Olaus testified in the Senate in 1959 in support of creating the Arctic refuge.  He said, ``We long for something more, something that has a mental, a spiritual impact on us. This idealism, more than anything else, will set us apart as a nation striving for something worthwhile in the universe.''  What is setting us apart today, colleagues, is just the opposite. We are striving for short-term gains.  In a hundred years, when the economic effects of this tax bill are long forgotten, we will still bear the blame for letting go of ``something worthwhile in the universe.''  We didn't create the Arctic coastal plain, and we cannot recreate, but we can surely destroy it.  I urge my colleagues to oppose sacrificing the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and to support removing this provision from the bill.  I yield the floor.

1640,topic-id,1645,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to voice my very strong support for the tax reform legislation that will come before the U.Senate this week.  This bill will power economic growth and provide great opportunities for American workers. It will lead to increased wages, and it will help our small businesses expand. I have said often on the Senate floor that small businesses in West Virginia comprise 95 percent of the businesses in West Virginia and over 50 percent of the workforce. Small businesses want to thrive, and they want to expand.  It will provide much needed tax relief for middle-class working families in my State and across the Nation, and for many in the working class, the increase in the standard deduction will lower rates and provide for a much simpler process. I have talked about this on the floor a lot. I think that one of the things that is underemphasized and not talked about in this great tax relief package is the simplification model that many Americans really want and deserve in the Tax So let's talk about our State of West  In my State of West Virginia, 83 percent of individual tax filers take the standard deduction--83 percent. This bill will nearly double that deduction--from $6,300 to $12,000 for an individual and from $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples. That is for 83 percent of the filers in my State of West For West Virginians who are already taking the current standard deduction, this provision means less taxable income and lower tax bills--more money in their pockets at the end of the day that they have earned.  Others who itemize will find that they are actually better off with the increased standard deduction. At tax time, they will make the determination: Should I take the standard deduction? I used to itemize in the past. They may make the determination: I am really better off taking the standard deduction because it is almost doubling. That is what I am going to do. That means that they will benefit financially and avoid the complications that come along with itemizing.  Families with children will benefit from the child tax credit that is doubled. This will provide real help to working families who are trying to afford education costs, pay rent or their mortgages, and simply make it to the end of the month. Whether they want to put money aside for their futures or they need money to get through the[[Page S7383]]tough child care or health costs, more money is a significant factor in a lot of people's families. They are working hard, and they want and deserve more money.  I was interested in an editorial that was in my local newspaper today, written in a negative way about this bill. It is funny, but it is not humorous. It actually does not mention the 83 percent of West Virginia earners who are going to be having the benefits of this simply by doubling the standard deduction and by doubling the child tax credit.  This bill also eliminates the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate, which is a penalty that mainly impacts the middle class. Let's talk about this. In 2015, more than 34,000 West Virginians were penalized under this mandate, and 81 percent of those people--81 percent of the 34,000 people--who were penalized with a tax penalty, because they could not afford to buy insurance or they chose not to, were assessed a tax penalty for that decision. That 81 percent earns under $50,000 a year.  There has been a lot of misinformation about this provision, so let me just clarify. No one is being forced off of Medicaid or a private health insurance plan by the elimination of the individual mandate. By eliminating the individual mandate, we are simply stopping penalizing and taxing people who either cannot afford or decide not to buy health insurance plans. I, for one, want everyone to purchase and be able to purchase a health insurance plan, but that is a personal decision, at the end of the day, that a family makes. If you opt not to purchase, which I hope you would not, your government shouldn't be taxing you, and that is what has happened.  Working families will also benefit from the higher wages and increased opportunity that this bill will create. The Tax Foundation found that this bill will create more than 4,900 jobs in the State of West It doesn't sound like much, I guess, to a larger Yet, to a small State, almost 5,000 jobs is significant. A typical middle-class family in our State would see its after-tax income grow by over $1,900. Nationwide, this bill could create as many as 925,000 jobs in this analysis, which is significant. These new jobs and higher wages result, in part, from lower tax rates and the shift to a territorial system.  This will make America more competitive. We want our jobs to be competitive not just here but globally. I mean, let's face it. We are in a global economy. Many of the companies, particularly the larger companies that are employing over 30 percent of West Virginia workers, are competing globally. If we can make it more competitive for those businesses to compete globally, that is going to mean higher wages, more jobs, and more products that will be made here in the United States with our American workers.  Quite frankly, our current system is driving American companies and jobs overseas. The United States has the highest statutory corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. That drives behavior when you look at investing. After 30 years--30 years ago was the last time we modernized this--it is past time to modernize our business Tax Code and make America more competitive--hire more people, raise wages, buy more equipment, and invest more capital. We know by estimates--and some of these say they are conservative--that there is more than $2 trillion--with a ``t''--in U.corporate earnings that is kept overseas. This tax reform package can bring those resources home, which will lead, again, to more jobs and higher wages here at home.  It is important that communities across our country benefit from this growing economy. Half of our Nation's job growth since 2010--almost 8 years ago--has occurred in only 2 percent of the counties across this country. I will add that none of those counties are in the State of West That demonstrates to me the need to help lower income areas attract more jobs and investment. That is why I am very glad to support this tax reform bill, because it includes a provision called the Investing in Opportunity Act that Senator Tim Scott, of South Carolina, introduced and that I was proud to cosponsor. This bill is designed, as a part of this tax reform bill, to attract investment into areas that have been left behind in our Nation's economic recovery, including areas in my State of West Virginia that continue to struggle in the wake of the Obama administration's anti-coal policies.  Besides making the Tax Code more competitive and helping to create and attract investment in economically distressed areas, this bill will also help our small businesses. We know that small businesses are a major economic driver in our economy. As I said earlier, half of West Virginia's workforce in the private sector is employed in small businesses, and this bill will provide significantly needed tax relief to our small businesses.  I have been traveling across the State, listening to those at small business roundtables, and talking to a lot of people. What I have heard is that small businesses are eager to take the tax relief they get and raise wages so that they can keep their good employees. They want to pay them more. They want to hire additional workers so that they can expand their work or buy new equipment. I met with a communications company that wants to invest in more These investments will have a positive effect on the economy in local communities across the country--those that are not in that 2 percent that have had the growth over the last 8 years.  I believe that this tax reform bill will help the Nation as a whole and the people I represent. I am excited to have this bill on the floor of the U.Senate this week.  The Senate Finance Committee, of which the Presiding Officer is a terrific member and is from the neighboring State of Pennsylvania, has held over 70 hearings on tax reform and has put together a very good piece of legislation. It has held over 70 hearings and an amendment process and has listened to many constituents and many individuals who will be impacted by this. The House has acted. President Trump stands ready to sign a tax reform measure into law. What remains now is for the Senate to do its work--for us to do our work--and pass this legislation. Some Senators will have a choice. Soon, Senators will make a choice. We can accept the slow economic growth that has occurred over the past decade or we can take big and bold action.  To my colleagues, I say, if you want to help the middle class benefit from tax cuts, higher wages, and more job opportunities, then you should vote for this bill. If you want America to become more competitive in the global economy, then you should vote for this bill. If you want small businesses to expand and thrive, then you should vote for this bill. Our country needs this, and our constituents are demanding it. I call on my colleagues to join me in passing this bill on the Senate floor this week.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Toomey). The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

It eliminates critical deductions that help central coast families, including deductions for State and local taxes, mortgage interest, student loans, and medical expenses.  With wildfire season in California growing longer each year, this bill callously eliminates tax relief for personal casualty losses resulting from wildfires as well as earthquakes. In fact, this bill would raise taxes on 36 million working and middle class taxpayers by an average of $1,130 a year.  With a national debt that has now surpassed $20 trillion, the American people cannot afford this tax bill that adds $1.5 trillion to the deficit and leaves our children stuck with the bill.

Unfortunately, I am here to remind all of us, Mr.Speaker, that it really is a tax scam.

146,topic-id,818,"Mr.President, I urge my colleagues to support this motion.  This motion will send H.1 back to the Committee on Finance with instructions to return it within 3 days to deal with one of the principal purposes of this act, and that is to create jobs. I am pleased that I am joined in this effort by Senators Feinstein, Blumenthal, Udall, Casey, Stabenow, Klobuchar, and  As I explained yesterday--but I want to just go over this, if I could--this particular motion is based upon a bipartisan recommendation in the last Congress that came out of the Senate Finance We had working groups that took a look at the different aspects of our Tax Code in areas that we need to reform, and there was general agreement that we need to deal with the fact that American companies have earned earnings overseas, and they have parked those funds overseas and have not brought them back to the United States because of the differential tax rates between our corporate taxes and the tax rates overseas. The American companies were not willing to pay the taxes. So, therefore, they leave the money overseas. To bring that money back is called repatriation. So the money comes back to the United We have done this before, and we imposed a lower tax rate in order to get the money back here in the United  The challenge with that proposal is a couple things. But, first, it is not a permanent revenue flow. It is a one-time-only revenue flow. We had the numbers on the House-passed bill, which would bring in somewhere around $300 billion of one-time-only revenue.  The problem is that H.1 includes provisions that use those revenues that bring that in as repatriation but uses the money on a permanent basis to give permanent tax relief to businesses and that puts us deeper in a hole as it relates to the deficit of this country.  This bill already is too expensive. We know that. I think my Republican colleagues know that. The American public knows that--that it will add to the deficit. We now have not only the scores that we traditionally use from the Joint Committee on Taxation as to how much it would cost, and we know it is somewhere in excess of $1.5 trillion--closer to $2 trillion if you extend all the sunsets that are in the bill--but, even now, we have the so-called dynamic score that takes into consideration predicted economic changes that try to make it more favorable, and that is in excess of $1 trillion. That is unacceptable. It should be unacceptable to every Member of this body.  This amendment will help us in doing that, in that it will take at least the $300 billion, which is one-time-only revenue, and not allow it to be used in the budget itself. Instead, we wall that off and use it for infrastructure.  I serve on the Environment and Public Works Committee, in addition to the Senate Finance I can tell you that the unmet transportation needs, water infrastructure needs, and energy infrastructure needs in this country are well documented. We know we need to modernize our transit systems, our roads, our bridges, our water infrastructure, and our energy infrastructure. We need to modernize them, particularly if we are going to be competitive. This motion will set up the right priority for modernizing America's infrastructure.  What does that mean with regard to jobs? Speaker Ryan used the number of a little less than 1 million jobs that are created spending $1.5 trillion. That is about $1.5 million per job. That is not very good by anyone's standards. We have projections that $300 billion--far less than $1.5 trillion--will create 4 million great jobs here in  Here is a chance to really create jobs but at the same time produce a much more up-to-date, modern transportation system for this country. I have the honor of representing Maryland in the I can tell you that we need significant resources to update our transit system. The WMATA system is old and needs improvements, and needs further investments. We are in the second worst congested area here in We need investments in roads. Our bridges are in serious trouble. We have a major water main break every day in this country--every day. We need billions of dollars to fix our water infrastructure.  Here is an opportunity for us to speak to two major priorities. One is fiscal responsibility. Let's do this in the right way, not spend one-time-only money. Two, we can take care of the international tax problems of American companies that have money overseas. Third, we can repair our infrastructure without raising the debt.

251,topic-id,758,"Mr.President, I understand we now have a new bill. I am looking at Senator Wyden hold up that new bill. I got a sheet that looked as if it came from K Street that gave us a list of changes that will be included in the managers' package. I looked at the list, and somewhere around 50 or 60 new provisions were on that list. Many of those were not bills that had been filed, so we had no idea what was going to be included in it.  None of those issues--in fact, nothing in this bill has been subject to an open hearing in the Finance Now we are going to be asked, I understand, maybe later tonight to vote on those changes. Quite frankly, I don't know what those changes are, and I am not going to have an opportunity to go over those with my constituents. That is wrong. That is not the process we use to change the Tax Code of this country, a major tax reform bill. That is an outrageous process, to say that we are going to vote on a new bill without an opportunity to understand it, without any hearings, without an opportunity for constituents to give their views on it, and I must state that I find that very offensive.  I want to talk about one provision in particular, and I hope we will have a chance to do something about it during the amendment process. As I understand it, the revised provisions in regard to State and local tax deduction still restrict what taxpayers can deduct on their Federal tax returns in regard to State and local taxes that they pay. I admit, this could have been modified, but what I understand is that the modification is that taxpayers will be able to deduct up to $10,000 of property taxes but will not be able to deduct any of their State taxes, whether they are income taxes or sales taxes, in regard to the Federal taxes.  In my State, we have county income taxes that will not be deductible, if I understand correctly, under the proposal we will be voting on. If that is, in fact, correct, that is absolutely wrong, and I want to tell you why. Many of us spent years in the State legislature. Our distinguished Presiding Officer was Governor of his We respect State and local governments. It is the same taxpayers that pay the taxes to the counties, to the State, and to the Federal  We believe in federalism. Our Nation was founded on federalism. I was proud of my record as speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates and of working on a federalism task force set up by President Reagan to look at the proper way to respect the rights of the States and local governments. Now we are saying we are not going to respect their ability to finance their operations. I say that because we are going to tax the tax. We are not going to respect that the same taxpayer is paying the State of Maryland's taxes or the State of Tennessee's taxes. That is wrong. That is an affront, I believe, to the Constitution of this country, but it has an impact.  It is going to be much, much more difficult for our States to be able to raise the revenues they need to support our schools and for public safety and health. All those services are going to be much more difficult for our States to be able to finance because of this change that is included in the Senate bill. It is going to be more difficult for local governments. The cap on property taxes is real and will affect local government's ability to raise property taxes. But in Maryland and other[[Page S7680]]States, our local governments have other sources, including income taxes, that no longer are going to be deductible.  That is going to affect my State's ability to adequately fund public services. Whether it is education, whether it is transportation, whether it is healthcare, all of that is going to be negatively impacted and it is wrong.  I will give you a number, because I know the number in Almost 50 percent of Maryland taxpayers deduct State and local taxes as an itemized deduction. They are going to be disadvantaged by the provision that is included in the Senate bill, and it is wrong. It also has unintended consequences, but it is going to have other consequences.

This is not a special interest; this is how we finance government. We finance government at the Federal level, the State level, and the local level. If this bill becomes law, we are violating it.  Mr.President, I will ask my colleague from Oregon to let me have a minute more for two or three more points on this that I think are important; that is, there are effects that are going to take place as a result of the limitation of State and local taxes. We are going to see effects on property values. The Realtors and real estate industries have made that clear. It is going to affect the tax base of local government.  This bill is going to affect charitable giving. Why do I say that charitable giving is part of this? Because I was talking to the mayor of Baltimore, Catherine Pugh, earlier today. She has serious problems with law enforcement in She is depending upon private groups and their generosity to help deal with the problems of It is going to be much more difficult for private groups to be able to get charitable contributions if this bill becomes law. So there will be impact on this that will affect our State and local governments, in addition to the elimination of the State and local tax deduction.  Here is one last point, if I might make it, in regard to middle-income taxpayers. I respect greatly my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the charge that they show, but these charges don't include the effect of the increase of the estate tax because that has not been made part of the calculations. It does not take into consideration 13 million people who no longer are going to have health insurance. That has not been taken into consideration in the charge they are showing.  It doesn't take into consideration, in the charge, that the corporation profits they are going to make as a result of these tax cuts are going to most likely go to stock buyouts, rather than helping the workers. That is not reflected.  So when you take a look at all of it--and we do have some analysis that has been done that is objective--middle-income taxpayers are at a disadvantage under this tax bill.

First, if I might, let me just point out that yesterday I took to the floor to emphasize some of the points that Senator Nelson just made--that this bill, which is advertised to help the middle class, does not help the middle class. It helps the wealthy. It is business cuts, and middle-income taxpayers[[Page S7546]]get some relief--some, not all--that is temporary in nature.

In my State of Maryland, it is estimated that 800,000 Marylanders will pay more taxes rather than less. The tax relief to middle-income families is so much smaller than what is given to the wealthy and what is given to the business community.  To compound that problem, we now know by the scores of both the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office that the bill will add tremendously to the deficit--over a trillion dollars. I think it is going to be closer to $2 trillion, but their scoring shows it over a trillion dollars in deficits.  Guess who is going to pay for those deficits. It is going to be middle-income families. Then, you put on top of that the repeal of the mandate under the Affordable Care Act, which is also going to hurt middle-income families on their ability for affordable healthcare.  So this bill advertised to help middle-income families does not do that. For my State of Maryland, it is particularly painful because of the loss of the State and tax local deductions that are used by almost a majority of our taxpayers. Just about 50 percent of our taxpayers in Maryland use the State and local tax deductions.  There is another reason why this bill has been advertised not just to help middle-income families, which it doesn't do, but it is called job creation. This bill is advertised as a bill that will create jobs in Now, let me go through that because I am for creating more jobs. We need more jobs in We needs more jobs throughout the country. The number that has been given to us is that this bill will create 975,000 jobs at a cost of $1.5 trillion. That comes out to $1,530,000 per job. That is a pretty high cost to create a job. In fact, it is ridiculous to spend that type of money. We don't know if that is going to actually happen. That is what the proponents of the legislation are saying.  Now, we have had Democrats and Republicans who have worked together to really create jobs. I serve on the Environment and Public Works I serve as the ranking member on the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee with Senator Inhofe, and we both know if we put more resources into infrastructure--into roads, bridges, transit systems--we will, in fact, not only modernize our economy by having a first-class transportation system and not only make the quality of life better so we can get to and from work in a reasonable time, but we will also create real jobs.  So in the last Congress we had a bipartisan group of members from the Finance Committee who said: Look, we have to do something about international tax issues, repatriation, and monies parked overseas. We need to do something to bring this money back. These are American companies that have their money overseas and don't want to pay the higher corporate taxes. There is a way of bringing that money back. Let's do it so we can try to get it into our economy. Democrats and Republicans agreed, but the one thing we didn't want to do was to use that money for a permanent type of spending that could increase the deficit.  So what does H.1 do? What does the underlying bill do? It does exactly that. It uses this one-time-only money and spends it on a permanent basis for tax relief for corporations--a permanent tax relief for corporations. That is not the responsible thing to do.  So what we should be doing with that money--and what the proposal was that we had in the last Congress--is to use that as seed money for infrastructure one-time-only expenses. We could, therefore, create modern infrastructure and create jobs and do it in a responsible way. It is a win-win-win situation. The House repatriation bill would bring in approximately $300 billion of one-time-only revenues. It has been estimated that at $300 billion, we create 4 million jobs. Now, let's compare that. If we use that $300 billion to create 4 million jobs, that is about $73,000 a job, as compared to $1.5 million per job under the underlying bill.  I think we all understand that we need to be more cost effective in how we do our work around here, and that is why Democrats and Republicans said: Let's use this one-time-only source for infrastructure, modernizing our roads, and creating jobs. That brings me to the motion I hope I will have a chance to offer tomorrow that would recommit the bill to the committee to return it to the Congress and to this floor so that we use the repatriation funds for infrastructure so that we can create the jobs and not create a greater hole in the deficit.  I am joined in this effort by Senator Feinstein, Senator Blumenthal, Senator Udall, Senator Casey, and Senator I do think this is a matter that I hope my colleagues will pay attention to. I hope we can fix this bill, H.1, and work in a bipartisan manner. It doesn't look like we are there yet. We want a bill that helps middle-income families. We want a bill that does not increase the deficit, and the current bill does exactly that. So I hope my colleagues will work with us so we can return this bill to the Senate Finance Committee and return a bill that is worthy of the people of this country.  I yield the floor.

1642,topic-id,2488,"Mr.President, for most of my time here in the U.Senate, I have been on the Senate Finance Committee, which deals with our Tax For most of my time in the House of Representatives, I served on the House Ways and Means Committee, which dealt with our Tax  Quite frankly, I thought that there were three guiding principles in regard to tax reform that both Democrats and Republicans felt were essential and that, really, I thought were beyond being controversial. That is, if we are going to have tax relief, the focus must be on the middle class; that in today's economic circumstances, we would not want to have tax reform add to the deficit; and that we need to use an open process--a bipartisan process--for tax reform so that we have the opportunity for all stakeholders to understand exactly what we are doing so that we don't have any unintended consequences. As I look at the bill that is being brought to the floor by the Senate Budget Committee, it violates all three of these basic principles.  First, with regard to providing relief to middle-income taxpayers, the Joint Committee on Taxation has looked at this bill, and that is the objective scorekeeper. Some may not like what[[Page S7384]]they say, but we have to acknowledge that these are the objective numbers that look at exactly who benefits from the tax provisions. It is an interesting analysis that they do about those who are in the top income tax brackets, and we are using about half a million people. In 2019 this group of half a million people will receive $34 billion in tax relief--half a million taxpayers. In that same year, those taxpayers who have income under $50,000, which amounts to about 90 million taxpayers in this country or about 180 times the number of people, will receive about 30 percent of the amount of benefits, about $14 billion in that year. That analysis does not take into consideration who benefits from the estate tax changes in the bill that is going to be brought before us. I must say that I doubt there are any taxpayers under $50,000 a year who would benefit from increasing the $4 million base that we currently have in our estate tax. The Joint Committee on Taxation did not include the impact of the repeal of the individual mandate for health coverage, which affects the funds going into health premium support and Medicaid which, again, goes to lower income families. The figures I just provided are conservative figures. It is much more skewed toward higher income than even the committee's analysis for 2019.  Let me point out one more issue about this number. Year 2019 is the most favorable year for middle-income taxpayers. It gets worse every year thereafter. The bill is not targeted toward middle income. It is targeted to the wealthy.  Look at some of the reasons. The estate tax repeal helps wealthy people. The alternative minimum tax--those in the highest incomes who are required to pay some taxes--is repealed. There is the fact that the business tax relief is made permanent but the individual relief has a sunset and terminates after 8 years.  So the Congressional Budget Office has told us exactly who will pay more taxes. This is interesting. In 2019, those at the lowest income tax brackets, or under $30,000, will actually pay more taxes. They are not getting a tax cut. If you look at 2021, 2 years later, those under $40,000 are going to pay more taxes. If you go all the way up to 2027, for those earning under $75,000, the majority will pay more taxes. So as to this bill, which is being advertised by my Republican colleagues as benefitting all taxpayers, know that it doesn't benefit all taxpayers.  In my State, it is estimated that 800,000 Marylanders will pay more taxes under this bill in 2027. It particularly affects those in middle income who are going to be put at a disadvantage. The people who are protected are those at the high income level. To add one more complication to middle-income taxpayers, there is also not even a subtle attack on Medicaid, Medicare, and other programs that are important for middle-income families. Job training programs dealing with education, et cetera, are all going to be jeopardized because of the way this bill is funded.  On the first test, is this bill aimed at middle-income taxpayers? The answer is no. It fails.  On the second test, are we financing this tax cut by increasing the debt, asking our children and grandchildren to pay for this tax cut? The answer is clearly yes. By its own admission, the budget instructions tell us that we are going to have a $1.5 trillion deficit as a result of this tax bill, and that is not the whole picture. We know there is at least $1.5 trillion of new debt if this bill becomes law, but as I am sure my colleagues are aware, there are many provisions in this bill that have sunsets--that terminate--but it is anticipated that those sunsets will be extended. For example, in the business expensing or the credits for family medical leave, many people are advertising this as just a way of fitting a more expensive bill into a $1.5 trillion deficit and not making it larger, but in reality, when extending those extenders, we find that the deficit will be half a trillion dollars more. We are talking about a $2 trillion hole in the deficit. To make matters even worse, we have a trigger that is being recommended that is in the bill itself, but that trigger will extend more tax relief, not less. So this bill fails in the second basic test, and that is because it creates a major hole in the deficit.  The third test is whether this is truly an open bipartisan process. Here no one can say with a straight face that the answer is yes. The majority, the Republicans, are using reconciliation, which is by definition a partisan process. There is no real opportunity for open debate or hearings or amendments. The amendments are all contrived under the reconciliation restrictions.  Does anyone here believe that at the end of the day the majority leader is not going to offer a new bill at the eleventh hour with no time to debate, where we vote up or down, which will be the final product that we are being asked to approve?  So on all three tests this bill coming out of the Budget Committee fails. But then it goes beyond that. There was a late addition in the Senate Finance Committee that repealed the individual mandate under the Affordable Care Now, quite frankly, one would wonder how would that ever get put into a tax bill? Why would this be put into a tax bill? The Congressional Budget Office tells us that it will add 13 million Americans to the uninsured rolls by 2027. These 13 million individuals will not be able to get access to quality healthcare. If they run into a major health episode, they are going either to have to sell all of their assets or go into bankruptcy or be denied care. I think we should be concerned about those 13 million. In addition, these individuals who don't have health insurance and don't have a doctor end up in emergency rooms for care, which is more expensive. Guess who pays the bill? We all do. We pay for it through higher hospital rates. Those of us who have insurance and who pay our bills are going to be paying for those who don't pay their bills. So the fact that we are eliminating the individual mandate doesn't just affect 13 million people. It does affect those 13 million, and it affects all of us who will be paying more through cost shifting.  Quite frankly, what is really aggravating is that it is in the bill getting scored as a tax savings--as more revenue coming in. It is more revenue coming as we spend less on healthcare subsidies, less on Medicaid, and the bill spends that money. So we are using cuts to middle-income families in healthcare to finance permanent tax relief for businesses in this country. Where are our priorities? That makes no sense whatsoever  There are individual changes that are being recommended in this bill that are going to have very dire consequences. I will just mention one. I spent a good deal of my life in public office at the State level, and I believe very much in federalism. I believe that State legislators are trying to do what is right for their taxpayers as we are trying to do what is right for the same taxpayers. Federalism says that we respect each level of government, but by eliminating the State and local tax deductions, we are telling taxpayers that they have to pay taxes on taxes, that we don't respect our State and local governments, and that you can no longer deduct your State taxes or local property taxes. Again, that is an insult to the Constitution and to federalism. It also, by the way, will hurt taxpayers.  In my own State, almost 50 percent of Marylanders use the State and local tax deductions. If the Senate bill becomes law, all of them will lose that ability to deduct State and local taxes on their Federal income tax returns. It will affect the ability of our States and local governments to finance the necessary functions of government, whether it is to keep people safe or whether it is to provide schools for our children.  I heard from people this last weekend from different charitable groups who told me that if the Senate bill becomes law, it will have a dramatic impact on private giving, because under the Senate bill, only 5 percent of the taxpayers in this country will be able to get a tax deduction from charitable contributions. Think about that for one moment.  We pride ourselves in the services that are provided by the private sector, services in healthcare, education, social services, and the arts. All of that depends on the generosity of private givers. Yet we are saying that only 5 percent of the population in this country will have any tax incentive to give charitable gifts. That will have a major[[Page S7385]]negative impact on charitable contributions.  Then, there is the value of the credit that we have out there for economic growth. I am very proud of the public-private partnerships we have in I am sure my colleagues are proud of those public-private partnerships in Pennsylvania and in every State in this country, but the credits we give are going to be worth a lot less if the Senate bill becomes law, making it much more difficult to put together a venture that can redevelop vulnerable communities around our  Let me just add one or two points before yielding the floor. What I think we all want to accomplish in tax reform is to have a tax code that is simpler and is predictable. That is not happening with the bill that is being recommended by the Budget  So many provisions are temporary. It is a partisan process. It doesn't simplify the Tax Code, and there certainly is not going to be predictability on provisions that have sunset termination dates.  The final bill could even be much worse. As I said, the bill coming out of the Budget Committee that is getting all this attention is certainly not going to be the bill that we vote on at the end of the day--sometime, as I have been told. It could be as early as tomorrow. It is going to be a different bill.  It is being negotiated now in closed sessions with Republicans meeting, trying to get their last couple of votes. We don't know what the changes will be, but at the end of the day, we know we are going to be presented with a different bill. But that is not going to be the final bill because then it will go to the House and there will be additional changes. There are measures in the House that have many of us upset, such as this: Are we not able to deduct medical expenses if we have an extraordinary need in the family? In the House bill you cannot deduct those expenses. Student loan interest costs cannot be deducted in the House bill. Are they going to end up in the final vote we are going to be called to vote upon in the Senate?  One thing is clear. The bill is only going to get worse and get more expensive, and it is going to cause greater damage to an already too-large deficit.  There is a better way. There is a better way, and that is true bipartisanship. Let's come together and work together.  I am very proud of the work I have done here in my career in the Senate and the In the House I worked with then-Congressman Portman, and the two of us worked together with stakeholders to change our retirement policies for retirement savings. We were able to get bills not only enacted but made permanent. Even though we didn't have the political support of our leadership, we had the support of the American people, we had a bipartisan process, we used all of the stakeholders, and we came to good policy changes. More people have retirement savings as a result of those efforts. That is the type of effort we need to put on for tax reform--Democrats and Republicans working together so we can have a predictable tax code moving forward.  There is a better way for job growth in this country. I heard my Republican friends say this bill will create up to a million jobs--$1.5 to $2 trillion creating 1 million jobs?  We had a bill in the last Congress that we could revise immediately to take the repatriation funds--that is the corporate money that is locked overseas--and bring it back here. I will submit an amendment to the Senate Finance Committee to try to get this done. A couple hundred billion dollars could come back into this country. We could use that for infrastructure, which creates 4 to 5 million jobs for a fraction of the cost. We could do much better in job creation than spending this type of money for the type of jobs that are predicted.  I started by saying I thought one of the guiding principles is to help middle-class families. This bill doesn't do it. Let's join together, Democrats and Republicans, and do what is right for middle-income taxpayers in this country.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1848,topic-id,628,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize World AIDS There was a time when Congress could put bitter partisan rancor and finger-pointing blame games aside and unite-around a cause. We did so to fight HIV/AIDS globally. Since 2003, the President's Plan for Emergency AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, has meant the difference between life and death for millions of people. In fact, just last year, I met a 30-year-old man named Simon in Namibia who said he would not be alive without the international community's HIV/AIDS assistance. With the generous support of the American people, the U.Government has committed more than $70 billion to bilateral HIV/AIDS programs; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and bilateral tuberculosis programs since the program's inception.  We cannot declare victory yet--far from it. Only one-half of the 37 million people in the world living with HIV are receiving treatment. Globally, young women are twice as likely to acquire HIV as their male counterparts. One million people still died from AIDS-related illnesses worldwide in 2016. Let us not forget that people here in the United States are not immune. In Maryland, for instance, the most recent data indicate that, in 2016, almost 36,000 people were living with HIV/AIDS, and the State had the fifth highest rate of new HIV infections in the country.  For the past 15 years, Congress has shown strong commitment and moral leadership by providing robust funding for PEPFAR and regularly reauthorizing the program. Signals from the Trump administration, however, indicate that this partnership may be fraying, putting lives and epidemic control at risk.  President Trump's fiscal year 2018 budget request proposed cutting funding for PEPFAR and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria by more than $1 billion. These cuts, if enacted, could deny lifesaving treatment to men, women, and children. These cuts, if enacted, could halt our progress to achieving epidemic control. These cuts, if enacted, will harm millions of people.  Congress must remain resolved not only to protect our investment, but to continue building on our progress thus far.  I call on the Trump administration to join us in facing the challenge of HIV/AIDS head-on, without politics and without posturing, as we consider PEPFAR reauthorization. The administration's proposal to extend the Mexico City policy, often referred to as the global gag rule, may hamstring the very organizations providing lifesaving prevention, detection, and treatment services.  The Trump administration's proposal to cut tuberculosis funding by more than 25 percent, if enacted, will further frustrate efforts to raise resources to combat this global killer; TB is the world's leading infectious disease killer and is the primary cause of death for people coinfected with HIV/Instead of proposing cuts, the Trump administration should be demonstrating continued support for the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and The Global Fund has saved 22 million lives since it was established. Currency fluctuations are complicating U.contributions to the Global Fund and, according to some estimates, could lead to U.funding being cut dear by up to $450 million in fiscal year 2019. We absolutely cannot allow such a thing to happen.  World AIDS Day should be a day of sober commemoration; but it should also be a day of hope. Success in the fight against HIV/AIDS is within our grasp.  Amid today's tweetstorms and controversies, it is easy to overlook the[[Page S7405]]fact that, when this body is at its best, it has the power to change the course of history. Success is possible. Cutting funding now--shrinking from our commitment now, instead of sustaining it--will negate the investments and progress we have made so far. We owe it to people like Simon, to their families, and to millions of others dealing with the scourge of HIV/AIDS to keep working toward a world free of the disease.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-29-pt1-PgS7404.txt,,SUPERIOR NATIONAL FOREST LAND EXCHANGE ACT OF 2017,2017,29,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1088,topic-id,1591,"Next, Mr.President, I have a couple of charts here. I don't know whether the Presiding Officer can see them from where he is sitting. I can barely see them from right here.  The first chart we are going to take a look at deals with the--on this side over here, we have median household income for Americans since 1987. Over on this side, we have corporate profits in the billions of dollars.  When we come back here to 1987, we look at the orange line here, and that is median household income in 2016 dollars. The median household income in 1987 was just a shade over $50,000. All of these years later, in 2017, it is just a little bit higher. It has gone up a little bit but not a whole lot--maybe close to $60,000, but I don't know that it is any higher than that. It has gone up a little bit, really, over the last few years.  The green line here on our chart is corporate profits. When we go back to 1987, corporate profits were equal to about--it looks like $30,000 billion, and if I am not mistaken, that would be maybe $30 trillion. I hope I have that right. That was 1987. If you look at what has happened, it has gone up and down. This is during the great recession when we fell off the cliff and almost fell off the world. In 2007, 2008, we started to climb back out of it. Today, the corporate profits have roughly doubled in this country since 1987--roughly doubled--while median household income is growing a tiny bit but actually not that much.  Let's look at the next chart, and then I will not speak from the charts. I guess the lesson here again is that corporate profits have gone up rather nicely. There were some ups and downs because of the great recession, but they are on an uptick now.  This is a look at the national deficit and debt. I know the Presiding Officer has a great concern about this.  I came to the House I guess in 1983. I had been State treasurer for a State[[Page S7851]]that had the worst deficit in the country. The State of Delaware tied with Puerto We were a mess.  Finally, Pete du Pont, a Republican, did a wonderful job for 8 years as I had the opportunity to serve with him in the State treasury and later on to become the Governor of the State of Delaware, when we went to a triple A credit rating for the first time in State history.  I came here in 1983 as a Congressman who was concerned about debts and deficits. My sense is that here in the Senate and the House, we don't have a lot of deficit hawks these days. If we do, their voices are not heard very loudly. We are on a course that is unsustainable in terms of our accumulation of more debt.  This is an interesting chart because it goes back to really the beginning of World War II, the war my dad was in and my uncle served in. There is a lot of red ink here, and it shows the deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product, and it reached about 30 percent right in the middle of World War After the war, we have the green down here where we actually had some surpluses in the late 1940s and the early 1950s. We actually had a surplus in 1968. Then we went from 1968 to about 1998 and never balanced the budget, all of those years at one time. The last 4 years of the Clinton administration, we balanced our budget four times. It was a bipartisan deal.  The chairman of the House Budget Committee, if I am not mistaken, was a Republican from Ohio, John Kasich, who is now the Governor of John and I came to the House together in 1983. He came as a deficit hawk as well. He and the Clinton administration obviously did a nice job to help to balance four budgets. We haven't done so well since then. Since then, we have shown, right from here up to the present, which would be right around there, one deficit after the other--deficits that peaked out over the last year of George Bush's administration, when we were again falling into the great recession, and we have spent a lot of money in stimulus to try to get us out of recession.  The debt dropped from about $1.4 trillion per year down to about one-third that much, and now it is starting to go up again. The debt last year--the year that ended on September 30--the deficit had bounced back up to $666 billion again in 1 year--a lot of money. The prospect going forward is not encouraging; it is actually discouraging.  The tax cut bill that was passed in this Chamber just a few days ago--last Saturday morning, in the middle of the night--called for tax breaks, some for individuals for a while, some for corporations that tend to be more permanent in nature. But for me, maybe the most troubling aspect of the tax bill that was enacted last Saturday morning, aside from the way it was pushed through, is the idea that we got, right here on the Senate floor, I think sometime around the middle of the evening last Friday night, a 400-page amendment, over 400 pages that we had never read, never seen, with scribbling on the side of the pages. The idea was that somehow we were supposed to read that and understand it and then vote it up or down in an amendment in like 4 or 5 hours. Good luck. That just doesn't happen. That would be the triumph of man's hope over experience.  I always ask these four questions when people ask about what we should do in tax reform. I say, 1, it ought to be fair. What we have actually passed is something where most of the benefits, the lion's share, go to people who are, frankly, very wealthy. Folks who are lower and lower middle income may realize some benefits in the first few years following the implementation of the new tax cut, but over time--say, by 2025--families with incomes up to $75,000 per family are going to be realizing not a net gain from the tax cut but actually a net loss, which is not good.  I always ask: Is it fair? I think it is not fair when you look at the numbers and see how middle-income folks fare and those who happen to be wealthier fare.  The second question I always ask is this: Will it foster economic growth or diminish it? I focus a lot of my time and energy on economic growth, job creation, and job preservation. Senators, Presidents, and Governors don't create jobs. We create a nurturing environment for job creation, job preservation, and workforce, transportation infrastructure, protection of intellectual property rights, public safety, access to water and wastewater. There are a lot of things that contribute to economic growth and so forth. Tax policy is important. Commonsense regulation is important as well.  But my second question is this: Does the tax reform bill that we passed foster economic growth? Not really. To a modest extent, some, but not really. One of the things it does is it suggests uncertainty and the lack of predictability going forth, which I don't think businesses really care for.  One area where we, frankly, decided not to spend any money this time is the area where we could actually get the biggest bang for our buck in terms of growing We have a transportation infrastructure that is woefully inadequate these days, in terrible shape--roads, highways, bridges, rail, ports, and airports. We have many broad areas in the country that don't have access to the internet.  We just passed a tax bill that is going to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. Unfortunately, none of that goes to pay for or to make investments in things that would grow GDP by a lot and would provide employment opportunities--not just for a couple hundred thousand people but for millions of people, over the next decade or so. None of that is there.  The third question I always look at in terms of tax reform is this: Does it simplify the Tax Code or make it more complex? The new provision that was adopted is going to increase by this much the thickness of the Tax Code, or by about another 15 or 20 percent--not making it simpler or easier to understand, but actually more difficult.  The last piece I consider is this: What is the effect on the deficit? Pumping up the deficit by another $1.5 trillion is making the situation even worse.  We are going to go to conference now, the House and My hope is that it will be more bipartisan than what we saw here in the It needs to be. I quoted last week and I quoted again today an old African-American proverb: If you want to go fast, travel alone. If you want to go far, travel together. Our Republican friends, at least on this side of the Congress, for the most part have chosen to go fast and to go alone. That is unfortunate. The last time we did tax reform, we did it together. It took 3 years, but it was a more lasting and, I think, a better outcome.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-05-pt1-PgS7850-4.txt,179,21ST CENTURY RESPECT ACT,2017,5,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1287,topic-id,1610,"I want to pivot for just a moment, Mr.President, and talk about workforce. Most people, when they think of Dreamers and DACA, think of young people who were born in other countries and maybe at a very early age were brought here by their parents and maybe have no recollection of the countries they grew up in. But they have been here now. They came here, were raised here, and were educated here, many of them in our public schools. A number of them had the opportunity to go to college.  Delaware State University is a historically Black university in Dover and is the home of the It is a wonderful land grant school that I have been heavily invested in as Governor and even now to make sure they rise and continue to improve. I am very proud of all of the progress that has been made there. I was invited by their president, Harry Williams, to come to their campus a couple of months ago. We met with Dreamers, ``DACAs,'' students born in other countries who were brought here by their parents years ago.  I have met a lot of college students in my day. I have been joined on the floor here by Senator Durbin from He has probably met at least as many as I have--probably more, because he is from a bigger  I don't think I have ever been more impressed by a group of college students in my life than the young men and women I met that day. We literally happened to be there at 11 in the morning that day, when the President's administration announced that the time for the Dreamers was going to expire in 6 months, unless Congress was somehow able to put together an agreement and pass legislation--which is hard to do without the support of the administration.[[Page S7852]]  I was there with young people that day. I will never forget what a young man said. I think he was born in Central America--either Honduras, Guatemala, or El This was right on the heels of the problem of recognizing these young people and celebrating their promise and potential. Right in the middle, we got an announcement, learning that the administration had just announced about sending these folks home in 6 months--not really home, because their home is here, but back to the places where they were born.  There were about five or six students, all undergrads--freshmen, sophomores. One young man had come here maybe from Guatemala, and he stood up and said: As a young person, I honestly don't remember ever living in my native country. The only country I remember is this country.  I grew up in public schools. Every day, we would start our school day in class, in home room, by standing, putting our hands over our hearts, and pledging allegiance to the United States of  He said: This is my home. This is my country. This is the only home I have ever really known.  He then went on to tell about his aspirations.  Those kids are smart and have parents who are engaged in their education and have high expectations for their children. A number of the students are working not one but two jobs to help support themselves through school. As a Navy ROTC midshipman at Ohio State, I worked two jobs to help pay the bills. These students are too. They are taking courses that include math, science, and physics. They want to do the kind of work that, frankly, a lot of people in this country--some want to serve in the military, some want to be in public safety, some want to be educators, some want to be scientists. They want to do all kinds of things. This is a time when we have across the country some 4 million to 5 million jobs that are literally going unfilled today, and people who maybe would like to do those jobs don't have the requisite skills to do them, maybe they don't have the interest in doing the jobs, or maybe they can't pass a drug test. But at a time when we have 3 million or 4 million jobs that are vacant, unfilled, and employers are pleading for qualified applicants, that somehow we are going to send 700,000 or 800,000 Dreamers back to wherever they were born makes no sense.  One of the loudest voices we have heard in this debate is that it is not just a fairness argument for the Dreamers, in terms of turning our backs on their aspirations and hopes, but that it is in our self-interest as a nation, in terms of a stronger economy, to keep them here.  Why would we educate them here and they learn values here, and then we ship them off to another country to compete with us, to start businesses of their own, instead of doing that here?  I suggest that we listen to the employers of this country. We don't always agree with everything that the U.Chambers of Commerce or State Chambers of Commerce say, but in this case they are absolutely right.  I have a 3-minute statement that I would like to read, if I could, from one of our Could I do that, I ask the Senator, our Whip, from Illinois?  This is about a woman living in Wilmington, DE, which is where my wife and I live. Her name is Kay-Dean This is a portion of a short email she recently sent to me:       My name Kay-Dean, a community builder who happens to be a      DACA recipient. I was born in Jamaica but I have lived in the      U.since I was 7 or 8 years old. I grew up in Delaware and      moved to New York in 2012 and moved back [to Delaware]      recently after 5\1/2\ years [in New York].       I am approaching 30 years old on March 1st, so I've been      here [in the United States] for almost 22-23 years.       My grandmother raised myself and two of my cousins. I grew      up not really understanding my immigration status or the      implications it would have on my reality and dreams. I missed      out on opportunities, but I assumed it was due to our      financial lack. My grandmother worked hard but she couldn't      read or write so this limited her.       After unjustly gaining a juvenile record because of poor      representation and ignorance of my rights, I decided I would      become a lawyer, not fully understanding that my immigration      status would potentially bar me from obtaining that dream.       After that summer, I gained a better understanding of my      status and why I couldn't really get a summer job or travel.      In order to truly cope, I determined that if I worked hard      enough, surely I could attain all my hopes and dreams.       I told my guidance counselor what I understood about my      immigration status and heard nothing but disappointment, I      was discouraged but I remained determined. I believed God      would reward my hard-work and faithfulness. So I saw [a]      different guidance counselor my 12th grade year, in tears,      pleading for help. She looked at my records (grades, SAT      score and activities) and by the grace of God she connected      me with a family member who worked with international      students at the local community college. With God's grace I      had the privilege of attending Delaware Technical and      Community College on a full scholarship.       In 2009, I graduated with my Associates in Business      Administration [with Concentrations in] Marketing      Upon graduating, God opened the door and I was accepted to      Goldey-Beacom College with scholarship assistance . . . I      completed my degrees in 2011, and graduated in 2012 with my      Bachelors in Business Administration [with Concentrations in]      Financial  After graduating from school and living and working in New York, Kay-Dean moved back to She wrote:       I currently work with a program that provides mentorship      opportunity for minorities and under-served youth who are      interested in working in the medical field. I have been      absolutely blessed to walk through the doors I have though      they were not the ones I originally pictured. I have had the      pleasure of helping and building up others, especially young      people.       I thought for sure DACA would begin to allow me the chance      to finally not only build up others, but myself as well.       But with Mr.Trump as President and his ending of the DACA      Program and whispers of immigration raids, I fight to hold on      to my dreams. My DACA status ends in March and with it all I      have worked so hard to build over the last 4 years.       I wrote this long email to simply ask that you fight for      people like me. We didn't choose to be here but we are      grateful to be here.       It is here where we've grown, cried, dreamed and worked      hard for our American Here is where those we hold dear      reside.

It is my prayer that you      would fight for us as if we were yours because truth be told,      WE  Your prayer has been heard.  I just want to say to my colleague Senator Durbin of Illinois, thank you for years of leadership on this issue to do the right thing, to treat other people as we would want to be treated if in their shoes and, frankly, to do the right things in terms of strengthening this economy.

1307,topic-id,913,"Mr.President, we just concluded a few minutes ago the confirmation of the President's nominee for the next Secretary of the Department of Homeland  As it turns out, the Presiding Officer is the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, which has jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland I have the privilege of being the immediate past chairman of the committee. The Presiding Officer and I have worked together on a wide range of issues that actually pertain to the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland  I don't want to speak out of turn, but I believe both the Presiding Officer, who is as well the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and I believe that one of the most important ingredients of success of any organization--I don't care whether it is a football team, a body such as the U.Senate, a hospital, a school, a State, a country--the key is always leadership. The key is leaders who are always interested in figuring out what is the right thing to do; people who believe in the Golden Rule, treating other people the way they want to be treated; and leaders who focus on excellence in everything they do. They surround themselves with the best people they can find. They embrace the idea that if a program or whatever is not perfect, let's make it better. The best leaders with whom I have been privileged to serve are those who just don't give up. When they are sure they are right, they just don't give up.  We have had a series of leaders, and I have been privileged to know every Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security since the very beginning of time, when I served as Governor and when I served in the I served with the first Secretary we had and others who have succeeded him--most recently, John Kelly, retired Marine four-star general who came from his command in SOUTHCOM to become Secretary of Homeland He is now at the White House serving as the Chief of Staff to the We are grateful to him for his service.  Since he has moved on to that post, it has left a vacancy to lead the Department of Homeland I think Elaine Duke is filling in quite nicely as the Acting She was previously Deputy Secretary of Homeland Now that Kirstjen Nielsen has been confirmed, we will see whether Elaine Duke will step back and be the I think a number of us hope that she will, but that is not our decision to make.  The vote today in favor of Kirstjen Nielsen's confirmation was, I believe, 62 ayes and 37 nays. Every now and then, we have the opportunity to vote and it is a close call. Not all of our votes are easy; some are more difficult than others. But for a number of us, this was a close call.  I think Kirstjen Nielsen is arguably bright. She is well-spoken. She has appeared before our committee and taken any number of questions. She was asked and has answered hundreds of questions from committee members and questions for the record. She has been good enough to meet with me not once but twice. I said to her yesterday when we met that I think she is a person with a good heart and good values--again, well-spoken and bright. She is especially strong with respect to cyber security.  The real question mark for me--one of the question marks for me, among others--was, for someone who has at best only led organizations with maybe a couple dozen people to now be thrust into--or selected to serve in this position, where she will be leading 240,000 people at the Department of Homeland Security, spread out all over the world, is a daunting challenge. As someone who has been privileged to spend 23 years of my life in the Navy as a naval flight officer, then as a treasurer, a Congressman, a Governor, a Senator, and I led the National Governors Association--for me, leading an organization of that size would be daunting. I would expect that the same is true for Kirstjen  John Kelly, who for 6 months was our Secretary, has a lot of confidence in her, and I have a lot of confidence in John John McCain and I introduced him as the ranking member and the chairman when General Kelly was nominated to be John McCain sat on one side of the nominee, and I sat on the other. I think we have taken his recommendation to heart, and that was maybe the tie-breaker for some of us.  When I spoke with Kirstjen yesterday, we talked about her core values and what guides her in making decisions. I think some of it is faith-based, which I find encouraging; the idea of treating other people the way we want to be treated; the willingness to welcome people to our home, our country, who are strangers.  So we will see how it plays out. I think it is critically important that--just as I try to surround myself with people who have strength and fill in for my weaknesses, my hope is that is exactly what will happen when she assumes the responsibility to lead the Department of Homeland  So I would say to Kirstjen Nielsen: Congratulations on your confirmation, and we look forward to working with you, hopefully agreeing a lot more often than we disagree.

1651,topic-id,1573,"Mr.President, 9 years have passed since I first joined the Senate Finance For each of those 9 years, I have looked forward to working on tax reform. In the House of Representatives, a million years ago, I had the privilege of working on tax reform legislation led by President Reagan, led by Tip O'Neill, Dan Rostenkowski, Bill Bradley, Bob Packwood, and others, which actually worked. It got us where we wanted to go, with lower rates and a more simplified code.  Tax reform takes time. It takes a lot of energy and a lot of effort. There is a lot of give and take. When we did that in 1986, the Congress took 2 years of public hearings, 2 years of meetings,[[Page S7390]]and 2 years of bipartisan negotiations. The idea that a permanent and enduring tax reform plan today can come to fruition in mere weeks is what they call in my State ``the triumph of [a man's] hope over experience.''  Any tax legislation that is purely partisan, written in the dark, and rushed to the finish line is bound to be poorly designed and riddled with inadvertent errors. A flawed process results in a flawed product.  When considering any tax policy, I look at it through a prism of 4 questions: 1, is it fair? 2, does it foster economic growth or impede it? 3, does it simplify the Tax Code or make it even more complex? And 4, is it fiscally responsible? Those are the four questions. Unfortunately, the Republican tax reform plan fails the test on, sadly, all four of these questions.  According to the nonpartisan--we just heard this from the Senator from Virginia--Congressional Budget Office, this plan would actually increase taxes on millions of Americans, beginning next year. By 2019, the CBO found that Americans earning less than $30,000 a year will be worse off under this tax bill. By 2021, Americans earning less than $40,000 will be worse off. By 2027, most Americans earning less than $75,000 a year will be worse off, not better. In fact, within 10 years, more than three-quarters of the tax cuts in this bill will go to the richest 5 percent of Think about that. Within the next 10 years, more than three-quarters of the tax cuts in this bill will go to the richest 5 percent of In fact, almost two-thirds of the tax breaks will go to the richest 1 out of every 100 None of this meets the reasonable definition, in my judgment, of fair.  The second question is, Does it foster economic growth or impede it? This bill does little to foster economic growth, and I fear, in the long run, it will actually impair growth.  Last week, a survey of top economists--including economists from across the political spectrum, as well as Nobel Prize winners and former presidents of the American Economic Association--found that only 1 out of 43 experts believe this type of tax reform would boost economic growth--1 out of 43--just 1. The truth is, any economic growth from this bill will be swamped by the deficits it creates. I will talk more about fiscal responsibility in a moment, but an important point here is that the increased national debt will be a huge drag on economic growth.  More Federal borrowing means higher interest rates, which means it will cost more for businesses, both large and small, to borrow and finance investments. It will cost more for families to take out a mortgage. It will cost more to borrow for college.  3, does it simplify the Tax Code? One goal of tax reform is supposed to be simplifying the Tax Code and reducing unpredictability and uncertainty. Unfortunately, this bill introduces new and complicated provisions, for examples, new requirements to claim the child tax credit and an awkwardly designed tax deduction for passthrough businesses. This will make it difficult for Americans to file their taxes--more difficult, not easier. As we learned earlier this month from the Joint Committee on Taxation during consideration of this bill in the Senate Finance Committee on which I am privileged to serve, this tax bill will actually make the Internal Revenue Code regulations longer, not shorter. Making the Tax Code longer is not the key for simplification.  A large part of the additional complexity results from the enormous new fiscal cliff created by this bill, which makes tax policy unpredictable for families and businesses. That point brings me to my fourth question: Is it fiscally responsible? This bill blows a $1.5 trillion hole in the debt, and it will be far costlier than that as the deficit grows in years and decades to come.  With respect to the fiscal cliff I just mentioned, almost all of the individual tax provisions expire within 9 years. I will say that again. Almost all of the individual tax provisions expire within 9 years.  The bill's increase in the standard deduction, the increase in the child credit, the new tax break for passthrough businesses, and most other provisions affecting individuals will, under this Republican bill, expire by the end of 2025. At the same time, the tax cuts for large corporations in this bill are permanent.  Many of our friends on the other side of the aisle are saying that all of these individual provisions will be extended and made permanent. Well, if that is the case, why don't they do it now? The truth is extending these provisions would dramatically increase the deficit, adding far more to the national debt--more than the $1.5 trillion this bill already adds.  Making the individual provisions temporary and the corporate tax cuts permanent is, at bottom, an elaborate attempt to have our cake and eat it too. At best, making the individual provisions expire is, simply put, an elaborate scheme to hide the true cost of this tax bill, obscuring the fact that this bill would add much more to the debt, possibly twice as much as the $1.5 trillion that has been admitted and advertised.  At worst, making the individual tax provisions expire is a sneaky way to increase taxes on American families, all in order to pay for a permanent and expensive corporate tax cut. Either way, the result is unconscionable and an affront to fiscal responsibility.  Let me just conclude by noting that it doesn't have to be this way. Instead of rushing ahead with a partisan product that haphazardly remakes the American economy, there are many areas where Democrats and Republicans could work together on tax reform. I talked about a couple of those yesterday in a press conference that Senator Warner alluded to, and one of those areas is the standard deduction. I have supported a proposal to double the standard deduction, which would simplify filing for a lot of taxpayers.  Another area where we could find common ground is the corporate rate. I think many of our Democratic colleagues would agree with me and with others that business tax rates should be reformed to ensure that American businesses remain competitive with our global trading partners. And while lowering the rate from 35 percent to 20 percent may be too low--and, I think, fiscally irresponsible--a more sensible and modern proposal would bring both Democrats and Republicans together. There has to be a rate somewhere between 25 percent and 35 percent on which we could come together.  Another area for common ground is the child tax credit. The bill increases the child tax credit but fails to deliver the benefits to the middle- and working-class families who need it the most. A better tax reform proposal would have reformed the child tax credit to be fully refunded and, just as important, permanent, so that lower income families could benefit from it as well.  Despite these many areas of bipartisan agreement, our Republican colleagues' partisan rush to the finish line leaves us with no room for negotiations on a plan that blows a $1.5 trillion hole in our debt while actually increasing taxes on millions of Americans beginning next year.  In closing, President Trump made three promises when he ran for President, when he was nominated for President, and when he was sworn in to office as One of those is he didn't want a tax reform proposal that helped people like him--the wealthy. That is not what he wanted to do. 2, he wanted to make sure that we put money back into the pockets of hard-working families. A lot of middle-income families would benefit from tax reform. That is what he wanted. And he said that he wanted to simplify the Tax The Democrats are all-in on tax reforms that keep those three promises. But from what we know about the legislation before us this week, this plan does almost nothing to fulfill the President's three promises.  I join my colleagues today in urging Republicans to slow down, work with Democrats on a plan that is actually fair, actually fiscally responsible, and that encourages economic growth and job creation and simplifies the Tax  I will close with an African proverb that I mentioned yesterday: If you want to go fast, travel alone. If you want to go far, travel together.  We need to travel together, and if we do, we will go far, and, frankly, we will lift with us the economy of this country and families who need our help.  With that, I yield the floor.

206,topic-id,1632,"Mr.President, I rise to talk about a subject matter that this bill deals with that we are not hearing a lot about. I wanted to start, though, with the basics in terms of the overall debate.  I have said many times in the last number of days and weeks when we have reviewed the House proposal and when we reviewed the Senate proposal that was voted on in the Senate Finance Committee before Thanksgiving--I described the Senate bill as a giveaway to the superrich and big, multinational corporations. I still believe that.  I hope that when we see the new version of the bill, I won't have to say that again, but I am afraid I will. I am afraid that when we look at some of the data on what the tax impact would be on certain income brackets in the United States, even starting in the first year where the analysis starts, 2019--I am looking at page 3 of a report by the Tax Policy Center dated November 20 and based upon the Senate bill. In that year, tax year 2019, table 1 focuses on three income categories: folks making between $50,000 and $87,000; folks making between about $310,000 and $750,000; and others making above $750,000, so basically the top 1 percent. Here is what they find. The Tax Policy Center tells us that the first group, the family making $50,000 to $87,000, would receive an average tax cut of about $900, or 1.4 percent of after-tax income. The next group, the $310,000 to $750,000 income, gets a tax benefit that amounts to about $12,000, or 3.5 percent. The top 1 percent--$750,000 and up--they get a tax break of $34,000, or 2.2 percent.  Probably the most significant numbers in there by way of comparison aren't necessarily the dollar amounts, although I would ask why the top 1 percent needs $34,000 in 2019. I don't think that should be part of our legislation. I would like to see all of the tax benefits to the top 1 percent go to the middle and those trying to get to the middle. But let's do the comparison.  In the first year, in terms of these families making $50,000 to $87,000, they get 1.4 percent. The folks making between $310,000 and $750,000 get 3.5 percent--more than two full percentage points higher. Why is that? Why do people making $310,000 to $750,000 get a much bigger percentage tax cut than people making $50,000 to $87,000? The third category is the top 1 percent, and they get 2.2 percent. So I have problems with this legislation just based upon that. Why does the top 1 percent need one more penny? Why do very wealthy people--maybe not quite the top 1 percent but the 95th to 99th percentile, the $310,000 to $750,000 category--why do they need a tax break?  Guess what. It doesn't get any better down the road. And I am not talking about 2027, where it is cataclysmic for families in the middle; let's talk about 2 years before that. It is still bad. It is still 3 percent, by comparison, for the very wealthy, people making up to $750,000. The top 1 percent are still getting 2.1 percent. But the income category between $50,000 and $87,000 gets 1.2 percent of the tax cut, so they will be getting worse in 2025. Why is that? As my colleague, the senior Senator from Colorado, shows in that chart, why do people making more than $1 million need $34 billion in 1 year? I don't understand it.  Let me focus in particular on part of the debate about which we really haven't had much discussion. The impact of this tax bill may be the only substantial effort that will be made on tax reform for years, if not decades. We know that the last time any kind of major tax reform was done was 1986, so three decades have passed since the last tax reform effort. So this is a critically important moment not just for taxpayers, not just for the economy, not just for families generally, but especially for children.  In a bill of this significance, a bill of this impact, one major question should be asked, among many: What will be the impact on children? What is the child impact statement, if we were to draft one, if we had to articulate that? What is the impact on children of this legislation?  Well, there are a lot of organizations around the country that pay attention to public policy as it relates to children. I am looking at a letter dated November 28 and signed by a long list of organizations that advocate on behalf of children, and I will just read some of the headlines from this letter.  The first headline says: ``The Senate tax plan threatens child care programs and funding for the future.''  The second major headline says: ``The Senate tax bill's proposal to cut the Affordable Care Act would harm children's health and well-being.''[[Page S7671]]  The next headline says: ``The Child Tax Credit proposal in the Senate tax bill would not help families who struggle to pay for child care.''  The next headline says: ``The Senate tax bill also takes away other tax benefits that ordinary families rely on.''  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Dear Senator: As members of the Child Care/Early Learning      Coalition, we urge you to vote against the ``Tax Cuts and      Jobs Act.'' This bill would eliminate existing benefits in      the tax code for children and families, as well as undermine      critical supports, including those related to child care and      early education, in the future.       The Senate tax plan threatens child care programs and      funding in the future. The Senate tax bill, which consists      largely of massive tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy,      is estimated to increase the deficit by about $1.4 trillion      over ten years. The budget agreed upon by the House and      Senate provides a roadmap of how Congress will seek to offset      this increase in the deficit: by cutting federal spending      and, in particular, by slashing programs and services that      provide working families with a basic standard of living.      That means this tax bill will ultimately lead to cuts in      programs that are integral to the wellbeing of children and      their families, including Medicaid, SNAP, public education,      and the Child Care and Development Block       The Senate tax bill's proposal to cut the Affordable Care      Act would harm children's health and well-being. The Senate      bill would repeal the ACA's individual responsibility      provision, a requirement that most people enroll in coverage      or pay a penalty. Estimates from the Congressional Budget      Office (CBO) show that repealing the ACA's individual      responsibility provision would increase the number of      uninsured by 13 million over 10 years and raise insurance      premiums in the individual markets by 10 percent. Children's      health and well-being suffers when their families lack the      health insurance they need to see a doctor when they are sick      or for preventive care. The Senate has already rejected an      attempt to repealing the ACA, and now the bill would sneak      this in in order to fund even larger tax cuts for high-income      households and corporations.       The Child Tax Credit proposal in the Senate tax bill would      not help families who struggle to pay for child care. The      Senate tax bill would increase the Child Tax Credit (CTC),      but does not make this increase fully refundable. As a      result, lower-income families will not receive the full      benefit: for example, a single mother working full time at      the federal minimum wage and earning $14,500 would only      receive an additional $75 in CTC benefits. In addition, the      tax plan bills adds a new requirement--providing a Social      Security Number for each child claimed for the refundable      portion of the CTC--which could exclude a significant number      of children in immigrant families. This is not an approach      targeted to help families striving to make ends meet, and      does nothing to address the high cost of child care with      which so many working families struggle every day.       The Senate tax bill also takes away other tax benefits that      ordinary families rely on. Even though the Senate tax bill      proposes increasing the CTC (and doubling the standard      deduction), the bill also proposes eliminating personal and      dependency exemptions, eliminating the deduction for state      and local taxes, and eliminating deductions for some      employment-related expenses. This would leave many families      worse off. And the Senate bill makes all of the tax benefits      for families temporary, expiring at the end of 2025, even      though the proposed corporate tax cuts are all permanent.       There is a better way to help families and children and to      build a strong economy now and in the future. Instead of      these ill-conceived tax cuts, Congress can help families      through the tax code by enacting the Child and Dependent Care      Tax Credit Enhancement Act of 2017, and ensure that all      children and families who need it get high quality child care      and early education by enacting the Child Care for Working      Families           Sincerely,       Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations      (AAPCHO), Center for American Progress, Center for Community      Change Action, Children's Defense Fund, Children's Leadership      Council, CLASP, Every Child Matters, Family Focused Treatment      Association, Generations United, Health Care for America Now,      Jumpstart, Make it Work, Mi Familia Vota, National      Association of Family Child Care Providers, National      Association for Bilingual Education, National Association of      Social Workers (NASW), National Council of Jewish Women,      National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, National Physicians      Alliance, National Women's Law Center, NETWORK Lobby for      Catholic Social Justice, SparkAction, The Institute on      Taxation and Economic Policy, United Auto Workers, Working      Families Party, ZERO TO  ",CREC-2017-12-01-pt1-PgS7655-2.txt,1828,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017,1,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

210,topic-id,864,"Mr.President, I want to say to the senior Senator from Oregon, as the ranking member of the committee, he will remember, as I do, that in the course of that so-called markup, which is a fancy Washington word for having some debates and offering amendments, there was no hearing--no hearing for days, and there has still been no hearing on the Senate bill passed out of the Finance Committee and the new version of the bill that we will see right now. So, in the course of that discussion, there were no hearings.  It would have been helpful to us and to the American people if we had the major organizations come in before the Finance Committee and give us testimony about the impact on children--organizations that have spent decades advocating on behalf of children, doing public policy research as it relates to children, but we never heard that because there were no hearings, not a single hearing on the bill. There was discussion, and there were questions for some tax policy experts, but nothing in the way of hearings that could probe very deeply on what happens to kids.  I think the American people would like to know more about what will happen with the child tax credit, for example. There has been a lot of talk on the Republican side about the child tax credit; they are allegedly making it better. Well, the Senate Republican plan does increase the maximum tax credit for children from $1,000 to $2,000 per child. That sounds pretty good so far, right--$1,000 to $2,000. But because the bill limits refundability, a mom working full-time at minimum wage will see only an additional $75 in the child tax credit, while a married couple earning $500,000 would become newly eligible for the maximum $2,000-per-child credit.  According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 10 million children--10 million--live in families who would get $6.25 or less per month in the additional child tax credit in this bill. So there is not much improvement in the child tax credit on maybe the only tax reform bill that this body will consider for the next 30 years. Let's say it is only 10 years. Wouldn't it be nice to have some testimony from experts across this country who live and breathe the work of being advocates for children, who study every bill to determine whether it impacts on children. Wouldn't it be nice to have their testimony maybe on the child tax credit, maybe just on the child and dependent care tax credit, which is the only tax provision in law right now that helps people pay for childcare.  Ask any family: What is your 1 concern, other than making ends meet and maybe paying for higher education? Other than a few priorities like that, their 1 concern is how to pay for childcare, but there is no testimony on that issue that relates to the bill. There is no testimony at all because there were no hearings on the bill. How can you have a child impact statement, how can you even generalize about it without a hearing?  Of course, we need more than generalizations. We need specifics. So I think we have to ask those questions and be focused on children in a very specific way.  Here is the last thing I will say. This opportunity to come together in a bipartisan fashion, which has not happened in this case--but we have the opportunity, and the majority could have taken a different path. They could have said to us months ago: Let's have a bipartisan process. Let's not move to a pathway that requires only 51 votes. Let's have a real bipartisan process on tax reform as they did in the mid-1980s, resulting in the 1986 bill. They could have said: Do you know what? We have a bipartisan concern about children. We like the child tax credit. We like the child independent care tax credit.[[Page S7672]]We like the earned-income tax credit. All of those are good policies. We want to make them better. We want to have a bipartisan effort to infuse all of those policies with even more funding, more help to make them more robust for our children, but that never happened.  Once again, because of what the majority did, the pathway they selected to passing their bill with only Republican votes--and that was their choice--we will have a tax bill that will not have a child impact statement, will not have hearings about the impact on children and families, will not have any of that. Once again, we will prove that Washington, DC, never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity, especially as it relates to children and families. That is particularly insulting to the American people and regrettable because we have a moment here where we are trying to do tax reform and because it is not bipartisan, because there were no hearings on the bill, the impact on children will never ever be fully assessed. That is not just a tragedy, but that is a real insult to our families and to our children.  I yield the floor.

We know that hasn't happened in recent history. We will see if the Republican argument is correct.  I want to put a few facts on the record in light of the debate this afternoon. Many people in both parties have been referring to the documents of the Joint Committee on Taxation, the I am looking at one of the documents right now to go through some data. This is dated November 27. It is D-17-54 for the Joint Committee on Here is some basic data.  The Joint Committee on Taxation, which is, of course, Congress's official scorekeeper, finds that in 2019--right away, early in the implementation of the bill, if this bill is to pass and if the version we just received is to pass--the Senate plan increases taxes on nearly 13 million families earning under $200,000 a year. That is what the document tells us.  That is the under-$200,000 category and 13 million families just in 2019. If you break it down further in terms of folks making between, say, $50,000 and $75,000 and then $75,000 and $100,000, almost 20 percent of Americans earning between $50,000 and $75,000 a year will see a tax increase or a tax cut of less than $100. That works out to be about $9 a month. Those individuals will have that tax consequence in 2019. So between $50,000 and $75,000 will see either a tax increase or a tax cut of $100 or less.

738,topic-id,566,"Mr.President, on December 1, we mark World AIDS Day, reflect on the more than 35 million people who have died of HIV or AIDS, and recommit to leading the way to an AIDS-free generation.  For more than a decade, the United States has been a leader in the global fight against HIV/AIDS, and this investment has shown real returns. The progress in treatment of both adults and children living with HIV/AIDS has been dramatic. According to the World Health Organization, in 2005, only 14 percent of women received services for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission. By 2016, that number had grown to 76 percent. Since 2001, the number of children born HIV-positive has decreased by more than half.  We should not interpret these metrics of progress to mean that our work is done or that we can afford to pull back from our commitment to eradicate this epidemic. Children, in particular, remain especially vulnerable to HIV/The Elizabeth Glazer Pediatric AIDS Foundation notes that there are still 2.1 million children living with HIV, and these children are receiving treatment at rates far below that of adults. The failure to support effective and acceptable HIV services for adolescents has resulted in a 50 percent increase in reported AIDS-related deaths in this group compared with the 30 percent decline seen in the general population from 2005 to 2012, according to the World Health We must do better.  The challenge of protecting children from HIV/AIDS is not just about access to treatment. We must also continue to work to prevent mother-to-child transmission, which is the leading cause of HIV infection in children, by improving services to pregnant mothers. We do this by strengthening healthcare systems in the most affected countries and by continuing to support the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, and local nongovernmental organizations in the fight against HIV/ The bipartisan commitment to addressing the complex challenges of the HIV/AIDS epidemic remains strong. However, this year, the Trump administration proposed cutting roughly 30 percent of the international affairs budget. This is risky, short-sighted, wrong, and will dramatically impact our leadership on global health issues.  The international affairs budget supports programs that have been both instrumental in preventing and treating pediatric AIDS and in encouraging other donor countries and organizations to match our participation. Drastic cuts will impact not only our reputation and our partnerships in the international community, but will have long-term consequences we cannot clearly predict today.  The international effort to combat pediatric AIDS exemplifies the ways in which countries, local NGOs, and the private sector can come together to protect the most vulnerable among us. Last month, I was proud to work with Senator Rubio to introduce 310, a resolution to recognize the importance of a continued commitment to ending pediatric AIDS worldwide. I want to acknowledge the leadership of Congresswomen Ros-Lehtinen and Lee on a companion resolution in the House of Representatives and thank my colleagues who have joined as cosponsors of 310 thus far: Senators Blumenthal, Booker, Boozman, Coons, Durbin, Feinstein, Franken, Hatch, Isakson, King, Klobuchar, Markey, Nelson, Rubio, and Van  This bipartisan effort represents one of many steps to reinforce U.leadership in combating HIV and AIDS and in protecting children around the world.

1148,topic-id,1360,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about this motion to commit. The amendment I am offering is very simple. It states that if companies are giving executives a raise and giving more money to shareholders through dividends or stock buybacks because of this tax windfall, then workers who help make these profits possible in the first place, and who also need a break, would see their wages go up. It is as simple as that.  I hope every Member of the Senate will support this sensible amendment. By one estimate, over the last 16 years, there seems to be little to no correlation between rising corporate profits and increased wages. We have seen record corporate profits over years, and in fact profits as a percentage of the economy have nearly doubled over the past 20 years.  The New York Times tells us:       In the United States, the richest 1 percent have seen their      share of national income roughly double since 1980, to 20      percent in 2014 from 11 percent. No other nation in the 35-     member Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development      is as unequal among those with comparable tax data, and none      have experienced such a sharp rise in inequality.  Let me review that again.  From 1980 to 2014, the richest 1 percent has had its share of national income roughly double to 20 percent from 11 percent. So, since 1980, the top 1 percent has had a bonanza. It has done quite well.  What has been the case with workers?[[Page S7520]]  At the same time, wage growth has stagnated. Many have seen the reports over the last couple of years, one by the Economic Policy Institute, which indicated that, if you compare wage growth after World War II, from 1948 to about 1973, wage growth was 91 percent. Then from 1973 forward, to about 2014 or 2015, wage growth was only a total of 11 percent growth. So there was 91 percent wage growth after World War II and only 11 since then, and in many years, it was not even 11. It was stagnating.  People can go to the Economic Policy Institute's website and read that series of reports about wages and about workers, which I thought was the focus--the prime focus, I had hoped--of both parties when it came to this bill. Apparently, it is not with regard to what the majority is presenting. Those at the top are not only getting richer; they have been getting richer in a big way since 1980. That increasing rate of benefits to the wealthy continues at a fast pace in this bill and continues year after year.  The Republican tax plan gives hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars of net tax cuts to major corporations. By one estimate, the total corporate tax cut exceeds $1.3 trillion. That is trillion with a ``t.'' Some estimate that the number is even higher than that, but I will go with that lower number. There is no requirement with that corporate tax cut that any benefits go to workers' wages and no requirement that companies invest in the United States of America--no requirement at all.  So what should we do about that?  We can pass an amendment like mine to make sure that, if the executives benefit and if the shareholders benefit, the workers benefit. The workers have a lot to do with the profits. The workers have a lot to do with the productivity of the corporation. In fact, many large corporations have told shareholders exactly what they are going to do with the money they get, with the benefits that are derived from this corporate tax cut. Here is the conclusion, unfortunately: All they are going to do is to increase dividends.  Here is a report from This report is dated November 29, 2017, with the headline: ``Trump's Tax Promises Undercut by CEO Plans to Reward Investors.''  Here is the opening paragraph of the story: ``Major companies including Cisco Systems Inc., Pfizer Inc., and Coca-Cola say they'll turn over most gains from proposed corporate tax cuts to their shareholders.''  This undercuts President Donald Trump's promise that his plan will create jobs and boost wages for the middle class.  That is what that report that I am quoting from says. I will quote from it more a little bit later. That is what they tell us in that report.  What about the workers? What about the workers and their wages, which have not gone up very much over decades and, in some measure, have stagnated?  The Republicans have promised over and over that this corporate tax cut would lead to higher wages. In fact, they even put a number on it. They said $4,000, and then they said that it might go higher than $4,000 if you give this corporate tax cut. So they were not just making a broad, unspecific promise. They were making a very specific promise about what would flow from this corporate tax cut, which I would call a corporate tax giveaway. Workers are the reason that those profits exist when a corporation is profitable, and they should see the benefit of the gains from their labor.  I will go back to this Bloomberg report. It quotes Jack Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard Group, which is a major company in Jack Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard Group, spoke in New York on this very topic this week. He is quoted in this Bloomberg story from November 29.  I will just read you part of what he said: The tax proposals being debated in Washington are a ``moral abomination''--those are his words, not mine--because they favor corporations at the expense of workers--my words not his.  Here is what Jack Bogle goes on to say:       Just think about this: Corporate profits after taxes last      year were the highest they've ever been in the history of GDP      going back to 1929 . . . and we are thinking of giving relief      to the corporations at the highest levels ever. Individual      wages are at the lowest level in about 15 years as a percent      of  That is what Jack Bogle said.  He goes on to say:       So we are helping people who are doing very well and doing      nothing for the people doing very badly. One of the flaws is      that corporations are putting their shareholders ahead of the      people that built the corporation, the people who put their      heart and soul on the line and are committed to the company.       It is just the unfairness.  That is Jack Bogle of the Vanguard Group, not some Democratic source.  He finishes with these words:       But the worst part of it is that corporations are making so      much money now that they don't know what to do with it. They      aren't investing in new equipment, in innovation. They're      buying back their own stock, which helps the stock price.  He goes on to say the following:       I'm all for capitalism . . . I'm a capitalist myself. But      there is such a thing as too much.  That is what Jack Bogle said about this bill and about the effects of the corporate tax break.  Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that corporate leaders are saying the tax cut proceeds will go to shareholders, as I said, which is the exact concern that many people have about this bill, among many other concerns.  Republicans say that this tax cut is to help competitiveness and wage growth. This amendment would simply put some teeth into that promise. If because of a tax cut a company spends, say, $50 million more on executives' raises and increased dividends and stock buybacks, then it ought to have to spend $50 million, as well, to increase workers' wages. That is the effect of the amendment.  If you are truly reinvesting in your company, your complying with this amendment shouldn't be an issue, but if your only goal is to put more money at the top, then without this amendment, this tax bill is grossly unfair to workers. If you don't want to take my word for it, talk to Jack Bogle  I yield the floor.

1567,topic-id,2214,"Mr.President, I rise this evening to talk about the tax bill, which will come to the floor very soon. We have started debate, and we will be debating it the next couple of days. There is a lot to talk about, a lot of numbers, and a lot of data. I will try to limit the numbers as best I can, but it is important to review some of the numbers.  For tonight's purposes, I start with just two numbers. The first number is 59,456, and the second number is 7. What do I mean when I say 59,456? It is in dollars. The average annual tax cut for those making over $1 million a year in 2019 is $59,456. As many people know who have been following the debate, the Senate bill delayed a corporate tax cut by 1 year so most of the analysis starts in the year 2019 not 2018. So there is $59,456 of a tax cut for those making over $1 million in the first year of the bill, 2019.  What does 7 mean? Seven is also a dollar number. Seven dollars is the average monthly tax cut for Americans making between $20,000 and $30,000 a year in that same year, 2019.  If you wanted to compare the annual number of $59,456 to the annual average tax cut for that income category for the same year, it would be about $84. No matter which way you look at it, there is a basic unfairness there. Even when you apply percentages, it is very clear that folks in those lower income brackets don't get the benefit the richest among us--the superrich people making more than $1 million--get. Even if you drop down the number to over one-half million dollars and up, those folks are getting sometimes double, even triple, the tax cuts for people in the broad middle.  The one I just cited might be the most egregious example, people making $20,000 to $30,000 a year getting just $7 a month in a tax cut.  One of the reasons the bill is so stingy and so unfair when it comes to folks in the lower income brackets or even the middle-income brackets is because so much has been given in the bill to big corporations. Right? There is only a certain amount of revenue you can move around in a bill like this.  Because the corporate--and I should say the permanent corporate tax cut. The tax cuts for families is not permanent, but the permanent corporate tax cut is $1.5 trillion, and by one estimate it is $1.414 trillion over 10 years. When you allocate that much to big corporations and make it permanent, obviously, it limits your ability to help the middle class in a robust or substantial way.  I think most Americans will ask: Why don't we limit any kind of corporate tax break and apply, potentially, hundreds of billions--with a ``b''--of dollars to a bigger middle-class tax cut? But the majority so far, starting with the Finance Committee, has decided not to do that.  I just leave that for people to consider. Is it fair, when you are doing a tax bill, so-called tax reform, for the first time in three decades, that people making over $1 million who don't need $59,456--does it make sense to give them that and give the store away to corporations in a permanent fashion and give folks making $20,000 to $30,000 just 7 bucks a month or 84 bucks over the course of a year, on average?  It gets worse. The numbers get even more egregious, even more insulting. That same year, in 2019, 572,000 of our country's richest households would get $34 billion worth of tax cuts. You heard that right. In 1 year, a rather small group of Americans--572,000 of the richest households--get $34 billion of a tax cut in just that 1 year. That $34 billion in that 1 year for the richest among us gets even higher if you add in other provisions, other tax cuts, but I will be conservative and just limit it to the $34 billion.  Some people might ask: Well, what about the rest of the country or most of the country? What is left? Well, if you compare that $34 billion for a relatively small group of the wealthiest, if you compare that to 90 million--my arms don't stretch out far enough to compare 572 taxpayers with 90 million. What happens to 90 million taxpayers who happen to make under $50,000? A couple of minutes ago I talked about $20,000 to $30,000. Now we are talking about everyone below $50,000 in a year. That is about 90 million people. What happens to them? Well, they get a grand total of $14 billion, and some even see a tax increase. So let's leave the tax increase for people making less than $50,000 off the table for now because some will get a tax increase, and some will get a benefit. So it is hard to comprehend that 90 million people divvy up $14 billion, but a tiny fraction of that--572,000 people--get $34 billion just in 2019. Then you have 2020 and 2021, and they keep getting those dollar amounts.  Some people might say: Well, you know, everyone should get a tax cut in a bill like this, and even if the wealthy get a tax cut, that is the way Washington works. I have described this bill this way over and over again, and I will keep describing it this way. It is a giveaway. It is a giveaway to the superrich. It is certainly a giveaway to big corporations. They get $1.5 trillion, and it is permanent.  There have been a lot of analyses done of this bill, and there are lots of stories to point to. I just point to one that came out just yesterday. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities came out with a report that is a little more than seven pages' worth. They do reports like this on a regular basis, sometimes more than one report in a week. I know folks can't read it from a distance, but here is what the headline says: ``JCT Estimates''--Joint Committee on Taxation, that is the acronym--Joint Committee on Taxation estimates ``Amended Senate Tax Bill Skewed to Top, Hurts Many Low- and Middle-Income Americans.'' That is what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said yesterday. So what they are analyzing is not the original proposal folks in the Senate Republican caucus offered. This is the amended Senate bill.  Here is what they say, in pertinent part. I will just read maybe two sentences.       Under the amended bill, in 2025 (when most of its      provisions would be in place), high-income households would      get the largest tax cuts as a share of after-tax income, on      average, while households with incomes below $30,000 would on      average face a tax increase. By 2027, when many of its      provisions would have expired, those at the top would still      get large tax cuts, but every income group below--[[Page S7355]]  I will read that again.     --every income group below $75,000 would face tax increases,      on average.  You heard that right--tax increases on average. So whether you look at it in the year 2019 for people making $20,000 to $30,000 or 2019 for people making under $50,000 and compare that to the wealthiest among us or whether you look at it in terms of what happens just a few years later in 2025, you can see the basic unfairness of this.  Just at a time when we have this great opportunity to do a number of things which would not only turbocharge the economy and potentially lift families out of poverty--and certainly lift children out of poverty--just when we have the opportunity to simplify the code, to help middle-class families in a substantial and robust way, not the stingy way the bill does it, to the point where some might get a tax break one year that is very limited and then that goes away and their taxes go up and others are losing healthcare because of the repeal of the individual mandate--what is most egregious here is maybe not even the giveaways. That is egregious enough. What is outrageous is, the giveaways happen, and the debt is run up to do that. Then, on top of all that, we miss an opportunity, as Washington often does. There is an old expression that Washington never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity. This is an opportunity to give the middle class maybe a record tax cut, but the majority has chosen not to do that. This is also an opportunity to lift a lot more children out of poverty with a much more generous child tax credit, a much more substantial commitment to lifting kids out of poverty, because we have a bill that allows us to do that, a big tax bill that only comes around once every couple of decades, potentially. The last time this was done was 31 years ago. So this is a critically important moment for the middle class, a critically important moment for children--middle-income children but also children from low-income families who don't get a lot of help under current policy.  Now, some people might ask: Well, how have the rich done over the last number of years? Maybe some might want to make the argument--the ridiculous argument, but they might want to make it--that somehow the rich need a little help. Well, let's see what has happened since 1980. Since 1980, the richest 1 percent have seen their share of national income almost double--double--from 11 percent to 20 percent in 2014, the last time this was measured. So the richest 1 percent, in about 35 years, have seen their share of all national income almost double. So the richest 1 percent have been doing pretty well over the decades since 1980. Do they really need yet another tax cut? Do they really need tens of billions of dollars split or divvied up among a very small number of Americans? I don't think so, and I think most Americans would agree with me.  According to the New York Times, no other nation in the 35-member Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development--the so-called OECD countries, 35 countries, and we are one of them--no other country has seen this widening of the gap between the richest and everyone else. You could see it in the other example. The richest small number in America get $34 billion, and then 90 million people have to split a number that is less than half that. That is really an insult to who we are as  That same JCT--the Joint Committee on Taxation--their estimate of the Republican bill shows that households earning over $1 million would get an average tax cut about 73 times larger than households earning between $50,000 and $75,000 in 2019, that same year, the first year.  We can go on and on with these comparisons, but I want to go back to the number I started with, that $59,000 number. If you keep the dollar sign on it, and use it for another purpose, you have just arrived at roughly the median household income for the United States of So the median household income is about $59,000. That is the median household income all across the country. That number happens to be roughly the same number as the $59,456, the average annual tax cut for those making over $1 million in 2019.  There are lots of other ways to describe the bill. The bill raises $134 billion on the backs of hard-working Americans by changing how the Tax Code measures inflation. Not many people are paying attention to this, but the measurement is going to change if the bill passes. This number only grows over time.  For someone who is just starting out in their professional life, they would see this change haunt their paychecks for the next 50 years. So they are going to change how the Tax Code measures inflation. Not many people know that, and I think they are starting to find out.  If all of that wasn't enough, this bill would do a number of other things which are particularly destructive. It will reward companies that have outsourced jobs, it will increase healthcare premiums by an average of an additional 10 percent a year, and it is going to give, at the same time, obscene tax cuts to the superrich by, at the same time, increasing taxes on the middle class.  So when I described this bill last week in the Finance Committee as a thief in the night, I didn't choose those words casually; I meant every word of it. It is a thief in the night because of what the adverse impact on middle-class families and lower income families trying to get to the middle class would be, compared to what happens to the wealthiest among us. So it is robbing people of an opportunity to get a better tax cut for the middle class and giving away the store to the rich.  I will have more to say about this, but I see the majority leader is on the floor.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-28-pt1-PgS7351-2.txt,1828,"BROWNFIELDS ENHANCEMENT, ECONOMIC REDEVELOPMENT, AND REAUTHORIZATION",2017,28,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2243,topic-id,2248,"Mr.President, I wish to go back to a point I made earlier when I was describing--both in terms of the substance of the bill and the process that has been undertaken to pass the bill--why, the week before Thanksgiving, I used the expression that the bill was, in fact, ``a thief in the night'' and what I meant by that. In the same bill, we have these inequities that I just described where the wealthiest are getting $34 billion in a tax cut--a giveaway, really, just in the first year, and then that continues--and 90 million Americans get less than half of that. That is, in my judgment, robbing those families of an opportunity to get a bigger tax cut and to have the wealthiest among us sacrifice a little bit for the middle class and for those trying to get to the middle class. It gets worse from there because, in addition to that, repealing of the individual mandate has a healthcare consequence.  We know that the Congressional Budget Office told us that because of what would happen as a result of the repeal of the individual mandate, 4 million people would lose their healthcare in the first year and 13 million over the course of 10 years. So it is entirely possible--we don't know the exact number, but it is entirely possible--that lots of Americans would, in the same year or certainly over time, have two adverse consequences. One, they would either not get much of a tax cut or their tax cut or any tax change would turn into a tax increase, and they would lose their healthcare because of the effects of one part of the bill. So, at the same time, in the same bill, some will lose their healthcare because of the bill and others will see their taxes go up, or worse, maybe the same thing will happen to the same individual, the same family. All that is happening in a bill that is speeding through this  Here is how defective the process has been. The Senate bill was introduced on a Thursday, and then voted out of the Finance Committee the following Thursday, and now the majority is trying to pass the bill this So from Thursday to Thursday to Thursday is the entire consideration of a bill that has not had one hearing--not a single hearing. Oh, yes, we had time in the committee the week before Thanksgiving to pose questions to the Joint Committee on Taxation--tax experts--or to staff, and that is part of the process. But a tax bill like this, which comes around every three decades and will have an impact, by one estimate, of $9 trillion to $10 trillion, doesn't have a single hearing and doesn't have the kind of due consideration that would allow people to examine it and allow taxpayers to examine the detail of this bill and the consequences that would flow from that--the adverse consequences--and be able to say: Hey, wait a minute. Maybe I am one of those people. Maybe I am one of those individuals whose taxes will go up or I don't get much of a tax cut and, on top of that, I lose my healthcare. I think any American who would be so adversely affected should have the time and the opportunity to examine this legislation, either themselves or through the debate that is undertaken by Senators or through reading news accounts.  The only good news here is that newspapers across the country, especially, and think tanks who are analyzing this bill are providing the American people information. But the debate is so limited that very little of the debate here in the Senate will land on the kitchen tables of Americans who will be affected.  So when I say that this is a thief in the night, I mean it by way of the substance of the bill where people are robbed of healthcare, potentially, and certainly robbed of an opportunity to either get a substantial middle-class tax cut or, in some cases, they get no tax cut at all because their taxes go up and, at the same time, they are losing healthcare.  This whole process has been cloaked in darkness and has been infused with secrecy. I got a letter the other day from a taxpayer who said to me: I am worried about the impact on--it was from a mom talking about her family--on my family and my children. She said: I don't know enough about this. I can sympathize with her because Democratic Senators were in a committee 2 weeks ago when this bill was presented to us, with not a single hearing on the bill.  My colleagues may recall what happened in 1985 and 1986. President Reagan came up with a proposal that was almost 500 pages in length. There was a lot of detail about his administration's priorities on tax reform. His proposal got 27 hearings in the Finance Later, when the House passed a bill in--I guess it was in the beginning of 1986--they passed a tax reform bill that went to the Senate, and that House bill in 1986 got six hearings in the Finance So if you add the review of the detailed Reagan proposal--almost 500 pages--to the actual hearings on a specific bill, we are talking about 33 hearings. That is the kind of review one would expect. I would settle for 10 or 15 hearings on something this substantial.  So we are basically saying that we are supposed to accept a bill that has gotten very little review and no hearing, and then wait for 20 years from now or 30 years from now to have another opportunity.  This is a joke. This is an insult to the American people, when we have a bill that will have such an impact on every American and is getting very little in the way of scrutiny.  I know the hour is late. I will just make a few more points, especially when it comes to our children. There has been a lot of talk about what this bill could do to help children. A lot of Americans know about the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit. Those two provisions alone in our law have lifted more children out of poverty than almost anything we have ever done in the Congress in decades,[[Page S7364]]literally. It has had that kind of an impact. So shouldn't we use these two vehicles that have lifted millions of children and families out of poverty--the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit--and strengthen them? Shouldn't we make them more robust so that more children could be lifted out of poverty? The answer is yes.  We have an opportunity here. Senator Brown and Senator Bennet introduced a bill that then became an amendment in the debate, which I and so many other Democratic Senators joined them on, to strengthen the child tax credit, as well as the earned income tax credit.  Here is the basic information about where we are with the child tax credit. The proposal by some Republican Senators to strengthen the child tax credit in the bill is also woefully deficient and woefully short of what families should expect from a big tax reform bill that is supposed to help folks with the child tax credit.  The Senate Republican plan increases the maximum child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per child. It sounds pretty good so far--$1,000 up to $2,000. It sounds pretty good so far, but because the bill limits refundability, a mom working full time at minimum wage will only see an additional $75 in the child tax credit, while a married couple earning $500,000 would become newly eligible. So in the Republican bill, wealthy families earning up to $500,000 of income are newly eligible for help, with the child tax credit, for the maximum credit of $2,000 per child. The working mom who has a low income gets a child tax credit of $75, which is not much help, but the family making $500,000 would be getting a $2,000 child tax credit. Anyone knows that is woefully short.  We can do better than that. We are a great country. We have the greatest economy in the world, we have the strongest military in the world, and we have a lot of good tax policies that have helped lift families out of poverty. Both parties have helped support those provisions over the years. This isn't just a Democratic priority; a lot of Republicans make this a priority as well.  This is the moment to do it. This is a big tax bill. We could make the child tax credit so generous and so substantial that you could turbocharge--use any word you want--you could turbocharge the effort to get young children out of poverty. But the Republicans won't do it because they are stingy on the child tax credit changes, just as they are stingy on the middle-class tax cut.  The source I cited earlier for the November 27 report, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities--you can go to their website. It is easy. Just type in four letters--CBPP--and you can find these reports. What do they say about the child tax credit provisions? The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that 10 million children live in families who would get $6.25 or less per month in additional child tax credit help--less than 1 hour of work at the minimum wage. So for 10 million children, this brandnew proposal on the child tax credit adds up to $6.25 or less per month. Even in a very low-income family, $6.25 a month doesn't get you much in terms of help for your children.  We have a lot to do in a short timeframe to let the American people know what is in this bill. Whether it is very limited tax relief for a lot of middle-class families or whether it is the outrage that so many Americans' taxes will go up--over time, especially--or whether it is the giveaways to the richest among us, there are so many outrages and so many insults in one bill, it is difficult to catalog all of them.  I hope that if we have a vote on the Senate floor, this bill will be defeated. Guess what can happen then. We can get to a different chapter on tax reform, just like we started to get to on healthcare. After the healthcare bill was voted down in July, everyone said that somehow there would be no engagement on healthcare after that, that the two sides would go into their corners and there would be no discussion. Within hours, if not days, of that happening, Democrats and Republicans came together on healthcare. On that topic on which there is supposed to be very little, if any, consensus or cooperation or bipartisanship, they came together and then had hearings in early People forget this, but it happened. In the first 2 weeks of September, we listened to Governors from both parties, insurance commissioners, and healthcare policy experts. Guess what we got. We got a bipartisan bill to help stabilize the market, to make sure we were coming together to try to solve at least one substantial problem in our healthcare system--not to cure every problem but to come together in a bipartisan way to fix the problem.  We could undertake a similar process on tax reform. We could start in December or January--whenever the majority wants to start--have lots of hearings, examine these issues, and figure out whether there is a bipartisan way to make the child tax credit more generous.  We have a moment here. We have a big bill. We could lift a lot more children out of poverty. Isn't there a way to make the middle-class tax relief much more robust and substantial? Instead of giving a $300 or $400 tax cut, maybe we could say: Let's come together on a bipartisan bill and give a tax cut that is worth $1,000--or maybe several thousand dollars--to the middle class and to middle-class families. We could do that. Democrats and Republicans could come together.  We could even come together on providing corporate relief. No one on our side doesn't believe that corporations should get a break, but when you reduce a corporate tax rate from 35 to 20--just do the math. It is $100 billion per point, so that is $1.5 trillion. That forecloses the option of making middle-class tax cuts even more generous. It limits the options to help families who are struggling to get into the middle class, who are going to work every day, sometimes working two jobs, making the minimum wage or higher than minimum wage, and they need a little bit of help with the child tax credit or other provisions.  We have an opportunity here to do tax reform the right way--not in the dark of night, not a one-party fiat or a one-party bill that gets rushed through and then we are supposed to accept this as good tax policy for the next 10, 20, 30 years. That is not the way to do tax reform. That is not the way it was done when Ronald Reagan was here, working with Democrats and That is not the way we should do it.  We will have more to say later in the week.  At this time, I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-28-pt1-PgS7363.txt,1828,ENHANCING VETERAN CARE ACT,2017,28,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
275,topic-id,1980,"Mr.President, I would like to comment on the positive aspects of the bill we are about to vote on.  The most positive thing I can say about this is that working families and middle-income families across the Nation will be better off. Families who over the last 8 years have not done well will begin to do better.  Now, we have already discussed some of the things that others have discussed. Let me just comment briefly:  We have doubled the standard deduction to make filing of income taxes simpler. For most Americans, that will be a tax cut by doubling that standard deduction.  We have provisions in there to stimulate the economy, to create competition for workers so workers will now have a choice of one job or another. When that happens, of course, their wages rise, and their benefits get better.  We incentivize companies that are, right now, moving overseas--because the taxes are so much lower elsewhere--to stay in the United States, to create American jobs, and to pay more American taxes.  Those are all good things my colleagues have discussed. Let me discuss some other ways perhaps that this bill benefits working families and middle-class families.  I am from an energy Louisiana produces so much oil and gas. The thing about energy jobs is it creates jobs for good families. They may not have a college education, but they are good people. They care about their children. In these jobs, they can earn over $100,000 a year in certain aspects of it, and they employ Americans in a way that Americans have kind of forgotten that it can be that way.  It is meaningful to me. We were in Illinois when I was born. My family moved to Louisiana because someone called my father and said: You know, Jim, if you move to Louisiana, you can sell to the people working at Esso, and you can make a good living.  So even though my father didn't work in the energy industry, he was one of those who benefited and made a living, which allowed me to go to medical school. I was the first generation in our family to go to college and go to medical school, and now I am a U.What an incredible privilege, all created by energy jobs.  One thing this bill does is it opens up a little more of Alaska for energy development--2,000 acres. One of my colleagues said smaller than the airport in Fargo, I have never been there, but 2,000 acres is not a whole lot of land, But on those 2,000 acres, there is a lot of oil beneath.  Why is that important? We as a country can make a decision to be energy secure or not. If we are going to be energy secure, it means we are going to produce our own energy. This is not to rule out renewables, but for the moment we are going to continue as a country to consume natural gas and oil. We can buy it from countries such as in the Middle East where environmental standards are not as strict as ours, but when we do that, not only are we sending our jobs and revenue overseas, but we are also, in effect, endorsing their lower environmental standards, and that overall pollutes the environment.  On the other hand, if we buy from ourselves--using American workers, creating American jobs, using American environmental standards--not only do we get the benefits to the family and the benefits to the environment, but we have the national security benefit of being able to be energy secure.  Now, this is powerful. I first became aware of it, I think, in middle or maybe elementary school. I went to Luke's Episcopal There was a guy there named What a great name, Thor told me his father was a pipefitter and was at that moment in Alaska working on the Alaska That was 40 years ago, so maybe my memory is a little fuzzy on everything but Thor's name. The point is, a fellow from Louisiana was going to Alaska, making great money, being able to provide for his family back home. That is a good thing.  As we develop our energy resources on the North Slope of Alaska, using American environmental standards, creating American jobs, we are changing the life of families like my family and for perhaps the family of the man I remember going to middle school with long ago.  I mentioned Thor's father was a pipefitter. Now, it is not just on those 2,000 acres. There will be a way of transporting that oil that is produced elsewhere. In South Louisiana, we make boats--boats that actually work off rigs and can create jobs both in the boatyard and in the maritime industry.  Thor's father was a pipefitter. You pipe out your oil, and you create jobs in that way. That comes to mind because when I was first elected to the Senate, I was going to a committee hearing, and some union fellows from Ohio came up to me to ask that I endorse the construction of the Keystone XL Of course, I have always been in favor of it so they had my vote, but they made the point: We are union laborers. We work on the job. When we say there is $40,000 created in the building of a pipeline--sure, we may only be on the job for 6 weeks, but then we go to another job for 6 more weeks and another job for 6 more weeks.[[Page S7687]]  I was struck that these working families benefit not from the actual production of America's natural resources but from the transportation of America's natural resources. So the economic benefit to working and middle-income families doesn't just stop with those who are perhaps doing the drilling, but it continues downstream and, as I mentioned earlier, even extends to a family like mine.  Now, let me mention another aspect of this that brings benefits to our working families and to our middle-class families. One thing I was helpful with was the restoration of the historic tax credit. The historic tax credit is a Federal tax credit first made permanent by President Ronald Reagan that allows somebody to go to an older building in a community and to restore it, returning it to commerce. So instead of a portion of our architectural heritage being destroyed, it is refurbished and is there for future generations to enjoy. More than the kind of aesthetics of seeing an older building become beautiful once more, it creates jobs.  Now, let's go back to this legislation, creating better jobs for working and middle-income families. First, it affects everybody. More than 40 percent of the projects under the historic tax credit program in the last 15 years have been in towns of less than 25,000 people. In my State, since 2002, the historic tax credit has contributed to 782 projects being built, bringing $2.2 billion worth of investment into these cities and towns across my  Now, when you have that much money, you create lots of jobs. It is thought, nationwide, according to the study by the National Park Service, the historic tax credit has encouraged more than $131 billion in private investment, rehabbing 42,000 buildings, creating more than 2.4 million trade jobs, returning a net positive to the U. Since fiscal year 2002, in Louisiana alone, it has, again, fostered more than $2.5 billion in private investment, creating more than 38,000 jobs. These are jobs--construction jobs, rehabilitation jobs--that allow a family to live with a good living wage. That is part of this legislation.  I should mention one thing in particular very topical on the historic tax credit. The World Trade Center of New Orleans is currently being refurbished. It was built in the 1960s and is being transformed into a world-class hotel condominium complex. It brings the city of New Orleans $400 million in infrastructure spending, 1,600 jobs in construction trades, as well as more than 450 permanent, full-time jobs. Instead of a crumbling eyesore, you have a jewel, but more than a jewel, you have 1,600 jobs created and 450 permanent jobs.  Let me mention the last thing that benefits working and middle-class families. My friends on the other side of the aisle talked about supposed negative effects on Social Security and I am a doctor. I have been working in the public hospital system of Louisiana for 25 years. I understand the importance of safety net programs, if you will, like Medicare that allow our senior citizens to have the healthcare they need.  The dirty little secret is that, according to the people who run Medicare and Social Security, those trust funds are going bankrupt--bankrupt. Under the Obama administration, they tried to address it by raising taxes, so they put a higher income tax on people, and the trust funds are still going bankrupt. Under ObamaCare, there were different things to try to save money within the system, delivery system reforms, and some are, frankly, good ideas--although I opposed ObamaCare, in general, some of these were good ideas, and I continue to endorse them--and the trust funds are still going bankrupt. So it raised taxes, we are trying to save money, and the trust funds are still going bankrupt. What can we do to try and rescue these programs that are so significant, so important to senior citizens, to all of us in this country--Social Security and Medicare in particular.  What about economic growth? I did an analysis once with another man which shows that if we just return to the economic growth that is common in our country--about 3.5 percent GDP growth per year--we will fully fund our trust funds for Medicare and Social  Keep in mind, although we are cutting rates for corporations, the rates for funding Medicare and Social Security are staying where they are. So if our economy is doing better year over year, there will be more money going into these trust funds, not because the rates are higher--the rates remain the same--but because there is more money to apply the rates to.  Is it reasonable to have that kind of growth? From 1946 to the beginning of President Obama's administration, through 10.5 recessions--including one-half of the great recession--we averaged over 3 percent growth as a country. Now, under President Obama's Presidency, it was about 2 percent growth, and 2 percent versus 3.5 is all the difference in the world because it compounds. It goes like this if it is 2 percent, it goes like this if it is 3.5 percent, and at the end of 10, 15, or 20 years, those differences are remarkable.  I will say, under President Trump, for the last two quarters we have had over 3 percent GDP growth. Republicans take over, and the economy begins to do better. In the next quarter, it is estimated that it will be over 3 percent. With this legislation, increasing the amount of money families have in their pockets, building out our energy resources as we are in Alaska, creating jobs for Americans across the way, using things like the historic tax credit, returning money to the Treasury, but also creating American jobs will create that prosperity, that economic growth, so that instead of the 2-percent growth that we have had for the last 8 years, we have the 3.5-percent growth that we historically have had. That is a promise of this legislation. That will restore funding for Social Security and That is the answer that has eluded the other side.  Mr.President, before I yield back, I ask unanimous consent that there now be 30 minutes, equally divided, for debate only, with no amendments or motions in order, and with the majority leader being recognized at the conclusion of that time.

346,topic-id,585,"Mr.President, today I wish to discuss the historic rehabilitation tax credit. During the Finance Committee markup of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the committee adopted my amendment to return the historic rehabilitation tax credit to the 20 percent level, with the credit now claimed over 5 years, as well as a transition rule to grandfather approved and underway projects under the prior law and regulations.  The historic rehabilitation tax credit program provides jobs and investment in communities across the country. More than 40 percent of projects over the past 15 years have been located in communities with populations less than 25,000 people. Since 2002, the historic rehabilitation tax credit has facilitated 782 projects in Louisiana, bringing more than $2.2 billion of investment into cities and towns across the I am pleased this important provision will be preserved in tax reform.  For purposes of the transition rule in my amendment, ``taxpayer'' refers to the person who undertakes the rehabilitation of a building. In the case where a person makes an election under section 48(d), the term ``taxpayer'' means the lessor, since the lessor is the person who undertook the rehabilitation. It is intended that the historic rehabilitation tax credits be available during the transition period only to the extent such credits would have been available under the prior law and regulations.  Mr.President, I am proud of the work we have done in the Senate to develop a bill that delivers tax cuts to working families and significantly improves the competitiveness of our Tax This will lead to greater investment, more jobs and opportunity, and an increase in economic growth.  I would like to take a moment to highlight an important, unresolved issue that we should consider as we work toward putting a bill on the President's desk.  Families in Louisiana are particularly prone to the negative impacts of natural disasters. From Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to historic flooding in multiple parts of the state during 2016, we have unfortunately seen some significant losses in our State; yet as we saw once again with the recent Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Louisianans are resilient and watchful of neighbors through the tragedy and the recovery.  One aspect of recovery that many people don't see is the enormous amount of capital that flows into the storm zone from the reinsurance industry. In simple terms, reinsurance is insurance for insurance companies, and it helps Louisianans rebuild their homes, their businesses, and their lives.  Reinsurance transfers risk from the balance sheets of property and casualty insurance carriers so those companies can provide cost-effective solutions to consumers and businesses. A robust reinsurance market helps ensure that policyholders are getting the best rates possible on insurance for their homes and businesses. Many of the largest reinsurers in the world were founded in Europe 100 years ago or more, and a number of them do business in the United States through U.subsidiaries.  My concern is the potential impact of the bill's base erosion provision on the reinsurance market and policyholders along the gulf coast. The base erosion provision has the rightful intent of targeting bad actors who implement strategies to avoid U.taxes; yet the provision may have an unintended consequence of negatively impacting cross-border reinsurers conducting normal transactions, which could affect the market and premiums.  Reinsurance is critical to families and businesses in Louisiana, particularly after a natural disaster, and I hope to work with my Senate and House colleagues on this matter as we work to get the bill to the President's desk.

Three did not. Matthew and two of his fellow Navy servicemen lost their lives in service to our country.  This is a terrible tragedy. Our hearts go out to Matthew's family--his mother, Marty, and father, Phillip, his fellow sailors, and his friends in We grieve with them.  As one of his former high school classmates said, Matthew could have had any scholarship he ever wanted to any school. He could have gone anywhere he wanted. He just believed that serving our country was first. That was his everything. Others who knew him described Matthew as smart, dedicated, and a strong leader. They said he could always make those around him laugh with his dry sense of humor and smile.  As Americans, we mourn the loss of Naval Airman Matthew As folks from Louisiana, we mourn the loss of one of our own, but we honor his memory and the example he set for those of us who benefited from his willingness to sacrifice. We thank him for choosing to serve, for his sacrifice. We are forever grateful.  I yield the floor.

This is a bipartisan bill condemning the Burmese military's systemic attacks on the Rohingya in Rakhine  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank especially Congressman Crowley from New York for working together in a bipartisan manner on this legislation and also with Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel and so many others.  As someone who has chaired the Foreign Affairs Committee on Asia and the Pacific and who has been to Burma and met with Aung San Suu Kyi and followed Burma very closely, what has happened there is truly shocking and disheartening, and really a blot on the world in how this has been handled up to this point in many ways.  The Rohingya have long been at the fringes of Burmese society and it is no secret that the Burmese military regards them as outsiders who don't even belong in Burma at all. That is why the military used some attacks back in August by a rogue group of Rohingya as a pretext to terrorize the entire Rohingya population.  This campaign of terror and violence has demonically worked. Over 600,000 Rohingya have fled Burma for Bangladesh, and at least 250,000 of those people are children.  Further, credible human rights organizations and the media have documented numerous horrors and abuses, including rape, murder, and torture. The most unspeakable things have happened there.  Together, these atrocities amount to what has been called ``a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.''  Unfortunately, Burma's constitution ensures that the Burmese military controls much of the government in Burma, while Burma's civilian government has proved incapable of taking appropriate action to address this violence. Since the Burmese military began its ethnic cleansing campaign, it has gone on and on.

1998,topic-id,1992,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 631, which provides a closed rule for consideration of H.3017, Brownfields Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment, and Reauthorization Act of 2017; and a structured rule for H.3905, Minnesota's Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest  Mr.Speaker, brownfield refers normally to abandoned or closed commercial or industrial properties that may be contaminated because of their prior use. These sites often represent a tremendous amount of untapped economic potential. However, developing that potential is complicated by the presence of hazardous substances or contaminants.  The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that there are more than 50,000 brownfields in the United The brownfields program has enjoyed broad bipartisan support and has been critical in converting these vacant sites into tax-generating properties and, eventually, well-paying jobs for American citizens.  As of May 1, 2017, the program has assessed 26,722 sites, and they have leveraged over 124,760 jobs. On average, Mr.Speaker, over $16 is leveraged for every EPA brownfields dollar spent, and 8.5 jobs are leveraged per $100,000 of EPA brownfields funds.  States all over the country have benefited from this grant program. In my home State of Wyoming, we put brownfield grants to use in cities like Casper, Cheyenne, Sheridan, Evanston, Kemmerer, Laramie, and  Brownfield sites have been revitalized using these funds in places like the Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas; development in the neighborhoods around Danville, Illinois; and the Grijalva Park at Santiago Creek in Orange,  The brownfields program has been expired, Mr.Speaker, since 2006, and it is high time we reauthorize this critically important grant program.  The brownfields program has enabled local communities to clean up and repurpose vacated sites, utilizing them for meaningful economic development, while responsibly cleaning up hazardous sites. This is an important step in maintaining and improving what has been a demonstrably effective program.  Mr.Speaker, the rule we consider today also provides for consideration of a very important bill, H.3905, Minnesota's Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest Act, which was introduced by my colleague, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.Emmer).  H.3905 requires congressional approval of any mineral withdrawal or monument designation involving the National Forest System lands in the State of Minnesota and provides for the renewal of certain mineral leases in those lands.  This is necessary, Mr.Speaker, because in the final hours of the Obama administration, the administration withdrew hundreds of thousands of acres in Minnesota from mineral development and improperly terminated two Federal mineral leases.  The effect of this decision halted potential mining projects in Minnesota, robbing the region of 650 direct and 1,300 indirect jobs, as well as the tax revenue the mining operation would bring.  Mining jobs, Mr.Speaker, are good, high-paying jobs. The average mining wage in Minnesota is roughly $25,000 a year higher than the average wage in the  Coming from a State where we mine more coal than any State in the Nation, I understand and appreciate the economic development mining projects can bring to a region. We also understand the burden that can be imposed by working with the Federal Government on these projects in  Roughly half my State, Mr.Speaker, is comprised of Federal lands. Receiving the appropriate authorizations to drill or mine on these lands can be a lengthy and cumbersome process that delays projects for many years.  Ultimately, Mr.Speaker, we must improve our Federal regulatory process so we can better harness the vast natural resources we have in our country, while still protecting and conserving our environment.  Therefore, Mr.Speaker, I encourage support for the rule for these important bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, today's rule provides for the consideration of two bills.  The first piece of legislation, H.3017, is a bipartisan compromise to extend the EPA's brownfields program. The successful brownfields program assists communities across this country in cleaning up contaminated sites to reduce pollution and health risks and spur economic development.  Although funding for this program has enjoyed broad support over the years, its authorization lapsed in 2006; 11 years ago. It is certainly long past time for this important program to be reauthorized. I appreciate the work of Republicans and Democrats on both the Energy and Commerce and Transportation and Infrastructure Committees in coming together to produce this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, this is how the process is supposed to work. There was a hearing, and there was a markup. I should[[Page H9480]]say, for the Record, the majority could have issued an open rule, instead of a closed rule. But I am not even going to criticize that today, Mr.Speaker, because experts on this issue came together to negotiate it in a bipartisan manner, and the result is a good piece of legislation that I look forward to voting for later this week.  I commend Mr.McKinley, Mr.Tonko, Mr.Pallone, and all those who worked together, and I just want to say for the Record, as one who routinely gets up here and criticizes the majority for issuing closed rules and structured rules all the time, I do so not just as a knee-jerk reaction to what they produce in the Rules I do it because usually they do closed rules and structured rules to basically stifle a deliberative process. They do it to shut off debate and to shut out other people's opinions. Quite frankly, the majority's record on rules is abysmal.  In this case, what we are doing is bringing forward something that represents a bipartisan process. I wish this wasn't an anomaly. I wish that the majority would understand that, in the House of Representatives, the views of Democrats are just as important as the views of If you want to get things done, you need to come together in the spirit of compromise and work together for the good of the American people, not just for the good of one political party, not just so you can issue a press release, not just so you can play gotcha games, but actually produce things that are meaningful.  If the Republican leadership would drop their all-or-nothing approach to governing more often, support genuine bipartisan negotiations and compromise, and open up the process on all pieces of legislation, both minor and substantial, we might be able to get something done around here. Maybe we could have more than 12 bills of any sort of real significance signed into law.  This rule also brings to the floor legislation, I am sad to say, that would do irreparable harm to our federally protected land by allowing a foreign company the ability to use a half-century-old lease to mine right next door to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area  H.3905 would allow a Chilean mining company, which is facing tens of millions of dollars in fines from the Chilean Government for their failure to protect nearby water resources, the ability to mine just upstream of pristine U.S.-protected land.  This is all based on a 50-year-old lease--a lease that didn't go through any environmental review because NEPA didn't exist yet. There are Members of this Chamber who weren't even born when this lease was signed.  My colleagues in the majority will claim that this bill will help create jobs, but what about the 22,000 jobs that the local protected land already supports?  What will happen to those jobs when the water is so polluted that no one can visit the recreational area around the mine?  The truth is, this isn't about jobs. It is about helping a few rich owners of mining companies line their pockets at the expense of the environment. In fact, the recipient of this Republican handout is a subsidiary of a Chilean company, Antofagasta, which is controlled by Chilean billionaire Andronico Luksic And get this: he just happens to be the landlord of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, President Trump's daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers to the Trump White  You cannot make this stuff up. This is part of a pattern of sketchy deals and questionable business contacts involving the President and his family and their closest advisers.  Earlier this month, we learned that President Trump and his family made millions through a hotel in Panama financed by Colombian drug cartels and the Russian We still don't even know how these new deals will boost President Trump's income or how his family profits off of the Presidency, because we are 312 days into his Presidency, and we still haven't seen his tax returns.  Imagine if this were Hillary Imagine if this were Barack Imagine the screams on the other side of the aisle demanding transparency and an open process. But when it comes to covering up all these sketchy deals on behalf of this President of the United States, there is silence.  President Trump promised to drain the swamp, but, instead, he has created a cesspool. There are so many conflicts of interest, this administration is on a collision course with corruption.  Mr.Speaker, we have only 6 legislative days left before the government runs out of money, but the Speaker of the House thinks another corporate handout, this time to Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump's landlord, is the most pressing issue that needs to be resolved in Congress this week.  If the Speaker wants some suggestions as things we ought to focus on this week, I know Democrats in this Chamber have a few. I can give you an example.  Democrats think we should be debating a funding bill to avert the coming shutdown on December 8, when the temporary spending bill expires.  Democrats want to debate and pass the Dream Act, ending the turmoil this President has caused by upending the lives of 800,000 young immigrant DREAMers and their families.  Democrats want to extend the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, and community health centers, whose authorization expired 2 months ago.  Democrats think we ought to debate flood insurance reauthorization, which expires on December 8.  Democrats want to pass additional hurricane relief to help those who are still recovering from devastating hurricanes in Texas, Florida, and Puerto  Democrats want to address funding for the Veterans Choice Program, which is set to run out of money before the end of the year.  But instead, here we are, considering yet another ridiculous, extreme antienvironment bill.  Mr.Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle love talking about returning this country to the way it used to be. I have seen the Make America Great Again stickers on many of their cars.  I can think of no pastime more important or more significant to our national heritage and identity than our wilderness and protected areas. My friends and colleagues who have spent time in the Boundary Waters tell me how stunning it is. They say it is one of the most beautiful places in our country. And we are going to risk polluting this national treasure with copper-sulfide acid drainage running into the streams that feed the Boundary Waters?  Worse yet, this bill makes these mining leases impossible to ever overturn, even should the Bureau of Land Management conclude its environmental assessment and rule against further mining in this protected national forest.  This is a slippery slope. If we continue to allow corporations to pillage our federally protected wilderness areas, we are opening the door to irreversible damage. What is next? Clear-cutting in Yellowstone Forest? Oil drilling off the coast of Acadia National Park?  Mr.Speaker, I beg my Republican friends to drop this assault on our public lands and urge the leadership of this House to bring up the urgent bills and priorities that we need to deal with before adjourning in less than 3 weeks' time.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and to oppose efforts that will further degrade our natural resources.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

1999,topic-id,1162,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I think it is important to be clear about exactly what H.3905 does.  H.3905 does not eliminate environmental requirements. In fact, it will only allow mining as long as those strict environmental requirements are met. What it does do is allow Minnesota itself to advance its State and local economies.  I applaud my colleague from Massachusetts' commitment and dedication to working together to try and come up with solutions about things like, for example, funding the government. I will just point out that if Democrats were, in fact, so dedicated to working with Republicans to fund the government and to begin to come to a solution, to come to an agreement, perhaps[[Page H9481]]their leadership would have shown up yesterday at the White House to have meetings and discussions about funding the government. It is awfully hard to claim that you are very dedicated and committed to that concept if you don't have leaders who show up to the key meetings.  I would also point out, Mr.Speaker, my colleague has called our bills and our process here ridiculous and extreme.                              {time}  1300  I can't help but note that what is truly ridiculous and extreme, Mr.Speaker, are the massive increases in ObamaCare premiums that my constituents all across Wyoming are now facing.  My constituents are now facing a situation, because of ObamaCare, because of this health plan that was supposed to provide coverage for everybody, low-cost coverage for everybody, that was supposed to guarantee access, guarantee if you liked your doctor, you could keep him or her, guarantee that you would be able to afford healthcare, my constituents are now facing premiums that will bankrupt them.  They are now receiving bills that demonstrate that their premiums next year, for example, for a retired married couple of two, the lowest amount that they can pay under the ObamaCare Bronze Plan is $2,700 a month. Now, that is absolutely unsustainable, and that is what is ridiculous and extreme.  What we are doing today is making sure that we pass legislation that reauthorizes the important brownfields program that restores rights to the State of  Mr.Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr.McKinley), the sponsor of H.3017.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.3017, the Brownfields Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment and Reauthorization Act of 2017. I am proud to be the sponsor of this bill, which has broad bipartisan support, as you have been hearing about. It will reauthorize the very successful EPA program, brownfields program, for the first time since it was enacted.  Like my colleague Mr.Woodall said last night in the Rules Committee, even though the brownfields site program is something that we all support, and brownfields is something we all have in our districts, working out the details of legislation like this is not easy, but the fact that we are here today with a compromise bipartisan bill and no amendment speaks volumes of how much support there is for H.3017 and the brownfields program.  There is no dispute that the EPA brownfields program has been a success. As you just heard from the gentlewoman from Wyoming, the program has resulted in over 27,000 properties being reassessed to start them on this road to being cleaned up, and it has resulted in over 129,000 new jobs.  Over the life of the program, the Federal dollars invested have resulted in over $25 billion in leveraged private investment. This is a program we all should support, and we all should encourage our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to fully fund this program in the future.  I have confidence that H.3017 will make the brownfields program even more successful, and I urge my colleagues to be in support of the rule and to vote for the bill on final passage.  I want to thank my committee chairman, John Shimkus, for his work and the staff's work in bringing this bill together in a fine, compromised fashion.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to just respond to my colleague from Wyoming, you know, when she raised the issue of why our Democratic leaders didn't show up to the meeting at the White Maybe she didn't catch the President's tweet in which the President made it very clear he didn't see a deal.  I am glad our leaders didn't show up because they are not props, and we in the minority are not props either to be rolled out, to give the appearance of bipartisanship or give the appearance that somehow you are working with us when, in fact, you are not.  The President showed his hand. He had no interest in a deal, no interest in working with us. And I would say that is one of the problems in this House of Representatives, that the reason why we are not more productive in getting things done and producing real legislation to help the American people is because there is no bipartisanship, very little. I made one exception to the issue on this brownfields legislation, but on the big bills, nothing.  The gentlewoman brought up the Affordable Care You know, what was her solution to the Affordable Care Act? What was the Republican majority's solution to making the Affordable Care Act better? I mean, bringing a bill to the floor under the most closed process that you can possibly imagine, a bill that would throw 23 million Americans off of health insurance, what are my friends thinking?  When people talk about healthcare reform and improving the Affordable Care Act, they talk about lowering prices; they talk about more accessibility; they talk about more people getting coverage. What the Republicans brought to the floor was a bill that would throw 23 million Americans off of health insurance. That is their solution. That would take away essential benefits protection for people who desperately need health insurance to deal with this opiate crisis and a whole bunch of other things.  So we don't want any lectures about what is extreme and what is ridiculous in this House of The way the majority conducts business in this House is extreme and ridiculous. The legislation, whether it is their attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act or even this tax bill that is a giveaway to corporate special interests and is going to raise taxes on people earning $100,000, that is extreme, that is wrong.  So, Mr.Speaker, I would just say to my Republican friends, again, you know, if you want to get things done, if you want to work with us, you have got to treat us as more than just props. You have to enter into good faith negotiations.

They have to argue for policies that have failed and argue for policies that we have actually had to live through the failure of those policies over the last 8 years.  My colleague on the Rules Committee, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.McGovern), asked us to imagine if Hillary Clinton were President, and imagine if Barack Obama were Mr.Speaker, we don't have to imagine. We lived through Barack Obama's We know that we would be, today, living through completely stagnant growth, a strangled military unable to meet its commitments around the world, out-of-control Federal agencies, a Federal Government that believed it had an obligation to run every aspect of people's lives across this country, and, at the same time, the Federal Government telling people that they were forced to purchase insurance they didn't want and they didn't need.  We know that has failed. We know that the whole system that the Democrats believed would work, in terms of bringing healthcare costs down, fundamentally failed. You cannot force people into the insurance pools. The concept was, if you forced the young, healthy people in, you would drop costs down for everybody. That is not what happened.  I have sympathy for them because it is a tough job that they are undertaking, but it is very important that we argue based on the facts on this floor, Mr.In fact, the tax bill that I hope will come back from the Senate--the tax bill that we passed out of the House, and one that we will take to conference--reduces taxes for the middle class, reduces taxes for families all across this country, doubles the standard deduction, and takes steps towards making real what we know to be true, which is taxpayer dollars don't belong to the government, Mr.Speaker, taxpayer dollars belong to the American people.  If we allow people to keep more of their own money, they will invest that money, they will grow our economy, and they will create jobs.

2016,topic-id,2567,"Mr.Speaker, I am prepared to close.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record two letters in opposition to H.3905 signed by virtually every major environmental organization in the country.                                                 November 8, 2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members      and supporters, we urge you to OPPOSE H.3905, the      ``Minnesota's Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest      Act'' scheduled for mark-up in House Natural Resources on      Section 3 of this radical bill, which would      require Congressional approval of any monument extension or      designation involving National Forest lands in Minnesota,      represents yet another direct attack on one of our nation's      bedrock conservation laws, and flatly ignores the      overwhelming public support for protecting unique and      sensitive federal lands and ocean areas through national      monument designations.       We urge the committee to consider the following during      markup of H.3905 this week:       Contrary to the Intent of the Law--The Antiquities Act was      designed to allow for swift and necessary action, including      when Congress is either unable or unwilling to act, to      protect irreplaceable resources from potential threats. Not      only has the law successfully protected some of our nation's      most remarkable historical, cultural and natural treasures      for a century, Congress intentionally left this presidential      power intact when passing the Federal Land Policy and      Management Act of 1976 (signed into law by President Ford).       A Vote Against our Parks--Supporting any bill that would      undermine the Antiquities Act is a vote against parks. Nearly      half of America's national parks began as national monuments      including the Grand Canyon, Acadia, Zion, Muir Woods, and      Olympic National Parks; and over two-thirds of our national      monuments are managed by the National Park Quite      simply, a vote against the Antiquities Act is a vote against      our national parks and monuments.       Federal Lands Belong to All Americans--The Antiquities Act      is used only to protect federal lands already owned by the      American public. By carving out an exception for national      forest lands within Minnesota, Section 3 of H.3905 flies      in the face of our nation's shared public heritage and      disregards how dearly the public values iconic public lands      and waters, like Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and      Voyageurs National       Bipartisan History--A signature achievement of President      Theodore Roosevelt, the Antiquities Act has been used by 16      presidents since its inception--8 Republicans and 8      Democrats.[[Page H9488]]       Out of Step with the Public--This bill is wildly out of      step with the American public's support for our national      parks and monuments. Just this summer, a vast majority of the      2.8 million people who submitted comments on the issue raised      their voices in support of keeping our national monuments      protected just as they are. These voices made Secretary      Zinke's national monuments public comment period the largest      public comment period in the history of the Interior      Across the West, public support for protecting      our national monuments has proven strong, and a significant      majority of Western voters oppose more mining and drilling on      public lands. According to Colorado College's Conservation in      the West Poll, 80% of western voters support ``future      presidents continuing to protect existing public lands as      national monuments.'' This poll reinforces other surveys that      document widespread public opposition to congressional      attacks on new parks. Americans want more protected public      lands, not less!       Opposed by Diverse List of Hundreds of Organizations--As      demonstrated by this letter as well as the attached letter      signed by nearly 200 organizations, a diverse array of local      and national organizations representing sportsmen, outdoor      recreation businesses, local chambers of commerce, cultural      heritage, historic preservation and conservation have      consistently opposed efforts to undermine the Antiquities Act      in any form.       Disregards Local Economies--Economic research shows that      national monuments support the growth of local economies,      bringing in tourism and recreation dollars and boosting the      quality of life. The Outdoor Industry Association reported      this year that public lands like our national monuments help      support 7.6 million jobs in America, and $887 billion in      outdoor recreation activity.       Monuments Protect our Shared History and Culture--In      response to broad community input, sites honoring America's      military and outdoor heritage, as well as those expanding the      diversity of our national park system to better recognize the      contributions and histories of Native Americans, Hispanics      and African-Americans have been designated under the      Antiquities These monuments include Fort Ord, Fort      Monroe, Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers, Harriet Tubman      Underground Railroad, Chimney Rock, Organ Mountains-Desert      Peaks, Cesar Chavez and many more.       Recent attacks on national monuments, from President      Trump's executive order, to Interior Secretary Zinke's hasty      and arbitrary review of these magnificent places, to      legislative proposals like H.3905 are a smokescreen for      other uses of these special places.       Thank you for considering our concerns. In order to      adequately protect iconic places like the Boundary Waters,      Voyageurs National Park, and all of Minnesota's shared public      resources, we urge you to vote no on H.3905.

Dear Representative:  On behalf of our millions of members      and supporters, we urge you to OPPOSE H.3905, the so-     called ``Minnesota's Economic Rights in the Superior National      Forest Act,'' when it is considered on the House floor.       Simply put, H.3905 is a bill to allow sulfide-ore mining      at the edge of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness      (BWCAW), directly threatening one of America's most-     accessible and most-visited Wilderness At 1.1 million      acres in size, the BWCAW is the largest Wilderness east of      the Rockies and north of the This interconnected      system of lakes, rivers, and streams provides unparalleled      opportunities for solitude, recreation, hunting and fishing.      The connections between Northern Minnesota's national      forests, Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, Voyageurs      National Park, and Quetico Provincial Park makes this entire      transboundary area extremely susceptible to the threat of      pollution from sulfide-ore mining, one of the most toxic      industries in America, according to the Environmental      Protection       H.3905 would require congressional approval of any      mineral withdrawal or monument designation involving National      Forest System lands in the State of Minnesota and would      provide for the perpetual renewal of federal mineral leases      in Minnesota, including two that were denied by the Forest      Service and the Bureau of Land The bill      undermines the Antiquities Act, National Environmental Policy      Act, Federal Land Policy and Management Act, Boundary Waters      Wilderness Act, and other laws regulating mineral leasing in      Minnesota's national forests.       Contrary to the bill's title, H.3905 would do more harm      than good for the economy of Northern Economic      analysis by Key-Log Economics LLC shows that sulfide-ore      mining on Superior National Forest lands in the watershed of      the Boundary Waters could lead to the loss of nearly 5,000      jobs in tourism, 5,000 to 22,000 jobs in the rest of the      economy, a $1.6 billion loss in annual income, and a $500      million reduction in private property values.       Specifically, we urge opposition to this bill because it      would:       Renew two expired and undeveloped mineral leases on      Superior National Forest lands next to the Boundary Waters      and along lakes and rivers that flow directly into the      Wilderness, advancing a foreign mining company's interests at      the expense of beloved American public lands.       Void the December 2016 record of decision by the Forest      Service withholding its consent to two mineral lease renewal      requests in the Superior National Forest due to the      unacceptable risks to this watershed, which according to the      Forest Service holds 20 percent of the National Forest      System's fresh water supply.       Undermine the National Environmental Policy Act by limiting      review of these two mineral leases to a 30-day environmental      assessment. Contrary to the bill language, there is no      `pending EA.' However, this section would override the      ongoing two-year Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)      initiated by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management      to carefully consider the potential impacts of sulfide-ore      mining on the Boundary Waters watershed. The ongoing EIS is      strongly supported by Minnesota's Governor Dayton and by the      citizens of More than 79% of Minnesota voters      support the study, while more than 126,000 citizens submitted      comments during the scoping phase.       Amend the 1906 Antiquities Act by mandating Congressional      approval for any national monument designations in      Minnesota's national forests. The Antiquities Act is a      bipartisan conservation law, which has been used by      Presidents of both parties, to protect irreplaceable federal      lands from potential threats. Monument designations under the      Antiquities Act have provided protection for areas including      the Grand Canyon, Acadia, Zion, Muir Woods, and Olympic      National Quite simply, this attack on the Antiquities      Act is an attack against our national parks and monuments.       Amend the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act      (FLPMA) by mandating Congressional approval for mineral      withdrawals in Minnesota's national forests. Additionally,      FLPMA intentionally left intact the presidential power to      protect public lands as monuments.       Bar the Forest Service from complying with its legal      obligations under the 1978 Boundary Waters Wilderness In      this Act Congress requires the Forest Service to maintain the      high-water quality of the Boundary Waters and a Mining      Protection Area within the Superior National The      Forest Service concluded that sulfide-ore mining near the      Boundary Waters would be ``contrary to Congress'      determination that it is necessary to `protect the special      qualities of the [BWCAW] as a natural forest-lakeland      wilderness ecosystem of major esthetic, scientific,      recreational and educational value to the Nation.' '' Make      all mineral leases on Minnesota's national forests      essentially perpetual. The `perpetual' nature of these leases      is material change in long-standing mineral leasing law and      policy. The bill would also override the two laws (1946 and      1950) on mineral leasing in Minnesota's national forests that      require Forest Service consent to any mining.       Ignore the request of the International Joint Commission      that environmental review of impacts on transboundary water      quality and cumulative effects be studied and the requests of      four tribal entities (the area is Ceded Territory).       Thank you for considering our concerns. In order to      adequately protect iconic places like the Boundary Waters,      Voyageurs National Park, and all of Minnesota's public lands,      and bedrock environmental laws like the Antiquities Act and      the National Environmental Policy Act, we urge you to OPPOSE      H.3905.

What we have a problem with is H.3905, which we think is a corporate giveaway that puts treasured public lands in the hands of a Chilean mining conglomerate, and we think that is wrong.  I agree with the gentlewoman that we ought to be doing important business here, but I would argue that, rather than rewarding some Chilean mining conglomerate, the more important business would be making sure we keep the government open, because we have a government shutdown fast approaching on December 8.  I would say to the gentlewoman that we have got to pass the Dream Act and help 800,000 people whose lives have been thrown into turmoil because of this                              {time}  1345  We ought to extend the Children's Health Insurance We ought to debate flood insurance. We ought to pass additional hurricane relief. We ought to address funding for the Vets Choice That is more important, that is more vital to the national interest than basically rewarding some Chilean mining conglomerate.  Finally, I would say to my colleagues here that we will ask you to vote to defeat the previous question. We will ask you to defeat the previous question so we can bring up and have a vote on a bill that will require this President and all Presidents and all party nominees to release their taxes.  I think the American people have a right to know where the conflicts of interest are with this White I think they have a right to know who benefits from this tax bill that we know is a giveaway to corporations that will raise taxes on millions of middle class families. They have a right to know who benefits from this.  I am astounded that the bar keeps on getting lower and lower and lower for my Republican friends. I mean, we have daily offensive tweets. We have irrational statements that come out of this White House on a daily basis, and there is silence.  When it comes to transparency, when it comes to making sure that there are no conflicts of interest, my Republican colleagues will not even allow us to have a vote on basically requiring this President and all Presidents to release their tax returns. That is not passing judgment on this It would be a requirement of all Presidents and nominees.  Basically, it is saying, let the sunshine in. Let us make sure that there are no conflicts of interest. That ought to matter, because everything that comes out of this House seems to be directed at helping those who are well-off and well-connected.  Every corporation is cheering when this House comes up with legislation, whether it is on tax reform or whether it is on helping mining companies, because it always seems to benefit those who are the most well-off.  Well, it is about time we put people first. It is about time the American people know what is going on in this government. Let the sunshine in. There is nothing wrong with that. We are doing it this way because it is the only avenue available for us to bring this to a vote, because the Rules Committee and the leadership in this House shuts off debate on issues that they find uncomfortable.  This is supposed to be the people's House, not the Russia We ought to be a place where we have deliberative engagements, where we discuss important issues, where we do things that benefit the American people.  I would say to my colleagues again, vote ``no'' on the previous question so we can have this debate. If you want to help the President cover up his tax returns, fine. You can vote ``no,'' but we ought to have a vote.  I don't know why this is so controversial. It, to me, is a no-brainer. Vote ``no'' on the previous question and vote ``no'' on the rule.

In this House, Mr.Speaker, we are charged with carrying out the obligations of the people who elected us. The bills and the rule that we are debating today do just that. Both of these bills are absolutely critical for spurring economic development across our country.  Therefore, Mr.Speaker, I urge adoption of both the rule and of these underlying bills.  The material previously referred to by Mr.McGovern is as follows:          An Amendment to 631 Offered by Mr.McGovern       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     305) to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to require      the disclosure of certain tax returns by Presidents and      certain candidates for the office of the President, and for      other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be      dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of      the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the      bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and      controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority      members of the Committees on Ways and Means and Oversight and      Government After general debate the bill shall be      considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All      points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At      the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the      Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with      such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous      question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and      amendments thereto to final passage without intervening      motion except one motion to recommit with or without      instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports      that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the      next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the      third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,      resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.305.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative[[Page H9490]]     Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th      edition, page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the      previous question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is      generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority      Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

What is the Republican Party working to do to make it even worse?  Passing a tax cut for the richest people in this country, the most powerful corporations, that will result in raising taxes on 82 million families, providing $1.5 trillion debt for the next generation, making deep cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, Pell grants, and infrastructure--all things that are necessary to grow and strengthen the middle class of this country--which will be a huge boon to the richest people in  The Senate version will also remove 13 million people from having access to affordable healthcare. The Republicans in the Senate are doing this right now.  The American people need to be certain that their voices are being heard to stop this proposal. It is a scam that will impose tremendous costs on working people in this country. It will provide tremendous benefits to the very powerful and very wealthy. It incentivizes American companies to ship American jobs overseas by making those incentives more generous.  The American people deserve a better deal.

456,topic-id,1027,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Maryland, for yielding.  I want to quote Congressman Raskin, who has said before, and I think it actually accurately captures what is happening: The Republicans are moving at the speed of light in the dark of night to jam through this proposal which will visit so much harm upon our economy and upon the American people, and particularly onto working families.  I think it is important to say, at the outset, that the process that has produced this piece of legislation that is now under consideration in the Senate--their own version of the same proposal--is an important thing to understand.  The last time that we did comprehensive tax reform--it was before I arrived in Congress--there were hundreds of people who testified. There were hearings to really understand the implications of these proposals.  Our economy is complicated. Tax policy is complicated. You want to be sure that you are making the right decisions based on good information, good evidence, and the guidance of experts.  This proposal in the House and, similarly, in the Senate happened with no hearings. Not a single witness testified. In fact, it was drafted even without the participation of some of the Republican Members of It was presented as a finished product and then brought to the floor for a vote.  One of the reasons I would say, Mr.Speaker, that my Republican colleagues are trying to get this done so quickly is because the more the American people learn about this proposal, the more they realize that it is not something they support, and it undermines the long-term health and prosperity of our country.  What does it do?  It provides a huge, gigantic tax cut for the people at the very top. About 50 percent of the proposal goes to the top 1 percent.  It creates greater economic incentives to ship American jobs overseas. Think about that. It creates better incentives to send good jobs overseas.  It raises taxes on 82 million middle class families.  It imposes $1.5 trillion additional debt on the next generation.  To pay for all of this, it imposes deep cuts on things that are so important to the economy and important to working families: Medicare, We will see more cuts in infrastructure, education, and all the things that are necessary to build and strengthen our economy.  This is a gigantic giveaway to the biggest corporations and the wealthiest people of this country, and it is paid for by the middle class. It is paid for by hardworking  There are, as I said just a moment ago, millions of people who lie awake at night worrying about whether or not they can make ends meet, take care of their families, and pay their bills because they are just not making enough money.  But instead of addressing that with a real tax reform proposal that provides real tax relief to middle class families and incentivizes the creation of good-paying jobs, this does just the opposite. It makes the situation worse. In fact, what the bill does, although its name is something about job creation, it does just the opposite because it is premised on this economic theory called trickle-down economics: if you let people at the very top hold on to more of their money, keep more of what they make, it will somehow just trickle down to the rest of us.  We know that is an economic theory that doesn't work. It doesn't work because what you really need to create jobs and to grow the economy is for people of the middle class to have a good-paying job and have money in their pockets so they can buy the goods and services businesses produce. That is how you grow the economy.  If you go to any small business in my State and ask, ``What do you need to create another job to add to your number of employees?'' they will tell you, ``I need customers. I need people to buy the things I make and sell.''  That is why having a tax policy that invests in rebuilding the middle class and provides tax relief to middle class families and doesn't rely on this trickle-down economics is the way that you grow the economy. This does just the opposite.  In addition to that proposal on the Senate side, they have inserted another proposal that will strip away healthcare from 13 million  Think about this: Just when you thought this bill or this approach couldn't get any worse, the Senate Republicans have done that.  We had a rally today with folks from all across this country who are standing up to say: This is not fair. This makes our Tax Code worse. This provides no relief for the people who need it. It doesn't help small businesses. Instead, it is a reflection of what a swamp Washington is.  All those folks who have a lot of political power, who spend a lot of money on elections, have allowed or have demanded that a tax bill go forward that benefits them.  Shame on my colleagues. This is a disgrace. What this is going to do to our economy and to working families is something that everyone who votes for this will be responsible for.  We are still hoping that we can defeat this proposal in the Senate and move forward in a bipartisan way for serious tax reform that will grow the economy, that will provide relief to middle class families, that will help raise people's wages and not be a huge giveaway for the richest people in the country, the most powerful corporations, incentivizing shipping American jobs overseas and then giving the bill to the next generation and to working families in this country.

174,topic-id,375,"Mr.President, today I wish to join in a colloquy with the majority leader to address concerns that I have with the tax reform legislation that we are considering and to thank him for the many discussions that we have had over the past months about this bill.  I have made clear that I don't think that the repeal of the individual mandate should have been included in the tax bill. Rather, I would prefer to see the mandate issue and the other flaws in the ACA addressed through a series of discrete bills that can be thoughtfully targeted to correct specific problems. That said, I have long-supported the repeal of the so-called individual mandate because I do not believe that the Federal Government should force any American to buy healthcare coverage he or she either does not want or cannot afford. Eighty percent of the people who pay the penalty imposed by the mandate make less than $50,000 a year.  Nevertheless, it appears very likely that the individual mandate repeal will be part of this legislation. Unless we take action, that repeal will almost certainly lead to further increases in the cost of health insurance premiums--premiums that are already too expensive under the Therefore, I believe that it is imperative that Congress take action to mitigate this likely premium increase.  There are two steps we can take to help remedy this situation. First, we need to pass the Bipartisan Health Care Stabilization Act of 2017, legislation authored by HELP Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member This legislation will not only give States critical flexibility to better manage their insurance markets, but will also provide funding in 2019 and 2020 for cost-sharing reductions received by low-income enrollees in the ACA exchanges.  Mr.From its inception, I have opposed the individual mandate because it is simply wrong for the Federal Government to require someone to purchase a particular product, particularly one they do not want and cannot afford. I agree that Alexander-Murray can help provide certainty and flexibility for State insurance markets in the absence of the mandate and will support passage of the Bipartisan Health Care Stabilization Act, ideally prior to the adoption of any final tax reform conference agreement and certainly before the end of this year.

175,topic-id,273,"I thank the majority leader for his response. Second, it is critical that we provide States with the support they need to create State-based high-risk pools for their individual health insurance markets. In September, I introduced the bipartisan Lower Premiums Through Reinsurance Act of 2017, a bill that would allow States to protect people with preexisting conditions while lowering premiums through the use of these high-risk pools. That bill would create a menu of options States could use to design reinsurance programs, which in turn would be eligible for Federal ``seed money'' grants that could leverage section 1332 ``flow-through'' funding to finance the programs. States may also add funds from other sources to the mix.  We know from the experience of Alaska and Maine just how effective such high-risk pools can be. Alaska's pool reduced a projected 40 percent rate increase to just 7 percent this year and is expected to contribute to a 20-percent decline in premiums next year. Maine saw similar results in its program, the Maine Guaranteed Access Reinsurance  I believe that passage of legislation to create and provide $5 billion in funding for high-risk pools annually over 2 years, together with the Bipartisan Health Care Stabilization Act, is critical for helping to offset the impact on individual market premiums in 2019 and 2020 due to repeal of the individual mandate.  Mr.I believe that State high-risk pools are a much better alternative to Federal mandates. I will also support passage of your bill and this funding to create high-risk pools, ideally prior to the adoption of any final tax reform conference agreement and certainly before the end of this year.

1149,topic-id,1137,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss four amendments that I have submitted to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that would strengthen this legislation in ways that are important to our middle-income families.  I express my thanks to the majority leader, my colleagues, and the administration for working with me on these proposals.  The first amendment would allow taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 in State and local property taxes. In recent years, more than 95 percent of all of those who itemize on their tax forms and 28 percent of all Federal income tax filers deducted State and local taxes, including property taxes. Yet the Senate bill would eliminate this deduction altogether.  The deduction for State and local taxes has been part of our Tax Code since 1913, when the income tax became law. It was intended to prevent a Federal tax from being imposed on a State tax. In other words, it was to prevent double taxation.  This deduction is especially important to the people of In my State, 166,000 itemizers deducted a total of $725 million in property taxes on their Federal income tax returns. This amendment would allow the vast majority of Mainers who itemize to continue to fully deduct their property taxes.  Improving the bill in this way--by preserving the property tax deduction up to $10,000--is crucial for middle-income taxpayers across the United In fact, for filers earning less than $75,000 who itemize, the State and local property tax deduction is typically larger than the State and local income tax deduction.  While I would prefer allowing the deduction of both State and local income and property taxes, the benefits of the property tax deduction are particularly important to middle-income families with less than $75,000 in income. In addition, by allowing the deduction of up to $10,000 in property taxes, my amendment parallels the provision that has been included in the House version of the tax bill.  My second amendment would strike a provision that could lessen the retirement benefits of church, charity,[[Page S7521]]school, and government employees, including firefighters, police officers, and teachers. I appreciate very much that my colleague from Ohio, Senator Portman, has cosponsored this amendment.  We are in the midst of a retirement crisis in this country. According to the nonpartisan Center for Retirement Research, there is a $7.7 trillion gap between the savings that American households need to maintain their standards of living in retirement and what they actually have. As Americans are living longer, seniors are in danger of outliving their savings or of no longer being able to enjoy the comfortable retirements they once had envisioned. We must do everything we can to encourage people to save more for retirement, not less.  Employees of churches, charities, schools, and local governments are generally paid less than their counterparts who work for for-profit businesses. Thus, they are less able to save for their retirements, especially early in their careers. Accordingly, there are special catch-up rules that allow these employees to contribute additional amounts near the ends of their careers when they are likely to have higher salaries.  There is also a special rule that permits churches, charities, and public educational institutions to make contributions for employees after they retire so as to make up for the shortfalls in the employees' retirement savings during their working years. Regrettably, as drafted, the Senate bill would hurt many church, charity, school, and government workers by eliminating these critical tax rules, including the ability to make these catchup and makeup contributions to retirement accounts. Striking this provision, as my amendment would do, would ensure that those employees who serve the public achieve greater retirement security.  My third amendment would improve the child and dependent care tax credit by making it refundable, thus providing much needed assistance to low-income working families. Making this credit refundable would help many families afford high-quality childcare or adult daycare for older parents or relatives who can no longer care for themselves.  Working families are increasingly faced with difficult decisions when it comes to balancing care and work, with some concluding that the steep cost of care serves as a barrier to working more or working at all. Nearly 15 million children in America under the age of 6 have working parents. These parents, particularly single parents, often struggle to find affordable, quality daycare, which ensures that they can continue to work while having the peace of mind that their children or their elderly parents are well cared for.  Congress should make this tax credit refundable, meaning that families who have no Federal income tax liability but pay other taxes will also benefit. Since it is not currently refundable, most low- and some middle-income tax-paying families are unable to take advantage of the childcare tax credit. In fact, according to the Tax Policy Center, almost no families in the bottom income quintile have been able to claim that credit. Think about that. These are the lowest income families who need help the most in paying for childcare or care for a dependent, elderly parent or grandparent or other relative; yet virtually none of them qualify for the credit--none of them are able to claim the credit.  To pay for making the child and adult dependent care credit refundable, my amendment would close the carried interest loophole, a tax reform that the President has endorsed.  Finally, high medical expenses are continuing to burden many American consumers, yet due to a highly unfortunate provision in the Affordable Care Act, consumers can deduct medical expenses only if they exceed 10 percent of their income. That threshold used to be 7.5 percent, and my amendment would return the threshold to that level to help taxpayers, particularly seniors who are struggling with the cost of long-term care for a loved one.  Just this past week, when I was in Maine, an elderly gentleman stopped me in the grocery store to tell me that he simply cannot afford long-term care for his beloved wife, given the change in this threshold. For those who suffer from chronic medical conditions, experience unexpected illnesses or injury, or find that long-term care services are a necessity but are not covered by insurance or Medicare, healthcare expenses can quickly become an unbearable burden. Many Americans are forced to choose between purchasing medical services and making other equally necessary expenditures. Since World War II, the medical expense deduction has provided much needed assistance to Americans with catastrophic medical expenses. We should reverse this ill-advised provision of the Affordable Care Act and reinstate the ability of those hard-pressed by high medical costs to deduct expenses in excess of 7.5 percent of their income.  I believe that all four of these amendments would strengthen this legislation in critical ways and make it more beneficial for middle-income  Thank you.

14,topic-id,1710,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, highly skilled Federal employees are essential to a government that serves its citizens. Skilled Federal workers ensure that functions of government, from delivering mail to protecting the homeland, are carried out successfully.  Federal jobs and the skills required to perform them vary significantly across government. Some employees review patents, some work in human resources, and others work in law enforcement.  While the jobs, skills, and training required may be different from job to job, the expectation that the Federal Government hires qualified candidates is universal.  One tool agencies and managers have to ensure a qualified workforce is the probationary period--a period of time used to evaluate whether a new hire[[Page H9548]]can effectively perform the duties of the position.  Under current law, most new hires are required to complete a probationary period of 1 year before receiving full employment status. Most new employees complete the probationary period and are hired as permanent employees.  New employees who fail to demonstrate that they are a good fit for the position, however, are transitioned out of government during the probationary period, but the current 1-year trial period is not sufficient for complex Federal occupations. Potential employees deserve ample time to learn about the job and demonstrate they are able to perform all critical aspects of a Federal position, and supervisors deserve ample time to evaluate new hires.  What is a manager supposed to do in this case? Does the supervisor take a gamble and offer permanent status to an untested employee or risk missing out on a potentially skilled employee? This is a real dilemma. Supervisors throughout the Federal workforce have described this exact scenario in their advocacy for this bill.  According to the Government Managers Coalition, managers tend to err on the side of releasing borderline employees in cases like this, and it can be a very frustrating decision for them to make. They have already devoted a significant amount of time and resources into training the new hire.  However, managers would rather not risk hiring an employee who is on the fence at the end of a probationary period. This is because a manager is pretty much stuck with an employee after the probationary period. It is difficult to remove a permanent employee for poor performance or misconduct.  According to the Government Accountability Office, the procedural hurdles to removing a permanent employee can take from 6 months to 1 year. The evidence is clear, the probationary period needs to be extended.  In 2015, the GAO reported that chief human capital officers throughout the Federal Government would benefit from an extension of the probationary period, especially in occupations which are complex or difficult to assess. Federal manager groups have been asking for a longer probationary period for years.  In congressional testimony earlier this year, the national president of the Federal Managers Association, Renee Johnson said: ``FMA advocates extending the probationary period. This would benefit both the government and employees by allowing supervisors to make decisions based on the employees' performance as fully trained employees--not just guessing at how they will perform after the training is completed.''  The Government Managers Coalition, a group of five organizations that represent the interests of over 200,000 supervisors, managers, and executives serving throughout the Federal Government, supports an extension of the probationary period.  I include in the Record a letter of support from the Government Managers Coalition signed by the heads of the FAA Managers Association, Federal Managers Association, Professional Managers Association, National Council of Social Security Management Associations, and Senior Executives Association; and a letter from the Professional Managers                                Government Managers Coalition,                                                November 29, 2017.     United States Congress,     Washington,       Dear Representative: We write on behalf of the Government      Managers Coalition (GMC), which is comprised of five major      federal sector professional associations collectively      representing the interests of over 200,000 supervisors,      managers, and executives serving throughout the federal      government.       Our coalition is supportive of H.4182, the Ensuring a      Qualified Civil Service Act of 2017 (the EQUALS Act),      introduced by Representative James We appreciate      Comer's efforts to take the lead on this important      legislation and the consideration earlier this month by the      House Oversight and Government Reform The GMC has      advocated for an extended probationary period for over a      decade. We encourage you to support the measure when it comes      to the floor later this week.       The EQUALS Act would grant agencies the authority to extend      the probationary period for competitive service appointments      and supervisors. In addition, this legislation would align      appointments under competitive and senior executive service      with the two-year trial period served under excepted service      appointments, bringing consistency to hiring throughout      government.       Extension of the probationary period is supported by a 2015      Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, GAO-15-191.      Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) commented to GAO that      often supervisors within federal departments and agencies are      not given sufficient time to accurately review performance      before the probationary period is complete. The CHCO      recommended an extension of the probationary period to the      GAO in order to accurately assess an employee's abilities in      the federal workforce. In addition, Congress has already      approved a two-year probationary period for employees at the      Department of Defense, as part of the Fiscal Year 2016      National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), P.114-92.       The GMC's mission is to promote good government initiatives      that foster effectiveness and efficiency throughout the      federal government. We believe that this legislation will      allow employees sufficient time on the job to demonstrate      their abilities as well as allow for proper assessment. The      measure will also ensure that supervisors have the      opportunity and authority to fulfill their performance      management responsibilities that may not be feasible under      the current one-year probationary period.       The current one-year probationary period is often      insufficient to assess an employee's performance in more      technical and complex jobs, of which there are many in the      federal government, and may in fact place an employee at risk      of termination before having had the opportunity to      effectively demonstrate their abilities. The reality is that      many technical jobs require agency classroom training,      mentoring and on-the-job training for employees to become      proficient. Often, the supervisor does not see the employee      during those times, and is unable to observe the employee's      performance. In front-line public service roles, such as with      the Social Security Administration (SSA) or the Internal      Revenue Service (IRS), employees must not only learn      material, but also need to be able to effectively interact      with citizens. The EQUALS Act would ensure that employees are      provided with the opportunity to not only receive training,      but also to effectively demonstrate their abilities.      Extending the probationary period will in no way penalize an      employee who is performing well and progressing in their      training and responsibilities.       The GMC would appreciate your support of this legislation.      In light of ongoing agency reorganization efforts, it is now      more important than ever to ensure federal managers making      personnel decisions have a comprehensive toolset available      that represents both flexibility for agencies and fairness      for affected federal employees. We look forward to passage of      this legislation, as well as other commonsense federal      workforce reform bills resulting in an improved federal      government that can better serve the American public.

Dear Representative: The Professional Managers Association      (PMA) represents the interests of professional managers,      management officials, and non-bargaining unit employees in      the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other federal      agencies. On behalf of PMA's members, I write in support of      H.4182, the Ensuring a Qualified Civil Service Act of 2017      (the EQUALS Act), introduced by Representative James Comer,      and to offer a specific example--Revenue Agents at the IRS--     for an example of a federal job that would benefit from an      extended probationary period. PMA also signed onto a letter      with our colleagues with the Government Managers Coalition      (GMC) expressing our collective support for the EQUALS       Following their hiring, IRS Revenue Agents go through an      extensive training process that includes classes in tax law      and procedures. They begin by learning the basics and the      laws that deal with individuals, starting with several weeks      of classroom training before moving on to work on actual      cases in taxpayer service. After that, they move onto      Schedule Cs and Partnerships, following the same process, but      with less time spent in the classroom. They then return to      the field or office for on-the job training with those types      of cases. Once they have completed this portion of training,      they are assigned to an office where they receive an      inventory of cases to work on. At this time, they are      evaluated on each case they close.[[Page H9549]]       All of this is just within the first year of training. In      year two--if they are lucky--the agent will be sent to      classes for small and then large corporations. Once the      classroom training is completed, they are assigned more      training cases. Again, each case closed is rated and      evaluated based on all aspects: tax law interpretation, case      write up, meet and deal qualities, etc.       There should also be managerial mentoring completed during      this training process. The manager is meant to go on visits      to observe how the agent deals with the taxpayer and how they      are doing with regards to case write-ups. Yet, while managers      are intended to be involved throughout the training process,      many are spread extremely thin and may be forced to make a      decision not in the best interest of the government or the      agent. A longer probationary period would give managers more      time to make an accurate decision on whether or not an      individual is able to perform the necessary duties of an      efficient, effective agent.       Two years of training is a very costly process, but it is      costlier to make a hasty decision and keep an employee that      would not be an asset to the organization or would be unable      to best serve the public. I urge Members to support the      EQUALS           Sincerely,                                                 Thomas Burger,                                               Executive  ",CREC-2017-11-30-pt1-PgH9547-2.txt,1E+14,"APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON H.R. 1, TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT",2017,30,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,topic-id,290,"In the letter, the coalition members write that they have ``advocated for an extended probationary period for over a decade,'' and that this legislation will allow employees sufficient time on the job to demonstrate their abilities as well as allow for proper assessment.  The individuals they represent see the difficulties associated with the current system in their day-to-day lives. They understand the problems associated with the arbitrary nature of the current 1-year probationary period.  The EQUALS Act addresses these problems and moves toward a system better suited for the modern workforce. The bill will extend the probationary period for new hires in the competitive service and initial appointments for managers to 2 years after the completion of formal training or licensure.  The concept of a 2-year probationary period is not new. Congress extended the probationary period for new hires at the Department of Defense to 2 years in 2015. This bill brings the rest of the government in line with the Department of Defense standards. The EQUALS Act also recognizes the variety of positions and training requirements throughout the Federal The EQUALS Act requires the 2-year period to begin upon the conclusion of the formal training or licensure process.  This is important, because under current law, time spent in training counts against the probationary period. This means that a Federal job with long training, by the time a probationary employee completes the training, the supervisor often has little or no time to evaluate the employee's performance.  For example, training for new hires at the Internal Revenue Service takes 1 year. By the time a new IRS employee completes training, the manager has to make a decision whether to keep the employee without having seen the employee do the job.

38,topic-id,175,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chair, I think it is important to define what the probationary period is and what it is not.  According to the MSPB, the probationary period is the final step in the employee screening process when an individual must demonstrate ``why it is[[Page H9553]]in the public interest for the government to finalize an appointment to the civil service.''  This is not a punitive measure. It is an opportunity for a prospective employee to prove they are qualified to serve the American people through a position in the civil service. These are critically important jobs and we need the best and brightest to fill them. A longer probationary period gives all new hires time to complete their training, learn on the job, and demonstrate that they can perform the role they were hired to do. This is good for our government, good for Federal employees, and good for the American people.  Mr.Chairman, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.

43,topic-id,332,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, this amendment does not create an exception for alumni of the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, and other national service programs. It puts them at a disadvantage.  They would have less time than other new hires to prove themselves before managers make a decision whether to keep them or let them go. This could mean fewer Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, and other national service alumni are retained at the end of the probationary period.  Under the current 1-year system, supervisors often do not have enough time to determine whether a potential employee is a good fit for the job. Managers tend to err on the side of releasing an employee who is on the fence at the end of a probationary period.  New hires to the Federal Government deserve ample time to demonstrate they are able to perform all critical aspects of the job. H.4182 gives them more time.  This amendment would actually put certain groups at a disadvantage in comparison to the rest of the Federal workforce. Alumni of the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, and other programs would have 1 year to demonstrate the skills and core competencies required for the[[Page H9555]]Federal job they are seeking. Their colleagues would have 2 years.  The spirit of this amendment is admirable, but the unintended consequence of adopting it will be that the very people the amendment is meant to benefit would be at a disadvantage.

54,topic-id,203,"Mr.Chairman, extending the probationary period is not a new idea. Federal manager groups have advocated for an extended probationary period for more than a decade.  The Government Accountability Office completed a study on the probationary period in February of 2015. In that study, chief human capital officers told GAO a longer probationary period could help supervisors make a performance assessment for those occupations that are particularly complex or difficult to assess. GAO also recommended considering, ``extending the supervisory probationary period beyond 1 year to include at least 1 full employee appraisal cycle.''  As far back as 2005, the Merit Systems Protection Board completed a study and recommended longer probationary periods when an agency deems it necessary to fully evaluate a probationer. It is not necessary to wait for more studies on this issue.  This amendment strikes the entire bill, meaning the current probationary period would remain the same and the problems that GAO and others have identified would persist. This amendment undermines the entire purpose of the bill, which is to allow managers' employees more time to conduct a fair and complete assessment of probationary Federal employees.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of 630, my legislation to begin to deal with the sexual harassment issue.  Thirty years ago, in 1988, a 34-year-old legislative aide named Dorena Bertussi faced a very lonely fight when she decided to stand up to a powerful Congressman, Jim Bates from California, who repeatedly sexually harassed her and others in his office with questions, comments, and actions such as asking her what type of sex she[[Page H9495]]liked and saying different things that he would imagine. He talked about her breasts. He humped her leg in front of the staff and said vulgar things that are really too unpleasant to talk about in this body.  Dorena didn't get a lot of press attention or some of the support that victims get today. She got little support from this body. She went on her journey alone. She received nasty phone calls and even threats. She was warned they would release damaging information about her.  Fortunately, she prevailed. Men and women in the workplace should know her name and know she was the first woman to win a sexual harassment case against a Member of  Let's remember, as we see all these headlines about men leaving their jobs and things going on, behind all of them are women who are victims like There is a lot of pain in dealing with such a situation. In speaking with her recently, I could hear that pain even 30 years later.  As a mom, former intern here in this body, former congressional staffer and counsel, and a Justice Department employee, I do believe this is a watershed moment.  I have a female chief of staff. I have a female district director. But we also need to have men and women involved in this process. I am so happy with the men who are coming forward, because this is a workplace issue, a human rights issue, and an issue that addresses all of us and our daughters and sons in the workplace.  When I was working in Congress in the nineties for Congressman Wolf, just a few years after Dorena, there were Members like ``Good Time'' Charlie Wilson, who openly bragged about hiring staff based on their looks and breast size, famously saying: You can teach them to type, but you can't teach them to grow breasts. He used a more vulgar term.  At the same time, Senator Bob Packwood--and this is a bipartisan problem--assaulted over a dozen women. He kept a diary of his debauchery that had been ignored for years.  It wasn't acceptable then, and it certainly shouldn't be acceptable now.

16,topic-id,2947,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.4182, the Ensuring a Qualified Civil Service This bill potentially weakens the Federal civil service by increasing the probationary period for career civil servants and those in the Senior Executive Service from 1 year to 2 years.  I might add, almost no private sector company I know of would have a 2-year probationary period because they know it would make it hard to recruit talented employees.  Unlike what has just been said in terms of protections that remain in place, during the probationary period, Federal employees have very little due process or appeal rights if disciplinary action is taken against them, and the action we would take today would be to extend those diluted rights instead of providing them with robust rights of every civil servant beyond the probationary period. They can be fired without notice. They have limited rights to an attorney or representative, and they generally may not appeal their removal.  Due process protections are critical to ensuring the integrity of the Federal civil service. In fact, that is the very heart of having a professional civil service.  These protections help prevent the politicalization of the workforce and protect whistleblowers from retaliation, which our committee, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has passionately documented as a very real danger in the past.  The Ensuring a Qualified Civil Service Act is a solution in search of a problem. The Oversight and Government Reform Committee has not held one single hearing to determine whether extending the probationary period an additional year for every single Federal job in the competitive and Senior Executive Service is something that agencies need or want to help them better manage their workforce. Not a single hearing, and this would have a profound impact on every Federal agency.                              {time}  1530  In February of 2016, the Government Accountability Office issued a report which my friend from Kentucky cited at the request of the chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental The request asked GAO to examine the rules and trends relating to the review and dismissal of employees for poor performance. Now supporters of this bill are using this report as a basis for extending the probationary periods of Federal civil service employees; however, nothing in this report calls for doing that. In fact, the title of the report is ``Improved Supervision and Better Use of Probationary Periods Are Needed to Address Substandard Employee Performance.'' The focus ought to be, the GAO says, on improving the supervision of the probationary period we have in place.  In conducting its study, GAO found that supervisors do not always have the skills necessary to do that and help address employee performance issues during the probationary period. GAO also found that supervisors sometimes do not even use the probationary period to make performance-related decisions about an employee's ability to do their job and may not always know when the probationary period even ends.  The report's recommendations were mainly focused on ensuring qualified supervisors have the training and skills they need to deal with poor performers[[Page H9550]]and making better use of the existing probation period for all new employees.  Instead of focusing on addressing the gaps identified by GAO and encouraging agencies to implement the recommendations made in that report, Congress is now attacking Federal employees and the merit-based system.  I am especially concerned about the bill's impact on recruiting the workforce of the future. Currently, 40 percent of the current Federal workforce is either eligible for retirement or soon will be--40 percent. Federal agencies need to be able to recruit their replacements and get the requisite skill sets we need for these challenging jobs, just like the private sector is challenged with that.  Extending the probationary period to 2 years, governmentwide, creates a climate of more uncertainty, less protection, and diminishes, clearly, the attraction of Federal service for many people, especially those whom we want to be attracted to the civil service, especially millennials.  Some of my colleagues have referenced the 2-year probationary period for Department of Defense civilian employees enacted in the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act of last fiscal year. They argue that it should serve as precedent for the rest of the Federal  There are a few things I need to point out about that. First, the Department of Defense did not request an extension of the probationary period or even indicate a need for it. Second, now that the 2-year probationary period for civilian defense employees has been enacted, the Department isn't even making use of this new authority.  According to the former Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Peter Levine, who testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in March of this year on civilian personnel reform, ``the Department has done little to take advantage of that legislation.''  Mr.Levine also warned that changing the law to address a small number of problem employees could hurt recruitment and retention and worker productivity. He stated: ``If legislation that is intended to address a problem with 1 percent of the workforce is perceived as threatening and hostile by the other 99 percent, it may undermine morale and reduce the Department's ability to attract and retain the capable employees that it needs. The civilian workforce will not become more productive if problems with a small number of poor performers is addressed with measures that are perceived as a declaration of war on all employees.''  In closing, 2 weeks ago, Congress passed legislation that would pave the way toward evidence-based policymaking, and we all supported that. For the sake of consistency, if nothing else, ought we not see the evidence of whether lengthening the probationary period is materially different and what impacts, both positive and negative, it would have for Federal agencies and employees?  Absent such evidence and careful study, I certainly am not willing to take the risk that this bill will not do more harm to both agencies' ability to recruit and retain qualified employees and that it would not be used to arbitrarily punish hardworking Federal employees.  However, if the GAO studies the impact of this policy at DOD and finds that this new policy has been wonderful for morale and has indeed improved employee performance and helps employee recruitment, then sign me up. But I do think we ought to rely on data and hearings before the requisite committee when making such a major change to how we manage our Federal workforce.  I plan on offering an amendment, Mr.Chairman, that would arm us with the information we need to make an evidence-based decision regarding an extension of the probationary period of the Federal workforce, which is what we ought to be doing before consideration of this bill.  Mr.Chairman, I include in the Record statements in opposition or expressing deep concern about this legislation from the American Federation of Government Employees; the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers; the National Treasury Employees Union; and a group of organizations, including the Government Accountability Project, the Liberty Coalition, the Project on Government Oversight, Public Citizen, and Taxpayers Protection                                            American Federation of                                Government Employees, AFL-CIO,                                Washington, DC, November 28, 2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Federation      of Government Employees, AFL-CIO (AFGE), which represents      approximately 700,000 federal and District of Columbia      employees, in more than 70 agencies across the nation, I      strongly urge you to oppose H.4182, the ``Ensuring a      Qualified Civil Service Act of 2017,'' introduced by      Representative James Comer (R-KY) when it comes to the floor      this week. If enacted, this legislation would arbitrarily      extend the probation period for a minimum of two years for      newly hired federal employees. AFGE opposes this legislation      as it does not address any issues surrounding employee      performance evaluation or management's ability to properly      evaluate employees during the probation period. Instead, all      it will do is penalize federal workers and weaken their due      process rights.       The extension of probation periods for competitive service      federal employees from one year to two years is unnecessary      and damaging to due process and the merit system. Candidates      for federal jobs are put through an extensive selection      process prior to being hired and one year is sufficient time      for a competent manager to determine if a new employee has      the ability to accomplish the duties for which he or she was      hired.       Specifically, H.4182 would extend the probation period      to a minimum of two years after completion of a ``formal      training'' program or after the date on which a required      license is granted. Such a change could leave employees in      probation limbo for many years. For example, government      agencies require initial training for prolonged periods of      time that could result in employees serving three to five      year probation periods, or longer. Employees should not be      subject to an almost perpetual state of probation because of      comprehensive agency training, certification or licensing      programs.       Additionally, extending the probation period reduces the      due process rights of employees. While on probation,      employees have few civil service protections and almost no      appeal rights in the event of an adverse action. Civil      service protections and the merit system exist to protect the      government from politicization. Without these rights,      employees on probation will have little to no protection      against discrimination and employer retaliation and more      exposure to termination not based on cause, but rather      arbitrary and unjust reasons.       Extending the probation period does not solve any problems      regarding poor performance. Supervisors should be responsible      and held accountable for identifying and addressing issues of      poor performance of new employees quickly and efficiently.      Supervisors need better training to manage new employees.      Extending the probation period does nothing to better train      supervisors nor does it provide any accountability for      supervisors to effectively manage new employees.       Please Vote NO on H.4182, ``Ensuring a Qualified Civil      Service Act of 2017.''           Sincerely,                                                   Thomas Kahn,     Director, Legislative                                  ____         International Federation of Professional & Technical            Engineers, AFL-CIO & CLC,                                Washington, DC, November 27, 2017.       Dear Representative: As behalf of the International      Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE),      representing upwards of 90,000 workers, including tens of      thousands of federal employees, I am writing regarding H.     4182, the so-called Ensuring a Qualified Civil Service Act of      2017. This bill has been scheduled for full house      consideration this week and IFPTE urges you to oppose it.       H.4182 aims to extend the probationary period for      federal civilian workers from one year to a minimum of two      years. Under this bill, the probation period would not      necessarily begin at the time a federal worker arrives for      their first day of work. Rather, the period would, ``end on      the date that is 2 years after the date on which such formal      training is completed.'' This is also true for federal jobs      that require a license, in which the probationary clock would      not start ticking until the license is achieved. In other      words, probations for many federal workers under this      legislation will be longer than two years, and dramatically      more than the current 1 year period.       IFPTE is opposed to this bill for several reasons. First,      this legislation is punitive in nature and serves no logical      policy objective. For example, it does nothing to address      performance issues, as supporters of this bill will      erroneously argue, and is silent on addressing the ongoing      challenges that management faces in properly evaluating new      employees, regardless of whether the probationary period is      for one year, or two years. For example, this past March      former Acting Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and      Readiness, Peter Levine, testified in the Senate regarding      the DOD's use of their new two-year probationary period for      federal workers. Mr.Levine testified that even though      managers at the DOD were granted two years to determine if a      newly hired DOD civilian employee should stay or go, that      authority is rarely, if ever used.       Unfortunately, this is yet another in a long list of bills      from this Congress that attempts[[Page H9551]]     to legislate good management, while creating more useless and      unnecessary requirements that end up costing taxpayers more      money. It is illogical to think that a manager who will not      act on a problem employee within one year of being hired      would act within two years. Mr.Levine's testimony confirms      as much. Federal managers already have the authority to      discipline and ultimately fire employees, BUT they actually      need to use the many authorities they already have to do so.       IFPTE believes that one year is more than enough time for      managers to determine whether a newly hired employee can      perform their job. Instead of creating more bureaucracy, as      this bill will do, Congress should simply require managers to      use the flexibilities they currently have, including the one      year probationary period, to retain or release federal      workers who have yet to fulfill their probationary periods.      Please vote against H.4182.       Thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,                                              Gregory Junemann,                                      ____                                             The National Treasury                                              Employees Union,                                                November 28, 2017.       Dear Representative: As National President of the National      Treasury Employees Union, representing over 150,000 federal      employees in 31 different agencies, I am writing to express      NTEU's opposition to H.4182, the Ensuring a Qualified      Civil Service Act of 2017 or the EQUALS Act of 2017, which      would drastically extend the probationary period for      individuals hired into the competitive service from one year      to two years, reflecting changes in policy based on a handful      of individual instances of concern that would--and can be--     much better handled by improved management than by changing      the law. With respect to any position that requires formal      training, the two-year time period would begin after the      required formal training. Given how limited an employee's due      process rights and a labor organization's representational      abilities are during the probationary period, NTEU believes      that the current one year is the proper time period for      agency management to assess and determine whether the      individual is suitable for the position and capable of      performing its duties. It is also important to recognize that      the end of a probationary period does not mean that an      employee cannot be disciplined or removed. It merely allows      the employee to challenge such actions that are done without      merit. Well trained managers can and do impose disciplinary      and adverse actions that stand up to such challenges. In      fact, in 2015, the Government Accountability Office found      that the probationary period of one year was not working, for      the most part, because those in supervisory positions are      only there for a higher grade, that no one had trained the      supervisor in how to supervise people, or that agencies are      not properly using the probationary periods for supervisors      who are not up to the task. Therefore, we question why this      bill is necessary when, instead, increased and improved      supervisor training is what is needed. NTEU has long      supported and advocated Congress enacting federal supervisor      training.       NTEU strongly opposes subjecting frontline federal      employees--who are not tasked with managing agencies and      long-term strategic responsibilities--to longer durations of      assessment that preclude due process and collective      bargaining rights. By extending the probationary period, the      federal workforce essentially becomes an at will workforce,      with limited rights and protections. In fact, the lack of      these due process rights has a chilling effect on employee      use of the few protections they do have, namely protection      against discrimination, sexual harassment, and whistleblower      retaliation. Congress has long recognized and valued the      importance of these protections for federal employees, which      would be undermined by this bill.       We also have significant outstanding questions about what      constitutes ``formal training'' under the bill as training      programs differ greatly by agency. NTEU represents a variety      of employees who undergo long periods of significant training      that occurs at multiple points in time (non-consecutive in      nature) and where the employee is already executing the      actual job in between training sessions.       We are greatly concerned that the language in this bill      could translate into 3 or 4 year--or even indefinite--     probationary periods for some of the employees we represent,      even though that may not be the intent. At this time, it is      unclear how agencies would categorize various types of      training that some of our members undergo under this new      definition. It is also important to note that for positions      that require extensive training, these individuals are      subject to ongoing evaluations by management during any      period of training.       For all of these reasons, we strongly oppose H.4182 and      urge you to vote against it.           Sincerely,                                               Anthony Reardon,     National                                  ____     Paul Ryan,     Speaker,     Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: We are      writing to express our concerns that H.4182, the EQUALS      Act of 2017, could undermine protection for government      employees who blow the whistle. The legislation extends the      probationary period for civil service employees from one to      two years.       We recognize that the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA)      covers probationary employees, and that there are provisions      in H.4182 that directly address those rights. But      probationary employees already are at a handicap, because an      agency has almost unlimited discretion to defeat a      retaliation lawsuit through independent justification reasons      entirely within its discretion. Second, probationary      employees only have rights against partisan discrimination      and under 2302(b)(8). This means an extra year that they      will not be protected under the recently-enacted Follow the      Rules Act or under 5 USC 2302(b)(9)(D) when they refuse to      violate the law. The taxpayers could suffer the consequences.       We request that the House of Representatives consider these      concerns before there is action on this legislation. The bill      states its goal is to strengthen government accountability.      Reducing whistleblower protection will undermine it.

Mr.Mr.Chairman, I thank my friend from Virginia for those loquacious comments.  Mr.Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.4182, the Ensuring a Qualified Civil Service  H.4182 unnecessarily doubles the probationary period for Federal employees from 1 to 2 years. During this period, employees have essentially no due process rights and can be removed for any reason or no reason at all with no right to appeal.  This is an arbitrary change to existing policy, and there is no evidence to suggest that extending the probationary period will address any issues surrounding employee performance or the department performance.  Not only are candidates for Federal jobs already put through extensive selection processes, but a year is sufficient for any competent manager to determine the ability of any employee to accomplish the job that they have been hired to do.  This bill will not improve agency outcomes but would penalize Federal workers by weakening their due process rights. Without due process, Federal employees will have little protection against employer discrimination and termination without cause.  These due process rights are also critical to promoting equity, fairness, and ensuring that whistleblowers continue to speak up without fear of retaliation.  It is also a clear attempt to undermine Federal employees' right to unionize since they would not be eligible to participate until their probationary period is over.  We need evidence-based changes that value Federal employees, make their workplaces safe, protect them against sexual harassment and discrimination, and ensure that their voices are heard. I ask my colleagues to reject this shortsighted legislation.  ",CREC-2017-11-30-pt1-PgH9547-2.txt,1959,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,30,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

52,topic-id,644,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, under H.4182, the probationary period for all Federal employees is extended for an additional year, regardless of the job they are hired to do. All new employees are punished equally, and supervisors are given no new tools to improve their use of the existing probationary period.  In February 2016, as I have mentioned before, the GAO reports studying the rules and trends relating to review and dismissal of employees for poor performance, suggests that the Office of Personnel Management look into whether there are certain occupations, due to the nature or complexity of the position, in which the probationary period should be extended beyond 1 year or not.  We heard testimony before the Rules Committee from a number of colleagues who represent areas with big Federal concentration, Federal employee concentrations with specialized agencies, such as the weather service in Oklahoma and CDC in Atlanta where a 2-year probationary period may very well impede the ability to hire the skilled workers we need.  The report goes on to say that it is something that should be looked into. It does not call for a government-wide extension of the probationary period. That is why I filed this amendment to require the GAO to conduct a study on the Department of Defense and other Federal agencies that have used this tool, a 2-year probationary period.  A 2-year probationary period for civilian employees at DOD was enacted in 2016, and as the largest Federal agency, this extension would provide a good case study on the potential impacts: good, bad, and indifferent on the legislation before us. It is a study we ought to do before we adopt a bill.  Some of my colleagues believe that since extending the probationary period has been working out so well, it ought to be extended across the entire Federal There are a few things I need to point out for us. This policy only affected those who were hired after November 25, 2015, the day the law went into effect.  Secondly, the former Under Secretary of Defense, as I mentioned in earlier statements, Peter Levine, testified before the Armed Services Committee that the Department has done little to take advantage of that legislation. That is his testimony. Therefore, there are only a small number of employees who have completed the 2-year probationary period, and it is too soon to declare it a success or failure.  That is why my amendment would have the GAO give us guidance. How has it worked? Has it helped? Has it hurt? Are there some things we haven't anticipated that we need to address?  The study would also look into whether extending the probationary period has any effect on the ability of an agency to recruit and retain. And, again, I pointed out 40 percent of the existing workforce is eligible for retirement now or in the next few years. That is a huge number of people. And we have got to worry about recruitment.  Gathering the data is a necessary first step, not a last step or an afterthought, before deciding to change a law with such profound impact on Federal agencies. This bill, as I said to my friend from Kentucky (Mr.Comer), may yet prove to be a good idea, but we don't know. There remain a lot of questions about the efficacy of this proposal. It is risky, and it can have terrible negative consequences that we haven't even foreseen and some of which we can predict today.  Two weeks ago, this body adopted a policy of evidence-based policymaking, so let's put it into implementation with this bill. Let's look for some evidence, empirical evidence, systematically done to justify the adoption of such a sweeping bill.  Mr.Chairman, I call for the adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

The Maduro regime is responsible for widespread human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, mass arbitrary detentions, and torture of the political opposition. They have detained five Citgo executives who are dual U.S.-Venezuelan citizens, as well as U.citizen and religious missionary Joshua Holt, who remains unjustly imprisoned.

The crisis in Venezuela has led to mass immigration. Last year, the U.received 18,000 requests from Venezuelans seeking to escape the brutal regime. Waves of Venezuelan refugees have also fled to Chile, Argentina, Colombia, and Brazil, threatening to create a regionwide migration crisis.

I commend the efforts of the Trump administration to take a principled stand to support the Venezuelan people and sanction the most dangerous actors in the Venezuelan Just yesterday, the regime threatened that elections in Venezuela would only take place if these sanctions were lifted. I wholeheartedly reject this threat and remain committed to the sanctions and to continuing to put pressure on the Maduro regime.  I express my strong support for these two bills. The U.supports a free, democratic, and independent Venezuela that is accountable to the people. We stand ready to assist the Venezuelan people and provide humanitarian assistance, and we urge more action from our partners in the region and the international community to resolve the crisis in  ",CREC-2017-12-05-pt1-PgH9653.txt,2103,STOPPING ABUSIVE FEMALE EXPLOITATION ACT OF 2017,2017,5,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The last time this Congress took up and passed comprehensive tax reform, I was 21 years old. It has been a long time since a bill of this scope and reach and impact has been considered, debated, and passed in this I wanted to give some reflections this evening on what happened very early Saturday morning and what it means.  First, it did not have to be this way. That bill passed on a straight party-line vote. Not one Democrat voted for it, and all but one Republican Senator voted for it. I joined more than a dozen of my colleagues in a press conference I think 2 weeks ago, saying that we wanted to work across the aisle and that we were trying yet getting no opportunity to do so.  Weeks and weeks ago, a group of us put out a letter to our colleagues saying that we wanted to work together on tax reform that would make our country more competitive and that would deal with some of the long-unaddressed issues in our Tax Code and yet be fiscally responsible. And right up until Saturday, I was working with a group of Republicans and Democrats to try to find a way to move forward on tax reform that would not blow up our deficit and debt, give real tax relief to middle-class Americans, and significantly reduce the corporate tax rate. Alas, we came up short.  I wanted to give just a few moments of reflection on how I see the tax bill that ultimately moved through this Chamber last week.  First, on the process, the idea that you do your best work at something like 2 in the morning--adopting a nearly 500-page piece of legislation without anyone having had the chance to really read it and understand it--I think defies common sense.  Second, I think that the idea that the best legislating is done by only one party has been proven to be incorrect, whether it is big pieces of legislation done by only Democrats or big pieces done by only Part of the point of this Chamber--and the balance and the separation of powers that our Founders crafted into the Constitution--was the idea that when we listen to each other and compromise, we produce better legislation, better laws, better justice.  Last, I would like to talk for a moment about the values that underlie not just this process but the outcome of this bill, because in speeches and comments and debates here on the floor and in materials put out over the last 2 weeks, there has been a lot of talk about financial matters, about percentages, about numbers, and about the Joint Committee on Taxation or the Congressional Budget There has been a lot of jargon and a lot of insider talk that has frankly left a cloud that has made it difficult for most Americans to understand what was at stake and what was at work in the steady progress toward that partisan passage of the tax bill so early on Saturday morning.  Let's talk for a moment, if we could, about the human values implicated by this bill. Let's talk less about fiscal jargon and financial details and more about where it will land.  I am sure it comes as no surprise to you that ultimately I voted against the bill. I was willing to do bipartisan tax reform that would allow President Trump to meet his expressed goal of delivering a Christmas gift to the American people--in particular, to the American middle class--but I wasn't willing to sign off on a bill that would add $1 trillion to our national debt and that laid the groundwork we are already hearing for calls to slash Medicare and Once this Christmas package is opened, the middle class will realize that its real impact is the steady increase of the tax burden on them and the steady decrease, over the years ahead, of critical, vital Federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid that have made such a difference to so many in need for so long.  For reasons that elude me, most of this country was not actively engaged in this tax debate. I had about 230 calls from Delaware on last Friday--200 opposed and 20 in favor, so 10 to 1 against. But I didn't hear from folks who might have understood and might have spoken up about the long-term, grinding impact this tax bill will have on those in real need in our country.  I wanted to take a moment here on the floor to reflect on something that happened late last week in the Budget Committee as they were marking up the bill. As several dozen clergymen, men and women of different faiths, gathered together outside in a moment of civil disobedience, a few of them--friends of mine--were arrested--arrested in a cry they had hoped would be heard to express their concern about the impact of this tax bill on the poor and needy in our  I stand tonight as a I stand tonight as someone who represents I stand tonight as someone who was elected not to serve one particular faith tradition but who is deeply informed by my faith tradition and the Gospel that I read. In the Gospel According to Luke, Jesus said: ``He has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor.''  I just wanted to stand here for a moment and say that while the Gospel is good news to the poor, this tax bill surely is not. Some of the best known, simple passages in the New Testament of the Christian Bible say you cannot serve both God and wealth. Jesus's call in Matthew 25: Inasmuch as you did this to the least of these, you did it unto me.  This preference for the poor, this focus on the least among us, is not new to the New Testament; it is deeply rooted in the Torah and in the Judeo-Christian values that underlie all of In Proverbs, the Torah teaches that those who oppress the poor insult their Deuteronomy Chapter 15 teaches that you should open your hand to the poor and needy neighbor in your land.  Lastly, it seems to me that while the Bible, the New Testament, and the Torah teach these things about God's deep preference that we be kind to one another, that we care for one another, that we support those in need around us, that doesn't inevitably lead to one party's position or another. It doesn't inevitably lead to one clear economic[[Page S7824]]theory or policy or another. But it does say that before we took dramatic action that will reset the ground for a generation, that I believe will inevitably lead to a loss of security and stability and opportunity for those in need in our country, we should have reflected. We should have listened to each other. We should have respected the greatest traditions of this country that say that we are most American when we open the doors of opportunity to all, when we create chances for those who are struggling amongst us to have a brighter future. And as I searched through what I understood of this 500-page bill thrust upon us late on a Friday night and marked up and voted on early on a Saturday morning, I found none of that. I found an incredibly expensive bill that even some titans of industry have said will add little to the growth of this economy and much to the burden of debt of this country.  I know people of good faith on both sides have differing views about the impact of this bill, but I, for one, felt called tonight to come to this floor and say that I think we have made not just a mistake of fiscal policy, but I think that in moving this bill forward, we have failed in our most fundamental call to hear each other, to work together, and to be mindful that we do not cause harm to those in our society who look to us to make the future brighter, to open the doors of opportunity wider, and to listen to some of the most ancient and profound voices in the traditions that lay the foundation of this free society; that we legislate worst when we legislate against the least of our brethren.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-04-pt1-PgS7823.txt,1984,SECRET SERVICE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION ACT OF 2017,2017,4,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1402,topic-id,2413,"Mr.President, I rise today to express my deep concern with the tax reform bill that the Senate Finance Committee is likely to approve later this week. The latest version of this massive tax bill, which will impact every single American, was only released to the public late Tuesday night. Less than 48 hours later, the Finance Committee is ramming through this bill on a party-line vote without any hearings and without a thorough review of the bill.  I strongly disagree with the closed-door process of developing the substance of a bill which skews the benefits to the wealthy at the expense of middle-class families and with this bill's irresponsible cost of $1.7 trillion over 10 years. I also want to tell my colleagues and the President that there is still an opportunity for us to do the right thing and to work together on tax reform.  We should follow the example of the last time there was successful tax reform enacted by This was led by Republican President Ronald Reagan, Democratic Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, and Members of Congress from both parties, who worked together back in 1986 to pass major tax reform legislation. Sure, they had strong disagreements, but they held lengthy public debates, compromised on both sides of the aisle, and eventually passed a major tax reform bill that was bipartisan, was fair, and did not add to our deficits and national debt.  For some reason, my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten the example of the last time the Congress actually passed tax reform. It happened because both parties worked together. It happened because both parties compromised. And while I believe there is still time for us to undertake this approach, what we are seeing right now is the exact opposite. I think that is a big mistake.  When I am on the train back to Wilmington or when I am at home in my State of Delaware hearing from my constituents, my message about this bill is simple: I am worried what this bill will do to our fiscal health as a country and the middle class, and you should be too.  Let me start by quoting a story from the Washington Post today whose headline reads ``Senate tax bill cuts taxes of wealthy and hikes taxes on families earning under $75,000 over a decade.'' Let me repeat that. The Senate tax bill cuts the taxes of the wealthy and hikes taxes on families earning under $75,000. The story is based on a report from the nonpartisan Joint Commission on Taxation which shows that the claims from President Trump and my Republican colleagues that this bill is all about tax relief for the middle class are simply wrong.  I will quote from this story:       By the year 2027, Americans earning $30,000 to $75,000 a      year--  Solidly middle-class folks--     would also be forced to pay more in taxes even though people      earning over $100,000 would continue to get substantial tax      cuts.  Unfortunately, though, that is not the end of my concerns with this legislation. I am also alarmed by how much this bill would add to our Nation's budget deficits and by the long-term impacts it would have on our debt.  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, this tax bill--this Republican-only tax bill--will cost over $1.7 trillion over 10 years. That is $1.7 trillion with a ``t.'' What happened to my colleagues who spent years talking about the danger posed by a growing national debt? Now these very same Senators and Representatives are willing to put almost $2 trillion on our Nation's credit card. It is an astounding figure--more than twice as large as the emergency stimulus package Congress passed in 2009 to prevent the next Great It is more than twice as much as the much maligned so-called bailout that Congress authorized to prevent the collapse of the financial system.  What does $1.7 trillion buy us? What is the great return on investment that would justify borrowing $1.7 trillion--mostly from China--in a time of near record-low unemployment? The Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, publicly bragged that their tax plan would produce 1 million jobs. That sounds good but not when you consider the cost. My math may not be great, but if you spend $1.7 trillion to get 1 million jobs, that is $1.5 million per job. That is not a great return on investment.  To add insult to injury, the majority believes they can use this bill to also cut access to healthcare for millions of Americans because they have decided at the last moment to include a repeal of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate--a critical part of that bill--law, which helps ensure a healthy risk pool, which, in turn, lowers premiums.  Those who actually work in healthcare know this is a bad idea. That is why the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Hospital Association, and America's Health Insurance Plans have all come out against the inclusion of the individual mandate repeal in this bill, saying that ``eliminating the individual mandate by itself likely will result in a significant increase in premiums, which would substantially increase the number of uninsured Americans.''  The nonpartisan CBO agrees. They found that repealing the mandate will cause 13 million people to lose their healthcare by 2027, and average premiums would increase about 10 percent each year.  The inclusion of the mandate repeal to pay for corporate tax cuts will hurt middle-class families across our country. It is politics at its worst, throwing aside the needs of our constituents to ensure that a small group of the wealthy get wealthy. That is because the core of this bill is based on a promise proven false time and again--that tax cuts for the richest Americans and most profitable corporations will somehow trickle down to help the majority of working We know that is not how our economy has actually worked. Even President Reagan's own budget director, David Stockman, said yesterday that this bill isn't going to increase wages for the middle class.  The Senate bill proposes we cut the top corporate rate nearly in half; exempt more wealthy individuals from the estate tax, which impacts only the top 0.2 percent of Americans; repeal the alternative minimum tax, which affects those making hundreds of thousands annually; and cut tax rates for those earning over $1 million.  Altogether, the core elements of this plan amount to $1.7 trillion in tax cuts, and my Republican colleagues are simply asking us to trust them that the benefits will somehow reach the middle class.  If that isn't enough to prove that this bill being rushed through in today's markup is bad policy, my colleagues in the majority went one step further in this latest version by eliminating all tax breaks for middle-class families in 8 years while making the tax cuts for corporations permanent. This means that millions of middle-class families will see a tax hike in the future in order to fund permanency for corporate tax breaks. That is just not right.  So here is what I think we should do. Let's slow down. Let's work together, Republicans and Democrats, to pass a bill that is actually good for all I believe we can get that done. I think it is our job and our duty. We don't have to start from scratch. There are bipartisan ideas. There are introduced, bipartisan tax bills that could make our code simpler and fairer and more effective.  I will mention two examples of bills I have introduced--one with Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito and another with Republican Senator Pat Roberts--that encourage manufacturers to use made-in-America parts and incentivize companies that invent something here to make it here. I have introduced another bill with Republican Senator Jerry Moran--it has eight bipartisan cosponsors--and with Republican Congressman Ted Poe that would alter the Tax Code to boost[[Page S7283]]every aspect of the American energy industry, from oil and gas to the latest renewable and clean energy technologies. These are just a few ideas, but they represent a simple truth: that we can and should work together on tax reform instead of making this one more pointless, partisan battle.  The same thing is true for our healthcare system. The American people have overwhelmingly said they want a bipartisan and open process to fix healthcare, not a one-party scheme by either party that throws our system into chaos with no plan to replace it.  I encourage President Trump and Republican leaders to stop trying to pass tax reform with only Republicans and to reach across the aisle to work with Democrats and pass something we can all get behind.                        Tribute to Megan O'Neill  Mr.President, while I appreciate the opportunity to talk today about the very real need for bipartisan tax reform that helps working families, grows the economy, and doesn't increase our debt, I wish to turn to another important topic--the impending departure from my office of Megan O'Neill, my director of scheduling.  Megan has been a part of our office for more than 5 years. She leaves later this month for an exciting new opportunity in New York  Megan is quite simply one of the most capable, resourceful, intelligent, effective, and kind people I have ever had the honor of knowing or working with. One of the most well-worn sayings here in Washington is that ``everyone is replaceable.'' While that may be true for me, and it may be true for the Acting President pro tempore, and it may be true for many others here, it is simply not true of She is truly irreplaceable. I owe Megan a huge debt of gratitude for her years of service to my office, to Delaware, and to our country.  Many of us who have worked with her will gather to thank her and wish her well, but I also wanted to take a few minutes to talk about--and probably embarrass--this remarkable woman.  Megan is from nearby Chevy Chase, MD, but more important, at least in my opinion, is that she graduated from the University of Delaware as a ``Fighting Blue Hen'' with a degree in economics and international relations. She interned in my Wilmington office during her senior year at UD and quickly became a staff favorite.  Upon graduating, Megan moved to Washington, and I hired her as a staff assistant, working at the front desk in my DC office. It is a particularly demanding job--juggling visiting constituents, constant phone calls, and supervising interns. She proved herself to be mature and capable. I promoted her several times in quick succession until she took over as my director of scheduling in August of 2015.  Over the course of her time in my office, I have come to deeply respect her as a professional, but more importantly, I have come to admire her as a person. In addition to being incredibly competent, strategic, and quick on her feet, it is Megan's boundless patience and optimism I will most miss. Regardless of how stressful, jam-packed, and uncertain a day may be, Megan is always able to ensure that everything gets done; that every constituent is heard, every important issue is raised, and that this Senator doesn't lose his mind.  Megan is also famous for her seemingly permanent smile and sunny disposition. Some of her colleagues in my office chimed in with a few anecdotes. Oftentimes, I was told, throughout the day, Megan will announce she is off to get a ``fun drink,'' which might sound like a Margarita but is, in fact, always a raspberry lemonade-flavored Dasani sparkling water. When something comes up--whether it is a favorite TV show, album, or new restaurant, she exclaims: ``That's my jam!'' She also loves to travel, but one thing that makes her different is that when she has an upcoming trip, she is just as excited to plan it out minute by minute as she is to actually go.  I can't talk about Megan without mentioning her family. She speaks frequently and lovingly about her parents Michael and Donna O'Neill and her younger brother As anyone who knows Megan is well aware, each summer, she is a key part of O'Neill week when she joins her parents, brother, cousins, and extended family in beautiful Bethany Beach, DE, to play Olympic-style beach games, eat, drink, and enjoy each other's company.  Anyone who understands the Senate knows how essential schedulers are to everything that goes on here. No staffer has a more challenging, demanding, or complex role. We Senators have big vocabularies for our long-winded speeches, but the most important word a scheduler says is ``no,'' and Megan mastered the art of saying no in a firm, professional, appropriate way, even when this Senator seems to always want to say yes.  Schedulers wear too many hats to count. They are field generals, firefighters, political advisers, logisticians, psychologists, diplomats, managers, and air traffic controllers. They work as hard or harder than anyone else here but so often go unseen or unheard. Maybe that is why Senate schedulers are a very tight-knit group. Megan often speaks with great fondness and respect for her counterparts in other Senate offices, and it does not surprise me that they think highly of her.  One of Megan's counterparts said she is ``always quick to share advice and ideas, and has been a great source of support when any [of] her colleagues need some kind words. She is efficient and effective while also being so nice and compassionate.''  Megan's compassion is, at the end of the day, what makes her such an incredible person and an irreplaceable part of our team. Regardless of who someone may be, when they work with Megan, they are treated with dignity and respect. Time and again, I have heard from people who are so grateful for her generosity, patience, and kindness. I have seen her help and stick up for her colleagues, even when that was difficult to do.  Let me close by simply saying to my friend and colleague Megan O'Neill: Thank you. Thank you for everything you have done for me, for your colleagues, for your friends in the Senate, for the State of Delaware, and our country. The Senate is a place full of amazing, talented people, but even among them, you have stood out in your time here, and we will all miss you dearly. Thank you.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Transmittal 17-59  Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section                 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                           Annex Item vii       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:       1. The Javelin Weapon System is a medium-range, man      portable, shoulder-launched, fire and forget, anti-tank      system for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers. It may      also be mounted on a variety of platforms including vehicles,      aircraft and watercraft. The system weighs 49.5 pounds and      has a maximum range in excess of 2,500 meters. The system is      highly lethal against tanks and other systems with      conventional and reactive armors. The system possesses a      secondary capability against bunkers.       2. Javelin's key technical feature is the use of fire-and-     forget technology which allows the gunner to fire and      immediately relocate or take cover. Additional special      features are the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an      advanced tandem warhead and imaging infrared seeker, target      lock-on before launch, and soft launch from enclosures or      covered fighting positions. The Javelin missile also has a      minimum smoke motor thus decreasing its detection on the      battlefield.       3. The Javelin Weapon System is comprised of two major      tactical components, which are a reusable Command Launch Unit      (CLU) and a round contained in a disposable launch tube      assembly. The CLU incorporates an integrated day-night sight      that provides a target engagement capability in adverse      weather and countermeasure environments. The CLU may also be      used in a stand-alone mode for battlefield surveillance and      target detection. The CLU's thermal sight is a second      generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor. To      facilitate initial loading and subsequent updating of      software, all on-board missile software is uploaded via the      CLU after mating and prior to launch.       4. The missile is autonomously guided to the target using      an imaging infrared seeker and adaptive correlation tracking      algorithms. This allows the gunner to take cover or reload      and engage another target after firing a missile. The missile      has an advanced tandem warhead and can be used in either the      top attack or direct fire modes (for target undercover). An      onboard flight computer guides the missile to the selected      target.[[Page S7330]]         5. The Javelin Missile System hardware and the      documentation are The missile software which      resides in the CLU is considered The sensitivity      is primarily in the software programs which instruct the      system how to operate in the presence of countermeasures. The      overall hardware is also considered sensitive in that the      infrared wavelengths could be useful in attempted      countermeasure development.       6. If a technologically advanced adversary obtains      knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the      information could be used to develop countermeasures or      equivalent systems that might reduce weapon system      effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with      similar or advanced capabilities.       7. A determination has been made that Georgia can provide      substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive      technology being released as the U.This      proposed sale is necessary to further the U.foreign policy      and national security objectives outlined in the Policy            8. All defense articles and services listed on this      transmittal are authorized for release and export to the      Government of                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-27-pt1-PgS7329-3.txt,1825,TAX REFORM,2017,27,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Right now, we have the highest tax rate in the industrialized world, and what we are doing is lowering that tax rate to make us competitive and in so doing, taking the advice of Barack Obama in his 2011 State of the Union message; advice from the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer; and Senator Wyden, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, who has recommended a lower rate than that contained in this motion to recommit.  We think we should take the advice of President Obama, President Clinton, Senator Wyden, Minority Leader Schumer, and other prominent Democrats--the advice they have given us over the last few years to lower these corporate rates and make us more competitive so we can bring jobs back home, improve wages, and get the economy growing again so people can pursue their American dreams.

761,topic-id,2403,"Madam President, as the world knows by now, last Friday night--I guess early in the morning on Saturday--we passed the Senate's version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the first major overhaul of our Nation's tax system in more than 30 years.  I want to express my gratitude to Chairman Hatch, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who shepherded that bill through the committee. I thank him for his leadership, as well as that of Chairman Enzi, who led the reconciliation process in the Budget I know it is a complex, convoluted, and arcane process, but we couldn't have done it without both of those gentlemen.  I also commend our majority leader, Senator McConnell, and all of our colleagues who worked together for proceeding with final passage and for negotiating in good faith. I have said before, and I will say it again, that one of the differences between this and healthcare reform is that everyone, I believe, on our side of the aisle wanted to get to yes, wanted to find a way to find a solution, and that goes a long way to getting to a solution.  Last week, the majority leader rightfully referred to the process as a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and he is right. I am glad we got this bill across the finish line and will soon deliver to the American people the tax relief they deserve. Notwithstanding some of the propaganda that has been disseminated on this, the fact is, this bill benefits Americans of all stripes, including low-income families.  Well, let me just start there. This bill doubles the standard deduction, which means a married couple earning up to $24,000 will pay zero tax on that $24,000 of earnings. Above that, we have raised the child tax credit to $2,000 per child. The first $1,000 of that $2,000 is refundable. That means that even if you don't pay income taxes, if you don't make enough money to pay income taxes, you will still get the benefit of at least half of that child tax credit. It also reduces the tax bracket for low-income families as well. The bill lowers the current 15-percent rate and increases the child tax credit, both of which help persons of modest means.  This bill also helps the broad middle class. Some of our colleagues ran around like ``Chicken Little'' during the debate on this bill, saying that eliminating certain deductions will disproportionately harm hard-working families, but that is just not true. A family of four earning the median income of about $73,000 will see their taxes cut by nearly $2,200. That may be chickenfeed to some of the folks inside the beltway, but that is real tax relief for hard-working, middle-class families. We also preserve the home mortgage and charitable deductions, and families will enjoy an enhanced child tax credit which, as I mentioned earlier, along with the larger standard deduction, will help them significantly.  Finally, this bill effectively repeals ObamaCare's individual mandate. Some have called this a tax on the poor, which it is because 80 percent of the people who pay the tax or the mandate penalty earn $50,000 or less, and that is because they can't afford to buy the government-approved health insurance. So their own government, rather than help them find affordable health coverage that suits their needs that they can afford, mandates they buy a[[Page S7812]]policy they can't afford, and when they don't do it, then taxes them with the individual mandate. We repealed that entirely, which will also ensure more take-home pay for America's families.  For America's job creators, this lowers taxes from 35 percent to a much more nationally competitive rate. What that means is, rather than hiring people overseas and keeping that money overseas earned from their labor, they will be now incentivized to bring it back to the United States to build and to hire in Right now, we have the highest tax rate in the industrialized world, 35 percent, when the international average for the industrialized world is roughly about 22 percent. We are getting a little below that at 20 percent, and together, with all the other advantages of doing business in America, we believe there will be a flood of money that is repatriated to the United States that is currently parked overseas, along with the jobs and investment that will go along with that.  Now that the bill has passed the Senate, we will soon begin to discuss the bill in a conference committee. This is how we reconcile the differences between the House version and the Senate version. I know there are a few items of concern and that the two versions of the bill differ to some extent, but I feel confident that with the help of Speaker Ryan and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Kevin Brady, we can reach an agreement quickly. It is important that we do so, that we reconcile those differences as quickly as we can, because we want to get this bill on the President's desk before Christmas so the people we are targeting relief for--starting from lower income Americans to the middle class, to America's job creators--can begin to enjoy the benefits of the tax cuts and tax reform right out of the gates in 2018.  It is true that our shared goals between the House and Senate are much more important than the small differences in our approaches, and these goals, as we have always agreed on, are increasing the paychecks of American workers and getting the economy working again because, unfortunately, it has become flat and stagnant.  The President has called tax reform rocket fuel, and I think that is right. Our economy has already begun to take off. It is amazing what the American economy will do when it is unleashed from overtaxation and overregulation. We have already seen the consumer confidence at a 16-year high; the stock market is hitting historic highs; people are anticipating the results of the rollback of excessive regulation during the Obama administration and the reduction in taxes, creating a much more competitive environment. It is exciting to see it beginning to happen.  As I said, the GDP grew 3 percent this last quarter, but over the last year it has been about 1.9 percent--so low that it is really not creating new jobs and certainly not creating new investment here in the United This tax reform and tax cut bill will change that. It will keep the American motor running fast and smoothly.  Now, it is my sincere hope that those in the driver's seat, the families and companies great and small, will reach destinations that before maybe they only dreamed of because this is really what this legislation is about. It is not about dollars and cents. It is not just about taxes. It is not just about the government's relationship with its own people, the people who are the heart and soul of this great country. This is about America's standing in the world. Will we continue to be the economic leader and the envy of the rest of the world? Will we continue to be able to have the strongest military and the ability to lead and keep the world safe, as opposed to creating vacuums when we retreat? Those vacuums are then filled by the bullies, tyrants, and dictators who certainly don't share our values.  I am excited about what we were able to accomplish last week, but we are not done yet. We need to get this bill reconciled with the House and put it on the President's desk so all Americans can enjoy the benefits of this tax reform, whether it is a direct tax reduction from their tax burden or being relieved from the onerous tax on poverty in the individual mandate or enjoying the benefit of America's increased competitiveness in the world and incentivizing businesses to invest, hire, and improve wages right here in I am excited and optimistic about what the future will hold once we get this on the President's desk later this month.                                  DACA  Madam President, the next topic I would like to address is something we refer to as This is the Deferred Action for Childhood Of course, this is a program that President Obama instituted because he decided to take an end-run around the Congress and tried to unilaterally provide relief to these young adults who came here as children with their parents illegally.  Being a recovering lawyer and judge myself, I can tell you we don't ordinarily hold children responsible for the actions of their parents. So I believe the President's compassion was appropriately placed, but his fidelity to the Constitution and to Congress's role in coming up with a solution was misplaced. So it is now our chance to put the program where it belongs, which is back into the hands of Congress, working with the administration.  As a result of what President Trump decided to do, which is to give this responsibility for a solution back to Congress, some of our Democratic friends are threatening to shut down the government this month, without an agreement on That is simply a hysterical and cynical ploy, putting their party and their agenda ahead of the How can you claim to care about the 800,000 undocumented immigrants this program protects through work permits and deportation relief, but then turn your back on the 322 million people who need to know that their government is still able to function? That is holding 322 million Americans hostage for their political desire to get a solution on their timetable--not on our timetable--and one that if we are successful and able to accomplish in January or February, will be done well in advance of the deadline in March of next year.  Let's all remember the recent course of events. President Trump announced his decision to rescind DACA on September 5 but delayed the decision to take effect for 6 months, giving us a little time to approach this problem thoughtfully and carefully. The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee then convened a working group to study potential DACA fixes. Finally, last week, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee offered an initial proposal which our Democratic colleagues rejected out of hand, refusing to even make a counterproposal.  The proposal we made included border security, interior enforcement, improvements in the E-Verify system, and a path to legal status for DACA recipients and limits on certain types of chain migration. Members of the Republican caucus, including myself, indicated a willingness to continue to negotiate, saying this was our starting point, but we insisted that any proposed solution must include border security and interior enforcement measures.  Now, as a result of our Democratic colleagues simply rejecting out of hand our initial offer and refusing to negotiate with us, it is fair to say those negotiations are currently at an impasse. By threatening to shut down the government, they are jeopardizing the future fate of those DACA recipients.  We have heard the senior Senator from Illinois, the junior Senator from California, the junior Senator from Vermont all threaten to shut down the government unless they can get their way when they want to get their way sometime this month. Perhaps they are unaware of how dire this ongoing uncertainty is. I come from a State where there are some 124,000 DACA beneficiaries, so I understand what is at stake, and I am committed to doing everything I can to helping provide them some relief, but it is not just my way or the highway. We are going to have to come up with a negotiated outcome that demonstrates our compassion for these young adults who came here as children through no fault of their own and now find themselves trapped.  We need to make sure that, 1, we stop or limit as much as we can illegal immigration into the United States, that we enforce our laws, and make sure people do it the right way.[[Page S7813]]  We are the most generous nation in the world when it comes to legal immigration. Our country naturalizes almost 1 million people a year. We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. That is what our colleagues across the aisle seem to have forgotten about. We will no longer be the great Nation we are if we fail to be a nation of laws.  We need to address the root problems as well. We can't just every few years come negotiate a temporary patch to what is a larger problem. Among them are holes in our porous border. My own State has 1,200 miles of common border with We know that our Border Patrol and Customs officials are overwhelmed. There is outdated surveillance and detection technology and a lack heretofore of serious interior enforcement of our immigration laws. We know that our immigration courts are stacked up and badly in need of additional resources.  By playing games and threatening to shut down the government unless our Democratic colleagues get what they want when they want and engaging in stunts to shut down the government, they are only hurting their own cause and the very individuals they claim to be protecting. They are engaging in destructive identity politics and turning their backs on the rest of the  I hope that those young adults--the Dreamers, they are frequently called--whom I described earlier aren't fooled by the theatrics of those who claim to help them. We all want a legislative solution, and we can find one as long as we quit the game-playing and the stunts and we sit down and negotiate seriously to try to come up with an avenue of relief, one borne by typical American compassion for these young people who find themselves at a dead end and those who believe that we need to get to the underlying causes that caused them to be in this situation in the first place; that is, a lack of appropriate border security and enforcement of our immigration laws. We can do this if we quit grandstanding and quit engaging in these sorts of stunts, and I hope we will.  Madam President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

906,topic-id,709,"Mr.President, I know the Senator from Arkansas has some remarks to make, so I will keep mine brief. I want to speak on the introduction of the Security, Enforcement, and[[Page S7838]]Compassion United in Reform Efforts Act, or the SECURE Act, which we will, under the provisions of rule XIV, put on the Senate calendar following the vote on the nomination at 4 o'clock. This bill is a product of a working group formed by Chairman Grassley of the Senate Judiciary Committee--the committee with jurisdiction over immigration matters. I have been a part of that, as have Senators Graham, Tillis, Lankford, Perdue, and  I would say to our friend from Illinois, we are all united in the desire to actually come up with a solution to this problem.  Our working group had two assignments. The first was to adopt reforms to secure America's borders and enforce our immigration laws. The second was to find a compassionate solution for those individuals who received deferred action under the DACA Program created by President Obama in 2012.  When I introduced a border security bill--the Building America's Trust Act--in August, I made clear that the main purpose for that was to create solutions that we could put in place to deal with our porous borders and that throwing money at the problem is not the answer, but it was also contemplating that at some point in the not too distant future, we would need to combine border security and enforcement measures with a solution for the recipients of the deferred action under President Obama, which now President Trump has appropriately sent back to Congress for us to address.  Coming from the State with the longest border with a foreign country--the State of Texas--I can tell my colleagues that my understanding and appreciation for border security are multifaceted. It requires boots on the ground, it requires technology, and it requires improvements in aging infrastructure at our ports of entry. But it also requires new authorities and enhancements to existing immigration laws to close loopholes that incentivize people who repeatedly violate our laws.  We can all agree that we need to protect America's international borders, whether they be to the north or south. Each day that we fail to put the needed resources and laws in place for border security and interior enforcement, we strengthen the resolve of drug cartels, gangs, and transnational criminal organizations to encroach on our sovereignty with impunity.  If we are going to act to help folks who were brought here by their parents, for whom we all have compassion--and thanks to President Obama's insistence on going around Congress in violation of the law, they now find themselves in limbo--prioritizing the resources needed to secure the border is the first step. It is not the last step, it is the first step. If we can demonstrate our ability to deal with a compassionate solution for the DACA recipients and combine that with real border security and interior enforcement, I would propose that we don't need to stop there, but we do need to regain the public's confidence that we are capable of dealing with these issues in a responsible way.  The DACA Program was designed to help those who were brought here illegally, but it was not created lawfully. President Trump, as I said, did the right thing when he kicked it back to So we have now introduced a bill that will address the very issues that our friends across the aisle say they care about the most: a solution for the DACA recipients. This bill provides a framework for a legislative proposal that we can support and that will regain America's trust.  I have told both Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader, and my friend Senator Durbin from Illinois that I stand ready to work with them on a proposal that includes the four pillars of the GOP framework: border security, interior enforcement, improvements to the E-Verify system, and some limits on chain migration. I hope they will come back to the table and respond to this proposal. I hope they will also quit threatening to shut down the government, which won't solve the problem but, indeed, will make it worse.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

920,topic-id,3118,"Mr.President, we know last Friday night, into the wee hours of Saturday morning, this body did something remarkable, something people said would never happen. We actually got some very important work done and passed a very important piece of legislation--the first overhaul of our Nation's Tax Code in over 30 years.  People said it couldn't be done. It is too hard. With Democrats opposing us at every step on the committee and on the floor, people said there were just too many obstacles in our way, and it was impossible to accomplish. People said there were too many special interests down on K Street that would make it impossible for us to figure out this Rubik's Cube of a tax code, there were too many moving pieces in this giant tome of our tax law. People warned us, if we did this, we would take political flak from all sides.  Well, to the cynics and skeptics and doubters, I will say: You were wrong. We did get it done. Families and job creators woke up the next day after the final vote feeling a little bit more confident about our Nation's fiscal future. Now that the bill has passed the Senate, they will be less weighed down by the yoke of government. They can breathe a little sigh of relief knowing we are doing our job. We are doing what we said we would do when they gave us control of the government.  Of course, it took no time for our major victory to be mocked, denigrated, or simply misrepresented. Sometimes the false rumor spreading was done deliberately by our friends on the other side of the aisle, which is ironic because Democrats used to support many aspects of this plan, such as lowering taxes for the middle class and eliminating incentives for corporations to ship jobs overseas. I guess we must conclude that they were happy with the status quo, a slow-growing economy, stagnant wages, jobs being shipped overseas because of our self-destructive Tax I guess we would have to conclude they thought that was a good thing. Well, they know it was not a good thing, but they just couldn't stand the possibility that we were going to be able to make this major accomplishment on behalf of the American people. Because they were so mired down in the politics of the day, they lost sight of the forest for the trees.  We all know it is easier to criticize than to contribute, such as when many on the other side feigned outrage about small tweaks that needed to be made to the bill. It is interesting. Back in 2010, there was an amendment called the Durbin amendment 3989 where, during the course of the debate, it was necessary to make some changes in the bill by handwriting those changes in the bill text. No one thought that was an outrage. Everyone understood this is sometimes what happens when you are making last-minute changes to legislation. Yet our Democratic colleagues acted like this was the first time this had ever been done, and 46 Senate Democrats voted for Senator Durbin's amendment, which included these handwritten changes in the text.  Don't forget the tax bill was passed last week through regular order. ``Regular order'' is part of the jargon we use around here, but it means the normal legislative process. Unlike the Affordable Care Act that was written in Majority Leader Harry Reid's office and brought to the Senate floor without going through the Senate Finance Unlike that process, this tax bill originated in the Senate Finance Committee, was the product of multiyear studies, working groups, white papers, a lot of proposals like the Camp draft, for example, that helped inform our debate.  From the bill that had been introduced by the ranking member, Senator Wyden, along with Senator Coats, we were able to glean some of the best elements of all of those prior efforts. Using regular order, giving Democrats and Republicans a chance to contribute to the legislation in the Finance Committee and on the Senate floor, we gave Democrats and Republicans a chance to offer amendments and to get votes on those amendments. That is what we mean by regular order, and that is what our friend from Arizona, the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr.McCain, rightly called for earlier this fall.  There were hearings after hearings. Democrats went to them. Democrats had their opportunities to offer amendments during the committee markup and to offer amendments on the floor. So one simply cannot say, honestly or truthfully, as many Democrats have, that the bill was negotiated in darkness, behind their backs, without their participation. It simply is a false claim, it is not true, and the facts show that.  It is not just our Democratic colleagues who have fueled misperceptions about the tax bill we passed late last Friday night, early Saturday morning. There was a big stir raised with the scoring done by the Joint Committee on Some of the critics of the tax bill have latched onto the Joint Taxation report, finding that the bill would increase the economy by 0.8 percent over 10 years, not enough for the cuts to pay for themselves, thus adding to the national deficit. That was the claim.  I take concerns about fiscal responsibility very seriously, but we have to acknowledge that economic modeling is notoriously difficult and can be done in a number of different ways. Each of these models has its strengths and weaknesses, each provides a range of estimates, and none is perfect. We have not yet been given the gift of perfect knowledge of the future. In the case of the Joint Committee on Taxation, the estimate was that the tax bill would generate enough growth to offset its pricetag from $1.4 trillion to about $1 trillion--a net $400 billion feedback effect. This is pretty interesting listening to our colleagues across the aisle. They make the audacious claim that tax cuts generate no economic growth--none. So when the original Budget Committee budget came out, giving the tax writers $1.5 trillion of deficit spending on a static basis, they claimed that would result in a $1.5 trillion deficit. Well, the Joint Committee on Taxation concluded that was not true. In fact, tax cuts can have a stimulative effect on the economy. Incentives can change human behavior, but it is notoriously difficult to estimate with any precision.  In any giant complex system like the American economy, the effect of changes is not easy to predict, but even small changes can produce large, far-reaching benefits. In our case, that means changes in our Tax Code can fuel major economic growth, which ought to be our collective goal.  Why should we have to settle for anemic economic growth? Why should we have to settle for flat wages? Why should we have to settle for jobs being created overseas because our Tax Code incentivizes that rather than incentivizing investment and job creation in the United States?  Well, the fact is, we don't have to settle for that, and we haven't. This tax bill represents our best effort to try to make sure our economy does grow, that wages do go up, and that jobs do come home to the United States because businesses are incentivized to bring that money back home and invest it in jobs and wages back here.  I am optimistic that with the reforms we have enacted, the economy could grow by as much as 3 percent, as the Heritage Foundation and the Tax Foundation have said. The President's Council of Economic Advisers and influential economists agree. I am aware of the old saying that if we were to stretch all the economists in the world end to end, we would never reach a conclusion. They call it the dismal science for a reason. It is not rocket science; it is modeling that tries to predict the future, which is notoriously difficult to do. In fact, you can't do it, but we try to come up with the best guesstimate we can.  I think it is wrong to just look at the Tax Code when you are looking at our economic future. Coupled with the regulatory relief we have seen under the new administration, along with the Congressional Review Act where we repealed back some of the onerous regulations on the economy, and with consumer confidence at a 16-year high, I think we all have the sense that America is coming back as a leading economic engine in the world, and we need to do that because we need to lead the way for the world economy. We need to make sure that the standard of living[[Page S7831]]in America continues to be something that we can achieve--a better standard of living for our children and grandchildren than the one we ourselves have enjoyed. That is the legacy we have inherited from our parents and grandparents.  Yes, we are in a dangerous world. The former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, said that in his 50 years in the intelligence community, he had never seen a more diverse array of threats than he did today. We can't ignore that, which means that we have to use some of that prosperity for our common defense. That is another important thing we are going to have to do before the end of this year; that is, to agree on a top-line spending number for national defense spending, because we have been trying to cash the peace dividend, again, when there is no peace or at least peace is threatened in places around the world, whether it is in the South China Sea, Syria, North Korea, or in Europe, with Russia on the march threatening NATO and our European allies. We need a strong economy so the standard of living can go up, wages can increase, and so we can do the things that we know we need to do as a country.  Now, I realize that these positive analyses by groups like the Heritage Foundation, the Tax Foundation, and the President's Council of Economic Advisers don't entirely pacify some of the deficit hawks. I count myself among them. We worry about whether tax reform will add to our debt through cuts in decreased revenue. But even based on conservative estimates, this tax reform could result in $130 billion in new revenue--revenue we would not otherwise have.  Here is the problem. Here is the elephant in the room that people simply choose to ignore or have given up on: Revenue isn't our biggest problem. It is our spending addiction. It is the 70 percent of Federal spending that is on autopilot, going up on average about 5.5 percent per year. Now, we have tried to do what we could through the Budget Control Act in 2011 and put a cap on discretionary spending, including defense spending. That has been relatively flat since 2011, but all the while, entitlement spending has gone up because we don't have the political courage to deal with it. The deficit can't be eliminated with tax increases. We can't tax America's producers enough to fill the hole. We have to address mandatory spending, which keeps growing year after year after year. It nearly doubled during the Obama administration, during which time our friends across the aisle never really said much about deficits and debt. But it is real. We ought to go to the root cause of it and not claim that it is making tax cuts to help make our economy more vibrant and improve the quality of life for more  Putting aside the macroeconomic concerns over the tax bill for a moment, it is easy to see how, on a more personal level, families and workers will benefit. Sometimes in accounts about tax reform, this more human focus is simply left out and that is a mistake.  For example, in our bill, rates are reduced for everybody. Every tax bracket sees a reduction in their tax rate. The standard deduction for families is doubled. So if you are a married couple filing a joint return, for the first $24,000 you earn, there is zero tax--zero. Then we double the child tax credit. I think that is something we should do because we need to help those families that have children to make sure that their families prosper, and the child tax credit is one way we can do that.  The ObamaCare mandate to buy government-approved insurance, which is just a tax on low- and middle-income Americans, is repealed, and I think that is another form of tax relief. There are 6.7 million Americans who had to pay a penalty to their own government because they couldn't afford to buy the government-mandated insurance because of the way that program was structured. Well, we eliminate that entirely. So, hopefully, those families can then use their own resources to buy insurance policies that meet their needs rather than what the government mandates.  We also soften the blow of the death tax, something I will continue to work to completely eliminate because I think it is simply a moral issue. Why should we tax income when earned and, then, when families want to pass it on to their children--whether it is the family farm, ranch, or a small business--we tax them again and make that sometimes impossible to do? Usually, if you want to reduce something, you tax it and that doesn't apply to the death tax because death will come no matter what. But it is immoral, I believe--double taxation. That is no reason for Washington to prevent families from passing on the fruit of their labor to their loved ones.  The likely result of all of these changes will be that wages will increase by as much as $4,000 for the average family. That is the estimate of the Council of Economic Think about that--if we can get the economy growing faster than the 1.9 percent anemic growth of the Obama years. Just think about that. The economy has grown on average at 3.2 percent since World War Yet we are being asked to settle for the new normal of the Obama years when the economy grew at 2 percent or less. So if we can get the economy growing faster, we will see wages improve and we will see family income improve. If we can cut their tax burden and relieve them of onerous things like the poverty tax, known as the Obama individual mandate tax, families will be better off.  A median family of four will see their tax burden cut by $2,200. Now, I know that in Washington, DC, when we talk about millions and billions and trillions of dollars, $2,200 doesn't seem like a lot of money, but for many families struggling to meet their obligations paycheck after paycheck, $2,200 can make a big difference. It can help them pay off their mortgage or pay college tuition for their children or replace a water heater or get their car fixed or finally take a long-delayed family vacation.  Now, the last heedless claim I have heard about our tax bill is that it mainly benefits corporations at the expense of normal, hard-working men and women. Once again, this is a false claim. Some portion of our high corporate tax rates are always borne by labor--by American workers, in other words. Our friends across the aisle and the critics sometimes claim that if you do something for a business, whether it is a passthrough business or a corporation, it has no effect on the people who work for it. Well, that is just demonstrably wrong, because the better off those businesses are, the more people they can hire, the better the wages are that they can pay, and those help hard-working American families.  So higher business taxes mean fewer jobs and smaller paychecks, and it means that we are less competitive in a global economy. That is why businesses are moving their headquarters overseas to low-tax countries like Ireland or the United This situation will change under our new bill.  In a recent survey of corporate chief executive officers, 82 percent said they would increase capital spending if our bill passed and 76 percent said they would increase hiring. So, yes, it is true that business will benefit, but we want them to because the end result will be less tax dodging and more jobs coming back home and, as I mentioned earlier, apart from businesses, families and individuals benefit too.  What is so bizarre about the debate is that this is a concept that former President Obama championed; that the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, has championed; and that the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Wyden, has championed--lower corporate taxes--because they realize this is a self-inflicted wound because it forces businesses overseas and prevents them from bringing their income back and investing it in the United States in jobs and wages. My question to them is this: Have you forgotten? Well, I don't think they have forgotten.  Throughout the tax reform process, Members of this Republican Conference on this side of the aisle worked together, and I am grateful for the contribution that each and every one of them made. With the strong headwinds from our opponents on the other side of the aisle who wanted failure, presumably because they liked the status quo rather than success, we knew this was going to be difficult, and it was. We got it done, but we are not finished yet.  As we head into a conference with the House of Representatives, the focus has to be on how we can maintain support here in the I hope our[[Page S7832]]friends across the Capitol understand that the Senate bill was a very fragile compromise and that one or two--well, two or more--Senators who would not support that bill could jeopardize the House-Senate conference. So we have to be very careful. We have to continue to communicate and work together with each other, and we can't undermine our own victory. It is not just our victory. It is a victory for American families and for our country and for our standing in the world. So when we begin our conversations with the House, let's take care to work closely together and continue to communicate. Let's prove that passing tax reform wasn't just a dream or an aberration. It was real. Now with the ball on the 5-yard line, we just have to punch this into the end zone.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

So it strikes me as odd, if not just outright fallacious, to suggest that we are somehow keeping them out of a bipartisan process. Just the opposite is true. They are taking themselves out of the process by obstructing, blocking, and doing everything they can to prevent us from actually delivering tax reform and tax cuts to the American people. That is what is happening here.  Just as the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, the Senator from Oregon, offered a motion to commit last night, just as the Senator from Ohio is offering a motion to commit here today, they are participating in the process while claiming to have no part of the process. The only problem is, they are not contributing anything positive. All they are trying to do is to blow up the process. They must like the fact that we have the highest business tax rate in the world, which forces jobs and investments overseas rather than encourages that money to come back home. They must like the fact that wages in America are stagnant. They must like the fact that working American families have not seen a pay increase because of those stagnant wages. They must like the fact that there are many people who are looking for work who can't find work, because they refuse to consider an alternative that might provide better wages and more jobs to people looking for work. They must think that 1.9 percent economic growth is the best we can do.

1455,topic-id,1266,"Madam President, the Senator from New York is my friend, and we have worked together on a number of occasions, but I must disagree with a number of things he said today.  First of all, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was a partisan creation by Democrats during the Obama administration that had virtually no Republican support. What they did is that they created a modern-day emperor, somebody immune from congressional oversight and the appropriations process. Now that Mr.Cordray is leaving, following the election of a Republican President, they are taking exception to the fact that this President has the authority under the law to appoint his successor. Instead, they are insisting that somebody chosen by Mr.Cordray--this modern-day financial emperor--should be able to make a choice and foist that on this administration when, clearly, this administration was elected to office in part in response to the overreach of the previous Obama administration.  This is a perfect example of how nimble my colleague can be with the facts. The fact is that he comes here and complains about the fact that this tax bill we will be taking up is not partisan enough for him, when Senate Democrats have made it clear that they don't want to do anything that would give any credit to this administration or the Republican majority.  Rather than taking the opportunity to find common ground and govern, they, essentially, have taken up the resistance, leaving the results of the election last November basically unresolved, in their minds, at least, even though the American people have clearly moved on and expect this administration, which was elected to office, along with a Republican majority in the House and the Senate, to actually govern.  I remember days and times when, after we had elections, we actually figured out that we needed to govern and weren't focused then on the next campaign. Apparently, our colleagues across the aisle have simply forgotten that. That is the bad news. The good news is that it is not too late for them to change their ways and join us and bring historic tax reform to the American people.  This week, we will be considering the Senate's version--voted out of the Senate Finance Committee last Thursday night--of our Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is the first major overall of our Nation's Tax Code in more than 30 years. It cuts tax rates across the board, reducing the burden on American job creators and middle-class families alike.  Under our proposal, it has been estimated that folks back in my home State of Texas will see more than 76,000 new jobs created. After-tax income for middle-class families should rise by nearly $2,600. Now, that may be chump change here inside the beltway; our friends across the aisle may turn their nose up and say: Who would want to do this for $2,600 additional tax savings. But I can tell you, my 28 million constituents in Texas don't believe that $2,600 in tax savings for a family of four is chump change. They think of that as ways to increase their take-home pay, improve their standard of living, prepare for retirement, and help their children go to college. That is what that means to them.  This bill will also reduce the tax burden on small businesses and put American companies on a level playing field with their foreign competitors, ultimately growing our economy here at home.  Ironically, we heard some of the same old tired rhetoric in the Finance Committee, where we were talking about corporate giveaways and things like that, only to remind our colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee that they themselves had proposed similar tax cuts for American businesses so they could get more competitive in an international global economy. We had to remind them, after they derided this idea that we would want to be more competitive in the global economy, that it was Barack Obama, in 2011, who called for Democrats and Republicans to come together to cut the corporate tax rate because it was the highest one in the world and it was causing businesses to invest abroad--indeed, to leave the United States to set up their headquarters abroad just to avoid the highest tax rate in the civilized world.  There has been a lot of disinformation and misinformation out there, which I would like to take the opportunity to correct on a couple of accounts.  One major reform we have included in the latest version of our tax reform bill is the repeal of ObamaCare's individual mandate. Make no mistake, the individual mandate penalty is literally a tax on low-income It is a tax because Chief Justice Roberts and the U.Supreme Court called it a tax.  Democrats have made two arguments: first, that repealing this mandate is a tax increase. Only in the parallel universe known as Washington, DC, would cutting the tax be called a tax increase. Second, they said the repeal kicks people off their insurance coverage, which is demonstrably not true.  But let's start with the first argument, that the repeal somehow represents a tax increase on the poor. It is a pretty strange thing to say that eliminating a financial obligation simultaneously entails an additional fiscal burden; in other words, that a tax cut is really a tax increase. Only here in the parallel universe of Washington, DC, could that possibly be true. It defies all logic.  What actually happens under our plan is that certain low-income individuals do get a tax cut. If they voluntarily decide not to buy ObamaCare coverage, they will receive an additional tax cut because they will no longer be penalized by their own government for failing to buy an insurance policy they can't afford. It is worth noting that, in 2015, 80 percent of people paying the ObamaCare individual mandate tax made less than $50,000 each year. Eighty percent made less than $50,000.  There were 6.7 million people in 2015 alone that paid this additional tax mandate because they couldn't afford to purchase the government-mandated coverage. If the mandate is repealed, these folks would have more money to spend, and they will benefit from income tax rate reductions in addition. If our colleagues across the aisle would work with us, these same people would find more affordable coverage that suited their needs rather than have to buy a one-size-fits-all policy that prices them out of the market. But that is another story.  The second ridiculous argument is one you may recall the minority leader saying shortly before He made the statement that we are kicking 13 million people off of their health insurance. But that is just not true, and it doesn't tell the whole story.  First of all, no one is being kicked off of their health insurance coverage. Instead, people will no longer be fined by their own government for not buying government-approved health insurance. That is based on the correct view that people shouldn't be coerced by their very own government to buy something they may not want and can't afford. Like I said, in a more rational world, Democrats and Republicans would work together to come up with an alternative that would provide people with more choices at a better price.  Democrats might say: Well, what about premiums? Will they not rise if the mandate is eliminated and people drop out of the market because of this problem? This is one of the problems created by the Affordable Care Act at its very beginning. But the issue of rising premiums is significant.

1813,topic-id,2412,"Mr.President, this week we are engaged in what is perhaps the most momentous subject that we haven't dealt with in recent times, and that is, after 30 years, updating and reforming our Nation's convoluted, complex, and self-destructive Tax  Those who are interested in getting to yes and who will cast a ``yes'' vote, I believe, will be casting a vote for growing the economy, voting for more jobs, voting for higher wages, and voting for more take-home pay. Those who vote against this endeavor are really saying yes to stagnant wages, less jobs, and a lower standard of living. They are willing to accept the reality that American jobs are going overseas because our country has the highest Tax Code in the civilized world, and bringing the money earned overseas back home basically means having to pay double taxes. So what people do is they do what you would logically do, and they spend the money overseas and hire foreign workers in foreign countries rather than Americans and make things stamped ``Made in America.''  Simply stated, this bill is about the dreamers and the doers, the small businesses and the hard-working American families who need tax cuts and tax reform. This is about helping the middle class.  Actually, what this bill does--the Senate version of the bill--is it reduces the tax burden on every tax-paying cohort. In other words, all of the tax rates come down. In order to do that, both on the personal side and the business side, we had to eliminate a lot of what I call the underbrush, which are the tax deductions, the tax credits, and the other subsidies that have made our Tax Code so incomprehensible to everybody other than accountants and lawyers. That is one reason people are so frustrated with our Tax Code--it costs them so much money just to comply with their legal obligations.  It has been a long time since we took up this important topic, and I know the reaction is, well, this is just another going-through-the-motions effort, but I assure you that is not the case. These reforms are not only possible, they are very important because they will positively impact real people's lives.  Arthur Brooks of the American Enterprise Institute has said that ``some believe that taxation is a dry topic[[Page S7347]]with no moral significance, but nothing could be further from the truth.'' For example, by doubling the standard deduction, we will limit the number of people who have to itemize their tax deductions in order to claim the full legal deduction. That means that now only 1 out of every 10 taxpayers will have to itemize and 9 out of 10 will just claim the standard deduction, which will now be doubled.  We are also going to double the child tax credit, which will help working families provide the things they need in order to take care of their growing families. It will mean that more people will have more money left over after paying Uncle Sam to spend on their own families, to invest in their children's education, maybe to even take the first vacation they have taken in 10 years or more.  Mr.President, $2,200 is what a median family of four will save in taxes under our proposal. Maybe they want to get their pickup truck fixed. Maybe they want to build a little financial cushion because they have been living paycheck to paycheck. I can't remember the precise statistic, but the number of people in America who could not meet their financial needs if they experienced an unexpected $400 cost--maybe your car broke down, or maybe your house flooded, whatever the case may be. We need people to be able to keep more of what they earn and build a cushion so they don't have to live with the anxiety of living paycheck to paycheck, knowing that if the unexpected happens, it could put them in deep trouble. That $2,200 a year could mean a couple hundred dollars each month to put toward your mortgage, to pay down your mortgage, or to provide a little breathing room.  This plan is also designed to increase wages, and it is estimated that the combined benefit of this bill, together with the economic growth we are anticipating, could mean as much as $4,000 in additional income. So it not only lowers the tax burden, but it raises the income levels. Frankly, as I mentioned a moment ago, our Tax Code incentivizes American businesses to send jobs overseas. Why in the world wouldn't we want to incentivize them to bring those jobs back home and invest here?  Not only can we make this Tax Code better, but I want to emphasize why we should. We have a historic opportunity, and we shouldn't squander our chances to take a bit of the pressure off of frustrated workers and struggling families who are trying to make ends meet.  This country has long been a leader in the world, with the strongest economy and the strongest people, but the reality is, our Tax Code is no longer a world leader. As I indicated earlier, we have one of the highest tax rates in the world, particularly for businesses. So what happens when countries like Ireland or the United Kingdom lower their tax rates for businesses? Well, those businesses move to those countries. People who want to start a new business say: Well, if I have a choice where to start that business, why should I start that business in a country that punishes us with the highest tax rate in the world?  The current tax system penalizes success by taxing American ingenuity and hard work at rates that are uncompetitive, and it discourages our free enterprise system. What I mean is that it sends messages to Americans like, don't work so hard because, you know what, you are not working for yourself, you are working for the government. We ought to be sending the message that by working harder, you can keep more of what you earn and spend it the way you see fit.  Companies, of course, have no particular loyalty to our country, so they don't really have a need to stick around because they are going to go to countries where they can make the most profit, where they can keep more of what they earn.  My basic point is that the messages our convoluted and archaic Tax Code is sending are counterproductive. They are counterproductive to workers who are looking for jobs, they are counterproductive to workers who are looking for a little more in their paychecks, and they are counterproductive to families who want to save and provide for their own future.  In 2016, the Tax Policy Center projected that almost 44 percent of Americans will pay no or negative individual income tax for 2017 under current law, and some smaller number even get more money back from the government in the form of refundable tax credits than they pay in taxes. We need to make sure that everybody participates in our government.  One thing I have heard a lot during this tax debate is that America is horribly in debt. Sadly, that is true. But it is not because of our Tax It is not because Americans aren't taxed enough. It is not because we spend too much money defending our country against threats here at home and abroad. It is because we have a spending problem.  Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues, who suddenly got religion when it comes to deficits and debt after doubling the national debt during the Obama administration, want to use this as a reason not to cut the taxes for hard-working American families, and I think it is terribly misplaced.  Is the deficit important? Is debt important? Yes, it is, and we know what we need to do to fix that. But denying the American people and hard-working American families the tax relief they need and deserve and failing to get the economy growing again is the wrong way to do it.  Let me quote from Arthur Brooks again. He said: ``If income tax rates are 100 percent, income tax revenue will be zero. Why? Because with a 100-percent tax rate, nobody will bother to work. And companies won't produce'' either.  On corporate taxes, we are seeing a lot of hypocrisy from our friends across the aisle who had previously championed some of the very provisions we have included in this legislation. For example, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, our Democratic friend from Oregon, had previously championed a 24-percent corporate rate because he recognized that a 35-percent corporate rate chased companies, businesses, and jobs overseas. Now he calls our reduction in corporate taxes a giveaway to corporations. You could consider the statements made by President Barack Obama in 2011 when he said to a joint session of Congress--he said that one of the things Republicans and Democrats need to do together is to work on lowering the corporate tax rate because he, too, recognized that this was self-destructive, that it was chasing jobs overseas, that it was preventing the U.Treasury from collecting its taxes, and frankly that it was hurting the bottom line for American families who maybe couldn't find work or whose work was not rewarded with fatter paychecks and more take-home pay.  For corporate taxes, economists have said that actually lowering the corporate tax rate will bring more investment and more jobs back home. If it were lowered, expanded production and investment would increase domestically.  Even though it might seem a little counterintuitive, Barack Obama; the Senator from Oregon, Mr.Wyden; and the minority leader, Senator Schumer from New York, were correct when they called for lowering the corporate rate, and it is unseemly to now try to demagogue this issue by calling it a giveaway when it is not. We are doing what they said we should do years ago.  When it comes to these corporate rates, some of my colleagues have raised concerns about passthrough businesses. It is true that a number of businesses operate here in America not as corporations but as passthrough entities, meaning that they pay their business income on an individual tax return. These concerns are legitimate, and we have worked hard to try to address them.  Earlier, we were working with the National Federation of Independent Business, which is one of the largest trade associations in the country representing small- and medium-sized passthrough businesses. We were able to come up with a solution which addressed their concerns and which benefits those passthrough businesses. We still have some more work to do, but that demonstrates what we can do when working together to try to answer the concerns people have raised along the way during this legislative process.  The U.Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, which I mentioned a moment ago, and nearly all major small business advocacy groups support this legislation. We had a press conference[[Page S7348]]here in the Senate, just off the floor, earlier this morning, and it was uniform--everybody said this is good for small businesses. And small businesses are what create the vast majority of jobs in  I know that those who have continued questions or issues about the legislation have had productive discussions with all of us and today with the President, who came to visit us. I am confident that if we keep working at it in good faith, we can come up with a way to address the remaining issues so that we are all satisfied as much as possible.  There is an expression: Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. If you are waiting around for perfection, particularly here in the legislative process, you are never going to get anything done. That is not an excuse for not making it as good as it can possibly be, I believe, working together, preferably on a bipartisan basis. But if our Democratic colleagues refuse to participate, as they have done so far, then we have no choice but to do it ourselves.  So in the end, a vote against tax reform is a vote for economic stagnation. It is allowing the perfect to be the enemy of the good. The Wall Street Journal, as they said yesterday--the question we need to ask ourselves is not whether the tax bill is perfect but whether it is a net benefit to the United I think it clearly is, and I think that, with the policies embodied in this bill, we can restore America's economic vigor.  America must continue to prosper if it is to remain the economic beacon of the world, and we need to remain a strong country economically so we can defend ourselves and our friends and allies abroad. The rest of the world--it is true--is just waiting for a sign that America's best days are ahead, and passing this important tax legislation is an indication that it is the case that America's best days still lie ahead.  It is time to awaken the slumbering giant of the American economy. By lightening the load on workers and companies alike, we can make sure new opportunities abound for those just coming into the workforce. We will make everyday drivers of the economy excited once again about our country's future. The President noted today, when he was with us at lunch, that consumer confidence is literally at an alltime high. People have seen the stock market go up and their retirement funds that are invested in pension funds or in their IRA or elsewhere skyrocket since the Trump administration came into office. I think that is because people are sensing we are on the verge of a great economic recovery.  Accepting a stagnant, anemic recovery is not something we have to do. We know what we need to do to rev up the engine of the American economy and get it moving again to benefit all of us. Through tax reform, let's show that the American dream of allowing men and women to work hard and earn success isn't just a bygone notion, and it is not just a figment of our imagination. We can do it if we pass this tax reform bill this week, which we intend to do.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Johnson).

907,topic-id,1099,"Mr.President, I want to associate myself with much of what my Republican colleagues have said about the immigration bill we are working on--or perhaps I should say, to be more accurate, the immigration bill we should be working on, because the Democrats at this point simply will not take yes for an answer. We are offering a package that they should support, and in return, they are threatening to shut down the government.  So let me just dispense off the top with their argument, such as it is, about the so-called DACA recipients.  No one is eager to deport 690,000 illegal immigrants who are here mostly through no fault of their own. They were left in legal limbo by President Obama, and everyone wants to find a good, durable, long-term solution.  But if we are going to give legal status to these illegal immigrants in their twenties and their thirties, we have to recognize that there are going to be negative side effects.  First, we are going to encourage parents from around the world who live in poverty and oppression and war to illegally immigrate to our country with small children. What could be more dangerous and even immoral than that?  Second, we are going to create a whole new category of Americans who could get legal status for their extended family, to include the very parents who brought them here in violation of our laws. We often hear that children ought not pay for the crimes of their parents. That may be so, but surely parents can pay for the crimes of the parents. They are the ones who created the situation in the first place.  I offered legislation with Senator Perdue earlier this year called the RAISE It had many features in it to replace unskilled and low-skilled immigration with high-skilled immigration, to limit chain migration, to reform our refugee program, and to eliminate our diversity lottery. This Congress needs to take up our legislation and pass it. But today I want to focus on chain migration in particular because chain migration is one of the biggest categories of immigration that bring unskilled and low-skilled workers to this country to compete for jobs and drive down the wages of working  Did you know that once you have legal status in this country, once you have a green card and become a citizen, you can bring to this country not only your spouse and your unmarried minor children but your adult children and their spouses and their children and your adult brother and your adult sister and your parents and their siblings--and it goes on and on and on. That is why it is called chain migration.  Our legislation would put a halt to chain migration. It is a kind of downpayment on long-lasting legal immigration reform, in addition to things like strengthening E-Verify, improving security at our border, and Kate's Law, named in honor of Kate Steinle, as we heard Chairman Grassley outline earlier today.  We are also pairing those provisions with a bill that Democrats and Republicans should support, the BRIDGE The idea of this bill is simple enough--that everyone who has a DACA card gets 3-year provisional status. That gives them certainty without giving them permanent residency or citizenship, which I think sounds pretty reasonable. I know the Democrats agree with me, too, because earlier this year they were calling for passage of the BRIDGE The BRIDGE Act is supported by Members of both parties, as Chairman Grassley outlined, including many prominent Democratic Senators--both Senators from California, the senior Senator from Florida, the junior Senator from New York, even the minor leader and the minority whip. In fact, the minority whip called the BRIDGE Act a bipartisan breakthrough.  If the Democrats were to oppose our legislation today, the SECURE Act, the question would be, Why? Well, I think I know what they might say. They might say: Oh, those terrible Republicans have added a bunch of terrible Republican ideas to this bill. Let me just ask, which of these provisions are so terrible? That we secure our border? Countries have borders, and those borders have to be secure. Is it terrible that we stop unscrupulous employers from hiring illegal immigrants by strengthening E-Verify? When people say that E-Verify doesn't work, what they mean is--E-Verify works. What they mean is that they want employers[[Page S7839]]to be able to hire illegal immigrants, to take jobs away from Americans and pay them submarket wages.  What about discouraging illegal and highly dangerous border crossings?  To get back to chain migration, do we really want a system in which green cards are given out by random chance? Because that is what we have not just in the diversity lottery but through chain migration. Today, you can get a green card in this country simply because someone in your extended family happened to immigrate to this country 20 or 30 or 40 years ago, irrespective of your ability to stand on your own two feet in our economy, to get a job and pay taxes and not take welfare, to assimilate into our culture.  Shouldn't we have an immigration system that focuses on the needs of America's workers and the American economy, not one that gives out green cards by random chance the way we have today? Shouldn't we be focused on the jobs and the wages of American citizens? After all, they are who elected us to come here to represent their interests.  I don't think this is unreasonable, and, frankly, I don't think the Democrats do either. They have supported the BRIDGE They have supported reform of other immigration programs--temporary visas--because they worry about the impact of immigration on lower wage, blue-collar workers.  Now, the Republicans have stepped up and done exactly what the Democrats have said they wanted: We have offered a real, long-term solution for persons who have received a DACA work permit. All we are asking for in exchange are commonsense reforms to prevent another situation, like the one happening now, in the future. So it is time for Democrats and Republicans to come together and support this bill.  If you are serious about helping these DACA permit recipients, you should vote for this bill now. It is good for those DACA recipients, it is good for American workers, it is good for our communities, and it will be a good first step toward lasting pro-American, pro-worker immigration reform.

2166,topic-id,701,"Mr.Speaker, I am here today to talk about a positive, encouraging decision that occurred last week for the State of Connecticut that was issued by the Under Secretary of the Treasury, David It concerned a terrible problem that has swept through the State best known as crumbling foundations.  Due to some outstanding journalism that took place over the last couple of years by a TV reporter by the name of George Colli, Jr.; Hartford Courant editorial writer Carolyn Lumsden, who did a series on this problem; and Journal Inquirer's Eric Bedner, who has been consistently reporting on this issue, it came forward and was flushed out to the public that a quarry in north central Connecticut was supplying aggregate concrete for homes over the last 30 years that contained a material known as pyrrhotite.  Pyrrhotite is a metal substance which, when it is exposed to moisture over a period of time, oxidizes or rusts and creates a sickening spider web cracking that ultimately compromises the foundation on homes. Estimates run as high as 19,000 homeowners who unknowingly have this form of concrete that threatens probably their family's biggest asset, namely, their home.  As you can see in this picture, this is an example of a home in Coventry, Connecticut, where the home was lifted with a house jack and the contractor, Don Childree, was actually able to remove the concrete by hand. That is how compromised and unstable the home was because of this terrible problem.  This picture shows an example of a condominium project that was completely jacked up for the repairs, which involved jacking up the house, removing the old foundation, pouring a new foundation, and then lowering and reconnecting the condominium to the new foundation.  For a homeowner of a rather average-size house, we are talking about repairs that total as much as $150,000 to $200,000. In some cases, it almost surpasses the family's value in their home.  It has set off a wave of litigation and claims against property casualty insurers, with mixed results. The property casualty policies, in many cases, require only coverage for a sudden collapse as opposed to something that happens over a period of time.  It is devastating for the homeowners who are affected by this. It affects about 40 communities in north central and eastern  On Wednesday, the Treasury Department issued a ruling extending the property casualty loss Tax Code provisions to allow these homeowners to take a deduction for their loss. This was a 19-month process which took place, from my office, with an outstanding staffer, Beata Fogarasi; from Congressman John Larson's office in the Hartford area with an outstanding staffer by the name of Sylvia Lee; and with Under Secretary Kautter, who issued the ruling that will provide safe harbor for people who have suffered a loss to be able to claim that on their tax returns.  We had the support of the departing IRS Commissioner, John Koskinen, as well as the National Taxpayer Advocate, who endorsed this request last year under the prior administration--two administrations working with Members of Congress, presenting the facts and the law and getting a decision which, actually, is a positive move forward for homeowners who are in this affected region.  It showed the interplay of the free press, of the organizing that took place, and the Connecticut Coalition Against Crumbling Foundations, led by Tim Heim from Willington, Organized homeowners did rallies, did town halls, brought their case forward, and it resulted in real change. The needle moved to allow people much-needed relief.  We have more work to do. As Winston Churchill said: ``This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. It is the end of the beginning.''  The decision the day before Thanksgiving by the Treasury Department[[Page H9438]]gave great hope to these homeowners that, actually, the system can work, and that is probably the most powerful emotion that people took away from the decision that took place on  We are going to continue to move forward to help people, middle class, hardworking people who pay their bills, have invested in their life's biggest asset, their home, to make sure that they are protected and they get help.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-28-pt1-PgH9437-4.txt,1836,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017,28,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

39,topic-id,1676,"Mr.Chair, I rise in opposition to H.4182, the EQUALS  My Republican colleagues have offered a legislative solution to a problem that does not exist.  The Oversight Committee has not held a single hearing to examine the existing one-year probationary period.  Yet, this legislation would double the probationary period. In the process, it would degrade the due process rights of these employees.  These due process protections are critical to protecting whistleblowers who report waste, fraud, and abuse.  For example, the Oversight Committee has examined retaliation against whistleblowers at the Transportation Security  In one case, a career official and disabled veteran testified before the Oversight Committee that he was removed from consideration for a Senior Executive Service position during his probationary period because he reported misconduct by top leaders at TSA including sexual harassment.  During his interview with Committee staff, this senior career official explained that extending the probationary period would make it easier for agencies to retaliate against other whistleblowers in the future.  The House of Representatives should not approve legislation that would allow more retaliation against whistleblowers at federal agencies.  Apart from the negative effects, we have seen no reason to adopt this bill. We have seen no problem that needs to be addressed.  As I said, the Oversight Committee never held a hearing on this bill.  We have not determined whether doubling the probationary period would help agencies deal with poor performers or further their missions.  We have not seen any evidence that federal agencies need a blanket one-year extension of the probationary period for every single federal job.  Instead, a recent GAO report recommended that the Office of Personnel Management actually study whether expanding the probationary period makes sense. GAO found that OPM should, and I quote:       Determine whether there are occupations in which . . . the      probationary period should extend beyond 1-year to provide      supervisors with sufficient time to assess an individual's      performance.  I agree with GAO that a study needs to be conducted first.  But our Republican colleagues want to skip this step. They want to skip any real examination of the issue and just add another year of probation during which employees have limited rights.  Some of my colleagues cite the fact that Congress passed a two-year probationary period for Department of Defense civilian employees in the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2016.  However, I would like to note two important facts.  First, the Defense Department did not request this change in the probationary period or indicate any need for it.  Second, the Department is not even using this new authority.  The Acting Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Peter Levine, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in He stated, and I quote, ``the Department has done little to take advantage of that legislation.''  Mr.Levin warned that changing the law to address a small number of problem employees could hurt recruitment and retention and worker productivity. He stated, and I quote:       ``If legislation that is intended to address a problem with      one percent of the workforce is perceived as threatening and      hostile by the other 99 percent, it may undermine morale and      reduce the Department's ability to attract and retain the      capable employees that it needs.''  Before damaging protections for whistleblowers, we should first determine whether an extension of the probationary period is needed at all.  We should also determine whether it is appropriate for all federal service occupations or only certain occupations.  The Acting CHAIR (Mr.Byrne). All time for general debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule, and shall be considered as read.  The text of the bill is as follows:                               H.4182       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

672,topic-id,356,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I rise to support H.3731, the Secret Service Recruitment and Retention Act of 2017, which Congressman Katko and I cosponsored.  The bill would authorize an increase in the annual salary and the overtime limit for the men and women of the Secret Service so they can be paid for the significant overtime they have already worked in 2017 and will be working in 2018.  Last year, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform unanimously passed the Overtime Pay for Protective Services Act of 2016. The bill authorized overtime pay for more than 1,400 Secret Service agents and the thousands of hours they worked in the 2016 Presidential campaign year.  Although non-campaign years are usually significantly less demanding, the size of President Trump's family, their frequent travel, and the need to secure their multiple residences have caused more than 1,000 Secret Service agents to reach the annual pay cap in 2017. These demands on the Secret Service will remain extremely high and require substantial resources.  In December 2015, the Oversight Committee unanimously adopted a report concluding that the Secret Service``. . . is experiencing a staffing crisis that threatens to jeopardize its critical mission.''  Our report found that this was due in large part to ``. . . significant cuts imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011.''  The report recommended that Congress ensure that the Secret Service has sufficient funds to restore staffing to the required levels.  Providing this much-needed overtime pay relief is an essential step towards fulfilling the committee's recommendation. The hardworking men and women of the Secret Service put their lives on the line every day and make tremendous personal sacrifices for our country.  We cannot expect the Secret Service to recruit and retain the best of the best and be the elite of the elite if they are not even being compensated for the hours that are demanded of them.  Congress has a responsibility to provide the resources they need. I am proud to join my colleagues in this bipartisan effort to do just that, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

1614,topic-id,334,"Mr.Speaker, most of us know how important water is in our States and the impact it plays in growth. It is directly tied to economic development and the health and beauty of the places we live.  Today, in accordance with commitments I have made to build improved quality of life in the rural areas of my district, I am introducing bipartisan legislation that will reauthorize the Bureau of Reclamation to provide cost sharing for the endangered fish recovery implementation programs in the Upper Colorado and San Juan River basins.  This bill is important because the successful recovery of these endangered species paves the way for critical projects in these waterways, projects that will facilitate water for agriculture, economic development, and other important uses not just in the rural areas of Utah's Third Congressional District, but in Colorado, Wyoming, Arizona, and New Mexico as well.  This bill reauthorizes a program that has become a national model for addressing the demands for water development to support growing Western communities. It has been run with accountability and solid results since 2012. Constituents will be pleased that the revenue for this project comes not from tax dollars but, rather, from fees collected by the projects from water users within the area.  The bill also strikes an important balance between conservation, recreation, and ensuring that we have access to public lands and natural resources.  The programs support millions of people who depend on the river's water to grow food, generate electricity, and serve the needs of cities and towns.  To quote Utah's Governor, Gary Herbert: ``The success of the . . . program is vital for . . . our State's continued progress and providing for the needs of the citizens of Utah.''  I would like to express my appreciation to Congressman Rob Bishop and the members of the Natural Resources Committee, who have done the heavy lifting on this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I hope my colleagues in the House and the Senate will support this very important bill.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-28-pt1-PgH9438.txt,1E+14,STAND FOR PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT AMERICA'S CHILDREN,2017,28,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
269,topic-id,1383,"Thank you, Mr.I am thankful for my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Toomey, for his remarks and for his leadership in getting us to this point tonight for this most historic moment in the U. I spent 28 years in the private sector before I came back to Washington, In fact, the last election I won before I won election to serve in Congress was student body president in my high school.  I spent many years working in businesses, growing businesses, creating jobs, sending a lot of money to Washington, DC, in taxes. You are not going to find a single Republican here who says taxes are bad. What we are saying here is that we are an overtaxed  In fact, if I were to ask you where are the most affluent counties in the United States, where are they, you might guess, well, Beverly Hills, perhaps Silicon Valley, New York The answer is, the most affluent counties in America are suburbs of Washington,  The American people have watched this city increase in power, increase in wealth, and I think this city has forgotten something; that the dollars that are sent here by hard-working Americans do not belong to the government, they belong to the American people. It is their money.  I will tell you what. I don't think we realize how much taxes we pay. We are focused right now on Federal income taxes, Federal corporate taxes. However, imagine you wake up in the morning--if you are like me, my cell phone is now my alarm clock--and you grab your cell phone. You reach for it. The first thing you do is maybe look at what inbound emails you have, maybe you look at the Twitter feed, but you realize, as you are grabbing the cell phone, on average, a U.wireless consumer pays about 17 percent--of that bill you pay for your cell phone, there are Federal, State, and local taxes for that cell phone. That is how the day starts.  So then I go, and I get dressed. I think about how much sales tax was paid, which most States have, for the clothes that you are wearing. Well, then you might leave your home, walk across your driveway to get in an automobile, perhaps, and you realize you are paying significant property tax on that property you own--if you are a homeowner--and you get in your automobile. Oh, by the way, you have paid a significant tax on that car too. You have paid a sales tax, most likely. You may be paying hundreds of dollars a year to put license plates on it. Then you want to drive on to work, and you might want to stop at that coffee shop. You might want to get that nice cup of coffee there to get you going for the day. What do you do? Well, you pay a sales tax, most likely, as you get your cup of coffee.  Perhaps on the way to work, you need to fill up your gas tank. Now, in Montana, we drive pickups. I could tell you, when you fill up your pickup, it costs you a chunk of change.  You are paying 18.4 cents per gallon just in federal taxes, and then you pay your State taxes on top of that. That ranges from 12 cents a gallon in Alaska to 58 cents a gallon in Pennsylvania, and then you go to work.  I was just speaking with one of my young staffers here tonight. She told me, when she got that first paycheck--I guess her first job out of college--she called her dad, and she said: They have made a mistake. They have screwed up my paycheck. And she talked him through the difference between the gross pay and what you really put in the bank, the dollars of your Federal, State, local taxes, Social Security,  Your day is finished. Perhaps you want to go home and grab something to drink, whether it is a glass of wine, perhaps a beer, perhaps a soda. Well, the government is there too. You have paid an excise tax somewhere on those beverages. All I am saying here is it is time to give some of that back. It is time to give some of that back to the single mom in Kalispell, to give it back to that small business owner in Helena, to give it back to the families, the businesses, working-class You know what, they need a pay raise.  So how do we start that? How about right here with this bill tonight. Let's lower tax rates on middle income Let's allow them to keep more of their hard-earned dollars. How about we increase the standard deduction? Let's take it from $12,000 to $24,000. How about we eliminate the poverty tax? That is eliminating ObamaCare's poverty tax. As Justice Roberts said, it is a tax. It has cost the American people so far over $5 billion, 42 percent of those making less than $25,000 a year, 82 percent make less than $50,000 a year. That is a poverty tax. We are going to repeal that as part of this bill that we are going to pass tonight.  Families need a break. How about we double the child tax credit? We are parents of four. How about that single mom with two children? I think she needs a break. Let's give working moms, working dads with a couple of kids an extra couple thousand dollars to help make ends meet and reduce the tax burden on small businesses--not corporations. We will talk about that in a minute. That is important to do, but these small businesses that are not corporations are paying as much as 40 percent of their income in Federal income taxes. We are going to take that down to less than 30 percent.  What does that do? It creates jobs. It puts pressure on wages, higher wages, because we need to direct these tax cuts to those who provide jobs.  By the way, those smaller businesses, 55 percent of the private sector jobs in this country are from smaller businesses. Two-thirds of the new jobs created since the recession of 2007, 2008 are from these smaller businesses. We are targeting significant tax relief for those small businesses. Who are these? These are farmers. These are ranchers. These are locally owned Montana businesses. It could be our community bankers. It could be a baking company. It could be a construction company. I grew up in a construction company. My mom and dad were the CEO and the COO of the family business. In Montana, that is 68 percent of the jobs in my They are getting significant tax relief. Working with my colleagues, we have had some great conversations, and we have provided some additional tax relief for those smaller businesses.  We have a historic, once-in-a-generation opportunity today. This only comes every 20 or 30 years. It goes back to 1986, 31 years ago--the same year my wife and I were married. We need to put more money back into the hands of American workers. Let's cut their taxes. Let's open the doors for the creation of more high-paying jobs. We start that by transferring the wealth of this city back to the families and businesses that sent us here in the first place and that keep our country moving forward.  We have been hearing a lot of things about this bill. The Washington Post even claimed four Pinocchios on some of these claims that somehow this plan will raise taxes for most working-class families. Look at the facts. That is not true.  Let me conclude by saying this, quoting a President:       It is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today      and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise      revenues in the long term is to cut the rates now. The      experience of a number of European countries and Japan have      borne this out. The purpose of cutting taxes now is not to      incur a budget deficit, but to achieve a more prosperous,      expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus.  That was John Kennedy in December of 1962.  Let's not miss this opportunity that we have now.  The PRESIDING The Senator's time has expired.

888,topic-id,251,"Mr.President, this week, I have the distinct honor of recognizing Ted Koenig of Kalispell for lending a hand with the humanitarian relief efforts in the U.Virgin A few months ago, after the devastation of hurricanes Irma and Maria, Ted left his home in northwestern Montana and traveled to the Caribbean to take part in the recovery.  When Ted arrived on the island of Thomas in late September, he arrived to immense destruction. His initial mission on the island was to serve as a planner, helping to assess needs and coordinate resources for the recovery, a job Ted is familiar with as he serves in a similar position as the northwestern Montana disaster program manager for the Red However, Ted spent the first few days hand-delivering essential supplies to areas outside the reach of emergency distribution centers. After helping deliver the basic necessities, Ted spent the final 2 weeks consolidating damage assessments to inform decisionmakers about the requirements for longer term recovery.  Helping others in need is common in Big Sky Country, and Ted's journey to Thomas is another example of this ethic in action. This ethic runs deep from Kalispell to Broadus, from the Flathead River to the Powder River, and is revealed in Montana having one of the highest per capita Peace Corps volunteer rates in the It comes as no surprise that Ted served 3 years in the Peace Corps and was stationed in Thank you, Ted, for using your steady determination to help others overcome difficult circumstances.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-30-pt1-PgS7558.txt,2138,LAW ENFORCEMENT MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS ACT OF 2017,2017,30,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

438,topic-id,533,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York, my friend, the ranking member, for yielding.  I rise in support of H.1164, the Taylor Force  Mr.Speaker, the pursuit of a negotiated two-state solution to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires a commitment to peace, but it is impossible for the Palestinian Authority to demonstrate that commitment to peace while paying terrorists for attacks on innocent civilians. But that is the reality today, and that is what this bill seeks to end.  Under current Palestinian law, the PA pays salaries to terrorists and their families more money for worse crimes, typically well exceeding the mean salary for Palestinian workers. If a terrorist is sentenced to life in prison for a horrific attack that kills Israeli citizens, he will get a four-times higher monthly salary than if he had been sentenced to only a couple of years in prison for a lesser attack. This is blatant incentive to terrorism; the same type of terrorism that we have seen tear through buses, shopping malls, nightclubs, and places of worship around the world.  In March of last year, during a surge of deadly stabbings, shootings, and car rammings in Israel, we saw the consequences of this incitement and incentive to terror.  Taylor Force, a 28-year-old American tourist, a West Point graduate and then-Vanderbilt graduate student, who[[Page H9651]]had fought in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, was stabbed to death on a promenade in Jaffa by a young Palestinian terrorist.  Taylor, by all accounts, was loved and humble. He enjoyed playing the guitar. He was an Eagle Scout and an Army veteran. His father described him as an all-American kid who made sure that everyone around him felt good. A friend of his in Nashville said simply: He made people better.  But rather than unambiguously condemn this attack against innocent civilians, as any responsible government would do, the PA instead has rewarded these types of attacks by paying more than $1 billion to convicted terrorists over the past decade.  It is the job of the Palestinian Authority, like any responsible government, to deliver services to its people, including welfare to those who need it most, like a grieving widow who suddenly has to take care of her family without the breadwinner. But this is not welfare.  The current law essentially tells Palestinians: If you tragically die in a car accident, your family gets nothing; but if you die driving your car into a group of Israeli civilians, your family will be taken care of for life.  That is not welfare. That is incentive to terror. It is pay for slay, and it must end.  I am proud of the bipartisan manner in which today's bill was crafted, and it is carefully written in a way that targets only those funds that directly benefit the Palestinian Authority, thereby creating real incentives for the PA to end this practice without damaging the vital U.investments in humanitarian assistance and grassroots people-to-people programs that are essential to achieving our overall objective of peace.  Taylor Force served our country to advance and protect peace. His life was taken by terrorists seeking to undermine peace.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

The bill before us today is a good bipartisan, compromise bill that will reauthorize $250 million in funding for the brownfields program under the Environmental Protection Agency for each fiscal year through 2021.  The EPA's brownfields program has a long history of empowering States, local communities, and other stakeholders to work together to prevent contaminated sites from endangering public health and the environment.  Brownfields grants continue to serve as the foundation of the EPA's brownfields program. These grants support revitalization efforts by funding environmental assessments, cleanup, and job training activities nationwide.  Additionally, this bill makes a number of overall improvements to the law that will strengthen brownfields remediation into the future.  In 2013, the Downriver Community Conference in my district received a brownfields funding grant to clear out asbestos and other hazardous materials from a hangar at the Willow Run Once the original home of Rosie the Riveters during World War II, today the site of the Arsenal of Democracy is now the home of the American Center for Mobility, a national DOT proving ground for the testing and validation of connected and automated vehicles, autonomous vehicles.

While public attention is diverted to the scandal in Alabama, Republicans are rushing through this sham of a bill, developed in the dark with lobbyists, before most Americans realize what is about to hit them in the face.  Instead of more jobs at home, Republicans create a giant, new gaping loophole to ship ever more jobs abroad. Even Speaker Ryan's home State Republican Senator Ron Johnson concedes that, under this bill, ``there will be a real incentive to keep manufacturing overseas.''  It is hardly a surprise since President Trump's Wall Streeter designated to run the show has just been identified personally from leaked Bermudan documents as the past executive of not one, but 22 different island tax-paradise shell companies.  Meanwhile, another loophole, carried interest, that flows to plutocrats like Donald That is the very injustice he promised to stop last year. It will keep flowing right into their pocket.  As for the deduction for student interest for those who are overwhelmed with college loans, like other middle-class tax provisions, that is part of the $65 billion that is cut out of tax incentives by Republicans in this bill.  They are totally dependent upon alternative facts.  Today's bill even authorizes those who want to pay absolutely zero in tax to do that by abolishing the alternative minimum tax (AMT). That one change that they make, in one year, would have put $31 million in Donald Trump's pocket.  So you can certainly understand why he is coming to the Capitol today, just to say thank you: Thank you for the billion dollars-plus that is estimated to go to the Trump family under this bill. ``When does my tax refund get here?'' he must be saying.  Of course, we don't know precisely how much Donald Trump is enriched because these Republicans keep colluding to hide his tax returns.  Republicans want to apply a ``dynamic score'' to this bill. I say: create a dynamic workforce, invest in people, and don't overwhelm us with endless debt. Develop a more competitive, healthy workforce that empowers our DREAMers and other immigrants and that gives every American access to education and skill upgrades to achieve their full, God-given potential.

If they want to take that oath, and maybe some will, then I refer them, ladies and gentlemen of the American jury, to exhibit A, page 257 out of the 479.  Why do I pick this page? Because they didn't have time to type it. They wrote it out in longhand. We are not even teaching cursive in a lot of schools anymore, but someone on the staff knew it enough to try. The problem is, they wrote it in cursive along the margin here. It is about subchapter[[Page S7688]]S corporations and how much tax they paid and what they don't pay. I defy anybody to read it because the problem was, when they copied it, they chopped off lines so there aren't full sentences here. They are like little phrases and words.  This is your Senate at work. This is what happens when you push through a bill late at night, desperate to pass it, without really stopping to ask yourself: Will this make us a stronger nation? Will this help legitimate businesses that want to expand and create jobs? Is this good for American families?  The Joint Committee on Taxation told us yesterday--that is our scorekeeper; they are the ones who we hired to be our scorekeeper; they are nonpartisan--what they learned about this bill before we got the new version, with the new amendments. Our friends on K Street were happy to tell us what the listings were. They told us that this starting bill will add $1 trillion to the national debt--so our kids and grandkids can pay it off--to pay for the tax cuts. They also told us that the predicted economic growth that is supposed to come out of these pages of 4, 5 percent a year is 0.8 percent. Is it not? Am I right?

279,topic-id,437,"They also told us that the biggest beneficiaries under this Tax Code--this Joint Committee on Taxation--happen to be the wealthiest people in America--surprise--and the biggest corporations. They told us that, at least in the second 10 years--maybe before--regular middle-income families are going to pay higher taxes because of this. They let us know, and we knew already, what is going to happen to programs like Social Security, Medicare, and You see, when you run up the national debt and you want to try to balance the books--our Republican friends have been very open about this. They want to cut the benefits under Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to try to balance the books.  America, are you ready for this? Are you ready for senior citizens who are counting on that Social Security check to get a cut in benefits to pay for a tax cut, a tax giveaway to the wealthiest people in America? Are you ready to see Medicare cut--that is, reimbursement for seniors for medical expenses--in order to make sure that the biggest corporations in America get a tax break? Are you ready to see Medicaid, which has as its major expense taking care of seniors in nursing homes--benefits cut in order to give an incentive for businesses to move jobs overseas? That is what this is all about.  Here is the reality. As a percentage of gross domestic product, American corporations have never been more profitable--never. As a percentage of gross domestic product, American corporations have never paid less in Federal taxes.  What is the Republican response to that? Cut corporate taxes. Why? Shouldn't we be focused on doing what is necessary so that middle-income families have a fighting chance to pay their bills and put some money away for their kids and their future? Shouldn't we be working on helping small and medium-sized corporations instead of the big boys?  That is what I think we should focus on. I don't know for sure that this bill doesn't do that. In fact, nobody does. Nobody knows what is in here--479 pages. If they tell you they do, then ask them to explain page 257. Ask them to try to read this. I have tried. This is going to change the tax law of America in ways that we can't even explain.

541,topic-id,1818,"Mr.President, resuming my earlier remarks, the Native-American Tribes almost unanimously opposed the action that was announced yesterday by President Trump and Secretary Zinke to shrink the Bears Ears They have passed resolutions in support of that monument.  Navajo Nation's president said that the President's efforts to shrink the monument ``demonstrates their failure to listen to the concerns of our people who have lobbied and fought for over 80 years for this designation.'' Even worse, the Navajo Nation made several requests to meet with President Trump on the issue, to no avail. Those requests fell on deaf ears, and the administration never met with the leadership of the Navajo Nation or any of the other Tribes who worked to protect this area.  The administration took these actions under the guise of protecting this area for future generations. During President Trump's speech in Utah, he said:       I don't think it is controversial, actually. I think it's      so sensible.  From the folks he was speaking to, it must have seemed that his comment was correct, but the group the President was speaking to was a closed-door group of selected supporters of his administration who do not reflect the feelings of local residents when it comes to the future of this monument. It reflected the same closed-door process this administration had used to shrink these monuments.  The administration ignored that more than 2.8 million Americans weighed in when there was an open public comment period at the Department of the Ninety-eight percent of them asked the President to protect the monuments and to maintain their borders--98 percent. So to say that shrinking these monuments dramatically is not controversial is to ignore 2.8 million Americans and the Tribes with whom the President never took the time to meet.  With these reductions, it is clear that Secretary Zinke and President Trump are choosing politics over science and choosing economic and political local concerns over the reality of what this particular monument means to the future of They are ignoring Utah's State Historic Preservation Office and the Interior Department's own staff, both confirming that there are artifacts throughout Bears Ears that will now lose their protection because of the decision by President Trump yesterday. The administration's proposed cuts closely follow the desires of Utah politicians to shrink the monument.  I had the opportunity to meet with Secretary Zinke and some of my colleagues a few weeks ago to discuss this reduction in the size of the monuments. In that meeting, he assured me that any potential cuts to Bears Ears would continue to protect the actual site's antiquities, including archeological sites, but according to the internal documents from the Department of the Interior, there are more than 8,400 archeological sites in the monument, 70 percent of which are prehistoric. Even more interesting, according to the Department of the Interior staff, less than 10 percent of the monument has truly been surveyed. That means we have only scratched the surface of the antiquities that could be present there.  What value is it to the people of Utah, what value is it to San Juan County, UT, what value is it to the United States to allow spectators and tourists to roam over these areas without acknowledging their sacred status and historic importance? We only get one chance to preserve our history, and now the President is walking away from that chance for the largest part of the Bears Ears Taking away protections from these precious places is something that could lead to permanent damage.  During the time that I visited Bears Ears, I stopped near Fry Canyon for a little lunch. I hiked around and saw some amazing artifacts, which I showed in the earlier photograph. These amazing artifacts are outside the new boundaries President Trump decided to draw yesterday. These impressive artifacts are worth preserving, but[[Page S7828]]President Trump and Secretary Zinke don't agree. They have left Fry Canyon unprotected.  I went to some of the areas where, centuries ago, Native Americans drew artwork on the sides of these canyons, in the walls. It is still very visible, and it should be protected. Some of it has been desecrated and obliterated by graffiti. How can we possibly justify that? How can we say to future generations: We just didn't care enough to keep this intact so that you and your children and grandchildren could appreciate it.  I know there are many more areas like Fry Canyon throughout the original Bears Ears Monument that are no longer protected because President Trump and Secretary Zinke decided to draw new boundary lines.  While I was visiting in Moab, UT, in one of the tourist shops there, I heard a group of about 12 speaking on the other side of the shop, and I drew a little closer just to hear what they might be saying. They were speaking in They had traveled all the way from Europe to see this unique area, so critically important to them, so unimportant to this administration. These tourists' willingness to travel halfway around the world tells us that we have something special here. I really wish the President could have met with them and so many others who create a bustling tourist economy in this area, people who come halfway around the world to see it. They believe it is something worth seeing. We should believe it is something worth preserving.  The residents of Moab, just outside the monument, must recognize this. Once a mining town with a dubious future, Moab saw its economy decline as the industry left during the 1980s. But the town has experienced a new rebirth, an economic growth of tourism that now provides up to 40 percent of the jobs in the area.  Last year, National Geographic named Moab, UT, one of the best outdoor towns in the world. Ely, MN, is the other U.town to receive that honor. The people of Moab will tell you that the protection of public lands has been good for their economy, creating good-paying jobs, new hotels, and new opportunities, and that they support the Bears Ears But President Trump didn't pay attention to them, and neither did Secretary  According to the Department of the Interior, the number of visitors to Utah increased 20 percent between 2011 and 2015 and is projected to continue increasing. But that didn't impress the Secretary of the Interior when it came to literally obliterating 80 percent of the original Bears Ears Monument that President Obama designated.  It was the University of Utah that found that tourists spent more than $8 billion in their State in 2015, resulting in more than $1 billion in State and local tax revenue and more than 142,000 jobs.  When the State is benefiting so much from tourism, why would they give away the protection of an area that attracts so many people and creates so many businesses and jobs in their own State? With public lands providing such a boon for tourism and economic growth, it is hard to believe that the Utah congressional delegation has ignored this and pushed so hard to destroy these monuments.  The dispute has roots in debate over federally controlled land and Utah's Enabling Act, which was signed more than 100 years ago. When it became a State, Utahns passed a bill to ``agree and declare that they forever disclaimed all right and title to the unappropriated public lands . . . and to all lands lying within said limits owned or held by any Indian or Indian tribes.'' This provision gave all lands not specifically claimed by the State of Utah to the Federal Utah signed up for that. That is how they became a  As a result, Utah now has the second most Federal land of any State, with Federal lands making up about 65 percent of their State, including five national parks and eight national monuments. These lands are a source of pride and economic opportunity for so many people. Yet the politicians of Utah don't appreciate that.  Last year, 15 million people visited national parks and monuments in Utah, hiking, camping, and learning the traditions and history of the Native people in that Let me say that again. Fifteen million people from around the world visited public lands in Utah in 2016--an 82 percent increase in visitors over the past decade. This is not only the right thing to do; it is the economically sensible thing to do to protect these monuments and these areas. Despite this growth, there is a push by some of Utah's politicians to force the Federal Government to give up these lands and remove the protections for the cultural and archeological resources they contain.  When I met with Secretary Zinke to discuss his recommendations, he confirmed to me that this decision was not based on protecting some of the most extraordinary natural resources in our Nation but, rather, on protecting political alliances.  Every monument designation has had some opposition. Even Roosevelt faced opposition when he worked to protect many of America's iconic places, but despite the opposition, President Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican, protected the Grand Canyon--a controversial decision in his time--and other special places. Thank goodness he did. Thank goodness he had the vision to look forward to future generations instead of looking backward to political promises and political buddies.  Teddy Roosevelt is remembered for his conservation record, preserving many of the places that make America a great nation, but what this administration is doing is just the opposite of Teddy Roosevelt's courage and vision. Repealing protections for Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante will not make America great again. It will give up America's greatness for selfish interest.  I urge President Trump and Secretary Zinke to reconsider their decision that rescinds our national monument protection. It will be challenged in court, and it may take a long time to resolve, but I hope ultimately the courts of this land stand up for the right of a President of either political party to make these designations, as they have so many times before. We owe it to America, but we owe it especially to the Native American Tribes and people who have forever called this land home to preserve the sites that are so sacred to them, and we owe it to those in the scientific community and to future generations.  I am hopeful that future generations will be able to visit Bears Ears--as my wife and I have--and learn about the people and culture that made America long before we arrived. It is worth the respect of this generation and future generations, and it is certainly worth it for us to step forward and to say with vision and with courage that we stand behind preserving these sites.

687,topic-id,1135,"Mr.President, we are facing a deadline of March 5, 2018. It was a deadline created by President Trump on September 5. That was the day he announced, through the Attorney General, that he was ending the DACA  The DACA Program was created by President Obama to give young people who were brought to this country as infants and toddlers and young children and who grew up in America and are currently undocumented a chance to earn their way to legalization and citizenship. That was the original Dream When President Obama passed his Executive order, he protected them from deportation until Congress responded with a law. I asked for that designation and was thankful President Obama did it.  As a result of his Executive order, 780,000 young people came forward, paid a filing fee of over $500, went through an extensive criminal background check, and were cleared to be given temporary protection from deportation and temporary opportunities to work in America, renewable every 2 years.  President Trump came into office and ended it. He challenged Congress and said: Now pass a law to take care of this issue. It is a legitimate challenge for the President to issue. I wish he had done it differently, but it is certainly worthy of him to call on us to do our job.  Well, here we are 3 months after that challenge from President Trump and what has the Republican majority done in the Senate or the House to respond to that challenge? Absolutely nothing--nothing, not one thing--to provide these 780,000, as well as others who are eligible for this protection, an opportunity under law, not one thing.  Is it because we have been overwhelmed with business? Well, I defy those who have followed the business of the U.Senate over the course of the last year to say that. It is seldom that we have ever come to the floor and debated anything of substance. Most of the time we are an empty Chamber lurching from one cloture vote to another cloture vote, to a motion to proceed to this nomination and that nomination. The exceptions, of course, were on healthcare and the Trump tax reform bill, and those were done by reconciliation; in other words, strictly partisan efforts.  So we have not done much this year. We certainly haven't done much since September 5 of this year, and now what we hear from the other side of the aisle, from the senior Senator from Texas is, What is the hurry? We have plenty of time here. We will take care of these young people perhaps in January, perhaps in The deadline is March 5.  It is pretty easy for any Member of the U.Senate to say: What is the hurry, let's go slow, until they sit down and talk to the young people who are affected. I have done that many times, and I did it over this weekend.  I went to Benito Juarez High School in the city of A group of about 20 young people came forward, all of them protected by These young people started telling their stories of being brought to the United States at the age of 1 or 2, watching as some of their relatives have been deported, trying to grow up in America, uncertain of their future--really uncertain today as to what they are going to be doing--and many of them are extraordinarily talented young people. It is not uncommon for them to break down in tears as they tell their story.  One was a 24-year-old graduate of college who received no Federal assistance because she is one of the Dreamers and undocumented. She finished college. She is now teaching in the Chicago Public School If she loses DACA protection, she loses her job as a teacher. There are tens of thousands just like her across  The senior Senator from Texas asks: What is the hurry? Why do we need to address this issue?  I wish that Senator could have been there and watched her and spoken to[[Page S7826]]her, as I did, and realized she is living in fear, in terror; that her life as she knows it could end tomorrow--and it could--because of the decision by President Trump to end this protection.  All we have asked for--and many of us on a bipartisan basis--is to call up the Dream Act for a vote in the U.Senate, to give these young people a chance of the protection of law so they can continue in this country.  Some Republicans have said we need to sit down and talk about border security. I said I would be happy to do that. When I was part of the Gang of 8, we came up with comprehensive immigration reform, and we had an extensive border security plan. Some of the Republican Senators who offered it told me later: We went overboard and you accepted it. We did. We are serious about border security. That is not an issue, but for the senior Senator from Texas, that is not good enough.  I handed him a sheet of paper last week, and I have a copy of it right here, showing him the proposals we are making on border security. I pointed out to him that 12 of the proposals I handed to him were proposals from his own bill for border security. We are serious about this. This is a genuine effort to give border security provisions the enactment of law along with the Dream  So what we hear is that the senior Senator from Texas came to the floor and said: Well, they are just not negotiating in good faith. Well, I have handed him this provision, this proposal. It was a good-faith gesture and a good-faith effort to move us forward, and the only response we had yesterday from the senior Senator from Texas is: What is the hurry? Why should we get it done this year? Why don't we wait until next year?  Well, next year, as we know, means waiting 2 months when it comes to this issue, and that, to me, is the real fear I have--that we will put this off. The uncertainty, the worry, the stress for these young people will continue while we do nothing--nothing.  We don't enact laws here. We do nothing. We give speeches to an empty Chamber and say: Gosh, I wish we had a little more time here to really do some substantive work. We have all the time we need.  I would commend to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, for goodness' sake, when 76 percent of the American people agree with the Dream Act, when 61 percent of Trump voters agree with the Dream Act, there is no excuse. We need to make it the law of the land.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-05-pt1-PgS7825-5.txt,326,"APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON H.R. 1, TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT",2017,5,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

763,topic-id,2551,"Madam President, we had a press conference in Chicago this afternoon, and several young people were there. One is named Zarna Zarna is a student at the Loyola University Stritch School of She is from a family that came to the United States from They brought her here when she was 3 years old.  When she was growing up, she didn't realize that she was undocumented. She thought she was just like everybody else in her classroom, standing up, pledging allegiance to that flag, and singing the national anthem. It was the only national anthem she knew. But then came high school, and she came to realize that she was different. She wasn't documented. She wasn't ``legally in America.''  Well, she soldiered on with her life and did quite well. She graduated from college with a degree in science. She prayed and hoped the day would come when she could go to medical school. Loyola University in Chicago offered her--and others like her, who were protected by President Obama's Executive order known as DACA--an opportunity to apply for medical school. They didn't get quotas. It wasn't any kind of affirmative action program. It just said you can compete with all the other students. The word got out around America to those who were protected by President Obama's order that there was a medical school that would accept you if you were protected. The net result of that was over 30 were admitted. They are so extraordinary, some of the best. They were admitted to medical school, and she is one of them. It is a great story, really.  She is realizing her dream to become a doctor, but there is a problem. The problem is that on September 5, President Trump decided to abolish DACA, the program that protects Zarna Patel, and in abolishing it--announcing that he would on March 5 of next year--it meant that she would then lose the protection she had under the previous Executive order.  What difference does it make? Well, it means that she is then subject to deportation, but equally important in her life, she loses the right to legally work in You say that she is a student and maybe she doesn't need to work. Well, as a student, she doesn't qualify for any Federal assistance because she is undocumented, and as a student in a medical school, to further your education, you need a residency. We know a residency means an awful lot of hours of working in a hospital that is teaching you how to be a doctor and develop your specialty. So you can't have a residency if you can't legally work in That means that, after all of these years of work, it is over; she can't apply for a residency.  The senior Senator from Texas came to the floor and said: Let's not have a hurry-up approach to this issue. Let's slow it down a little bit. The President announced on September 5 that he was going to abolish protection for Zarna Patel and for 780,000 others just like her. Here we are, 3 months later, having done nothing.  Many of us feel a sense of urgency because these young people have their lives on hold. They are living with the anxiety and stress of not knowing whether they will be deported tomorrow or can work. It is a simple thing to many of us as we read about it. It is life and death in the future for these young people.  So when we say to the Senator from Texas that we need to get this done, it isn't like the Senate is overwhelmed with work. I didn't have to come down here and beg for an opportunity to speak on the floor. You can see it is empty, and it has been empty most of the year. We have done precious little this year. I can point to three or four things the Senate has accomplished. We had plenty of time to address this and still do, but it takes a will on the part of the majority to get this done.  I want to thank several Republican Senators who have stepped up to try to help me get this done, especially Lindsey Graham, a Republican of South Carolina and my cosponsor of the Dream Act, and other Senators who are sponsoring it and trying to move this forward. Senator Jeff Flake, last week, announced that his vote on the tax plan was contingent on a conversation he had with the White House about this issue of DACA and the Dream  The senior Senator from Texas comes to the floor and says I haven't really reached out to him or spoken to him about this. He must have forgotten that I handed him this sheet of paper last week. This was our proposal on border security in the hopes that, by being serious about border security, we could get Republican Senators to join us when it came to protecting those who qualified for DACA in the Dream I gave this to Senator He knows it. I like him. He is my friend. But we have to reach the point where we realize that there is a sense of urgency here. I hear the Senator from Texas say: Well, maybe next year we will get around to it. As of March 5, this program ends, and as of March 5, 1,000 young people will lose their protection every single day for 2 years.  What it means for Zarna Patel and others is the end of a dream, the end of an opportunity to pursue an education. She is not the only one. She is 1 of 30 or 32 at the Loyola Stritch School of There are 900 of these young people who currently have volunteered to serve in the U.military under the MAVNI If we don't renew this program, they are gone. Think of that. They are technically undocumented and illegal in this country. They volunteered to risk their lives for America in service to our country. Now the Senator from Texas says: Well, we are in no hurry to tell them whether they can continue to serve in our military.  As we look across America, we have 20,000 teachers. I met one of those last Friday in She is 24 years old, teaching in an inner-city school, and protected by The minute DACA ends on March 5 of next year, she can no longer legally work in the Chicago Public Schools system. She is finished. Pack up, clean out your desk, and go home.[[Page S7814]]  Is that what we want to see happen across America? We know what these young people are doing. They are going to school. They are working while going to school. They are teachers. They are nurses. They are involved as first responders and law enforcement. They are in medical school.  The Senator from Texas questions why I am in such a hurry to get this done? I am in a hurry to get this done, and he should join me in understanding that there is a sense of urgency here. There are a lot of rumors flying around here. I am not going to honor any of them as to what might occur, other than to say, when we get Senators who are willing to sit down and accept the principle of the Dream Act, that the principle is that those who were brought here as children, who have grown up in the United States, who have no serious criminal charges in their records, and who have completed school have a chance to become legal and become citizens--that is the fundamental of the Dream  It is a bill I introduced 16 years ago. I am still trying to pass it. There are bills that are not identical but are very similar that accept that premise and have been offered twice by Republicans as well.  So if the Senator from Texas will start with the Dream Act, we can then engage in additional conversations about border security. He can take the draft I gave him last week, which includes, incidentally, 12 provisions from his own bill. The Senator from Texas had a bill drafted on border security. We read it. We picked up 12 of the major provisions and included them in our offer to try to get this done in an expedited way.  I will just tell you this. If any Senators want to come to the floor and say it is not that important, it isn't timely, we need not hurry about this, we can get around to it later, I would like them to come home with me. Maybe they should even go home to their own States and meet with these young people and realize that their lives are on hold because we have put this issue on hold.  For goodness' sake, let us face our responsibilities as Let's do what we are supposed to do--legislate solutions to problems. The President challenged us. He said: I am going to abolish this program; now Congress, you pass a law to create it. He challenged us. Let us accept the challenge and do it in a bipartisan professional way. That is all I have ever asked for and all I continue to ask for.  Yes, I want it done this calendar year. I don't want excuses about maybe next January or maybe next February, because we know that on March 5, when the deadline hits, it will be a disaster for 1,000 of these young people every single day. Yes, there is a sense of urgency. Yes, there is a need for us to work together. I am going to continue to meet with Republican Senators and Democrats to find a solution, to find a way through this, and to get it done this month in How can we, in good conscience, pass a spending bill giving authority and resources to this administration to go out and arrest and deport these young people and not address the underlying issue of their legality and their future in the United States? That, to me, is obvious.  I hope my colleagues, those of good will and good faith, will join me in making sure that we don't go home for the holidays until we get this job done.                      Bears Ears National Monument  Madam President, very briefly, the President of the United States went to Utah to announce that he has done something that is going to be challenged in court--and should be--but is virtually unprecedented in the history of the United Presidents have the authority, going back to President Theodore Roosevelt, to establish monuments around this country--special land that is set aside because we believe it is important for future generations to have special access to it.  President Obama, before he left office, created the Bears Ears National It is in San Juan County in I know a little bit about it. Twenty years ago, I visited this area when it was characterized as the Red Rocks Wilderness, and I introduced a bill to protect it.  Over 20 years, little or nothing happened until President Obama designated a monument. Now comes President Trump, who has made a decision to dramatically eviscerate this monument, to basically eliminate 80 or 90 percent of the land that has been set aside.  It is a beautiful part of It is an extraordinary part of It is something that most of us know little about, but if you go to the southeastern corner of Utah, you will find tourists from all over the world who come to see the beauty of this region--the Bears Ears region, the Red Rock Wilderness region.  You ask local people: If you didn't set this aside for future generations, if you didn't protect it, what would you do with this land? The people of Utah are the first to tell me: Well, there is not much you can do with it. We don't think there is oil and gas there to be drilled. The uranium efforts have petered out; there is very little of that that is left. There is not much that can be done with it. But if it is preserved, clearly people want to come visit it and be part of this unique American experience.  When I was there just a few weeks ago, there was a group in Moab, UT, in a gift shop. I kind of drew near the group--there were about a dozen of them--and they were all speaking These were French tourists who came to this part of Utah not only to spend their money but to see something special.  President Obama said: Let's protect it. Let's make sure that future generations can indeed enjoy it and value it.  President Trump said: For 80 or 90 percent of it, let's make it go away.  This is a terrible decision. It is terrible for this section of Utah, it is terrible for our country, and it is terrible for our future. If we do not protect our natural heritage for our kids, grandkids, and their kids and grandkids, then we have walked away from a fundamental responsibility, and I believe we have.  We have a wonderful system across America protecting national parks. If you read the history of some of these national parks, you will know that it was a battle to stop someone who wanted to create a commercial interest there and didn't want it to be protected by the government. In this case, there doesn't appear to be any other economic interest that can really lay claim to this, but there is an effort by the Trump administration to remove the protection anyway. I think that is a serious mistake.  America is not America without its great outdoor spaces--its national parks, its historic monuments--that Congress and Presidents in both political parties have preserved for the benefit of future generations. To diminish our commitment to protecting the natural landscapes and historic places in this country from ruin by exploitation or environmental degradation would constitute a breach of our responsibility both to those who founded this Nation and to those who will inherit it. That is why we are deeply troubled by President Trump's announcement today, which would undermine the preservation of some of the country's most important national monuments and would remove protections for more than 2 million acres of public land--the largest elimination of protected land in the history of the United States of  Utah's most cherished national monuments--Bears Ears, which I mentioned, and the Grand Staircase-Escalante--will now be under threat from this new Trump order. Many of these are sacred lands to Native Americans, and they will now be put at risk for desecration and looting. Is that what we want to leave future generations? Is that the honor we are going to give to the lands that were part of the heritage of Native Americans? I think it is a serious mistake.  I hope that some will stand up and speak up about preserving this heritage for future generations.  Madam President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

953,topic-id,1047,"Mr.President, it was 20 years ago when I was first elected to the I was asked to consider a bill called the Red Rocks Wilderness I didn't know anything about it. It was a bill that had been offered by Senator Bill Bradley of New He was retiring. I was asked to consider sponsoring this wilderness proposal in the State of Of course, I said, I am from Illinois, not Utah, and I have never seen this. Well, they asked me to come out and take a look, and I did.  My wife and I went out to take a look at what was known as the Red Rocks Wilderness It is in the southeastern corner of I had never been there, nor had I ever heard of it before I visited. What an eye-opener, to go there and see this magnificent vista, this incredible landscape that was being proposed for wilderness protection and status.  So over the years, I have reintroduced the bill, the conversation continued, and it wasn't until President Obama took a major share of this area, which is in San Juan County in the southeastern corner of Utah, and designated it in the name of the Bears Ears Monument that we finally achieved protection for this beautiful piece of real estate.  I have been there. It is breathtaking. There are incredible cultural sites there by Native Americans, and it is a great place to visit, to hike, and to enjoy a special piece of It is filled with magnificent red rock formations, deep, carved canyons, long mesas, and rock arches. Some of the photos just don't do it justice. We can take a look at some of these, and we can get an idea of the vastness of the area that is affected here.  Then you might take a look at some of the others and realize it includes a lot of cultural and prehistoric settings that were utilized by the Native American people when they called these caves their homes. It has special meaning to the Native American Tribes that are there. Many of them trace their origins to the very people who dwelled in these caves and the structures they built with the loose rocks that we can still see today.  We look at it and think, Well, if you didn't use this, if you didn't preserve it, if you didn't protect it, what would you do with it?  I have spoken with some of the Senators from Utah, and they have readily conceded there is no oil or gas there to be drilled. There may be some uranium processing but very little. I asked them: Why wouldn't you want this area protected? It doesn't have economic value other than the fact that people will come, tourists will come to Utah to see this beautiful place.  I was troubled when President Trump announced he was going to follow Secretary Zinke's recommendation and shrink the proposed Bears Ears Monument as well as another nearby called the Grand Staircase-They would reduce the size of the Bears Ears Monument by 85 percent and Grand Staircase-Escalante by 50 percent.  In April, President Trump issued an Executive order requiring the Department of the Interior to preview and review the previous national monument designations of President Although Bears Ears and Grand Staircase are the first two targets to be hit by President Trump, this attack on what is known as the Antiquities Act and our national monuments goes far beyond these two sites.  As part of the review, the President and Secretary of the Interior Zinke considered changing every national monument that had been created since 1996, which is more than 50 nationwide. These are areas that have been protected by Presidents of both political parties. It goes back, in fact, to a Republican President, Teddy Roosevelt, who realized it was worth fighting off some of the parochial and economic interests to preserve pieces of America for future generations.  The list that was subject to the Trump order spans the country. It includes the Cascade-Siskiyou in Oregon, Gold Butte in Nevada, Katahdin Woods and Waters in Maine, Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks and Rio Grande in New Mexico, and several marine monuments.  The administration's decisions to shrink Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante goes against continued support for these sites. The Bears Ears Monument was the first monument to be proposed and advocated by the five sovereign Tribal nations: The Hopi, Navajo Nation, Ute Mountain Ute, Pueblo of Zuni, and Ute  The Tribes sought protection because of the important place Bears Ears has in their cultures. The artifacts within Bears Ears range from 700 to 12,000 years old, providing Tribes with an incredible insight into the sacred history of their ancestral homeland and bolstering their deep spiritual connection to the landscape itself. In total, 30 Native-American Tribes with ancestral, historical, and contemporary ties to the Bears Ears region supported the designation--30.  I might recall, for those who are not students of history--and I am learning--treatment of Native Americans in this region has again raised some serious questions about America's past. It wasn't until 1920 that Native Americans were recognized as citizens of the United States in many of these areas. It wasn't until 1957 that Native Americans were given the right to vote in the State of Utah even though Native Americans had served our country in World War II, such as the Code Talkers, who were honored by President Trump last week. It wasn't until the 1970s that the State of Utah built its first public school on a Tribal area reservation--and only did that after being ordered by the Federal court. The history of our relationship with these Native-American Tribes is one that raises questions about our respect for what they meant to the earliest founding of America and what they mean to us today.  Mr.President, I see the majority leader has taken the floor. I know that under the rules he has priority when it[[Page S7827]]comes to speaking.

1138,topic-id,839,"Madam President, let me thank my colleague from Ohio for raising this important issue. It comes down to a very basic question for the We have a tax code that creates incentives and penalties for certain conduct. We encourage Americans to give to charities, and we give them a deduction. We encourage Americans to own homes, and we let them deduct the cost of interest on their mortgage. We encourage them in so many different ways and discourage other conduct.  Why shouldn't we encourage American businesses to hire American workers? Why shouldn't we reward American businesses that keep their businesses in America and not move them overseas? Why shouldn't we incentivize businesses and corporations to pay a decent minimum living wage to their employees, to provide basic benefits when it comes to health insurance and healthcare, and a good retirement plan? Why shouldn't we incentivize American companies to hire veterans? Why don't we put in our Tax Code incentives that create stronger, better, patriotic American corporations?  I am going to wave the flag here. I think there are a lot of great corporations, companies in America that really do care for this country. Some don't, and I don't think they should be rewarded for turning their backs on America--but we do.  In the current Tax Code, if you decide to ship your jobs off overseas, send your factories overseas and put Americans out of work, do you know what the Tax Code says? Be my guest. The provision says you can deduct the cost of moving so we incentivize and reward companies that want to leave  What Senator Brown and many on this side of the aisle believe, as I do, is why don't we incentivize the companies that want to stay in America? Why don't we incentivize those who say: We want to hire American people and pay them a decent wage.  I think that is what a tax code is all about, to create incentives for good things for the American economy and discourage bad things, and so I introduced this bill several years back. Congresswoman Schakowsky of Chicago joined me in that effort. We have had this bill there. Senator Brown has been such a leader in this area. I was proud to stand with him today to do this jointly and offer this as part of the tax plan.  So it is a basic proposition for President Trump and for the Do you believe--do you believe American businesses that stay in this country deserve a break? Do you believe American businesses that pay a decent wage to their employees deserve a tax break? Do you believe American companies that put together health insurance and retirement plans that are fair and just for their workers and their families deserve a break in our Tax Code? Do you think we ought to give a helping hand to those companies that will hire a veteran, put a veteran to work? Do you think our Tax Code should also recognize that some companies are going to hire disabled people and give them a chance of a lifetime? Do you think all of those are good conduct by corporations that deserve not only a pat on the back but a helping hand when it comes to the Tax Code? That is what this is about. It is very basic. That is what I believe. I think that is what most of the people in Illinois believe. I think that is what President Trump might have been speaking to during the course of his campaign, about creating jobs in  This President and those who are in his party now have a chance to put a vote on the board and show they believe that too. If you vote against this, how in the world would you explain it when you go home? Oh, yes, I voted against patriot corporations. I don't think we ought to reward American companies that hire American workers and treat them fairly. How do you explain that?  This Tax Code is loaded with incentives. It is loaded with special interests. The special interest we are focusing on are American workers and their families with this amendment. We are focusing as well on the companies that respect them, treat them fairly, pay them a decent wage, and give them a fighting chance to make it in It sounds to me like a middle-class issue. It sounds to me like a middle-income issue. It sounds to me like a good economic growth policy, not just to increase corporate profits by reducing their taxes but to make sure the company's business model is based on what is good for the future of America and what is good for our economy.  Yes, I am waving the flag here. I am proud to do it. I want to wave a flag at every company that respects American workers and treats them the way they deserve, and I think this is a good way, a good step in that direction.

1288,topic-id,2091,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from He and I came to the House of Representatives together a few years back, and we have had the pleasure and honor of serving together in the When he is on my team, I feel much stronger because I know Tom Carper is a person of values, principles, and hard work, and he really takes this job seriously. His State is lucky to have him, and I am lucky to count him as a friend. I thank him for joining me on this important issue.  Sixteen years ago, I introduced a bill addressing young people brought to America by their parents who, frankly, were young, didn't really know much about the immigration experience, grew up in the United States thinking they were just like all the other kids in the classroom, and then realized one day they weren't.  You see, they are not legal. Their parents didn't do it properly, didn't file the right papers. I am not holding it against their parents. Let me add that quickly. Their parents were doing the very best for the family they could. They were taking risks that many of us would take any day for a son or daughter to have a chance to live a good life.  Here were these young people in the United States undocumented. What were they to do? They didn't know that old country where their parents came from. They may not even be able to speak the language of that country, and here they were in the United They thought things would work out, some way or another. Time passed, and it didn't.  We have a broken immigration system. We have a lot of gaps in the system, and they were caught up in one of[[Page S7853]]them. Sixteen years ago, I introduced a bill, and here is what it said. If you came to the United States as a child, if you grew up in this country, you didn't have any serious problems with the law, and you graduated from school, we were going to give you a chance, a chance to earn your way into legal status. You could do it by furthering your education, volunteering for the military. There were a lot of ways to do it. We said to these young people: This will be your chance.  That bill was introduced a long time ago, and it has never become the law. At one point when President Obama was in the Office of the Presidency, I wrote him a letter with 20 of my colleagues in the Senate and asked him to find a way, if he could, to protect these young people from being deported out of America, and he did. They called it The DACA Program said, if you are one of the people who, by definition under the DREAM Act, would be eligible, you can stay in the United States if you step up and pay about $500 in a filing fee, go through a serious criminal background check, and then we will give you a temporary 2-year protection from deportation--2 years that you can work legally in the United States and come back and see us if you want to renew it.  At the end of the day, about 800,000 young people in America did that. They paid their fee. They went through the background check, they submitted all their information to our government, and they were protected.  Just 3 months ago, President Donald Trump abolished DACA and said, as of March 5 next year, it is gone. What does that mean for these young people? It means that as of March 5 of next year, many of them will be subject to deportation and subject to losing the jobs they have or being unable to finish school because they can't work.  I have met a lot of those young people. I am sure Senator Hassan has met some. I know Senator Carper has. He just read one of their stories. They are heartbroken, and they are scared. They worry about what is going to happen to them and their families when March 5 rolls around.  For weeks, months since President Trump's announcement, I have come to the floor and asked: For goodness' sake, can't we agree--Democrats and Republicans--to fix this problem? President Trump challenged us: Do your job, Pass a law.  That is what we are supposed to do. Here we are, 3 months later, and it hasn't been done. What I hear from the other side of the aisle is, give us a little more time; we will try to get to it next year.  March 5, 2018, DACA is over and finished. Waiting several weeks is bad enough. Waiting several months is unacceptable. I will tell you why it is. We know this needs to be done now. Today, 34 Republicans in the House of Representatives sent a letter to the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, calling for Congress to pass legislation to protect Dreamers this year--34 They said: ``It is imperative that Republicans and Democrats come together to solve this problem now and not wait until next year''--34 Republicans in the How many bipartisan things go on around here anymore? Not many. Here is one. I salute these Members of the I salute the four Republican Senators who joined me in cosponsoring the Dream They, I think, have stuck their necks out, and I respect them so much for it. I will stand up for them because of it. I thank them for that. I know why they are doing it. They are not doing it for me. They shouldn't, and I am sure they are not. They are doing it for these young people. I will tell you without fail, when you meet them, they convert you in a minute.  For the last several years, I have come to the floor to tell their stories. I am told the one I am going to tell right now is the 99th time I have told a story like this. Each time I tell one of these stories, it makes the case for why we need to do something to help these young people and do it quickly.  Let me show you this wonderful young lady here. Her name is Blanca Blanca Morales was brought to the United States by her parents from Mexico when she was 5 years old. She grew up in Santa Ana, Growing up, she took care of her two younger siblings while her parents worked in factories and in the agriculture fields of  She was quite a student. In high school, she was named one of the top 100 students in the county. She was active in community service, mentoring students who couldn't complete high school without help. She attended a community college, Santa Ana I might add, because she is undocumented, she didn't qualify for any Federal Government assistance. Going to college in that circumstance means working, scraping by, putting things off, sacrificing to get through. She did it. She majored in chemistry and biology. She was part of Phi Beta Kappa, an international honors society. She won first academic team in the All-USA Academic She was her class's valedictorian, with a perfect 4.0  Blanca, after graduation, attended the University of California, She majored in neurobiology. At UC Irvine, she graduated with honors magna cum laude. After obtaining this premed degree, she couldn't land a job in the medical field because she is undocumented in  Then, in 2012, everything changed. President Obama established the DACA Program I mentioned earlier, which allowed Blanca, for the first time in her life, to get a permit to legally work in Last year, Blanca Morales was accepted to the Harvard School of She has remained involved in community service, mentoring students, teaching health classes at a community health center, and volunteering as a translator at clinics for Spanish-speaking patients.  Close to 70 Dreamers are enrolled in medical schools around the country just like she is. Without DACA, these Dreamers will never become doctors. Why? They are going to be deported back to their countries if they are not lucky. If they happen to be able to stay, they cannot legally work in America without DACA status. You cannot finish medical school and go on to a residency without a work permit, without being able to legally work in They cannot legally work without DACA protection, and President Trump has ended it.  Are we going to be a stronger nation if we deport her, tell her to leave, go back to Mexico, which she left when she was 5 years of age, give up on all the education she has put on the board--at the community college where she was leading her class, on to get her degrees, on to be accepted to Harvard Medical The answer is clear. America would be less if she left.  The Association of American Medical Colleges reports the Nation faces a doctor shortage, which is only going to get worse. Both the AMA and the Association of American Medical Colleges have warned that ending DACA will make this problem worse. They have urged Congress to do something.  Blanca wrote me a letter, and here is what she said.       It took me eight years from graduating from the university      to enter medical school. Without DACA or better yet, a formal      way to become a full member of society, I am left to live in      the shadows. I don't know if I will be able to finish my      medical training without a permanent solution to my      immigration status. Please help me keep my dream of becoming      a physician alive.  When my colleagues come to the floor and say we are just too busy here to take up this issue, I wish they would have a chance to meet this spectacular young woman. I wish they would consider what she is asking us to do. She is asking us to do our job. We are supposed to solve problems.  When you read the numbers, 70, 80 percent of Americans approve of the Dream Act, even an overwhelming majority of those who voted for President Trump believe these young people deserve a chance to be legal in Why can't we get our job done? We need to do it and do it now. We have 3 weeks before we are likely to end the session this year. I want to see us get this finished this year. I want to see a bipartisan agreement.  I came to the floor earlier and listened to the speeches of many of my colleagues--one from North Carolina and another from Oklahoma, one from the State of Texas and another from the State of Arkansas--and each one of them said there are lots of things we need to do to fix our immigration system. I couldn't agree more.  I was on the task force--the Gang of 8 they called it--that came up with a comprehensive immigration reform. It[[Page S7854]]took us months to do it, but we did it. We did everything we could think of within the four corners of immigration reform. We passed it on the floor of the Senate with a strong bipartisan rollcall, and the House of Representatives refused to even consider it. That doesn't mean the problems have gone away. They are still here. What I am saying to my colleagues is, don't try to fix every immigration problem you can think of on the backs of these Dreamers like Blanca I am willing to talk to you honestly, forthrightly about border security. Count me in. I voted for it as part of comprehensive immigration reform, but every notion, every idea, every theory you have about immigration shouldn't be placed on the shoulders and backs of these young people.  Let's fix this, and then let's go on to the next phase of dealing with immigration reform in its totality. That makes sense to me. I am ready to bargain, work, compromise in good faith with any Member on the Republican side and the Democratic side who wants to make sure a young woman like this deserves a fighting chance in I believe that.

SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Terrorism      Prevention Act of 2017''.     2.       Congress finds the following:       (1) White supremacists and other right-wing extremists are      the most significant domestic terrorism threat facing the      United       (2) A 2009 report from the Extremism and Radicalization      Branch of the Department of Homeland Security concluded      ``that lone wolves and small terrorist cells embracing      violent right-wing extremist ideology are the most dangerous      domestic terrorism threat in the United States''.       (3) An unclassified May 2017 joint intelligence bulletin      from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department      of Homeland Security found that ``white supremacist extremism      poses [a] persistent threat of lethal violence,'' and that      white supremacists ``were responsible for 49 homicides in 26      attacks from 2000 to 2016 . . . more than any other domestic      extremist movement''.       (4) According to the New America Foundation, since      September 11, 2001, 76 Americans have died in terrorist      attacks by domestic extremists in the United 89      percent were killed by far-right-wing extremists.       (5) The fatal attacks described in paragraph (4) include--       (A) the August 5, 2012, mass shooting at a Sikh gurdwara in      Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in which a white supremacist shot and      killed 6 members of the gurdwara;       (B) the April 13, 2014, mass shooting at a Jewish community      center and a Jewish assisted living facility in Overland      Park, Kansas, in which a neo-Nazi shot and killed 3      civilians, including a 14-year-old teenager;       (C) the June 8, 2014, ambush in Las Vegas, Nevada, in which      2 supporters of the far right-wing ``patriot'' movement shot      and killed 2 police officers and a civilian;       (D) the June 17, 2015, mass shooting at the Emanuel AME      Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in which a white      supremacist shot and killed 9 members of the church;       (E) the November 27, 2015, mass shooting at a Planned      Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in which an      anti-abortion extremist shot and killed a police officer and      2 civilians;       (F) the March 20, 2017, murder of an African-American man      in New York City, allegedly committed by a white supremacist      who reportedly traveled to New York ``for the purpose of      killing black men'';       (G) the May 26, 2017, attack in Portland, Oregon, in which      a white supremacist allegedly murdered 2 men and injured a      third after the men defended 2 young women whom the      individual had targeted with anti-Muslim hate speech; and       (H) the August 12, 2017, attack in Charlottesville,      Virginia, in which a white supremacist allegedly killed 1 and      injured 19 after driving his car through a crowd of      individuals protesting a neo-Nazi rally, and of which      Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, ``It does meet the      definition of domestic terrorism in our statute.''.       (6) The Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism found      that right-wing extremists were responsible for 150 terrorist      acts, attempted acts, and plots and conspiracies that took      place in the United States between 1993 and 2017. These      attacks resulted in the deaths of 255 people and injured more      than 600.       (7) According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, in 2015,      for the first time in 5 years, the number of hate groups in      the United States rose by 14 percent. The increase included a      more than twofold rise in the number of Ku Klux Klan      chapters. The number of anti-government militias and      ``patriot'' groups also grew by 14 percent in 2015.       (8) In November 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation      released its annual hate crime incident report, which found      that in 2016, hate crimes increased by almost 5 percent,      including a 19 percent rise in hate crimes against American      Similarly, the previous year's report found that in      2015, hate crimes increased by 6 percent. Much of that      increase came from a 66 percent rise in attacks on American      In both reports, race-based crimes were most      numerous; more than 50 percent of those hate crimes targeted      African       (9) In January 2017, a right-wing extremist who had      expressed anti-Muslim views was[[Page S7300]]     charged with murder for allegedly killing 6 people and      injuring 19 in a shooting rampage at a mosque in Quebec City,      It was the first-ever mass shooting at a mosque in      North America, and Prime Minister Trudeau labeled it a      terrorist attack.       (10) Between January and July 2017, news reports found 63      incidents in which American mosques were targeted by threats,      vandalism, or arson.     3.       In this Act--       (1) the term ``Director'' means the Director of the Federal      Bureau of Investigation;       (2) the term ``domestic terrorism'' has the meaning given      the term in section 2331 of title 18, United States Code;       (3) the term ``Domestic Terrorism Executive Committee''      means the committee within the Department of Justice tasked      with assessing and sharing information about ongoing domestic      terrorism threats; and       (4) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Homeland          4.

SHORT         This Act may be cited as the ``Drug-Price Transparency in      Communications Act''.     2.         Congress finds as follows:         (1) Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription      pharmaceuticals is legal in only 2 developed countries, the      United States and New         (2) Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription      pharmaceuticals is designed to cause patients to pressure      physicians to prescribe certain medications.         (3) In 2015, pharmaceutical companies spent more than      $100,000,000 on advertising with respect to each of 16 brand-     name drugs, primarily new and expensive drugs.         (4) Prescription rates of medications advertised directly      to consumers have increased by 34.2 percent compared to a 5.1      percent increase in other pharmaceuticals.

1810,topic-id,2149,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Greg Katsas to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, but I want to begin with some general observations.  This year, the Republican-controlled Senate has repeatedly fallen short when it comes to serving as a meaningful check and balance in our constitutional system. Senate Republicans have abandoned longstanding norms of due diligence and careful scrutiny, all in the name of advancing the agenda of President  We saw this when Senate Republicans voted in near lockstep to confirm President Trump's Cabinet nominees. Republicans simply looked the other way when nominees failed to pay all of their taxes, did not disclose millions in assets, had conflicts of interest, or could not even answer basic questions at their hearings. Senate Republicans have repeatedly tried to rush through partisan bills in the dark of night. Remember when they revealed the text of the TrumpCare bill just a few hours before the Senate voted on it? Now Senate Republicans are trying to pass massive tax cuts for the largest corporations and wealthiest Americans, by ramming through an enormous bill with little debate and public scrutiny of how the bill would explode the deficit and raise taxes on many in the working class.  This pattern, of the Senate abandoning its responsibility to do basic due diligence when it comes to the agenda of President Trump, has also infected our process of considering judicial nominees. When it comes to President Trump's judicial nominees, we are seeing the Senate's constitutional responsibility of ``advice and consent'' turn into ``rush through and rubberstamp.''  All year, Senate Republicans have been removing guardrails that help ensure that judicial nominees have the qualifications, temperament, and integrity that we need for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. Don't just take it from me. Take it from the conservative Wall Street I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a November 20 article from the Wall Street Journal entitled ``Checks on Trump's Court Picks Fall Away'' at the conclusion of my remarks.  This article talks about the series of procedural changes Senate Republicans have made this year to expedite Trump's judicial nominations--most recently, the November 16 announcement by Senator Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, that he would hold hearings on nominees who do not receive positive blue slips from both home-State Senators, something that never happened under the Obama administration. The article begins by saying:       The Republican head of the Senate Judiciary Committee has      curtailed one of the last legislative limits on a president's      power to shape the federal courts, giving Donald Trump more      freedom than any U.president in modern times to install      his judges of choice, legal experts said.  Consider the other changes Republicans have already made in just the first year of the Trump administration.[[Page S7345]]  First, President Trump subcontracted the selection of Supreme Court nominees out to rightwing special interest groups like the Federalist President Trump publicly thanked the Federalist Society for assembling a list of candidates from which Justice Neil Gorsuch was selected. The White House even asked Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society to call Justice Gorsuch to let him know he was a candidate for the job. Never before had a President credited a special interest group with serving as a de facto selection committee for the Federal judiciary. For anyone who wonders what the Federalist Society is all about, I urge you to watch the video of this group laughing and applauding at their convention a few weeks ago when Attorney General Sessions joked about meeting with It was shameful.  Senate Republicans also changed the rules of the Senate in order to get Neil Gorsuch confirmed. He couldn't get 60 votes on the Senate floor, so the Republicans changed the rules to make 50 votes the threshold for appointments to the Supreme  When it comes to lower-court nominees, the Trump administration and Senate Republicans are doing half-hearted vetting at best. We are constantly learning information that nominees initially failed to disclose. For example, Alabama District Court nominee Brett Talley failed to disclose that his wife was an attorney in the White House Counsel's Office and that Talley had apparently posted online comments defending the early KKK and calling for shooting death row inmates. Court of Federal Claims nominee Damien Schiff failed to disclose that he had called Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy a ``judicial prostitute'' in a blog post. North Carolina District Court nominee Thomas Farr reportedly failed to fully disclose his role in an African-American voter suppression effort during the 1990 campaign for Senator Jesse Yet all of these nominees were reported out of the Judiciary Committee on party line votes.  There are other changes that Republicans have made to the nominations process this year. Republicans have decided not to wait for the American Bar Association to do their nonpartisan peer review of a nominee's qualifications before holding a hearing. When the ABA unanimously finds nominees not to be qualified, Republicans still support the nominees anyway. Republicans have also begun regularly holding hearings on two circuit court nominees at a time. Why? Apparently, they are afraid to let each of their nominees stand on their own two feet and face questioning from Senators individually. The circuit courts have the final word on tens of thousands of cases every year. Every single lifetime appointment to these courts deserves to be scrutinized on its own individual merits.  Furthermore, Judiciary Committee Republicans are looking to relax the standards for nominees with a history of past drug use. Republicans repeatedly blocked judicial candidates proposed by President Obama who had smoked marijuana in the past, but Republicans now want a more lenient standard for Trump nominees. I am open to a different standard, but it must not be a double standard for Democratic versus Republican nominees.  That takes us to the changes to the blue slip. Republicans now want to disregard this 100-year-old tradition--meaning they will ignore the vetting that home-State Senators do for nominees from their Remember, blue slips were respected throughout the Obama administration. Republicans sent a letter in 2009 asking President Obama to respect blue slips, and he did. Republicans then proceeded to block 18 Obama nominees by withholding blue slips. Now, Republicans have announced that they are doing a 180-degree turn for Trump nominees and that they will disregard blue slips whenever they feel like it.  Why are Republicans abandoning so many longstanding traditions and guardrails when it comes to judicial nominations? It is because many of President Trump's nominees simply wouldn't pass muster under the traditional ground rules. Many Trump nominees have minimal experience, a history of ideologically biased statements, serious questions about their temperament and judgment, or a lack of independence from President Senate Republicans want to rubberstamp these nominees anyway--and confirm them as quickly as possible in their effort to pack the courts.  Just look at some of the judicial nominees who have already been confirmed this year--like John Bush, confirmed to sit on the Sixth Circuit, who blogged about the false claim that President Obama wasn't born in the United States and said at his hearing that he thinks impartiality is an aspiration for a judge, not an expectation; or Stephanos Bibas, now a judge on the Third Circuit, who wrote a lengthy paper calling for corporal punishment, including putting offenders in the stocks or pillory and applying multiple calibrated electroshocks.  Now, consider DC Circuit nominee Greg Katsas, who is before us today. Mr.Katsas works in the White House for President He is a Deputy White House He testified that he has been personally involved in many of the Trump administration's most controversial policies, ranging from the Muslim travel ban to the creation of the Pence-Kobach election commission, to ending the DACA program, to the Trump administration's rollback of protections for LGBTQ- Mr.Katsas also said that, while working for President Trump, he has given legal advice regarding the Emoluments Clause, advised on the administration's efforts to cut off Federal public safety funds to cities because of disagreements over immigration enforcement, and even provided legal advice on the Special Counsel's Russia investigation.  This is a laundry list of Trump administration controversies that Mr.Katsas has been personally involved with. It is likely that many of these issues will end up in litigation before the DC I don't think appointing President Trump's staff lawyer to the DC Circuit will strengthen the American people's confidence in the fairness of our justice system. Instead, we need nominees with a strong track record of independence and good judgment.  Let me talk for a minute about Mr.Katsas's judgment.  At his hearing, I asked Mr.Katsas some simple questions about the torture technique known as waterboarding. I was deeply troubled by his answers. I asked him if waterboarding is torture. He said, ``I hesitate to answer the question in the abstract, not knowing the circumstances, the nature of the program.'' I asked him if waterboarding is cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. I noted that Senator John McCain, the author of the 2006 law that made it clear that cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment is illegal, has said ``waterboarding, under any circumstances, represents a clear violation of U.law''--so did all four Judge Advocates General--the top lawyers in the military--during the Bush administration. But Mr.Katsas responded evasively, saying ``anything that is cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment would be clearly unlawful.'' I then asked Mr.Katsas is waterboarding illegal under U.law. He said ``to the extent it constitutes either torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, yes it is.''  What a pack of weasel words. Mr.Katsas's tortured logic about waterboarding is unacceptable. Mr.Katsas should have said, with no equivocation and no uncertainty, that waterboarding is illegal, that it is cruel, inhuman, and degrading and that it is torture. That is the law, and a Federal judge should know it.  I am concerned that Mr.Katsas's refusal to give those answers reflects a troubling ideological viewpoint when it comes to questions of torture and interrogation techniques. My concerns were amplified by a speech Mr.Katsas gave in April 2009 when his speech notes said ``high bar--a lot of coercive interrogation does not equal torture.''  This is a clear-cut issue for me. I have voted against nominees in the past who gave the wrong answers to questions about waterboarding, and I will do it again. In my view, Mr.Katsas has not demonstrated the independence and judgment that we need for the critical position of DC Circuit judge. I cannot support his nomination.[[Page S7346]]  Here is the bottom line. Before I was a Senator, I was a lawyer in downstate Illinois, and I looked up to Federal judges. I thought that, to get that job, you had to be a cut above. Otherwise, you wouldn't make it through the Senate's rigorous advice and consent process. Sadly, this Republican Senate is turning advice and consent into ``rush through and rubberstamp.'' Republicans want to pack the courts with judges who will support President Trump's agenda, and so they are hurrying to confirm as many of his picks as possible--even if they are unqualified, ideological, hiding things from the Senate, or too close to President Our Federal judiciary is being diminished as a result.  I wish my Republican colleagues would stand up for an independent judiciary and a meaningful advice and consent process. We should fill this vacancy on the DC Circuit with someone who is independent of President Trump, not one of his staff attorneys. We should choose nominees who are unafraid to say what the law is on torture, instead of what they might wish the law to be.  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Katsas nomination.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, 20, 2017]                Checks on Trump's Court Picks Fall Away                    (Joe Palazzolo and Ashby Jones)Move to curtail `blue slips' gives the president, and successors, wide                    leeway in picks for federal bench       The Republican head of the Senate Judiciary Committee has      curtailed one of the last legislative limits on a president's      power to shape the federal courts, giving Donald Trump more      freedom than any U.president in modern times to install      his judges of choice, legal experts said.       Last week, Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) reined in a      tradition that empowered senators to block federal appeals-     court nominees from their home state. His decision came about      four years after Democrats, citing Republican filibusters of      President Barack Obama's circuit-court nominees, eliminated a      Senate rule that required the majority party to mount 60      votes to advance a nominee to a confirmation vote.       Together, the threat of a filibuster--or delaying tactic--     and use of ``blue slips''--so named because senators indicate      support or opposition to nominees on blue slips of paper--     guarded against lifetime appointments for nominees deemed far      outside the mainstream, court experts said.

1829,topic-id,3093,"Mr.President, this week many things will happen in Washington, but the focus in the Senate Chamber later in the week will be the Republican tax plan. It is a plan that has come upon us really quickly--in a matter of weeks--and it literally will affect the economy of the United States and virtually every taxpayer. There is hardly a measure we can entertain that has such broad and far-reaching impact on the future of this country and its economy.  What we are trying to do now is to analyze this plan. It has been put on a fast schedule. I can guarantee, as I stand here, that because of this hurry-up approach on tax reform, when it is all said and done, if anything is enacted into law, we can look back with regret for not having taken the time to do this carefully, not having measured the impact of any tax changes on individuals, families, and the economy, and, certainly, on our national debt.  So far we have a plan that was considered and passed by the House of Representatives, also on a fast schedule, and one in the Senate as well. The one in the Senate will be up for consideration this week. It is going to be a procedure, which was established in the Senate years ago, called reconciliation. For the outsider, it is a long word, which, by Senate definition, means that a simple majority vote is all that is necessary to pass this measure. It will not be subject to the traditional filibuster in the Senate nor to the need for 60 votes, as in most instances.  It was designed, in its inception, to be a way to reduce the budget deficit. Ironically, what we will see happen with the proposed Senate tax plan is an increase of our national debt instead of a reduction. But that seems to be the intent of the sponsors, and it is what we will consider.  We took a look at some of the proposals in the Senate Republican plan. It is no secret that this plan would bankroll massive tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America and the largest corporations, and it would raise taxes on middle-income families. If that seems like contrary thinking to what most Americans were looking for, it is.  Time and again we are told that the average American needs a helping hand. I certainly understand that in Illinois and across the This tax plan by the Republicans will not help working families. At best, it gives them a temporary tax cut, which later ends up as a tax increase.  However, if you happen to be among the wealthiest of Americans, there is good news in the Republican plan. There will be substantial tax cuts in permanent law. So the help for working families is temporary, the help for wealthy families is permanent, and the help for corporations is permanent.  To put it in perspective from the corporate point of view, we can understand those who argue that lowering taxes on businesses will incentivize them to expand their businesses. Yet there are a couple of things we have to acknowledge. As a percentage of the gross domestic product, corporate profits in America have never been higher. As a percentage of gross domestic product, corporate taxes paid have never been lower. Profits are at their highest, taxes are at their lowest, and the Republicans come to us and say: Well, clearly, what we need to do is to cut corporate taxes again. I disagree.  I asked Secretary Mnuchin at a hearing: Shouldn't our goal be to not only have a growing economy but to have more fairness in the economy for working families who continue to put in the hours and put in the work and watch their own wealth and their own income really fall behind against the expenses they face? Well, he agreed with my conclusion, but he couldn't explain how the Republican tax plan would meet that goal. I don't think it does.  I do not exaggerate when I say that this is a tax cut by the Republicans for the wealthiest. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation analysis of the Republican bill shows that by 2027, as corporations are enjoying a huge tax cut, on average, taxpayers who earn less than $75,000 a year will see their taxes go up under the Republican plan.  You think: Oh, that must have been a press release from the Democratic National No, it was an analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan group that we turn to in order to measure the impact of tax legislation. It is not the wealthy taxpayers, not a few taxpayers, not a couple of unfortunate exceptions; on average, taxpayers at every income bracket earning less than $75,000 would see their taxes increase under the Republican plan.  How would the wealthy fair? Well, it is no surprise that under the Republican plan, the largest tax cuts under the bill go to the wealthiest households. I get a lot of letters and emails, telephone calls and contacts. There aren't a lot of rich people calling me and saying: We need a tax break, They are not asking for it. But they don't have to ask for it when the Republicans are writing a tax bill.  As Republicans throw huge tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, here is what they do: They eliminate the alternative minimum tax, they lower the top income tax bracket, and they double the exemption for the estate tax. They go straight after a deduction that helps one-third of all taxpayers lower their taxes--the State and local tax deduction. They cut that, but they give these tax breaks to people who are already millionaires many times over.  The Republican plan would eliminate the State and local tax deduction--a deduction that helps millions of middle-income families avoid being taxed twice on their hard-earned income--once at the State and local level and again at the Federal level. The State of Illinois is an example--and most other States--where people pay a State income tax. Currently, taxpayers can deduct that State income tax paid from any Federal tax liability. The premise is simple: You shouldn't be taxed on a tax. The Republicans turn that upside down. They would tax the tax you paid at the State and local level.  Eliminating this vital deduction makes it more expensive for families to fund local services such as schools, police departments, fire departments, and local roads and bridges. In my State, which has the fifth highest number of taxpayers claiming this deduction, nearly 2 million Illinoisans would no longer be able to claim more than $24 billion in State and local tax deductions, as they did in 2015.  So what is the Republican motivation for eliminating this deduction that is so important for middle-income families? Well, that is how they pay for the tax cuts for those at the highest income levels, and that is how they help the largest corporations cut their tax bills.  This is wrong. If there was ever a question about who the Republicans are writing this plan for, look no further than the changes made during the committee session when they decided that they wouldn't stop at merely raising taxes on millions of middle-income families in order to pay for permanent corporate tax cuts, but they also were willing to raise families' health insurance premiums. It is not bad enough that tax bills are going to go up for most middle-income families. Under the Republican plan, they have devised a way to increase health insurance premiums at the same time. What a breakthrough.  Republicans can't help themselves. Even in the face of opposition from the American people, hospitals, patients, nurses, seniors, and faith leaders, their tax bill would pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent by repealing part of the Affordable Care  This change alone means that 13 million Americans will lose their health insurance, and it means that the health insurance premiums paid by many others will increase by at least 10 percent a year--perfect. Not only are they going to raise taxes on working families, but they are going to raise the cost of health insurance for those buying policies and eliminate health insurance protection for 13 million Thirteen million Americans lose their health insurance, and millions more see their premiums spike--all to give corporations and the wealthiest people in America a tax cut.[[Page S7339]]  To my Republican colleagues I ask: When is it enough? Haven't we helped the wealthy enough? At least for a day or two, shouldn't we focus on middle-income families?  Sadly, the threat to working families doesn't stop with a hike to their tax bill. In order to find even more money to fund tax cuts for corporations and the highest earners in America, Republicans agreed to add $1.5 trillion to the national deficit--$1.5 trillion. How many times have we heard Members of Congress--usually on the Republican side of the aisle--come to the floor and pose for holy pictures when it comes to the national debt? Well, they certainly have a lot of sermons to deliver when they have a Democratic President, but they suffer from political amnesia when they have a Republican Now they are going to add $1.5 trillion to the national debt to give tax breaks to wealthy people and big corporations.  I have served in this body for many years. I have heard lecture after lecture from Republicans, until they are red in the face, about the importance of fiscal responsibility. I have listened to my Republican colleagues speak at length about the need for spending offsets. They wanted spending offsets for food stamps for hungry They wanted spending offsets for Hurricane Sandy victims when the hurricane hit the New York, New Jersey area. They wanted offsets for Meals on Wheels for seniors.  Where are these deficit hawks now? The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mr.Mulvaney, who made a name for himself while in Congress railing against increasing the debt ceiling, is now advocating for the Republican tax plan saying: ``We need to have new deficits.'' Spare me.  I have heard the calls from Majority Leader McConnell, who once asked: ``At what point do we anticipate getting serious here about doing something about deficit and debt?'' Those are the words of Senator  To that Senator and my Republican colleagues I say: How about now?  So-called fiscally conservative Republicans are hiding behind widely debunked economic growth projections and the so-called ``dynamic scoring,'' arguing that what looks like a $1.5 trillion increase to the deficit will not actually be one.  The appropriately named ``Laffer Curve'' suggested that if you cut taxes on the wealthy, everybody gets well. It didn't work then, when he proposed it. It hasn't worked since, and it will not work now. Yet the Republicans find this as the only refuge for their increase to the deficit.  Over the weekend, however, it was announced that the Joint Committee on Taxation wouldn't have the time to produce a so-called dynamic score for the bill before the  So let me understand this. Not only did Republicans vote to explode the deficit, but now they don't want to wait to see whether their weak defense for this fiscally irresponsible plan will actually work? This is hypocrisy. Maybe it is because Republicans know, as well as the American people, just how hollow their promises are on junk economics.  Do you want a preview of what dynamic scoring will hold? Last week the Penn-Wharton Budget Model released an analysis that shows that the Senate bill would fail the Republicans' own test, even when using their so-called dynamic scoring. Make no mistake, once this happens, Republicans will waste no time in making up the difference by calling for devastating cuts to America's vital programs.  The Republican budget even spells this out for us--where they are going to turn when their approach falls apart. Here is how they are going to do it. They are going to do it on the backs of hard-working Americans, with more than $1 trillion of cuts in Medicaid, and--hang on tight--$470 billion worth of cuts in  The harmful impact to seniors and low- and middle-income families and some of the Nation's most vulnerable from these budgetary cuts apparently justify to them the $1.5 trillion deficit hole they are going to create with this tax plan helping the wealthiest people in  Under our current law, known as the pay-as-you-go law, harmful cuts could start as soon as January, if this bill is passed.  Republicans are determined to have a ``win'' before the end of the year. That is because if you were suffering from insomnia and following the Senate business over the course of last year, you have to wonder why we were here. In the course of the year, two things happened of any moment. 1, there was filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and I will save my analysis of that for another day. 2, there was the passage of the Defense authorization bill. That is it--two things, 1 year.  So the Republicans, before we leave for the so-called holiday recess, want to have a feather in their cap. They want to be able to point to the fact that they have actually passed something. They are saying to their Members that this is a life-or-death proposal: We have to pass this or we will not be able to point to hardly anything that we did during the course of 1 year under Republican control of the That is why they are determined to do this, and do it quickly.  The Republicans' irresponsible deficit spending under this plan will trigger $150 billion in automatic cuts to mandatory spending each year for the next decade. It includes regular cuts to  To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you just can't have it both ways. You can't claim to be fiscally responsible and then vote for a plan that includes billions of dollars in budget gimmicks that would explode the deficit by up to $1.5 trillion over the first 10 years and beyond, even with this great dynamic scoring theory that you are trying to sell. You can't claim to make a tax plan that prioritizes small business and then spend hundreds of billions of dollars giving huge multinational corporations--already enjoying record profits--a massive tax cut as well.  I might add that the Republican tax bill creates incentives--incentives for American corporations to move overseas, to take American jobs overseas. Why in the world would we create a tax code incentive for that to happen?  You can't choose to make the corporate tax cuts permanent at the expense of protecting working Americans and then still claim that this plan is going to help those same families. It is based on nothing more than a wink and a promise to extend half a trillion dollars in middle-income tax cuts that no one wants to pay for.  You can't pretend to be above special interest and then include a provision in this tax bill--in the tax bill--that would open drilling leases for 800,000 acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--one of America's last pristine, untouched wilderness places, home to more than 200 wildlife species, and deserving of preservation.  I have come to the floor over the course of many years in debate about the Arctic National Wildlife Senator Ted Stevens used to sit in that chair, and he couldn't wait until I finished my speech. He would stand up and say: The Senator from Illinois--he would point at me--doesn't even know where the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is. He has never been there. He has no idea what is going on up there. So he should not stand up on the floor and say things that he can't back up with his own personal experience and knowledge.  What I did at that point was that I decided I was going to call his bluff. So I picked up and went up to the Arctic National Wildlife I took a bush plane in and camped out overnight in the refuge. I trekked around. I took a look for myself so that I could back up some of the things I said on the floor.  We were right on the Canning You could look across the river at parts of the Refuge that were managed by the State of On this side of the river where we camped, it was managed as a national wildlife refuge. There was a dramatic difference. Roadways had been built on the State side but not on the Federal side. We had a pristine refuge area. The net result was really beautiful and impressive.  I couldn't wait to get back to the floor to debate Senator Stevens since I had been there. I came back for the next debate. He never raised the question again about whether I had been there. So I didn't get to give the speech on the floor.  To give up all of this land to drill for oil at a time when we are saying to the Middle East that we don't need their oil as much as we have in the past, to[[Page S7340]]drill for gas when fracking is finding natural gas in areas all over the continental United States hardly makes sense. It certainly doesn't if you have ever been there and seen this beautiful piece of real estate.  I think the American people know what the Republicans had in mind with this plan. It really does help their deep-pocketed donors. Some Republicans in the House have been very open about this. One New York Republican Congressman said: Our donor said don't come back unless you give me a tax break. He is very honest about that, but, as far as I am concerned, that shouldn't be the motivation for passing tax reform.  One of the Republican donors I referred to--and I quote him directly--said: ``My donors are basically saying, `Get it done or don't ever call me again.''' Another one said: ``Financial contributions will stop'' if the Republican tax plan doesn't pass. Thank goodness for their honesty and candor.  There are special interests that will do well under this Republican plan, and wealthy people as well, but I think it is time for us to look at this plan, look at it clearly, and understand the negative impacts it is going to have on working  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-28-pt1-PgS7338.txt,326,THE ART OF THE TAX DEAL,2017,28,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1850,topic-id,2213,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to speak about the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as DACA, an Executive order of President Obama, provided temporary, renewable legal status for immigrant students if they registered with the government, paid a filing fee of $500, passed a criminal and national security background check. About 780,000 young people stepped forward and did something they had been warned their entire lives never to do. Their parents knew they were undocumented. They knew that they had been brought to this country at an early age. They knew that they weren't technically legal, and their parents had warned them: Stay away from cops and government. All that can happen is that they will discover you are undocumented and deport you and maybe your family as well. Be careful.  So President Obama stepped up and said: If you will step forward, tell us who you are, and let us do a background check on you, we are going to give you a chance--a chance to earn your way to legal status in America--and 780,000 young people took that chance and signed up for  Just this last Monday I was up in New York City, and I went to Hunter College, which is part of the City University of New York, and there were about five young people on a forum with me to discuss this bill and the issue of Dreamers and immigration. It was interesting because each one of them--bright students, impressive young people--before they would say anything, they would introduce themselves by saying something like ``My name is Isadora, and I have 465 days.'' And the next one would say, ``My name is Evelyn, and I have 270 days.'' They were telling me how much time they had left, protected, to continue on as students.  They know that President Trump's decision on September 5 to abolish DACA means that their protection is going to end as of March 5 next year, and then they face some terrible possibilities. The first is deportation. These people have turned themselves in. They have stepped up and identified themselves to our government with the belief that our government would not hold it against them, and now they worry that has changed. They are worried about what will happen to their family because they had the courage to come up and sign up for this program. These are very real, lifetime problems and challenges these young people face.  If you look through the list of those who could be affected if DACA disappears, as President Trump has called for on March 5, there are some heartbreaking stories. Do you know there are 900 DACA-protected young people who have volunteered and now serve in the U.military? That is right. Even though they are undocumented because of DACA, they were allowed to sign up for a program known as MAVNI, which is a specialized program for those who have talents that are needed in our military, and they literally signed up. Think of that for a moment. Here they are, illegal in America, undocumented in America, willing to risk their lives for Why? Because it is the only country they know. They have lived their whole lives here. They have gone to school here. They have pledged allegiance to that flag every day in the classroom. That was their flag, their national anthem, their country. But because they were brought here as children, toddlers, infants, necessary papers were not filed. They have no legal status in this country. Well, I hope we can change that.  When I asked President Obama to create this program by Executive order, he waited and worked for a year before he came up with it, and I thought it was a good program. It was controversial, but at least for these young people, it gave them a temporary renewable status, and that made all the difference in the world.  When Attorney General Sessions announced the end of DACA on September 5, the President challenged us. He challenged the Senate and the House of He said: Do something about this. Pass a law. Take care of this problem.  I think DACA was legal, but I am not going to argue that point anymore. The new President does not, but I accept his challenge, and I think we all should.[[Page S7377]]  What can we do that is fair to these young people and gives them the chance they are asking for that is consistent with a good immigration policy for America? That is why, years ago, I introduced the DREAM Act and why I still believe it is the right approach. The notion behind it, of course, is if you were brought here as a child, you have no criminal record of any serious nature, you have completed your education, you have a chance to earn your way into legal status and then ultimately into citizenship, and that is what we are working on now.  A number of us are getting together and talking about it on a bipartisan basis, and we have little time left. This has to be done this year, before the end of Why do I say that if the program expires in March of next year? Well, because I have been around the Senate for a few years, and I know in January and February there is little, if any, heavy lifting. There are few bills that have to pass, and we tend to put things off. So far this year, we really wouldn't get gold stars for our performance on the floor of the Senate in generating legislation and that is why I want to get that done--the whole Dream Act and DACA done--in the month of December before we leave. If we don't do it, if we fail--and I pray that we won't--but if we fail, as of March 5 of next year, 1,000 of these young people will lose their protection under the law every single day for 2 years--1,000 a day.  I mentioned those serving in the military. There are 20,000 under DACA who are teachers. As of March 5 next year, they will lose their jobs. School districts all around America will have to fill those vacancies because the teachers can no longer legally work for the school districts, and there are many others who face that as well. We have almost 90 percent who are engaged in some type of job. Many are students who work because they, as undocumented students, don't qualify for Federal assistance. So they hold down jobs to pay for their college education. I have met them. Some of them break down in tears and say: Senator, I am so close to graduating, but what's the point if I am going to be deported the day after? What's the point?  That is what we are up against, and that is what we face. What we need to do is take a look at the real-life stories.  I want to introduce to you a person who is a friend of mine. He is an amazing person. This is Cesar Montelongo, as shown in this picture. Cesar was 10 years old when his family brought him here from He grew up in New Mexico, where his academic achievement was quickly recognized. He graduated from high school with a grade point average above 4.0. He was ranked third in his class. He was a member of the Chess, French, Spanish, Physics, and Science He even took college classes during the last 2 years of high school.  Cesar went on to New Mexico State University, where he had a triple major in biology, microbiology, and Spanish, as well as two minors in chemistry and biochemistry. He is one smart fellow. He graduated with distinction in the honors track with a 3.9 He then earned a master's degree in biology.  He earned a master's degree in biology because his dream was to go to medical school. But before DACA, it was impossible. He could not apply for medical school. The medical schools of America were not accepting the students who were undocumented. He knew if he went to medical school anywhere and didn't have a legal right to work, he couldn't complete a residency at the end of medical school. So he got a master's degree in biology and a minor in molecular biology and worked as a teaching assistant.  Then DACA came along. Today, Cesar is the first DACA student who is enrolled in the MD-PhD program at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of He is entering his third year of this highly competitive program. They accept only a handful for an MD-On completion, he will receive a medical degree and a doctorate degree in science. He is one of more than 30 DACA recipients at this medical school, which I am so proud of, in It was, in fact, the first medical school to admit students with DACA status, beginning in 2014.  DACA students don't get special treatment--no quotas. They have to compete. But amazingly bright, young people like Cesar were just waiting for a chance to compete.  In order to finish their education at this medical school, they borrow from the State of Illinois government, which gives them a loan for their medical education. For every year that they are given a loan, they pledge to serve 1 year as medical doctors in an underserved area of our It is a win-win situation.  He is now doing amazing research. He is researching how bladder viruses shape bacteria populations and the potential implications for urinary infections and disease.  He is a member of the pathology medical group. He is a Spanish interpreter at the local clinic, and a mentor to other medical students.  I asked Cesar: What drew you to medicine? Here is what he said:       When I was very young, my father became ill and then was      bedridden for months. He was the primary breadwinner and I      saw him as our protector. Watching him immobilized and      screaming in pain had a huge impact on me. Years later we      would find out that my father suffered from diabetic myopathy      and neuropathy. Learning that both his illness and our      family's suffering could have been prevented by education and      relatively inexpensive medication was heartbreaking. But at      the same time, it made me realize the potential of medicine.  What is Cesar's dream for the future? To become a practicing physician and a scientist and to develop new and improved clinical diagnostic tools so that doctors can diagnose and treat diseases better.  Close to 70 Dreamers are enrolled in medical schools around the United Why is DACA important to him? Any student like him who is in a medical school today and wants to go on to a residency has to be able to work. Residents work long hours in hospitals while they are learning. If he didn't have DACA, he wouldn't have legal permission or legal authority to work in this country. No medical school will accept him for a residency unless he has that DACA protection.  Why in the world would we let this young man's vigorous pursuit of education and brilliance be wasted? We need him. We need him in We need him in We need him in America--and many others just like him.  The Association of American Medical Colleges reports that the Nation's doctor shortage will rise to 40,000 and even to 105,000 by the year 2030. Both the AMA and the Association of American Medical Colleges have warned that ending DACA will hurt when it comes to this physician shortage. They want Congress to do something.  Listen to what the AMA says:       Estimates have shown that the DACA initiative could help      introduce 5,400 previously ineligible physicians into the      U.healthcare system in the coming decades to help address      [physician] shortages and ensure patient access to care. . .      . Removing those with DACA status will create care shortages      for rural and underserved areas. . . . Without these      physicians, the AMA is concerned that the quality of care      provided in these communities will be negatively impacted.  I know the Presiding Officer is from the State of North In my State of Illinois, we have some great big cities, and we have some great small towns. Many of the best small towns and rural areas from my end of the State are desperate to make sure they have good doctors at their local hospitals and people available in the community.  We can't afford to lose We can't afford to lose the thousands of others the AMA tells us are poised to become doctors and to fill our need across This aging population of our country is going to need doctors and nurses and physical therapists more than ever. If these young people can answer that call, they will not only be serving our Nation, but they will be serving their own goals to be part of our Nation's future.  Now it is up to us. We are supposed to leave here in a matter of days. That means those of us who are serious about this issue have to do something meaningful and important, and do it quickly.  I yield the floor.

2034,topic-id,2832,"Mr.President, I want to thank the Democratic leader. His strong support of the Dream Act encourages me but, more importantly, gives hope to the Dreamers across America: young men and women, just like the one he described, who are living in fear, fear that their time in America is coming to an end.  This is the only country they have ever known. They have stood in classroom after classroom and pledged allegiance to the American flag, the only flag they have ever known. They sing the national anthem. They believe they are part of America, but as Senator Schumer has reminded us, they are missing the paperwork. Their parents brought them here as infants, toddlers, children and never filed the paperwork, never made them legal, and here they are in this country, searching for an answer, searching for some hope.  My best basic question to the U.Senate and to my colleagues is: Why do we make this so hard? Why is this so difficult? Don't we all fundamentally agree on the premise that no young person should be held responsible for the actions or decisions of their parents? That is what is happening here. These young people didn't make the key decisions in their lives; their parents did.  Let me quickly add, because many of the Dreamers say: Senator Durbin, understand that our parents were doing everything they could to help us. I couldn't agree more. From a moral viewpoint, their parents were determined to help their children and were prepared to incur great risk, even legal risk, to do it. I understand that. I would do the same thing, and I am not being critical or negative. But the simple fact and reality is that these young people, because they don't have the paperwork, don't have a future in  The circumstances they face are bleak. Imagine, if you will, the challenge of college, the challenge of going from high school on to an education at a university, with no help whatsoever from the Federal You don't qualify for a penny in Pell grants; you don't qualify for any help when it comes to government loans. Think about the challenge of college and higher education without that help, without the fundamental assistance that millions of young Americans count on. Dreamers get no help--none. They have to fight their way forward on their own, and they do it in remarkable and heroic ways.  Over the last break, I was down at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale--deep southern Illinois, 300 miles or more away from the city of Chicago--and I sat down with a group of these Dreamers who were at the university. One young woman had worked so hard to get through community college and now through the university at Carbondale and still had two semesters left before graduation. She was telling me about her struggles--taking time off to work a job, save the money, go back to school, and here she was where she could see the finish line. As she sat there and described it to me, she stopped and broke down in tears. She said to me: Why am I doing this? Because of the announcement by President Trump, I don't have any future in this country. After all these years and all this effort, I really don't have a future here.  I don't believe that, and I begged her not to believe it either. She has a future, an important future in the United States and in the State of She has proved through her determination and hard work that she is an extraordinary young woman. She is going to get that bachelor's degree, and I pray that we in the Senate and the House--with the President--will give her a chance to be part of  President Obama did. He created I had introduced the DREAM Act years and years ago--16 years ago--when President Obama was my colleague in the Senate from He was the cosponsor. I joined with Senator Lugar, a Republican Senator from Indiana, writing to President Obama, saying: Find a way, if you can. Find a way to protect these Dreamers from deportation until we pass a law that needs to be passed. And he did it. He created the DACA Program, where young people could come forward, pay the fine and fee of almost $500 or $600, submit themselves to a criminal background check to make sure there were no problems in their background, show proof that they had graduated from high school, and then--only then--would they be allowed to stay in the United States for 2 years and not be deported and legally be allowed to work.  Well, President Obama created by executive order the DACA At the end of the day, 780,000 of these young people stepped forward. It was a leap of faith on their part. Each and every one of them had been raised in America by their parents and carefully schooled in this belief: Don't raise your head. Don't let this government see us. As long as we can live in the shadows, as long as we are not confronted with the legal system, we have a chance to stay. They lived with that looming over their heads every single day. Then, when President Obama said to them: Come forward, tell us who you are, where you live; tell us about your family; and we will give you a chance to stay here legally under this Executive order, they did it. They trusted in their leaders. They trusted in their government. They were prepared to make that leap of faith, at great risk, on the chance that this might be the ticket they were looking for to a life in America, to be part of America's dream and America's future.  Then, on September 5, President Trump came forward and announced that he would abolish this program created by President Obama and that it would end on March 5, 2018. He established a standard and said: We will allow those who have to renew during this period of time--their 2-year DACA protection had expired, and they would have to renew--until November 5 to file and to qualify for a renewal period. He picked November 5. For many of them, it was a surprise and a challenge to come up with the filing fee and to get the papers in on time so that their protection would continue until March 5, 2018, or beyond. Some of them did everything they could think of. Some went to attorneys, for example, to make sure they got this renewal of DACA completed successfully and accurately.  Now we have learned that something terrible happened in the meantime. They relied on the Federal Government--particularly, they relied on our Postal Service--to mail in their applications for renewal. Who would have argued that that was not a responsible thing to do? I can tell my colleagues that practicing attorneys across the United States use our Postal Service regularly.  One attorney sent the renewal to Washington by certified mail so that there would be proof that it was mailed. He mailed it on October 21. The problem was that the Postal Service lost the application. It didn't arrive until a day later, a day past the deadline established by the  That young person has lost the right to renew unless the Department of Homeland Security comes up with a new ruling on the subject. That is the complexity of the life of these young people who are simply asking for a chance to be part of America's future. That is what that young applicant faced. That is what hundreds of others faced. We believe that some 8,000 were not able to renew in time and lost their protected status.  I can't tell you what their future is, but I pray that the Senate, before we leave this year, will decide the right thing for their future.  I have come to the floor over 100 times to tell the personal stories of these young people who are asking for a chance to have the Dream Act become the law of the land. Some Republican Senators have joined me in this effort. Notably, Lindsey Graham, the Republican Senator from South Carolina, has been a cosponsor. Three other Republican Senators have joined in sponsoring the Dream Act, and more are interested in helping. The conversations continue on the floor and give me some hope that, at the end of the day, we will do the right thing, before the end of this year.  Let me add, too, that having served in the Senate--it has been my honor to be here for some years--I know the calendar determines your fate many times in the The calendar we face could determine the fate of these Dreamers.[[Page S7273]]  Here is what it boils down to. If we don't renew the Dream Act before the end of this year, then it has to be done in January or January and February are well known to be months of little activity in the Senate and in the So if we wait until then, it is not likely it is going to happen. That is why I am pleading with my colleagues and the leadership of the Senate: We can't go home for the holidays until we do this. We can't talk about dreaming of a white Christmas until we face the Dreamers and the bleak Christmas they face if we fail to act. I am begging my colleagues on both sides to roll up their sleeves and join me, sit at the table, and let's get this job done.  There are specific reasons why we should, and I want to tell one of those stories today, as I have done more than 100 times in the past.  This young lady's name is Priscilla Priscilla was 5 years old when her family brought her to the United States from She grew up in Brownsville, She was a great student. In high school she joined a medical magnet program and graduated in the top 10 percent of her class.  Priscilla was a member of the Health Occupations Students of America, where she participated in regional and State competitions in biomedical debate and medical reading. This experience sparked her love for science.  Priscilla went off to the University of Texas at She graduated with honors in the winter of 2012 with a bachelor's degree in biological sciences. Remember, as a Dreamer, she didn't qualify for any Federal assistance going to school. She had to work at jobs and borrow money from others to finish her education.  After graduation, Priscilla was accepted into Teach for America, a national nonprofit organization that places talented college graduates in urban and rural schools where there are special challenges and shortages of teachers. It is interesting, isn't it, that this young woman who was brought here at the age of 5 not only worked so hard for her own education but was then willing to give 2 years of her life in the schools of America to help less fortunate students. Do you think you have an insight into who she is and what her values are?  Priscilla is not alone. Twenty thousand DACA Dreamers are currently teaching across the United States of America, including 190 in the Teach for America  Priscilla now teaches biological and medical microbiology at Mercedes High School in Mercedes, She is the head of the Science She oversees a team of nine science teachers. She teaches students of all grade levels and coaches the school's debate team. The team won the district championship last year and participated in the State championship.  In 2013, a tragedy struck Priscilla's family. Her mother died unexpectedly. Currently, Priscilla is caring for her three younger siblings, all of whom were born in the United States and are U.citizens. In fact, almost 75 percent of Dreamers have a U.citizen spouse, child, or sibling.  Priscilla wrote me a letter, which I will read into the Congressional Record:       Science and learning are my biggest passions and I want to      keep pushing myself forward so that I can be better equipped      to serve my community and my students. I want to inspire and      encourage all students to pursue careers in science. I want      to be a role model and mentor to students by succeeding in a      science career myself. If I can do it, so can they!  But without DACA, and without the Dream Act, Priscilla and 20,000 other teachers just like her will lose their jobs in I am not exaggerating. DACA gives Priscilla the legal right to work in If she loses that DACA protection on the March 5 deadline, or whenever her renewal comes up, at that point she can no longer work in the United  This is not an isolated case. I have told the story many times about 28 students at the Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine in They are all protected by They came to that medical school in open competition--no quotas, no special slots. They are the best and brightest. They came from all over the United States because Loyola University--thank goodness--decided they deserved a chance. Young people like them all across America who had given up on a medical education because they were undocumented finally had their chance under Twenty-eight of them now are dedicated to becoming doctors.  They can't borrow money from our Federal Government, as I mentioned before. The State of Illinois, under both a Democratic and Republican Governor, have created loan programs for them in medical school with one condition: For every year the State of Illinois helps to pay for their medical education, they have to pledge 1 year when they finish their medical degrees in service to our State, in areas where we have shortages of doctors--medically underserved areas.  So 28 of them now have their fate hanging in the balance, depending on the fate of the Dream Why? Because to become a doctor, you need a residency. A residency is a job. A residency means legally working. If these young people lose the DACA and Dreamer protection, they have to drop out of medical school. They cannot continue their residency and pursue a specialty that they have had their heart set on.  That is the reality of our failure to act. That is the reality of losing Priscilla Aguilar as an inspiring science teacher in Texas, of losing 28 doctors who are on their way to graduation at Loyola University, and of literally thousands of others who could make America a better, more prosperous, and a more just  Why do we make this so hard? Why do we make it so difficult for these young people? They have overcome the odds. They have shown their determination. They have shown their love for this country. Many of these DACA Dreamers are begging to serve in our military, to risk their lives for Yet we have failed to act. The President draws a deadline and says: After this point, there will be no more protection for these young people. That isn't what America stands for. That does not reflect our values.  I stand here today honored to be the son of an immigrant to this country. My mother was brought here at the age of 2 from That immigrant family fought hard when they arrived, as most immigrant families do. By fate, my mother became a naturalized citizen and her son became a U.That is my story. That is my family's story, but it is America's story. It is a story that has been repeated millions of times over and over. People come here begging for a chance--a chance for a better life, a chance to make this a better nation.  These young people and their parents, I might add, deserve that kind of consideration. What we are considering today doesn't affect their parents and the Dream Act, but certainly we should give these young people a chance. I think their parents deserve it, too, but that is a debate for another day, perhaps. We will see.  In the meantime, I beg my colleagues to join us. Let's do something right this year, before the end of the year, that reflects our values of who we are. Let's acknowledge the obvious. Justice demands us to step up and stand behind these  The moment is about to arrive. Senator Lindsey Graham, my Republican cosponsor of the bill, said that a moment of reckoning is coming. He is right. It is a moment of reckoning as to who we are in the Senate and in the Congress and in the White It is a reflection on our view of America as a nation--a nation of immigrants that has embraced diversity and become all the stronger because of it.

2122,topic-id,1267,"Mr.President, in a few days, Americans will celebrate Thanksgiving, a holiday that is filled with meaning and memories and, if we are lucky, sumptuous meals shared with family and friends.  Thanksgiving began as America's national harvest festival, a day to give thanks for our rich and fertile land and the great bounty of food it produces.  On this long Thanksgiving weekend, I plan to spend a few hours reading the latest book from one of my favorite friends whose works capture in loving detail life on her family's Wisconsin dairy farm, but even more, the rock-solid values that sustained her family and her life.  The book is called ``The Round Barn: Biography of an American Farm.'' As one reviewer wrote, reading it ``is like sitting on the porch of an early 20th century dairy farm and watching an era in American history pass right before your eyes.''  The Round Barn books--there are three of them now--are the creations of Jackie Dougan Jackson, a novelist, poet, professor, mentor to generations of writers, and one of the best-loved residents in my hometown of Springfield,  She lives in a big, old home in Springfield which, legend has it, was once visited by another master storyteller, Abraham  Loretta and I are lucky to count Jackie as a dear friend of many years. She is a kind, creative soul who never fails to reach out to help others. At the age of 89, she is still filled with energy, empathy and curiosity about nearly everything.  The Round Barn books keep a promise that Jackie made to her grandfather W.Dougan when she was just 15 years old. She vowed then that one day she would write a history of the dairy farm that W.had founded in 1906, the farm on which three generations of Jackie's family lived and worked.  Jackie Jackson throws open the Round Barn doors at the Dougan family farm to tell us an American story. She gives us a rich history of farm life at the mercy of the forces of science and the market but grounded in rock-solid Midwestern values.  Some of those values were painted onto the silo of the family's round barn. W.titled the list ``Aims for the Farm.'' They were: ``#1. Good Crops; #2. Proper Storage; #3. Profitable Live Stock; #4. A Stable Market''--and most important of all--``#5. Life as Well as a Living.''  W.Dougan was a deeply spiritual man and a hard worker. He struggled for years to put himself through college and became a Methodist minister, but encroaching deafness forced him to give up the religious life he loved.  In 1906, he bought a dairy farm near Beloit,  The Round Barn was built in 1911. W.chose the unusual shape because he believed that a barn braced on a central concrete pillar was cheaper to build, more efficient for a dairy operation, and less likely to blow away in a tornado. The Round Barn quickly became a county landmark.  W.marketed himself as ``the Babies Milk Man,'' and he succeeded through hard work, dedication to his customers and community, and an unusual talent for spotting and adopting cutting-edge advances in agriculture. In 1925, he was named a ``Master Farmer'' by a prestigious agricultural organization, one of only 23 Midwestern farmers so honored.  Even so, the Great Depression, which destroyed so many family farms and businesses, nearly wiped out the Dougan Guernsey Dairy In 1930, bankruptcy papers were drawn up but never filed.  Jackie was born in 1928, the year before the Great Depression, one of four children of W.J.'s son Ronald and Ronald's wife,  Jackie was a natural born writer, a prodigy. When she was 8 she wrote a short story that took first prize in a Beloit citywide contest. Her first novel was serialized in the Galesburg Post in Illinois when she was 10.  She majored in classics at Beloit College, married, and then moved with her new husband to Ann Arbor, where they both earned master's degrees.  The couple had four daughters. Jackie would go on to earn a doctorate in Latin from the University of  She was teaching writing at Kent State University in Ohio in 1967 when her father suffered a heart attack. Jackie went home and sat at his hospital bedside for weeks as he recounted stories of life on the family farm.  Back in Ohio after her father's recovery, Jackie became aware of a deep longing within her to reconnect with her rural beginnings. As she described it in one of her Round Barn books:       There has been another clock within her. She didn't set it      nor place it there. It's been geared not to hours but to      cycles; the daily precession of milking and bottling, feeding      and cleaning the yearly procession of planting, cultivating,      harvesting. It's been set to sun, moon, health, cold, wet      dry. But now if there's a heavy spring freeze, she puts on a      coat without sensing the loss of crisp that might result from      too-late planting. If the sky lowers black, she takes an      umbrella without feeling the sway of the hay wagon racing to      reach the barn before the cloudburst. Her dailiness is not      this class, that lecture, the next trip to the stacks. . . .      It was the ground she'd stood on, the air she'd breathed. She      had no special moment, no epiphany to explain the realization      of loss that came over her. She only knows that something      elemental is gone and has been gone for some time. That it's      probably irretrievable, unless she changes the path she's      treading.  So that is what she did. Jackie Jackson changed her life's path. She moved to Springfield, IL, and accepted a position teaching literature and writing at an innovative university that was just opening, Sangaman State University, now the University of Illinois at  For years, she had been collecting stories and recollections about the Round Barn, her family, the dairy's customers, and the townspeople. Her trove of tales included her own notebooks, stretching back to when she was[[Page S7293]]8, the stories her father had told her from his hospital bed, letters and notes left by her grandfather, and much more.  She became a sort of detective, finding more letters tucked into framed pictures, stuck to the attic floor in the old family home all sorts of unexpected places. Each letter or scrap of paper became a piece of the family puzzle.  In 1976, she began to fashion the notes and letters into the first Round Barn book. The book published this month, ``The Round Barn: Biography of an American Farm' is the fulfillment of her promise to her grandfather, her magnum opus, a detailed and loving portrait of a way of life that no longer exists.  The Dougan Guernsey Dairy Farm ceased operating in 1967, just as agribusiness and large corporate farms were beginning to redefine American farming.  In 1979, the Round Barn was added to the National Registry of Historic  By 2012, the dilapidated old structure had become a safety hazard, and it was torn down, but thanks to Jackie Jackson's beautifully detailed biography of her family's farm and the people who lived and worked there, generations from now readers will still be able to visit the magical world of the Round  As this Thanksgiving Day, this American harvest festival, approaches, I am thankful for the Round Barn books that capture a bygone day of American farming like holograms, and Loretta and I are grateful to our friend Jackie for giving the world such a gift.

698,topic-id,791,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I come to this conversation based on people I know who live in manufactured housing. A lot of folks call it mobile homes or trailer parks. We call it manufactured housing. But I have walked those places, sat in those rooms, and just been with my neighbors, friends, and constituents who live in manufactured housing. I appreciate them tremendously. They are wonderful folks. The folks I know are just part of those 17 million people who live in manufactured housing.  If Congress got rid of manufactured housing, the national homeownership rate would fall about 6 percent. So manufactured housing, no doubt, is important and is an affordable alternative for many people.  But that doesn't mean the lender can rip them off. That doesn't mean the lender can pick their pockets, and that doesn't mean that the lender can let some big monopoly reach in the borrower's pockets and take their money away from them.  Just because the loan payment on manufactured housing might be lower than rent doesn't mean they get to up the skim. They have still got to be fair to people.  Look, for folks who are watching this debate, it is important to understand what we are really talking about. I am going to boil it down as best I can. We are saying: If you live in manufactured housing and if the loan is going to be extra high in the interest rate, if the interest rate is 6\1/2\ or 8\1/2\ above the annual percentage rate, which could bring you as high as the ranking member said, 18 percent, then certain things kick in for you.  If they are going to charge borrowers that kind of interest rate, the law says we are going to look out for them by saying that the lender has to explain the consequences of default--it will ruin the borrower's credit--that the lender has to disclose the loan terms in the monthly payments, that the lender has to ensure that the borrower receives homeownership counseling. And this is really important: under another regulation, the lender is forbidden from being the dealer and steering that person to a lender. In the case of Clayton Homes, they are both.  They will sell the borrower the unit and give them the loan. They will say: Hey, do you know what? We are going to sell you a nice new unit here. Don't worry about borrowing or where to look for a loan. We got you covered. We are in that business.  They are a monopoly. What is happening here, Mr.Speaker, is that all those protections that a high-cost-loan borrower is about to face this legislation takes away. That is all we are talking about here. We are saying that if a borrower is going to get a high-cost loan, then he should get certain protections. The borrower should get information and counseling. People should tell the borrower what is going to happen if he defaults.  They are saying: Hey, man, that is getting in the way of my money. We don't want you telling them what their rights are because that is interfering with the millions and millions that we are going to get off of them. A dumb consumer works out for our monopoly just fine, a smart one not so much.  That is what this is all about.  Now, I want to just say--giving my friends on the other side of the aisle the best of intentions--that we do have a philosophical debate here. We believe that the problem--if there is one--of people lending in this market is not that there are consumer protections, but it is that there is a huge monopoly.  If the Congress wants to fix the problem of manufactured housing lending, then break up that monopoly. If the Congress wants to get more entrants into the market and get some downward competition in price, then break up the monopoly.                              {time}  0945  But if the Congress just tells the monopoly you can charge these people more now, you don't have to give them the protections, you don't have to inform them, you can steer them, and you have got to get a really high-cost loan before they get any protections, then all that is going to do is benefit the firm that is already occupying this market space.  The firm that already sells the unit and gives the loans, the one that has all the advertising set up, the one that has all the sales force set up, the one that has all the infrastructure already set up, the monopolists will be the ones who will benefit from this legislation.

1729,topic-id,752,"Mr.Speaker, one of the things that I am most proud of is being from What a beautiful State that we have. People joke about how cold it is in the wintertime, but let me tell you, Minnesota is awesome all year round.  One of the things that we are so proud of is the Boundary Mr.Speaker, look at this picture. This is no glossed-up photo. This is what it looks like. It is awesome.  Back before I was in Congress, I was able to bring young people to the Boundary Waters who were court-involved. Mr.Speaker, one day a judge asked me: Hey, Ellison, come up here. You want to take some kids to the Boundary Waters?  I said: I kept doing it for 5 years straight because I loved the place.  Yet this bill will perhaps damage all that, all that beauty, that gem of our State, which not only is a beautiful place that needs to be preserved for people, but also is a job-generator. A lot of people earn good livings because of the Boundary Waters, and if we just do this, pass this bill, what it will do is jeopardize their livelihood and our crown jewel of our  This bill will grant a mining company the right to build sulfide-ore copper mines along rivers and lakes that flow directly into the Boundary Sulfide-ore copper mining has never been done without polluting water, and thousands of communities and wildlife will be at risk.  When you mine sulfide ore, water and air interact to create sulfuric acid. One leak or spill would contaminate substantial portions of the Boundary Waters, decimating wildlife and habitat, and destroying the livelihoods of so many Minnesota workers.  The Boundary Waters, the waters of the Boundary Waters, are especially vulnerable to acid mine drainage because they lack a buffering capacity.  This bill is a bad idea, and I urge Members to vote ``no.'' This bill will undermine core environmental laws, including the Antiquities Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, and the National Environmental Policy  The Antiquities Act is a bipartisan conservation law to protect irreplaceable Federal lands, including in the Grand Canyon, Acadia Forest, Zion, Muir Woods in California, and the Olympic National If they undermine the Antiquities Act, what else is in danger? Well, I would say every national treasure of the United  This attack on the Antiquities Act is an attack against our national parks and monuments, making this not only a Minnesota issue, but a national issue.  This bill would permanently lock in all mineral leases on Minnesota's national forests by overriding two laws on mineral leasing in Minnesota's national forests that require Forest Service consent to any mining. They don't want to go around the regular process. They want to use Congress to short-circuit that process.  If you have never been to the Boundary Waters, as I said, I urge you to go there. If you vote ``no'' on this bill, you will not just be protecting the Boundary Waters for yourself and people around all over the United States, you will be protecting it for your grandchildren.  Much is said here about children and grandchildren. Think about the Boundary Waters when you think about the legacy that we are leaving our grandchildren and how H.3905 would destroy and jeopardize that legacy.  Economic analysis by Key-Log Economics shows that sulfide-ore mining on the Superior National Forest lands and the watershed of the Boundary Waters could lead to a loss of 5,000 jobs in tourism, 5,000 to 20,000 jobs in the rest of the economy.                              {time}  1600  As people tout this bill as a job creator, it is a job destroyer. I would tell you that, if you are an outfitter or you are a wilderness guide or you are a forest ranger, your job is just as important as anybody else's. What this bill is saying is, no, your job is no good. Nobody cares about it. Only the mine companies' interests are important.  We could stand to lose $1.6 billion in annual income and $500 million in reduction in private property values because of this piece of legislation.  We shouldn't have to choose between a robust economy and a clean environment. We can and must have both. Saying ``no'' to this piece of legislation gives us a chance at both. Voting for it makes us pick one over the other, and not just economic interests, but certain interests--not everyone's.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

The majority of these homes are in rural In fact, more than 6 out of 10 manufactured homes are located in rural areas. In my home State of Minnesota, manufactured homes are the State's largest source of affordable homeownership.  Unfortunately, a provision in Dodd-Frank has put homeownership out of reach for these Specifically, Dodd-Frank and the CFPB modified the criteria and expanded the types of loans from lenders to manufactured home buyers, which are considered to be ``high cost.''  As a direct result, lenders are struggling to make these loans because of a high legal risk associated with this ``high cost'' definition, ultimately harming low-income buyers in The consumers are being harmed in Minnesota and around the country.  This is why Republicans and Democrats have come together in support of H.1699, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act, authored by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.Barr), our friend, to help millions of Americans become homeowners.  This legislation provides clarity and certainty regarding the changes made by Dodd-Frank and the H.1699 will ensure that home buyers in rural and low-income areas are able to afford manufactured housing and are not unfairly targeted by the very agency that was created to protect them.  Mr.Speaker, when it comes to achieving the American Dream, government should not be standing in the way. As Members of Congress, it is our duty to stand up for and against this continued overreach, support the American Dream, and vote ``yes'' for H.1699.

The MINER Act will ensure that the people of Minnesota have the opportunity for jobs and economic prosperity that would come if the deposit can ever be mined in an environmentally safe and responsible manner.  The MINER Act will renew the Federal Government's commitment and promise to the citizens of When the Superior National Forest was created in 1909 and, later, when the Boundary Waters Canoe Area was established in 1978, there was an express agreement between the Federal Government and the State of Minnesota that mining and logging could continue in the Superior National In fact, according to the most recent Superior National Forest land use management plan, mining and logging are considered a desired condition in the forest.  This is about more than just the 10,000-plus jobs which are now at risk because of the lameduck actions of the Obama administration. This is about billions of dollars in revenue for Minnesota's economy and billions more in potential education funding for Minnesota's schools that are now on the line. This is about strategically important metals and minerals which are used by Americans every day. This is about undoing a last-ditch effort to further a political agenda at the expense of the livelihoods that Minnesotans have relied on for generations.  The MINER Act, again, is about protecting Minnesota's right to explore and, if environmentally appropriate, mine valuable and important precious metals, precious metals that are not only necessary to our everyday technology, but which are critically important to our Nation's national defense.  There are some who would like to deny Minnesota the right to explore and potentially mine these precious metals. They argue that any mining activity could negatively impact our beloved Boundary Waters Canoe This concern, however, ignores the fact that, if a mine is ever proposed, and to date there has been no mine proposed, if one is ever proposed in the Superior National Forest, it would have to satisfy all current local, State, and Federal environmental review and permitting requirements before it could ever be approved to proceed.  We can and we will protect the Boundary I have no doubt that we can find a way to preserve Minnesota's pristine landscape without permanently destroying any future job creation or economic development in By passing the MINER Act, we protect thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue and education funding while leaving an extensive process intact to protect and preserve the environment and our  In conclusion, I encourage all my colleagues to support the MINER Act because we know someday someone might find a way to mine these important precious metals in a safe and environmentally responsible way, and if that happens, Minnesota deserves the opportunity and the jobs and economic prosperity that will ensue.[[Page H9501]]    ",CREC-2017-11-29-pt1-PgH9498.txt,2253,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,29,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MINER Act will ensure that the people of Minnesota will have the opportunity for jobs and economic prosperity that would come if the deposit can ever be mined in an environmentally safe and responsible manner.  The MINER Act will renew the Federal Government's commitment and promise to the citizens of When the Superior National Forest was created in 1909, and later when the Boundary Waters Canoe Area was established in 1978, there was an express agreement between the Federal Government and the State of Minnesota that mining and logging could continue in the Superior National                              {time}  1330  In fact, according to the most recent Superior National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, mining and logging are considered desirable conditions in the forest.  This is about more than 10,000 jobs, which are now at risk because of the lameduck actions of the Obama administration. This is about billions of dollars in revenue for Minnesota's economy and billions more in potential education funding for Minnesota's schools that are now on the line.  This is also about strategically important metals and minerals, which are used by Americans every day. The MINER Act, again, is about protecting Minnesota's right to explore and, if environmentally appropriate, to mine valuable precious metals--precious metals that are not only necessary to our everyday technology, but which are critically important to our Nation's national defense.  There are some who would like to deny Minnesota the right to explore and potentially mine these precious metals. They argue that any mining activity could negatively impact our beloved Boundary Waters Canoe Area This concern, however, ignores the fact that if a mine is ever proposed--and one has not, but if one is ever proposed--in the Superior National Forest, it would have to satisfy all current local, State, and Federal environmental review and permitting requirements before it could ever be approved to proceed.  We can and we will protect the Boundary I have no doubt we could find a way to preserve Minnesota's pristine landscape without permanently destroying any future job creation or economic development in  By passing the MINER Act today, we protect thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue and education funding while leaving an extensive process intact to protect and preserve the environment and our  In conclusion, I encourage all of my colleagues to support the MINER Act, because we know that someday someone might find a way to mine these important precious metals in a safe and environmentally responsible way. And if that happens, Minnesota deserves the opportunity and the jobs and economic prosperity that will ensue.  Mr.Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the underlying bill.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton in opposition to H.3905.                                               State of Minnesota,                               Office of Governor Mark Dayton,                                Saint Paul, MN, November 27, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan: I write in strong opposition to HR3905,      which I understand has passed out of Committee and is being      reviewed by House Majority Leadership for a floor vote. I      implore you not to schedule a vote on this bill without a      full vetting of the serious risks to the Boundary Waters      Canoe Area Wilderness from adjacent copper-nickel mining, the      status of the two-year federal study currently underway, and      the wishes of the majority of Minnesotans, who oppose copper-     nickel mining in the immediate vicinity of the Boundary            HR3905 is a bill, ``To require congressional approval of      any mineral withdrawal or monument designation involving the      National Forest System lands in the State of Minnesota, to      provide for the renewal of certain mineral leases in such      lands, and for other purposes.'' HR3905 was introduced in      response to the desires of a foreign mining company to use      Congress to circumvent the deliberations of the U.     Departments of Interior and Agriculture and their agencies,      the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.Forest      Service (USFS), to determine whether copper-nickel mining can      be conducted safely in this ecologically sensitive part of            The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BCWAW) is      America's most popular national Wilderness Area, drawing      visitors from all over the world to Northeastern Minnesota to      fish, hunt, and experience its interconnected pristine lakes,      rivers and streams. Additionally, the BWCAW contributes      enormously to Minnesota's social and economic well-being.       In January, 2017, the BLM and the USFS began a      comprehensive two-year study to determine whether copper-     nickel mining, with its toxic by-product, sulfide ore, is      appropriate within the watershed and immediate vicinity of      the Specifically, this environmental review will      determine whether the Superior National Forest lands next to      the BWCAW should be removed from the federal mining program      to protect the Wilderness from pollution and other      environmental degradation caused by the resulting sulfide      ore. The study considers a wide variety of factors, including      scientific evidence, public input, economic considerations,      ecological characteristics, and recreational value, among      others.       I respectfully ask that you allow the completion of this      important review process. Over 126,000 Americans have      submitted public comments as part of it. Many attended three      public meetings conducted earlier this year by the BLM and      Moving HR3905 forward at this time would disregard the      input of all Americans, who have participated in the process,      as well as the views of the 79 percent of Minnesotans, who      favor the two-year pause and environmental review of      potential impacts to the       The BWCAW is crucially important to our state, and I      believe strongly that future federal and state decisions      about its future should be made only after the most careful      and objective scientific review. I urge you to reject the      attempts by a foreign mining corporation to short-circuit the      review process underway, and to affirm the importance of a      careful, objective analysis under the existing federal legal      framework.       Continuing this review process is the best way to allow for      well-informed federal and state decisions, which will affect      many future generations of Industry should not      dictate the stewardship of taxpayer-owned public lands, nor      use Congress to short-circuit sound decision-making--     especially regarding pristine Wilderness Areas like the                Sincerely,                                                      Mark Dayton,                                                          Mr.Mr.Speaker, I also include in the Record a letter from the Sportsmen for the Boundary Waters in opposition to the bill; a letter from the National Parks Conservation Association; and a letter from the Girl Scouts of Minnesota and Wisconsin Lakes and Pines in opposition to this bill.                            Sportsmen for the Boundary Waters,                                       Ely, MN, November 29, 2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members      and supporters, we urge[[Page H9485]]     you to OPPOSE H.3905, the so-called ``Minnesota's Economic      Rights in the Superior National Forest Act'' when it is      considered on the House floor.       Simply put, H.3905 is a bill to allow sulfide-ore mining      at the edge of the Boundary Water Canoe Area Wilderness      (BWCAW), directly threatening one of America's most      accessible and most-visited wilderness areas. At 1.1 million      acres in size, the BWCAW is the largest wilderness east of      the Rockies and north of the This interconnected      system of lakes, rivers, and streams provides unparalleled      opportunities for solitude, recreation, hunting and fishing.      The connections between Northern Minnesota's national      forests, Boundary Water Canoe Area Wilderness, Voyageurs      National Park, and Quetico Provincial Park makes this entire      trans boundary area extremely susceptible to the threat of      pollution from sulfide-ore mining, one of the most toxic      industries in America, according to the       H.3905 would require congressional approval of any      mineral withdrawal or monument designation involving National      Forest System lands in the State of Minnesota and would      provide for the perpetual renewal of federal mineral leases      in Minnesota, including two that were denied by the Forest      Service and the Bureau of Land The bill      undermines the Antiquities Act, National Environmental Policy      Act, Federal Land Policy and Management Act, Boundary Waters      Wilderness Act, and other laws regulating mineral leasing in      Minnesota's national forests.       Contrary to the bill's title, H.3905 would do more harm      than good for the economy of Northern Economic      analysis by Key-Log Economics LLC shows that sulfide-ore      mining on Superior National Forest lands in the watershed of      the Boundary Waters could lead to the loss of nearly 5,000      jobs in tourism, 5,000 to 22,000 jobs in the rest of the      economy, a $1.6 billion loss in annual income, and a $500      million reduction in private property values.       Specifically, we urge opposition to this bill because it      would:       Renew two expired and undeveloped mineral leases on      Superior National Forest lands next to the Boundary Waters      and along lakes and rivers that flow directly into the      Wilderness, advancing a foreign mining company's interests at      the expense of beloved American public lands.       Void the December 2016 record of decision by the Forest      Service withholding its consent to two mineral lease renewal      requests in the Superior National Forest due to the      unacceptable risks to this watershed, which according to the      Forest Service holds 20 percent of the National Forest      System's fresh water supply.       Undermine the National Environmental Policy Act by limiting      review of these two mineral leases to a 30-day environmental      assessment. Contrary to the bill language, there is no      `pending EA.' However, this section would override the      ongoing two-year Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)      initiated by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management      to carefully consider the potential impacts of sulfide-ore      mining on the Boundary Waters watershed. The ongoing EIS is      strongly supported by Minnesota's Governor Dayton and by the      citizens of More than 79% of Minnesota voters      support the study, while more than 126,000 citizens submitted      comments during the scoping phase.       Amend the 1906 Antiquities Act by mandating Congressional      approval for any national monument designations in      Minnesota's national forests. The Antiquities Act is a      bipartisan conservation law, which has been used by      Presidents of both parties, to protect irreplaceable federal      lands from potential threats. Monument designation under the      Antiquities Act have provided protections for areas including      the Grand Canyon, Acadia, Zion, Muir Woods, and Olympic      National Quite simply, this attack on the Antiquities      Act is an attack against our national parks and monuments.       Amend the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act      (FLPMA) by mandating Congressional approval for mineral      withdrawals in Minnesota's national forests. Additionally,      FLPMA intentionally left intact the presidential power to      protect public lands as monuments.       Bar the Forest Service from complying with its legal      obligations under the 1978 Boundary Waters Wilderness In      this Act Congress requires the Forest Service to maintain the      high-water quality of the Boundary Waters and a Mining      Protection Area within the Superior National The      Forest Service concluded that sulfide-ore mining near the      Boundary Waters would be ``contrary to Congress'      determination that it is necessary to `protect the special      qualities of the [BWCAW] as a natural forest-lakeland      wilderness ecosystem of major esthetic, scientific,      recreational and educational value to the Nation.' ''       Make all mineral leases on Minnesota's national forests      essentially perpetual. The `perpetual' nature of these leases      is material change in long-standing mineral leasing law and      policy. The bill would also override the two laws (1946 and      1950) on mineral leasing in Minnesota's national forests that      require Forest Service consent to any mining.       Ignore the request of the International Joint Commission      that environmental review of impacts on trans boundary water      quality and cumulative effects be studied and the requests of      four tribal entities (the area is Ceded Territory).       Thank you for considering our concerns. In order to      adequately protect iconic places like the Boundary Waters,      Voyageurs National Park, and all of Minnesota's public lands,      and bedrock environmental laws like the Antiquities Act and      the National Environmental Policy Act, we urge you to OPPOSE      H.3905.

Oppose H.3905: Minnesota's Economic Rights in the Superior          National Forest       Dear Representative: Since 1919, the National Parks      Conservation Association (NPCA) has been the leading voice of      the American people in protecting and enhancing our National      Park On behalf of our more than 1.3 million members      and supporters nationwide, I urge you to oppose H.3905:      Minnesota's Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest      Act when it is reviewed at a markup by the Natural Resources      Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday, November 7th and 8th.       NPCA strongly opposes this legislation as it undermines two      decisions made by the U.Forest Service and the Bureau of      Land Management (BLM) regarding harmful sulfide-ore copper      mining within the watershed of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area      Wilderness and Voyageurs National The legislation also      carves out a special exception for Minnesota from protective      provisions of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act      (FLPMA) and the Antiquities       H.3905 threatens the decision-making process already set      in motion by the Forest Service to consider a twenty-year      mineral withdrawal within the Superior National Forest in the      Rainy River watershed. These public lands lie upstream of two      prized and federally-protected areas, the Boundary Waters      Wilderness and Voyageurs National Both areas are easily      threatened by pollutants from mining activities in this      watershed given the exclusive drainage into their waters.      Tens of thousands of people have already submitted comments      on this matter and over 2,000 have participated in agency-     sponsored listening sessions. This legislation could erase      the remarkable outpouring of public support for clean water      and public lands, and set a precedent for legislating a      decision that could counter what our federal agencies and      public want.       The legislation also threatens the BLM's decision, with      advice from the Forest Service, not to renew two mineral      leases on the edge of the Boundary Waters Wilderness held by      Twin Metals Although the language of the      legislation is unclear, it is possible its intent is to      restrain Forest Service and BLM discretion on lease renewals      while reinstating the Twin Metals leases. Congress has      granted discretion to the Forest Service and BLM to assess      the circumstances and surrounding environment of any mineral      lease application, including applications for lease renewals.      Based on this discretion, both agencies have determined that      this region is too vulnerable for this type of risky mining,      a type of mining never before allowed in Twin      Metals would operate in the northeastern part of the state      upstream of the Boundary Waters Wilderness that hosts some of      cleanest water in America, and Voyageurs National Park, which      encompasses over 84,000 acres of water relied upon by many      native species.       NPCA also strongly objects to carving out a special      exception for Minnesota from the protective provisions of the      Antiquities Act and The Antiquities Act allows the      president to establish national monuments on federal lands      already owned by all Nearly every president since      1906 (eight republicans and eight democrats) has used the      Antiquities Act as a bipartisan conservation tool to protect      our nation's history and culture. The bill would eliminate      this authority on federal lands in Minnesota, making it only      the second state declared off-limits for national monuments      declared by presidential proclamation. To carve out      exceptions from this law is nothing short of a betrayal to      the American people and the land and history we've spent      generations protecting.       FLPMA establishes the authority of the Secretary of the      Interior to withdraw land from leasing for up to twenty      years. Any final Forest Service and BLM decision to move      forward with a twenty-year mineral withdrawal would be based      on a thorough, science-based process through the National      Environmental Policy H.3905 would eliminate this      authority solely for Minnesota, alone among the fifty states,      and undermine the ability of the agencies to do their job, as      appointed by       Thank you for considering our views on this important      legislation. Please reject H.3905 during this week's      markup.           Sincerely,                                                    Ani Kame'enui,                                 Director, Legislation and Policy.[[Page H9486]]                                       ____         Girl Scouts of Minnesota and Wisconsin Lakes and Pines,                                                November 26, 2017.       Dear Member of Congress: I am writing to request you vote      no on HR 3905, which is a bill that would stop a 2-year      Forest Service study of environmental, economic, and social      risks to the Boundary Waters from sulfide-ore copper mining      on Superior National Forest lands in the headwaters of the      Boundary Waters Canoe       For over fifty years, Northern Lakes Canoe Base has offered      wilderness canoe trips in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area      Wilderness (BWCAW). I guided Girl Scout canoe trips for five      years and have directed our wilderness program for 7 years      and am writing this letter to describe the strengths of this      program to you and to underscore the fact that this one-of-a-     kind program cannot exist anywhere other than the Boundary            Girls who come on our canoe trips may have had basic      camping and canoeing experiences, but few have experience in      wilderness travel. We typically serve 150-200 girls a summer.       In general, girls travel in wilderness areas less than      boys. Even in 2017, girls are taught to think that the      outdoors is no place for a girl because it is hard work,      dirty, and going to the mall is just much easier. We teach      teenage girls, in a girl-only environment, that their      individual strength and the power of teamwork is far greater      than they ever imagined. They also learn that hard-work and      dirt is part of the fun on a Boundary Waters canoe trip, and      they leave with an appreciation for the beauty of wilderness      and an understanding of the challenges they now know they can      overcome. Girl Scout wilderness canoe trips bring out the      best in teenage girls; we see how creative, hardworking, and      kind they can be to each other. It doesn't take much      imagination to believe that these traits will follow them      back to their everyday life.       We are a high quality, affordable program and pride      ourselves in our thriftiness. We use our canoes for 20+      seasons and packs and paddles summer after summer. We do this      so we can serve girls from all economic backgrounds,      including local iron range and Native American communities.       For years we have received feedback from participants      crediting their Boundary Waters experience for continued,      life-long growth. Our program cannot exist somewhere other      than the Boundary Waters Canoe Area No other      place on earth offers the perfect combination of      accessibility and high adventure that the BWCAW offers. Many      of our participants drive to Ely from Chicago, Milwaukee, and      Many others fly to Minneapolis and then rent a      car to get to Unlike many other wilderness areas which      may be high on a mountain range or only accessible by high-     clearance vehicles, it is easy for a mom or dad to drive a      van full of girls to the Boundary Waters, send them on a      trip, and then pick them up a week later.       The Boundary Waters is also unique in that, unlike many      other wilderness areas, visitors don't require any previous      experience or training to have a safe, adventurous trip.      Anyone seeking adventure and challenge belongs on a canoe      trip, not just body builders and endurance athletes. We have      even seen that a Girl Scout canoe trip sometimes inspires      girls who may be uninterested in athletics or leadership to      seek out her own creative ways to be active and healthy,      leading to improved confidence and greater aspirations.      Again, it doesn't take much imagination to conclude that      girls who experience wilderness travel will go on to make the      world a better place.       Girl Scouts canoe trip participants always remark that the      solitude they find in the Boundary Waters is unlike any they      have found elsewhere, whether at their own Girl Scout      resident camp or a state or national park. The quiet      environment of a protected wilderness area gives them an      opportunity to reflect on their life in a way that they could      not in a non-wilderness setting. Girl Scouts end their canoe      trip with a swagger to their step, ready to take on any      challenge that comes their way.       Thank you for doing your part to preserve the Boundary      Waters Canoe Area Wilderness by voting no on HR 3905. It      means a lot to all of us in Ely whose programs and businesses      are focused around wilderness travel.

435,topic-id,475,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, in strong support of this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I would first like to thank Ed Royce, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs I agree with everything he said in his remarks. I want to thank him for his hard work on this legislation. We worked closely together to make this bipartisan bill as strong as possible, while also taking care to limit any unintended consequences. That is what we have been doing on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and that is why we have been so successful in passing legislation. We do it in a bipartisan way.  Let me begin by saying that the Palestinian system of so-called martyr payments is downright disgusting. We are talking about a system that involves paying people on a sliding scale based on the death and destruction that they cause. It is simply sickening.  These payments clearly incentivize terrorist attacks, and they further threaten prospects for peace, pushing the chance for a Palestinian state further and further out of reach.  This legislation was named for Taylor Force, an American victim of Palestinian terrorism. He was a West Point graduate and a veteran of the wars in Iraq and He was stabbed to death in Jaffa in 2016.  The question we face is: How do we compel the PA, the Palestinian Authority, to end the martyr payment system?  In 2015, appropriations bills began to include language cutting off funds for the Palestinian Authority by the amount that they spent on so-called martyr payments, but that didn't curb the practice.                              {time}  1500  We stopped giving the Palestinian Authority direct assistance, but the Palestinian Authority hasn't budged.  We are now considering this legislation, which cuts all funds that directly benefit the Palestinian Authority if the Palestinian Authority continues to make these payments. This will make it crystal clear to the Palestinian Authority that so-called martyr payments are unacceptable, period.  At the same time, the bill allows the United States to continue humanitarian and democracy assistance, which is in our interest and the interest of our ally It also includes a thoughtful exemption proposed by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.Connolly) which exempts childhood vaccinations from the cuts required under this bill.  Overall, I believe that this version of the Taylor Force Act strikes the right balance. Chairman Royce and I worked very hard to come up with a piece of legislation that both sides would support. The Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously passed this legislation. The message should be clear: this is not a partisan issue.  We must send a message to the Palestinian Authority that these so-called martyr payments, which are ``killing'' payments, must stop.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that ensures no unintended consequences, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, let me close by saying that this bipartisan legislation seeks to compel the Palestinian Authority to stop incentivizing acts of terrorism against innocent victims, including American Taylor  Now, the encouragement of hooligans and thugs to just randomly try to kill people for no other reason than just to try to perpetrate violence needs to be stopped. While the Palestinian Authority seems to be encouraging knife attacks and terror attacks against Jewish Israelis, it is important to say that being in the wrong place at the wrong time leaves everybody vulnerable. That is what happened to Taylor He wasn't He happened to be American, and he happened to be a soldier in a war area and a very good, nice, decent human being. He didn't deserve it.  Nobody deserves to be a victim of terror. But certainly, the victims of terror, if we are going to cry out to help them, we have got to put a stop to this disgusting practice of calling these murderers martyrs. They are not martyrs. They are murderers. They have no regard for human beings. They have no regard for anything. It is time for us to say: Enough is enough.  In this current bill, it allows the United States to avoid any unintended consequences such as the cessation of humanitarian assistance, the right thing to do. I hope that the Palestinian Authority will use this opportunity to stop these martyr payments, move away from incitement, and move toward a two-state solution. Again, this bipartisan legislation seeks to compel the Palestinian Authority to stop acts of terrorism, to stop aiding and abetting acts of terrorism against innocent victims, including American Taylor  The gentleman from Florida (Mr.Deutch) said that if someone drives their car and hits somebody, nothing happens. But if someone drives their car and kills somebody, they get a martyr payment. There is something perverse about that. There is something just wrong about that.

Finally, let me say that this bill, aptly named as a tribute to Taylor Force, to his parents whom I had the pleasure of meeting, and to all of the people who knew him--he really was the driving force behind this legislation.

The majority of Venezuelans stayed clear of polling stations and chose not to participate in what was yet another effort from that government to distract from the country's real problem, which, as we have been saying, is a humanitarian crisis created by President Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, an increasingly dangerous human rights climate.  Just last week, the Venezuelan human rights group, Foro Penal, joined Human Rights Watch in releasing a report documenting abuses in the country that have taken place over the past year. I would like to mention a few statistics from this report that shows you just how repressive the Venezuelan Government has become.  Fifty-four hundred people have been detained in relation to antigovernment protests in early April; 3,900 of them are still subject to arbitrary criminal prosecutions and measures that limit their freedoms. And 757 civilians were prosecuted by military courts in violation of both Venezuelan and international law. Even more alarmingly, 124 Venezuelans were killed and 2,000 injured this year while taking part in antigovernment protests.  The Human Rights Watch report states:       In 53 cases involving at least 232 people, detainees were      subjected to physical and psychological abuse, with the      apparent purpose of either punishing them or forcing them to      incriminate themselves or others. In some of these cases, the      abuses suffered by the detainees clearly constituted torture.      These include electric shocks, severe beatings, being hung in      stress positions, sleep deprivation, asphyxiation, and sexual      abuse, including, in some cases, rape.  In an August report, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed a similar sentiment pointing to ``the existence of a policy to repress political dissent and instill fear in the population to curb demonstrations.''  I think it is important to point out that, year after year, Democrats and Republicans have come to the House floor to call attention to the erosion of democracy in As my colleagues have said, Venezuela should be the leader in South America, the most prosperous country in South America, with huge oil reserves. Instead, it is a basket case because of Maduro and because of  For many years, it seemed that the United States was an outlier in raising our voices, while many in the hemisphere remained silent. Fortunately, that has changed. Leaders throughout the Americas have been increasingly willing to stand with the people of  It is hard to find a silver lining for Venezuela in such a dark time, but I do hope, from the strong resolve of our friends in Latin America and around the world in rejecting Venezuela's sham constituent assembly and calling out human rights abuses in the country, they will realize that we care about them, that we know what is going on, and that we are not going to let their repressive government sweep things under the rug.  In November, the European Union put in place a wide range of sanctions on Venezuela, including an arms embargo, visa bans, and asset freezes. Our friends in Canada imposed sanctions on human rights violators in the Maduro government, and, on October 26, Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland hosted the Lima Group of Foreign Ministers in Toronto to seek a hemispheric solution to the crisis in  The OAS, the Organization of American States, has also played a critical role in increasing pressure on the Maduro regime, particularly under the leadership of OAS Secretary General Luis  But we cannot rely on the OAS alone. The United Nations, both with the Security Council and through the Office of the Secretary-General, must do much more to bring attention to Venezuela on the world stage and hold its leaders accountable.  And today, the House of Representatives, here in Washington, goes on record again underscoring our commitment to the people of Venezuela and condemning the destructive policies of the Maduro regime.

858,topic-id,631,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure. Let me, first of all, thank my good friend and fellow New Yorker, Mr.Crowley; and our former chair of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee, Mr.Chabot, for authoring this important resolution. I also want to thank Ed Royce, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for his sustained focus on this tragedy and his leadership in quickly bringing this measure to the floor.  Mr.Speaker, we continue to see reports of Rohingya refugees fleeing to Bangladesh and widespread hunger and malnutrition for those left behind.  The Burmese military and security forces are waging a brutal campaign of violence against unarmed civilians, including women and children, killing, raping, and destroying lives and livelihoods.  The Rohingya people have been marginalized for decades, but the unthinkable violence and human suffering since August is ethnic cleansing, pure and simple--a description the Trump administration now agrees with, although they were far too slow to say so--and possibly even genocide.                              {time}  1415  Over the past 4 months, more than 600,000 men, women, and children have fled to neighboring Bangladesh to find refuge in a country with tremendous needs of its own. This is more than 10 times the number of refugees the administration will allow into the United States this year, the same administration that ended America's participation in the U.effort to develop a global compact on migration, all this right in the middle of the world's most serious refugee crisis in history. I say shame on us. We should be doing more.  Bangladesh deserves our deep gratitude for opening its doors to the Rohingya at a time when our government slams the door shut. The Governments of Burma and Bangladesh have struck a deal to begin repatriating Rohingya next month, but it is not clear that anyone is interested in returning right now. In fact, there are reports of more arrivals in Bangladesh each day on fishing boats for those who can afford passage and on makeshift rafts for those who cannot.  People are leaving Burma out of fear; they are leaving because they are hungry; and they are leaving because they know, if they stay, they will die. The Burmese Government has not yet set appropriate conditions for the voluntary, dignified, and safe return, including allowing an independent United Nations fact-finding mission and addressing citizenship issues.  The United States Congress has long defended the rights and freedoms of the Burmese people, championing Burma's new leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, during her many years under house arrest, supporting Burma's historic 2015 decision, and remaining a committed partner in Burma's ongoing democratic transition. With the measure before us today, this body will continue to speak out on this issue. We support freedom and respect for human rights in  This measure condemns the horrific actions of the military and security forces, calls for an immediate cessation of its violence, and urges the restoration of humanitarian access. It also calls for Aung San Suu Kyi to exercise moral leadership, something that is needed now more than ever.  We reject the army's claims that what is taking place in Burma is a so-called counterterrorism measure. That is nonsense. It is textbook ethnic cleansing; that is what it is.  We should also encourage other governments to stay engaged and continue to address the pressing needs of these refugees, needs that will only grow as long as this situation remains unresolved.  Lastly, we must also urge our own administration to hold members of the Burmese military and security forces accountable for these atrocities, and I have introduced sanctions legislation to do just that.  Mr.Speaker, I support this measure, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

341,topic-id,660,"Mr.President, today I wish to speak about the important legislation we are now considering.  Earlier this week, I explained some of the reasons the Senate needs to consider tax reform legislation and gave a general overview of the bill. Today I want to talk about some of the specific provisions of the bill.[[Page S7697]]  First, I want to talk about the relief this bill provides to hard-working The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduces tax rates for individuals, almost doubles the standard deduction, and doubles the child tax credit. This will allow families to keep more of the money they earn in their pockets. The independent Tax Foundation estimates that this will amount to about $2,500 more in after-tax income for a middle-income family in  This bill also will provide relief to small, family-owned businesses that currently employ the majority of the private sector in The bill cuts taxes for these businesses while enhancing deductions that are important to them, like the section 179 deduction that promotes business investment. The Tax Foundation believes changes like this will add more than 1,700 full time jobs in my home  While these individual Tax Code provisions are important to so many Wyomingites and small businesses in my home State, I am also especially proud of the international tax provisions in this bill, which I worked on with Senator Portman and Chairman  Right now, our tax rules are written so that many businesses could be better off if they are headquartered outside of the United Those rules, which were written in the 1960s, are completely outdated. Many of the U.major trading partners, including Canada, Japan, and the U.K., have moved to what are called ``territorial'' tax systems. Those systems tax the income generated within their borders and exempt foreign earnings from tax.  The United States, on the other hand, taxes the worldwide income of U.companies and provides deferral of U.tax until the foreign earnings are brought home. Deferring the tax incentivizes companies to leave their money abroad and invest it there. That is certainly not a recipe for U.growth and U.job creation.  The dominance of U.S.-headquartered companies in the global marketplace is waning. In 2000, 36 percent of the Fortune Global 500 companies were headquartered in the United In 2009, that number dropped to 28 percent. In 2017, we are down to 26 percent. Clearly, America is losing ground, and our international tax rules are part of the problem.  I have been working to change that since the 112th Congress, when I introduced the United States Job Creation and International Tax Reform My goal then was to incentivize American companies to create jobs in the United States while leveling the playing field for U.companies in the global marketplace. I believe the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act achieves that goal.  This bill would reform and modernize the rules for taxing the global operations of American companies. These reforms, along with reducing our corporate tax rate, would help make America a more attractive location to base a business that serves customers around the world.  With these provisions in law, families would hear fewer stories about how U.companies are moving their profits to tax haven countries and avoiding U.tax on those earnings. Families would hear fewer stories about how U.multinational companies set up post office boxes in the Cayman Islands and Switzerland without an employee or officer of the company anywhere in sight and attribute a significant portion of their foreign earnings to these jurisdictions. Instead, families would hear more stories about how U.companies are generating the ideas and inventions of tomorrow right here in  The international tax rules are not easy or simple, and a lot of work went into these provisions. I want to again thank Senator Portman and Chairman Hatch for their work with me in this area. I look forward to continuing to work with them and the rest of my colleagues to pass this bill that our country desperately needs.  Thank you.

This amendment would undermine the balance struck in the drafting of this bill and diminish its potential to generate growth.  Has all time expired?  The PRESIDING All time has not expired.

484,topic-id,1043,"Mr.President, earlier this week, I said it was historic that we began the consideration of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Today is even more[[Page S7713]]significant because we are one step closer to enacting that bill.  The chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Hatch, has called this a once-in-a-generation opportunity. I agree.  As an accountant, one of my goals when I came to the Senate in 1996 was to serve on the Finance When I joined the committee in 2009, I said that positive, pro-growth changes to our tax policy could help us out of the economic downturn. I believe this bill makes those types of changes and will jump-start our economy.  This week, 137 economists agreed with that assessment. In a letter to Senators and Representatives, these economists wrote: ``Economic growth will accelerate if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passes, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and a better standard of living for the American people.''  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle dispute that analysis. But after a decade of below-average growth and official projections showing real economic growth will average less than 2 percent annually over the next decade, isn't it time that we tried something new?  Some of my colleagues have also suggested that this bill hasn't gone through regular order. I have already reminded folks of the 70 tax hearings in the Senate Finance Committee held over the last 6 years, but that isn't all we have done. In the last Congress, Chairman Hatch organized five bipartisan groups to propose changes to the Tax I was party to those groups, which made many recommendations that have informed this package. I would say that those working groups were also bipartisan.  While I don't sit on the Energy Committee, I understand that Chairman Murkowski led a similarly robust process. The issue of oil and gas exploration and development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has been an issue since before I was a We have been considering and debating the matter for years. This year alone, Senator Murkowski has introduced a bill, held a hearing, and then marked up legislation on this issue. Now the bill that is a product of the Finance and Energy Committee's efforts is on the floor.  We have not bypassed committees. We have not filled the tree. We have not cut off debate by filing cloture, which was a common practice in recent years. I think this is as open and transparent a process as I have seen in many years, and I appreciate the leader, I appreciate Chairman Hatch, and I appreciate Chairman Murkowski for their work to make that happen.  I also want to thank my Budget Committee staff for their work on this bill. In particular, I want to thank my staff director, Betsy McDonnell, who has done a remarkable job shepherding both the budget resolution and reconciliation bill through the committee and on the floor. She has been new to that position. She has been in a number of positions in the Senate that trained her well to be able to do that, and she did a marvelous job.  I also want to thank her team: Matt Giroux, Paul Vinovich, Becky Cole, Thomas Fuller, Elizabeth Keys, Joe Brenckle, Jim Neill, Steve Robinson, Greg D'Angelo, Tom Borck, Rick Berger, Jeremy Dalrymple, David Ditch, Susan Eckerly, Alison McGuire, Will Morris, Steve Townsend, Kelsie Wendelberger, and Eric  I would like to thank my personal office staff who worked hard on the tax provisions in this package and kept all of my other issues going at the same time. Particularly, I want to thank Bart Massey, who is a CPA and who has been my special person to work on these finance issues with me for more than 3 years.  I also want to thank Tara Shaw, my chief of staff, who had to put together a new staff because a lot of good people I had were taken to the administration and to the Budget She did a marvelous job on that.  Landon Stropko is the legislative director, and he has coordinated well. I thank Liz Schwartz, Natalia Riggin, Aniela Butler, Charlie Carroll, Shawna Newsome, Garnett Decosimo, Chris Lydon, Aron Wehr, Dylan Mitchell, Coy Knobel, Max D'Onofrio, Rachel Vliem, and the rest of my Wyoming team that worked out in Wyoming collecting the information and doing casework out there while we got this work done.  I thank the Budget Committee's bipartisan staff: Kim Proctor, Katie Smith, George Woodall, Grace Bruno, and Kevin Walsh, as well as Celina Inman, who has been on loan to us from the Government Publishing  We have also been supported by the great work of our leadership, the floor, and the cloakroom staff. Specific thanks are owed to Sharon Soderstrom, Hazen Marshall, Jane Lee, Brandon Dunn in the leader's office, Monica Popp, John Chapuis, Emily Kirlin, Sam Beaver, Jody Wright, and Noah McCullough in the whip's office and especially Laura Dove, who coordinates all of this activity on the floor and who knows the rules backward and forward and is able to give good advice--some very definite advice sometimes but always helpful advice--and Robert Duncan, Chris Tuck, Megan Mercer, Tony Hanagan, Mike Smith, Katherine Kilroy, and Chloe Barz in the cloakroom.  I would really be remiss if we didn't thank the Senate Parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, and her team: Leigh Hilderbrand, Michael Beaver, and Allison Reconciliation bills are subject to special rules and procedures, and I know they have given up a lot of their nights and their weekends, as well as their regular job time, to work in detail on this product. People wouldn't even realize the file cabinets full of precedents that they have to search through as they listen to both sides make cases about what can and can't be in a budget reconciliation bill.  There are also many other staffers who deserve to be thanked for their work on this product, including the entire Finance and Energy Committee staffs, but in the interest of time, I will just say that I appreciate them and look forward to working with all of them to help finish enacting this bill that will benefit hard-working Americans and make our economy and country stronger.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1657,topic-id,1450,"Mr.President, this is a historic day, as the Senate begins consideration of tax reform that will help boost America's economy, create more jobs, and leave more money in people's paychecks.  The House and Senate passage last month of the fiscal year 2018 budget resolution marked an important first step toward tax relief for American families and job creators that will jump-start economic growth. The resolution gave the Senate Finance Committee the headroom to come up with comprehensive tax reform, and it instructed the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to save $1 billion. Finance Committee Chairman Hatch and Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairwoman Murkowski both deserve praise for developing legislative recommendations that fit with the budget resolution's reconciliation instructions, and I thank them for their efforts.  Yesterday, the Senate Budget Committee took the next step by combining the legislative recommendations from the Finance and the Energy and Natural Resources Committees and reporting the combined bill to the full Senate for consideration. This put our Nation one step closer to real tax reform while advancing American energy security.  It is past time for us to act. A lot of things have changed since the last major tax reform in 1986, and unfortunately our Tax Code hasn't kept pace with those changes. It is an outdated mess that is hurting American workers and holding back our economy. That is why we need tax reform that will make our system simpler and fairer and allow people to keep more of what they earn. The bill before us will do that. It will help grow the economy, create jobs, and ensure that hard-working Americans aren't missing available tax relief.  This bill also will provide relief to small, family-owned businesses. We want to make sure that small businesses, which currently employ the majority of the private sector in Wyoming and are the backbone of our communities all over the country, have the opportunity to grow and provide more jobs.  If you care about jobs, if you care about American companies staying here and being able to compete globally, then you should also care about reforming our business tax system. America has the fourth highest corporate rate in the world. We need to encourage companies to bring back their overseas money to increase the number of jobs here in the United Lowering our uncommonly high and uncompetitive business tax rate would be one of the quickest ways to solve the problem. It is time we make America a more inviting place to invest, to do business, and to create jobs.  We heard a lot of rhetoric yesterday in our committee meeting where we reported this bill, and I expect we will be hearing a lot more of the same arguments over the next couple of days. So I want to address some of the claims made by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle yesterday.  Several Members complained that there have been zero hearings on this reconciliation legislation and that this has been a rushed process. Nothing could be further from the truth.  The entire 2018 budget reconciliation process has been open, transparent, and subject to regular order, starting with the passage of the Senate budget resolution. The Senate Budget Committee marked up the budget over 2 days and accepted amendments from both sides of the aisle to make the resolution stronger. In fact, for the first time ever, the minority was given a copy of the chairman's bill 5 days prior to the start of the markup. According to many of my colleagues, it was one of the most transparent budget resolution markups in history.  The budget resolution, complete with the reconciliation instructions being used this week, was then debated on the floor in an open process that allowed every Senator the opportunity to offer and vote on amendments to improve the resolution before its final passage. That set in motion the instructed committees' process for producing recommendations.  Over the last 6 years, the Senate Finance Committee has held 70 hearings on how the Tax Code can be improved and streamlined to work better for all  Earlier this month, the Senate Finance Committee held a 4-day markup before finally approving tax reform legislation designed to modernize our Tax The markup lasted 23 hours and 34 minutes over the course of those 4 days. Of the more than 350 amendments filed, 69 were asked to be considered in committee. An additional 35 amendments, offered by both Democrats and Republicans, were included in the final bill reported out of committee.  On November 2, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing to receive testimony on the potential for oil and gas exploration and development in the so-called 1002 area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or On November 15, after adopting a bipartisan amendment, the committee approved, with bipartisan support, legislation authorizing responsible development in the 1002 area and meeting the $1 billion reconciliation deficit reduction target.  Let me explain what we are talking about. ANWR is 19.3 million acres. It is about the size of South The 1002 area is 1.57 million acres--about the size of The area within 1002 that we are talking about for development is just 2,000 acres, which is smaller than the Fargo, ND, airport.  When the Budget Committee met yesterday, consistent with our responsibility under the Congressional Budget Act, we were only allowed to combine the recommendations of the two committees. We reported the combined bill to the full As provided by law, no amendments were allowed because, under the Budget Act, our committee is prohibited from substantially changing either committee's approved recommendations. Now that this bill is on the floor, however, it will be subject to the amendment process. For reconciliation bills like this, the amount of amendments that can be offered is unlimited.  Several Members yesterday accused us of no longer caring about overspending and the debt. Again, this is completely false. Better tax policy will boost the value of everything we produce, and this will mean more revenue for the Federal  The cost of this bill that you will hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue assumes the bill has little effect on the economy. That assumption is based on the sluggish growth we have had recently. In 2016, annual GDP growth was 1.6 percent, but our historical average growth is 3.2[[Page S7395]]percent. Under President Trump's efforts and the hope that he has brought to working Americans, our economy has grown at more than 3 percent over the last two quarters. If we only get to 2.4 percent growth in the private sector, this bill will be paid for. If we reach 3.2 percent growth, part of the debt will be paid down with the extra revenue that will be generated.  We have tried stimulus, and it left us with the 1.6 percent. We have tried cutting. In Washington, if you don't give the amount of increase that people are asking for but you give them more money than they had last year, that is considered a cut. So cuts haven't worked here, either. So what is the other option that we have? Growing the economy.  Now, I want to repeat that in 2016 the annual GDP growth was 1.6 percent, but our historical average growth is 3.2 percent. And under President Trump's efforts and the hope he has brought to working Americans, our economy has grown at more than 3 percent over the last two quarters, without this. If we only get to 2.4 percent growth in the private sector, this bill will be paid for. I believe we can reach the 3.2-percent growth, and part of the debt will be paid down from the extra revenue that will be generated.  Some people will say that after tax cuts before, the deficit has gone up. I hope you check and see that the revenue has gone up, but the spending went up bigger. It is like somebody winning the lottery and spending their winnings twice.  This reconciliation bill will make concrete reforms to the broken U.Tax Code and put the American economy back on a growth track. This tax plan is an investment in hard-working Americans, one that will produce more jobs and result in higher wages and a stronger and more competitive American economy.  You are probably going to hear a lot of screaming going on in speeches this week. Please don't confuse volume with veracity or truth.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to help pass this bill. It will not only benefit hard-working Americans, but it will make our economy and our country stronger.  I yield the floor.

His plan guts the 2015 open internet rules and removes the FCC as the cop on the beat to protect consumers online.  Without protections against blocking, throttling, or paid prioritization, there will be nothing to stop ISPs from slowing or blocking a website or charging consumers more to access certain content. It would allow ISPs to pick winners and losers by charging small businesses tolls to reach potential customers online, and they will be able to control the flow of information on the internet.  Millions of Americans cheered for the 2015 rules to protect the open internet, rules that have been upheld by the courts. With those rules in place, ISPs have been less likely to mess with content.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule, and I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that the House can vote on my bipartisan legislation, the Presidential Tax Transparency This bill codifies the longstanding, bipartisan tradition of Presidents and Presidential nominees disclosing their tax return information to the American people.  The Republican majority and the President are currently working in overdrive to pass a distorted tax bill that will raise the taxes on 82 million middle class families. It takes one's breath away.  I and many others have spoken at length about the harm this bill will do to the middle class, from targeting the mortgage interest deduction, to raising the cost of higher education and graduate school for student loans, to limiting the deductibility of State and local taxes. And, at a time when our country is recovering from several natural disasters, including major wildfires in California where 14,000 Californians have lost their homes, the House-passed bill eliminates the deduction for personal property losses resulting from natural disasters, which I find to be especially cruel.  While it is very clear that the Republican tax bill will harm the middle class, it is less clear how the bill will benefit one taxpayer in particular, if he pays any taxes: the President of the United States of  Mr.Trump is the wealthiest President in our Nation's history, but he is also the only President, going back to Gerald Ford and all Presidents moving forward who voluntarily put out their tax returns--he is the only one--to refuse to release his tax returns, a lapse in disclosure that is made all the more troubling given his all-out push for tax cuts for the wealthiest at the expense of the middle class and others in our country.                              {time}  1315  How can Americans have any confidence in what is going on? They are not fools. They understand that we are swimming around in conflicts of interest, and nothing is being done about it.  Today, Republicans have an opportunity. And while we cannot know exactly how the Republican tax bill will benefit the President, until he releases his tax returns, we can be sure that this tax bill, which is skewed toward the top 1 percent, will benefit the billionaire Commander in Chief and his family.

2005,topic-id,206,"The Republican tax bill cuts the tax rate for so-called pass-through businesses, which is how many of the Trump family's businesses are structured, including hotels, golf courses, and real estate developments. Specifically, the tax rate for passive business income, which is derived from licensing, royalties, and other arrangements that the Trump organization specializes in, will be cut from 39.6 percent to 25 percent in the Republican tax scam bill.  That same bill also repeals the alternative minimum tax, which we know from Mr.Trump's leaked 2005 tax return forced him to pay an additional $26 million in taxes that year. Without the AMT, he is completely off the hook and would, essentially, have a measly 3 percent effective tax rate: another great example for the American people. It is no wonder they don't trust Washington, D. Lastly, the Republican tax bill doubles the estate tax exemption to $22 million, and guess who wins again? Mr. Mr.Speaker, only with full disclosure of the President's tax returns will we know how much he and his family will benefit from this Republican tax scam.

1250,topic-id,1004,"Mr.President, I wish to speak about the so-called Republican tax reform bill.  When it comes to revising our tax system, I assumed there were two things my Republican colleagues would agree with me on.  First, that tax reform doesn't increase taxes for middle-class families and, second, that tax reform wouldn't balloon the deficit.  Unfortunately, I was wrong on both counts. The bill that is before us does both of those things. Candidly, I'm surprised that anyone can even call this bill tax reform with a straight face.  I think it is clear to all of us and to the American people that this bill is nothing more than a windfall tax cut for big corporations and rich  There were no hearings on this bill with outside groups. There was no transparency in the drafting of this bill, and much like the healthcare debacle, the result is a mess that not even all Republicans are supporting.  This bill would blow a $1.4 trillion hole in our deficit. This bill would raise taxes on many working families by gutting important deductions like for State and local taxes. This bill would leave 13 million Americans without health insurance. This bill even has riders in it to allow drilling in pristine areas of the Alaskan wilderness.  The bill takes all of these destructive actions just to put more money in the pockets of corporations and the richest  This bill is one of the most fiscally irresponsible bills I have seen in quite some time.  In fact, I don't ever recall a tax bill on the Senate floor that drives up our deficit this much.  Republicans are trying to convince Americans that these huge tax cuts for the rich will pay for themselves. Well, that is just not going to happen.  If you don't believe me, listen to all the economists who agree that this bill won't accomplish the goals that Republicans are claiming.  While a higher deficit is bad enough on its own, I fear that Republicans will use this as an excuse to gut vital programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security to pay for it.  I can think of better ways to spend $1.4 trillion than cutting taxes for the rich. Imagine how many jobs would be created if we invested that money in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure or the jobs created if we invested in clean energy solutions to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. We could invest in education to prepare our students to compete in the new economy, or we could invest in our veterans by improving the care they receive at VA hospitals.  Instead, Republicans want to waste that money lining the pockets of millionaires and billionaires, and it is the middle class who will pay the price.  Every day I hear from Californians who are worried about this bill and what it means for their family's budgets.  Here are some of their stories.  Raleigh is a middle-class retiree in Davis, He wrote me to say that his taxes would go up nearly $4,000 a year. He simply can't afford such a drastic tax increase on his fixed budget.  Mary lives in Berkeley, She said the effects of this bill will be higher health insurance premiums because the bill goes after the individual mandate in the Affordable Care The increased costs could mean she will have[[Page S7554]]to choose between buying health insurance or paying for her daughter's college tuition.  Michael is a senior in Los He is afraid he will have to sell his house due to the elimination of the property tax deduction.  Carol, who lives in Sacramento, tells me that her family's taxes would go up almost $12,000 a year, making it harder for her to save for retirement.  These are just a few stories about the hardships that Americans will face because of this bill.  In fact, more than half of American households will pay more in taxes under the Republican plan. That is appalling.  Californians will be particularly hurt by the elimination of the State and local tax deduction.  Since the national income tax was created in 1913, Americans have been able to prevent double taxation by deducting state and local taxes.  In 2015, more than 6 million California households claimed this deduction, and the average amount deducted was $18,400.  Even Americans who don't claim the SALT deduction will be hurt by this proposal.  Funding for critical services like schools, and police and fire departments would be in jeopardy as communities bear the impact of the increased tax burden on families.  This bill also renews the Republican's assault on the Affordable Care The bill would drive up healthcare costs by repealing the individual mandate.  If this passes, prices in the marketplace would skyrocket, increasing by almost 10 percent each year, making healthcare unaffordable for many families. The result would be 13 million fewer people with healthcare.  One group, however, is the clear winner, and that is big corporations.  The Republican tax bill permanently slashes the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.  They will get to keep deductions taken away from ordinary people, allowing companies to drive their executive tax rate down further.  For instance, corporations will still be able to deduct State and local taxes they pay, while middle-class families won't be allowed to.  Under the Republican plan, corporate tax cuts are made permanent, keeping their tax rates low. Meanwhile, the lower tax rates for the middle class would disappear, further shifting the tax burden onto American families.  The misplaced priorities in this tax cut bill are bad for families and bad for This bill is being rushed through in large part because it is harmful to families. It clearly skews to benefit big corporations and the rich. It explodes our deficit, leaving the middle-class to pay the tab.  I cannot support this bill, and I urge my Republican colleagues to join me in opposing it.  Scrap this fiscally irresponsible legislation, and work with Democrats on true tax reform that puts the middle class first.

1373,topic-id,493,"Mr.President, today I wish to call attention to the more than 112,000 foster children in our Nation who are waiting to be adopted. Of these, more than 14,000 are in  These are children with no permanent place to call home, who have experienced severe neglect or abuse. Through no fault of their own, these kids are uprooted from their lives, separated from everything they know, and unable to be safely reunited with their biological families. Many are moved from home to home with their few belongings in a garbage bag.  These are children who are waiting for a family, wanting to belong, and needing our help. Of these children, more than 20,000 age out of the foster care system every year without a place to call home. We can and must do better.  What happens to children who age out of the foster care system? They are shown the door and expected to suddenly be self-sustaining, successful adults. Unfortunately, this is not the case for the majority of our foster youth. I say ``our'' because these kids are all of our responsibility. They are in every community, and we are failing[[Page S7358]]them. For those who age out of the system, 20 percent become homeless. Only half are employed by age 24. Seventy percent of young women who age out of the system are pregnant by age 21. Less than 3 percent complete a college degree. Foster youth are also at higher risk of being victims of child sex-trafficking.  We can do better. Our children deserve better. Every child is meant to be in a family. In America, families come in all sorts of wonderful shapes and sizes, and every foster child waiting to be adopted deserves the love, safety, and support that only a permanent family can provide. No child is unadoptable.  During the month of November, our Nation celebrates National Adoption Month, and recognizes the families that have opened their hearts and homes to children in need of a family and the joy that adoption brings. I encourage anyone interested in building their family through adoption to visit www.adoptuskids.org.  It is also important to recognize the efforts of the volunteers and mentors who provide a positive, stable relationship for a child whose entire world is changing. In addition, programs that provide comprehensive resources--from mental health services to tutoring--help foster kids succeed. There may not be a simple solution, but we do know what gets us closer. There are programs in California and across the Nation that have shown improved permanency rates, nearly universal high school graduation rates, and success in college and employment. There is hope and not a second to waste.  As National Adoption Month comes to a close, we must remember our foster youth year-round and strive to ensure that each one is connected with a permanent, loving home.

1406,topic-id,1441,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about the National Defense Authorization The process of negotiating the annual defense bill is one that has a long and important history on Capitol  This afternoon, the Senate voted to pass a conference report, continuing a tradition of 55 consecutive years in which the National Defense Authorization Act has been a must-pass bill for the People have a habit these days of assuming that Congress cannot pass major legislation, but this bill is a testament to the fact that when it comes to supporting our men and women in uniform, we work together to provide them with the support they need. I am happy to say that this year, we are carrying on this proud tradition.  This year's National Defense Authorization Act was passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities in both the Senate and the As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have been proud to do my part to help craft this bill and to be a part of the process.  We live in a rapidly changing world, and, unfortunately, one that presents a growing number of threats and challenges that our military must face. Across the globe, we have witnessed the rise of dangerous new threats that make the mission of our warfighters even more challenging. In Europe, Vladimir Putin has shown a complete disregard for international law and order and threatens key allies and democracies that underpin the democratic backbone of In the Pacific, we face a nuclear-armed dictator in North Korea who murders his own people while threatening mass death and destruction to the United States and to our allies. In the Middle East, we have witnessed the rapid and fearsome emergence of radical extremist groups like ISIS, whose barbarism shocks the world. Their horrific acts of bloodshed show just how dangerous this warped ideology is, and the efforts of the men and women in uniform have played a critical role in the fight to stem this dark tide.  Unfortunately, this same ideology of radical extremism is finding new followers in Europe, Africa, and These threats demand that we be ready. The fact is that the United States has faced challenges before, and if one thing holds true throughout history, it is that our Armed Forces will be called upon to defeat the enemies of freedom and safeguard this For them to succeed, the Congress must provide the men and women in uniform the support they need to execute their missions. That is why I am so proud to stand before you today and speak about the National Defense Authorization  This legislation sends a clear message: Now is the time that we begin to rebuild our military. Contained in this bill is the necessary funding to start filling the gaps and ensuring our force remains the best in the world. This includes increases to the size of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Reserves, and our National It also means that new, battle-ready systems are going to get the funding they need to be put in the field as quickly as possible. On land, the NDAA authorizes funding for 85 Abrams tank upgrades and 93 Bradley fighting vehicles. At sea, it revitalizes our fleet, authorizing 13 new ships for our In the air, it provides 90 new F-35 aircraft and 53 UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters.  Across all of these domains, the fiscal year 2018 NDAA authorizes funding for critical modernization priorities to help ensure that on every battlefield the men and women of America's Armed Forces have the resources they need to complete the missions they are given.  I serve as chair of the Armed Services Committee's Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, and my top priority has been the modernization of our nuclear forces and the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons complex.  This bill strongly supports nuclear modernization and makes a number of other key investments within the subcommittee's jurisdiction. First, the conference report builds on important provisions included in the versions that passed both the House and the Senate this year, and it includes the administration's request for additional missile defense funding, submitted earlier this month. In total, the bill authorizes an additional $4.4 billion above the level requested by the President when the budget was initially submitted to improve our missile defense systems. This includes a significant expansion of our Ground-based Midcourse Defense system and authorizes resources to begin construction of another 20 interceptor silos at Fort Greely, To further enhance the system's effectiveness, the bill makes valuable investments in the network of radars and other sensors that support the system's operations. The bill also contains reasonable reforms to our military space enterprise that are designed to achieve a more streamlined and agile system that is more responsive to the needs of our warfighters.  Furthermore, the bill improves the oversight and management of our nuclear command and control architecture. Often overlooked, these programs form the connective tissue between our national leadership and our nuclear forces. Their reliability and resilience are vital to the effectiveness of our nuclear deterrent.  As the specter of great power conflict returns and the threat from a nuclear-armed North Korea continues to grow, our missile defense and nuclear capabilities will play an increasingly important role in protecting our homeland. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to further modernize and strengthen these vital capabilities to ensure that we stay ahead of the threats that our Nation faces.  Beyond the strategic forces portfolio, this bill recognizes that we must also rebuild our readiness and military infrastructure here at home, which is why we have included funding increases in the bill to support 90 percent of the requirements for facilities sustainment, as well as a significant increase for facilities restoration and modernization. This means newly authorized funding to restore and modernize facilities and infrastructure ranging from barracks and hospitals to runways and hangers.  But let's not forget the most important part of our effort in crafting this bill, and that is providing for the one asset we can never replace: our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. The people who wear the uniform are more valuable than any weapons system. The dedication, sacrifice, and honor they exemplify every day is why we stand here today and enjoy the freedoms this country has to offer. For that reason, included in this bill is the largest pay raise for our troops in 8 years.  We have also permanently preserved special survivor indemnity allowance[[Page S7288]]payments to surviving military spouses. There are more than 60,000 Americans whose spouses have died on Active Duty or during retirement and, as a result of this legislation, this important payment will no longer exist on a year-by-year basis, but it will be preserved indefinitely.  Make no mistake, these are challenging times for our Nation as the world is becoming an increasingly complex place. Now more than ever, we are asking our military to tackle difficult problems and to face adversaries who consistently seek new ways to do us harm.  No matter the day, no matter the situation, America's Armed Forces stand ready to answer the call and protect our We need to uphold our solemn duty as Members of the Senate and keep faith with those who wear the uniform by giving them the tools they need.  The 55-year legacy of passing the National Defense Authorization Act did not happen by accident. It has happened because Members of this body know and Members of this body recognize that this bill represents a promise to our servicemembers. It is a promise that, as you stand in harm's way, far from your families and loved ones, we stand with you. When you are deployed during a holiday or a special occasion, as many members of our own Nebraska National Guard will be this Thanksgiving, we stand with you. During late nights and early mornings in the cold, in the heat, in battle, and in peacetime, we stand with you.  Passing the National Defense Authorization Act means keeping our end of the promise to those who serve. As a Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, it has been my honor to play a part in helping to craft this year's bill, and I would like to thank our chairman, Senator John McCain, for his leadership in guiding the committee through the process.

1663,topic-id,1983,"Mr.President, I rise this evening to speak about tax reform, which is so important for families in Nebraska and throughout this country. The last time Congress comprehensively reformed the Tax Code was in 1986, and we all agree it is long overdue. My priorities for tax reform have always been threefold: delivering relief to the middle-class, unleashing small business growth, and making our country competitive globally. This bill before us accomplishes these goals.  American families have struggled over the past decade, and too many in our country have found themselves living paycheck to paycheck. Wages for workers have stagnated while the prices of goods and services have continued to climb. Things are only just starting to turn around and, as I travel across my State, Nebraskans have begun to tell me they are finally feeling confident about the economy again. That needs to continue, and the best way to do it is by putting more money back into the pockets of regular This bill does that in one of the best ways possible, by doubling the standard deduction and protecting the first $24,000 that married couples earn and the first $12,000 individuals earn from Federal taxes.  Increasing the standard deduction is pro-family, and it helps to foster the American dream. It not only leads to Americans keeping more of their hard-[[Page S7401]]earned money, but it also means that simplifying the code will help them save money in tax preparation as well. According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, a married couple with two kids making $85,000 per year, will see their taxes decrease by $2,224. This reform provides money that will allow Americans to plan for their future and to pay their bills. It can be a downpayment on a house or it can be put away for future college tuition or for retirement. It gives millions of earners more empowerment to use these savings for their lives as they see fit.  Simplifying the code isn't the only family-focused provision included in this legislation. The Senate bill doubles the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per child. According to the Department of Agriculture, parents of a child born in 2015 are likely to spend more than $233,000 raising a child to age 17. That doesn't even include college tuition. Doubling the child tax credit will allow families to keep up to an additional $4,000 every year if they have two children or more. This credit builds a stronger future by helping families all across our country keep more money to raise happy and healthy children.  In addition to these changes, this legislation will preserve many other popular deductions. This includes the charitable deduction, medical expense deduction, the student loan interest deduction, the mortgage interest deduction, and the low-income housing tax credit. This bill also continues popular savings programs such as the 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts. These saving incentives are key tools that allow individuals to provide for their families and to prepare for retirement. It empowers Americans to plan ahead.  There are also commonsense provisions in this bill that have been overlooked during the current debate. These are changes everyone here can agree are long overdue. For example, this reform takes away the tax-exempt status for professional sports leagues. We all love sports, but professional sports leagues like the NFL and the PGA shouldn't be allowed to use exemptions for nonprofits to avoid paying taxes. These are for-profit leagues where commissioners make tens of millions of dollars. They should be treated for what they are, and that is a money-making enterprise.  I also want to take the time to address a misconception. Some have argued that this bill will tax the tuition waivers graduate students receive from their universities as a part of attending to their studies. There is no such provision. Ph.research is a staple of higher education, and it drives our Nation's innovation. It helps us better understand our world and often leads to incredible technological advancements. We in the Senate support graduate studies, and none of us want to make it more difficult to obtain graduate degrees or do research at the highest levels. We will not be taxing you for tuition you don't pay while earning a master's or doctorate degree.  There are some other important provisions in this bill that haven't gotten the attention they deserve, and I want to take a moment to discuss some of them. The Senate tax reform retains nearly all of the education incentives that are present in the current Tax Code for students and for teachers. For example, we keep the Hope credit, which allows taxpayers a credit of up to $2,500 per student, per year, for qualified tuition or related expenses. We also keep both the Coverdell and the 529 education savings accounts. These accounts promote saving for school, and they help parents prepare for future tuition. Finally, we double the educator deduction, which helps teachers make their classrooms as friendly for learning as possible. This is a pro-education tax reform bill, and it acknowledges education is a key to our country's future success.  We must also recognize that our economy has changed over the last few decades, and our Tax Code needs to catch up to the times. We have the chance to make history, one that will help working families. My Strong Families Act, which is included in this legislation, would be the first nationwide paid family leave policy in American history. If we want to build a better future for our children, we must tackle problems for families juggling those responsibilities between home and the workplace.  This plan has the potential to make life much easier for working families across our country by providing a tax credit as large as 25 percent for employers who offer up to 12 weeks of paid family leave to their employees. Under programs set up by employers, employees would be able to take an hour, a day, or weeks off for purposes like taking care of a sick child or an ailing parent to make sure they get to a doctor's appointment. They could also take maternity or paternity leave to bond with a newborn or recently adopted child.  In 21st century America, the number of dual-income households is on the rise. According to the Department of Labor, 70 percent of mothers with children under 19 participate in the labor force, with over 75 percent employed full time. For those without the means to take unpaid time off, the burdens of caregiving are a real burden. A recent study from the Pew Research Center found that most individuals who make higher salaries usually have access to some kind of paid family leave, but those making less than that are not always covered. This is why my paid family leave plan limits eligibility to those earning below $72,000 per year. We want these benefits to target hourly and lower salaried workers. We want to increase access to paid family leave for those who need it the most.  While my friends on the other side of the aisle focus on the stick approach to paid family leave--pushing mandates or the creation of new government programs--this bill pursues the carrot approach, and Americans agree with us. A recent study showed that 87 percent of Americans supported a limited government approach that enables employers to provide the benefit themselves.  It is not hard to understand why. The plan balances the need of 21st century workers with the real-world challenges that small businesses face today. Eric Dinger, who is the CEO of a Lincoln startup named Powderhook, put it the best. Eric told me:       I want to offer my employees paid leave, but a mandate      forcing me to do so would be hard. I have to make payroll.      [The Strong Family Act] is much more workable and wouldn't      provide a disincentive to hire anyone.  I agree.  Another of my constituents, Alison Ritter--an employee at Applied Systems, Inc., in Lincoln--is helping her company's leadership develop a paid leave policy. In reaction to my bill being included in the tax reform proposal before us, she told me:       This concept would change the game for many newborn babies      and their parents, allowing them the time they need to bond      and establish a nursing routine without as much of the stress      and guilt they face today. It would provide families with the      financial support they need in order to do what's best for      their family, but also help businesses that struggle with      putting a plan in place due to the financial burden extended      absences create. . . . Our country wins when we focus on and      invest in healthier families.  Sara Rasby, who is the co-owner of Lotus House of Yoga, which has locations across my State agreed:       It is refreshing to see a policy that supports the family      and small business unit. As co-owner of a small business and      a mother of two young children, I know firsthand how      challenging it can be without paid leave. A mother and/or      family needs time to adjust and bond. . . . This bill would      help parents, families, and small business owners be more at      ease with the transitions and changes that come with      maternity leave. Additionally, it will create more community      awareness on the importance of supporting the family      structure through policy.  We need to get this done for people like Eric, Alison, Sara, and other business owners, caregivers, and working parents throughout the country.  I also said my goal in this process is to promote policies that will ensure small businesses succeed. There are over 29 million small businesses throughout our country, and these small firms drive our economy. They have generated over 60 percent of the new jobs created over the last two decades and have made up nearly 98 percent of our exports. They are often the face of our country to the world.  This reform will provide small businesses with additional incentives to invest and grow. When small businesses make money, they invest it back into their businesses and help grow their local economy. Places like Lincoln and Omaha are well known to the entrepreneurial community as bustling hubs of[[Page S7402]]innovation. This bill provides a 17.4-percent deduction for the large majority of small businesses, which will lower their tax bills and give them more financial flexibility. The preservation of things like the 1031 like-kind exchanges and the stepped-up basis will further help our small businesses, especially agriculture businesses.  Small businesses don't have the professional resources to deal with the Tax Code that comes in at over 74,000 pages. Simply doing taxes--let alone paying them--has become a burden on too many of our small companies. Moreover, they cannot take advantage of all the corporate deductions or the little-known loopholes like big companies can. This is not fair. It hurts our competitiveness globally, stifles strong economic growth, and it favors big corporations, which have offices full of lawyers and accountants. This tax reform lessens this disparity and deserves support from everyone who wants to promote American entrepreneurialism.  Lastly, this legislation goes a long way toward making America competitive internationally. A large part of this is lowering the corporate tax rate. At 35 percent, America's corporate tax rate is a full 13 percentage points higher than the average rate of our competitors from the developed world. This is a big reason why companies are fleeing our shores, and they are choosing to set up their headquarters or invest outside of These so-called inversions have been on the rise in recent years, and there is little reason to think that trend will reverse if we stand by and do nothing.  This legislation will put us in line with our trading partners and, once again, make America an attractive place for business, which will lead to more jobs and higher wages for our country.

223,topic-id,1478,"Mr.President, I rise this evening in opposition to the tax bill before us. I think the problem in our country isn't that wealthy people in this country aren't wealthy enough; the problem is, the wealth gap has grown to the highest levels in my lifetime. This bill would make that wealth gap even bigger.  Senator Paul Wellstone often said: ``We all do better when we all do better.'' He knew the economy does better when there is a strong middle class and when working families have more money to spend. Unfortunately, the Republican tax bill does the opposite of what Paul Wellstone argued for. Instead of helping working families, it raises taxes on at least 14 million of them, and it uses this revenue to give $1 trillion to the superrich, all while adding $1.5 trillion to our national debt. This is, at its core, an awful bill.  When President Trump took office, he pledged that he would look out for the ``forgotten men and women,'' not the wealthy. This bill is a betrayal of that commitment.  I believe Congress should work on a bipartisan basis to make our Tax Code fairer and simpler for working families, and that is what I have advocated for since I joined the Democrats have made a good-faith effort to work in a bipartisan manner on a tax reform bill with Republicans, but Republicans have chosen, from the very start of this Congress, to take a purely partisan approach that has left Democrats entirely out of the discussion.  We all know this bill is being rushed through Congress so Republicans can claim a legislative achievement by the end of the year. That is not the way you get a fairer, simpler Tax You get a fairer, simpler Tax Code by having hearings with outside witnesses.[[Page S7674]]You get a fairer, simpler Tax Code by giving Americans an opportunity to weigh in as it is being drafted, to review the bill, and to share their views. You get a simpler, fairer Tax Code by doing it in a bipartisan manner, not by excluding Democrats entirely from the drafting of the bill.  The fast-track process Republicans are using is just like the Republicans' equally partisan, equally secretive, and equally rushed attempt to repeal and replace ObamaCare earlier this year. Americans deserve better.  In their effort to get this bill through before Americans realize just how damaging it is, many Republicans have made some misleading claims about it.  For example, Republicans often cite the fact that the bill would double the standard deduction that families can claim on their tax return. That is true, but they always seem to leave out the very important fact that their bill would also eliminate the personal exemption. The personal exemption is about $4,000 for each family member, so when compared with a $12,000 increase in the standard deduction, it means households with two parents and more than one child would be worse off under the Republican tax bill than under current law; for example, with two children.  Sometimes they argue that doubling the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 would offset the loss of the personal exemption, but under their plan families who most need the help would get hardly anything from the increase in the child tax credit, which is not refundable. So, for instance, a family living off a minimum wage earner would benefit by only about 75 more dollars under this bill's revised child tax credit, not the full $1,000 some Republicans promise, but the Republican bill would also now allow people earning up to $500,000 a year to claim the full tax credit of $2,000 per child. That is $500,000 a year, up from $110,000 as it is now. So that is $75 more per child for a minimum wage earner and $2,000 per child for someone making $500,000 a year. That is just not fair.  We hear from my friends on the Republican side that tax cuts always pay for themselves. Ask the people of Kansas about that. When Kansas cut taxes in 2012 and in 2013, State revenues plummeted, Kansas slashed university budgets, canceled highway projects, and had to borrow $1 billion to fund their public pension plan. Schools around the State started going 4 days a week. Teachers moved across the river from Kansas City, KS, to Kansas City, From 2013 to mid-2017, the Kansas economy underperformed that of nearly all its neighbors and the United States overall in economic growth, private sector job creation, passthrough business formation, and labor force participation. Finally, corporations begged the legislature to raise their taxes, which they did, over the Governor's veto.  That is Kansas; take the whole country. Bruce Bartlett, Ronald Reagan's economic adviser, wrote a few weeks ago:       The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the top personal tax      rate to just 28 percent from 50 percent, and the corporate      percent to 34 percent from 46 percent. Yet there was no      increase in the rate of economic growth in subsequent years,      and by 1990, the economy was in deep recession.  Tax cuts don't magically pay for themselves.  I would also like to highlight the Republican hypocrisy on budget deficits. For many years, Republicans have used budget deficits as an excuse to block important pieces of legislation. In fact, even now, we are in danger of stripping health insurance away from 9 million children because of difficulties finding offsets for reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Yet, when it comes to the tax bill, only a handful of Republicans have raised concerns about the fact that it would add $1.5 trillion to our national debt.  We know from experience that as soon as the ink is dry on this bill, Republicans will cite the rising national debt caused by this bill as a reason to cut key programs that millions of Americans use every day--things like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, job training, education, infrastructure, and affordable housing. In fact, under their budget resolution that Republicans adopted just 2 months ago, they laid out their plans for these reductions, which would include over $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts and $470 billion in Medicare cuts.  This bill would also trigger automatic cuts to some key programs. So in exchange for the bill's minimum tax cuts for some working families, starting in 2018, there would be an automatic 4-percent reduction in Medicare payments and a zeroing out of other key accounts--a zeroing out of the Crime Victims Fund, farm price support programs, and the social services block grant that provides funds to Meals on Wheels, youth counseling, and other important services for vulnerable people.  There are many better uses for $1.5 trillion. President Trump said he wanted to work with Congress on a $1 trillion infrastructure package to rebuild our roads, our airports, our ports, and to build broadband across I have said I would like to work with the President and my Republican colleagues on a comprehensive bill, but this bill would make it impossible to enact a $1 trillion infrastructure package the President promised and which we have really heard nothing about.  There are too many other flaws with the Republican bill to highlight them all now, but I would like to raise one that is particularly important to The bill before us today would eliminate the State and local tax deduction. It is an important deduction because when people deduct the taxes they pay to their State and local governments, first of all, it prevents the double taxation of their income, and it enables our local communities to make investments in public safety and education, childcare, and infrastructure. According to the Tax Policy Center, 34 percent of Minnesotans claim the State and local tax deduction, with an average deduction of almost $13,000. Eliminating this deduction means a significant tax increase for those families and would make it harder for local communities in Minnesota to raise the revenue necessary to make vital investments.  I have heard outrage over the Republican approach to tax reform from a very wide range of my constituents. I have heard from Minnesota farmers about how it would undermine agricultural cooperatives, which are really important to I have heard from Minnesota students who are concerned it will force them out of graduate school. I have heard from Minnesota homebuilders and developers who say it would cut affordable housing construction in half. I have heard from Realtors who say the bill could crater the real estate market. I have heard from many ordinary Americans who say the bill is simply unfair.  Americans deserve a fairer, simpler Tax Code, not the debt-funded giveaway to the wealthy that Republicans are trying to force through the Senate today. That is why I oppose this bill, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it as well.  I yield the floor.

205,topic-id,795,"Mr.President, I want to talk about the importance of passing this tax reform legislation for the people of What we have is an opportunity to see real wage growth in this country--something we haven't seen for far too long. Over the past decade, I think people who are on both sides of the aisle have recognized that while there might be some economic job activity, job creation taking place, while we might see some low economic unemployment numbers in States like Colorado, what we haven't seen is the kind of wage growth we know we can create.  Under the analysis done by nonpartisan think tanks in Colorado, they[[Page S7670]]estimate that wages would grow--after-tax income--by over $3,000. That is incredible wage growth for families who many people estimate and who other economists have said could see a financial hardship if they were asked to come up with $400. In fact, we know that if over one-third of people in America had to come up with $400 today, it would create a financial crisis in their household.  We heard our colleague from Pennsylvania and our colleague from South Dakota talking about the fact that a family earning a median household income of $73,000 would see a 60-percent reduction in their taxes next year. A single parent with a child, earning $41,000 a year, would see a 75-percent tax cut.  Let me read a headline from a story in The headline of this article is ``How Tax Reform Can Empower This Drive-in Theater Owner to Expand Her Business.'' What she is talking about is the fact that if she sees lower taxes at the 88 Drive-in--that is an iconic drive-in in Commerce City, If you see this drive-in, you will know exactly--it is iconic on the landscape. She believes that if her taxes are lower, she will be able to move forward and buy the property next door, which will allow her to expand her business. She talks about the fact that she has to turn people away because so many people are going to it and they don't have enough room. She wants to expand, but she is held back by our uncompetitive Tax If we cut taxes, she will be able to buy land, expand the business, and create more jobs. It is a greater opportunity for her, her family, and the people of  This is really an opportunity to see the kind of growth and wage growth that we haven't seen in this country for far too long.  I have held several roundtables on taxes throughout the Eastern Plains of Colorado, where I live. People are worried about their income because they haven't seen the kind of economic growth, the numbers in employment growth that they have in the Front Range, in I have held roundtables on the Western Slope of Colorado, in Southern Colorado, Northern Colorado, and they are all very worried about a country that is not as competitive as it used to be. They know that with a competitive tax code, they would see those jobs and investment come back into this country once again.  People in Pueblo, CO, know they need jobs brought back into their community because while many areas of Colorado have seen very low unemployment rates, they haven't seen the kind of growth other areas have. They know that with a competitive tax code that brings jobs and money back from overseas, that will provide real relief to a single parent with a child at home and to a family of four working hard to make ends meet. They are going to pay less taxes next year as a result. They are going to be able to spend the money they want to in Pueblo, CO, to put it into an investment that they want to in Brighton, It will be an investment that somebody in Craig, CO, wants to have. That is what they are focused on. They want to get the money into their pockets. They earned it. They should keep it, not Washington, DC, where they make bad decisions on how to spend their hard-earned dollars.  To my colleagues who oppose this bill, we have talked about the opportunities for the American people to see real wage growth. This bill does it. We talked about the opportunity to bring jobs back from overseas. This bill does it. We talked about the opportunity to get businesses hiring again and expanding. Nonpartisan estimates show that this bill would create nearly 1 million jobs--new jobs created by this bill. It is a great opportunity for us, and I thank the people who have worked so hard on this bill, my colleagues in South Dakota, Pennsylvania, and others.  Mr.President, I yield back my time.

1146,topic-id,1808,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to talk about the historic opportunity we have before us to grow the American economy, to create jobs, and to make sure Washington has less money in its pockets and the people across this country have more money in their pockets.  I rise to support the pro-growth tax reform proposal before the I rise to support modernizing and simplifying the American tax system to make it competitive. I rise to support American workers who haven't seen wage growth for far too long. I rise to support American families.  It has been 30 years since this country last reformed the Tax We haven't modernized our Tax Code in over 30 years, since 1986. Since that time, we have had lobbyists and special interests adding on and building on loopholes and giveaways to what once was a competitive tax system. That 30 years of drag on the Tax Code has made it more out-of-date day by day. It is so out-of-date that American families and businesses now spend 6 billion hours and $263 billion every year just to file their taxes. That is bigger than the economic output of the nation of New Zealand, just to file our taxes every year.  Meanwhile, we have watched the world change since 1986 significantly. Other countries have learned how to use their tax codes to entice U.businesses overseas--businesses from around the globe--to their country, to move away from the United States to their countries' more competitive tax code. That disparity between the U.Tax Code and foreign tax rates has literally chased jobs and wages out of this country. Companies now not only invest in low-tax foreign countries, but they leave U.dollars abroad without bringing them back into the United Those billions have piled up, and now it is estimated that there is somewhere around $2.5 trillion in foreign profits being held by U.multinationals overseas.  That tells us three things: 1, corporations will find low-tax jurisdictions; 2, without this reform, it isn't changing anytime soon; 3, American workers are the ones who are paying the cost of this failed economic system. It is the American workers who suffer in the form of higher taxes, lower wages, and a less competitive economy.  We have before us an opportunity to change this. This reform will bring the kind of relief Americans have been demanding for a number of years, for over a decade--lower taxes, higher wages, and less time and hassle filing their taxes. This change will mean that a family of four--according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation--earning the median family income of $73,000 would see a tax cut of nearly $2,202. That is a 60-percent cut next year over what they paid last year with the passage of this bill. A single parent with one child and an income of $41,000 will see a cut of more than $1,400, according to the nonpartisan Tax That is a cut of 70 percent in their tax rates from what they paid this past year to what they would pay next year. This change will bring thousands of dollars in higher wages as companies begin to invest in America again.  The Council of Economic Advisers has estimated that just lowering the corporate rate alone would raise average income around $4,000 to $4,385 in my home State of The academic literature supporting that analysis suggests the gains could even be bigger. This change will reduce the wasted billions of hours spent filling out the paperwork, dotting the i's and crossing the t's, just to file your taxes.  The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that after passage of this bill, about 92 percent of taxpayers will use the standard deduction rate rather than itemize their taxes, and because the standard deduction will have been expanded, they will end up being better off.  It shouldn't be more fun going to the dentist than it is figuring out your taxes. We can't let this moment pass without bringing this relief to America's taxpayers. Doing that would only chase more dollars and jobs out of the country. The result of voting against this reform can be summed up in the information I have right next to me.  Here is the first one. This shows how our corporate tax rate over time--since the 1980s and 1990s--has stayed flat, has stayed the same, while OECD nations and while our competitors have lowered their rates and become more and more competitive over time. Countries like France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece, and country after country have lowered their corporate tax rates far less than our rates today. Indeed, the average European corporate statutory rate is around 18 or 19 percent. The United States remains stuck at 35 percent--the highest statutory tax rate in the industrialized world.[[Page S7519]]  When a company decides it wants to expand or buy new equipment, it looks at these rates to see how much extra revenue it needs to generate in order to make the expansion profitable. The higher the rate, the harder it is to generate enough revenue to justify the investment.  It doesn't take much more than this chart alone to know that investing abroad has made a lot of sense to far too many people. Businesses have responded to this. They have moved. As a result, business investment in capital in the United States is at a low. Investments in new structures, equipment, and intellectual property have some of its lowest rates we have seen.  Indeed, Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett recently warned that there is a ``crisis in our country'' because of the lack of what is called ``capital deepening''--which is what an economist would use for the term meaning the impact of capital stock--on worker productivity. Worker productivity, in turn, is what drives up wages. That makes sense. The more productive a worker is, the more the employer is willing to pay that worker to keep him or her.  That leads us to the other piece of information that is important to look at. You can see the effects here. The relationship between corporate profits and wages has broken down over the past couple of decades. Prior to 1990, when corporate profits went up by 1 percent, wages went up by more than 1 percent, but that has changed because of our uncompetitive tax system. From 2008 to 2016, a 1-percent increase in corporate profits corresponded with only a 0.3-percent increase in worker wages. When we hear about a growing income inequality, which is something we have to address, this is part of the story. This is part of the reason we have income inequality, because that ratio has shifted as a result of people going overseas, money being kept overseas, and our tax rates simply being out-of-date and out of order.  One of the biggest culprits is that corporate tax rate. It is what causes that disconnect between profits and wages. Businesses are investing those dollars overseas, and they lay off workers in the United States, expanding in Poland instead of Portland or not just expanding at all. No matter which option they choose, the American worker loses out. That is why experts say employees bear 45 percent to 75 percent of the burden of corporate taxes--because businesses invest in them less the higher the tax rate goes.  That brings us to the third point of information. The empirical evidence is remarkably clear. Countries with lower tax rates have much higher wage increases than countries with higher corporate tax rates. High-tax countries, like the United States, have weak wage growth, less than 1 percent--even close to zero. You can see this. The highest statutory corporate tax rate countries in the world have less than 1-percent wage growth. High-tax countries, like the United States, have that extremely weak wage growth. Low-tax countries, though, see the wage growth of 1 percent, 1.5 percent, 2 percent, 4 percent, and that is because low-tax countries create an environment that encourages businesses to grow and to expand, while high-tax countries, like the United States, chase money out of the country.  Over the last several years, we have been told we need to get used to low wages--that we have to get used to low wages and low GDP growth. We have been told we just need to accept a secular stagnation theory; that the American economy's prime has gone away. I don't believe that. I don't think anybody in this country should believe that. I believe our economy's best days are ahead of us if we pass the kind of policies we can this week.  Until we get our Tax Code competitive again, there are people who are going to think the secular stagnation is all we can get. They will be stuck with low growth, low wages. Bipartisan groups have pushed for ways to change this: Simpson-Bowles Commission, Wyden-Coats, even President Obama himself called for tax cuts in his 2011 State of the Union In fact, President Obama's economic adviser, Larry Summers, said that reducing the corporate tax rate and lowering the competitive disadvantage faced by American multinationals is ``about as close to a free lunch as tax reformers will ever get.''  Here we stand at the end of this reform process, and the opponents of this reform simply pound their fists on their desks and shoot off standard talking points about millionaires and billionaires. They told us from the outset, in a letter to Senator McConnell, that they didn't want to cut taxes for everyone, so they wouldn't play a meaningful part in crafting the package. What a shame that has been. They could have worked with us, offered proposals that would help us find that solution that benefits all. They rail against different specifics, often mixing up what is in the House proposal with what is in the Senate's proposal because it is politically expedient.  There really have been no honest, substantive amendments to make the bill better, as we have asked time and time again. It is unclear if they will even support amendments that mirror the bills they themselves have introduced because I am afraid the opponents aren't interested in making the bill better. They are interested in a political fight and continuing to see Americans suffer under low wages and high taxes, but they don't tell us why, other than ``just not this bill.''  We have a chance to help the middle class. We have a chance to cut taxes, to grow the economy. For Coloradans, it means more jobs, it means higher wages, it means true economic growth. Let's get away from that Atari-era 1986 Tax Code, and let's put forth something that works for this generation, the next generation, building competitiveness, building opportunity, and building an America we were all proud of.

47,topic-id,223,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  A longer probationary period for new Federal hires is important to give supervisors the time they need to evaluate whether a new hire should gain career employee status. But a longer probationary period will not accomplish anything if supervisors don't use the extended time properly.  Managers often don't know the end dates for probationary employees under their supervision. Because probationary periods end automatically, without action by a supervisor, an employee can be hired without a complete assessment of whether the employee is qualified for full Federal service.  A 2015 Government Accountability Office report recommended automated systems to notify supervisors when the end of an individual's probationary period is imminent.                              {time}  1600  Agencies have these systems. They just need to use them. My amendment requires supervisors to be notified at a series of regular intervals in advance of the expiration of a probationary period. The notifications occur at 1 year, 6 months, 3 months, and 30 days before the scheduled completion of a probationary period.  This notification will remind supervisors of their responsibilities to observe employees and provide feedback throughout the probationary period. It will also remind supervisors to decide whether the employee is fit for Federal service.  Mr.Chairman, I urge Members to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

1644,topic-id,1060,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about the tax plan we will be voting on tomorrow, likely in the middle of the night, and definitely without much needed debate, oversight, and transparency, as it should have.  I think everyone in this Chamber agrees we need to fix our tax system so it doesn't create so much difficulty for the working families in our If this bill actually did that, it would be real reform, and it would be bipartisan. However, this plan does not seek anything close to the type of relief regular working people need. Instead, what it does is this: It pays back wealthy donors and lobbyists through corporate welfare, and it does this at the expense of the middle class. In other words, this is a blatant attempt to take millions of families' hard-earned money and hand it over to rich corporations on the Fortune 500 list.  If the Senate actually goes ahead and passes this bill, corporations and the wealthiest 1 percent of income earners will get massive and permanent tax cuts, and it will blow a $1.5 trillion hole into our deficit. Make no mistake, 3 months from now, Republican leadership will use that new, massive deficit as the reason to cut Social Security, Medicare, and  Why are Republicans in Congress so determined to provide massive corporate welfare? Listen to this actual quote from one Republican Member of Congress, which will tell you everything you need to know about whom this tax plan is really for. He said: My donors are basically saying, ``Get it done or don't ever call me again.''  This is Washington's culture of soft corruption at its absolute worst. Now, somehow after years of talking about it, a massive tax bill has finally made its way to the Senate floor and, after all that talk, it doesn't even help the middle class. It does the exact opposite.  Here is one very simple example that sums it all up. This bill eliminates the deduction for local and State taxes, known as the SALT deduction, which so many Americans need to help them stay afloat. The SALT deduction prevents hard-working families from being double taxed on their income. It has long been our policy that when workers pay their State and local taxes, the IRS doesn't tax them twice on the same income, but the Republican tax plan now repeals this. In effect, this plan would make it so you are taxed on everything you make and then you will be taxed again. Why? Because corporations need a big tax break and to pay for the tax breaks for the richest  In many cases, the SALT deduction makes it possible for families to afford to buy a home, which is usually a family's largest asset, and it keeps the value of this investment growing. Eliminating the SALT deduction would hurt New Yorkers, and it would hurt millions of There is literally no other way to spin it.  When the details of this tax plan were released, we started hearing a lot of dredged up old talk about the supposed virtues of trickle-down economics--the myth that if only corporations had more money, it would help American families. Well, we have heard this one before, and let's not be fooled again.  Let's take a look at the state of things right now. The biggest companies in America are flush with cash, the stock market has never been higher, but cities, towns, and rural areas all over my State have been hit hard over and over again by companies that have packed up and left for cheaper labor and fatter profits abroad. So then why would we reward them by giving them yet another tax cut they don't need and will not go to their workers?  President Trump's top economic adviser recently asked a roomful of CEOs to raise their hands if this extra cash from the tax cut would get them to reinvest in their communities. No more than a handful of CEOs in the room raised their hand. I know a lot of people like to pretend otherwise, but is that really a surprise to anyone here?[[Page S7386]]In fact, several CEOs have said on the record that instead of hiring more workers or raising their pay, many companies will reward shareholders and not workers by increasing dividends or buying back their own shares.  This plan could not be more misguided because we should be rewarding work, not shareholder value. Let me put it another way. Just yesterday, the Dow broke another record with a new alltime high, and I am sure many CEOs will get a massive bonus for that, but what I want to know is this: When the Dow broke that record, how many workers on factory floors in Pennsylvania or in New York saw their pay increase? How many workers in grocery stores saw their pay increase? How many families in your State were given big pay raises that reflected those historic profits? I think we all know the answer to that question.  In our economy today, even as corporations are earning more money than ever before, there is essentially no benefit for families. The wealth does not trickle down, and this tax plan would make that problem even worse.  This tax plan helps the wrong people. It helps the people and corporations that don't need any extra help right now. It ignores the people who do. We need to start rewarding work in this country again, not doling out lavish tax cuts for giant companies. I can't say this clearly enough to New Yorkers and to hard-working Americans all over this country: If you are not rich, if you are just a regular hard-working family, then there is a very good chance you are going to take a big hit if this bill passes.  I urge every one of my colleagues to do what is right for families and oppose this plan. Tax reform should never be a partisan exercise, and we should all agree that our goal should be to help middle-class workers and their families. So let's pass a bill that actually does that. Huge corporations do not need our help. They are going to be just fine. Instead, let's finally start rewarding work in this country again.

428,topic-id,5137,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate my colleague pointing out that we have done something good here.  When people talk about the tax bill that was passed, it is not everything everybody wanted, that is for sure. It is not everything Republicans wanted, but it is going to do good for most every  I would love to have seen just an across-the-board tax cut. I would like to have seen a tax cut that brought everybody to pay the same exact percentage. You make more, you pay more; you make less, you pay less.  For those who believe in a tithe, that kind of always worked well for the Everybody pays the same percentage, whether it is a widow's mite or hundreds of billions of dollars or the billions that Warren Buffett refuses to have his company pay even though he says he would love to pay for taxes. He ought to tell his lawyers that.  In any event, there are people who were paying 10 percent who are now not going to pay any taxes. I don't see how anybody across the aisle could keep saying it is going to be worse for the poor, because those who were paying 10 percent tax are not going to pay any tax. It is good for them. It is great for them.  I would love to see everybody have something that they pay in--something--so that they have some investment in the income tax system. It seems to help focus people's attention on government when they see how much they are paying into the Federal Government when it is a real percentage. The bill cuts completely any income tax for those who were paying 10 percent.  For those who were paying 25 percent, they are being cut to 12 percent. It is a tremendous tax advantage for them. In fact, you see that all the way through the tax bill, the creation of which was led by Kevin Brady, chairman of the Ways and Means He did an incredible job bringing all the different interests together to get a great bill.  At the upper end, the 39.6 percent tax was not changed. I guess the reason the committee decided they wanted to leave the 39.6 for the wealthiest Americans in place is because that way the Democrats could not come in--I know this was the thinking: If the only tax rate we don't lower is for the wealthiest Americans, we leave that where it is, then they can't come in and say we[[Page H9615]]are cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans and putting it on the backs of the poorest  Well, they have come in and said it anyway. We might as well have given everybody a fair tax break instead of leaving the wealthiest taxes right where they were, 39.6 percent, because they still came in and said it. Schumer is still saying it in the  The truth is, when you look at the tax rates that people will pay and the exemptions being doubled, it is going to be much better for most people.  There were some things in the Senate bill I liked. I didn't realize, but I heard from people back home, we do have some seniors who do pay so much in medical expense that takes such a tremendous amount of the small income they have that they do have enough to take deductions for their medical expenses. If they are not allowed to take those medical expenses as deductions, accountants tell me many of their clients will end up being bankrupt.  The Senate left that provision in, and I am hopeful that that will be in the final bill. We don't need to be hurting our seniors who are paying so much in medical expenses even though they were assured ObamaCare would cure all ills when it came to healthcare.  If you like your insurance, you can keep it. Well, that turned out to be a lie.  If you like your doctor, you could keep your doctor. That turned out to be a lie.  If you liked the medicine you were taking, you could keep taking that medicine. It turned out to be a lie.  In fact, there were actual incentives in ObamaCare for the insurance companies not to bring in the best cancer treaters, the best heart facilities, because that means people with cancer and heart problems would sign up for those policies, and they might have to pay too much.  So it was really deviously inventive by the architect of ObamaCare to create a system that is going to be so bad it is going to fail at some point. The hope was that, when that day came, people would throw up their hands say: This is awful. I never thought I would say this, but maybe we are better off just letting the government take over every bit of healthcare.  Well, the government was already close to taking over all healthcare under ObamaCare, but as Senator Obama told people on video, it is basically government running all phases of healthcare. They give it a deceptive name: single-payer. But we can't get there in one step. It will take a couple of steps.                              {time}  2115  Well, ObamaCare was step one, and a complete government takeover of people's healthcare was step two.  Fortunately, if we can add to the House bill what was added into the Senate bill, a complete repeal of the individual mandate, then we will be on our way to bringing down premiums, to having people choose the health insurance policies they want.  Ultimately, we have got to encourage people to put their own money not in the pocket of the government, not in the pocket of the insurance company, but into their own health savings accounts and build that up. That is the hope for the future for young people: to have enough money in their account down the road that, by the time they become senior citizens, not only will they not want government intrusion, they won't need it.  Those that are chronically ill, chronically poor, and cannot work, we have got to reform welfare and return the requirements that were put in place that caused single moms for the first time in 30 years to start making much more than they had, when their income had been flat for 30 years when adjusted for inflation. I was surprised to see that on a chart--on a graph at Harvard, at a seminar up there; but sure enough, the facts spoke for themselves.  There are things we can do to help people return to work, to take care of themselves, make their own decisions, and I think this tax bill will help do that, especially if we put in the repeal of the individual mandate, as surprised as I am to keep hearing about how this tax bill is going to hurt the poor in  When the people who are paying 10 percent tax don't pay any tax, the people who were paying 25 percent start paying 12 percent tax, it is just really hard to accept someone saying that they are going to be paying more tax to help the rich when the rich did not get a tax reduction from the 39.6 percent.  I do want to take up a critically important decision by the Supreme Court of the United There is an article from Ian Mason today: ``President Donald Trump's travel ban is once again to largely go back into effect after the Supreme Court of the United States stayed two lower courts' injunctions  ``The orders come in response to filings by the Department of Justice Friday, asking the Supreme Court to stay the preliminary injunctions in the two main travel ban cases, Hawaii v. Trump in the Ninth Circuit and International Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump in the Fourth These cases have been proceeding up and down the Federal court system for months.''  I do think, in the Judiciary Committee, it is time that we start bringing in some of these renegade judges who were not content to wear black robes and be judges, but took on the role of being legislators and being elected executives. They took all three branches into themselves, because basically what power the President didn't have to fully invoke the travel ban, Congress had given him any extra that he needed. He had full authority to do what he did.  Anybody can see that people could come in from countries where radical Islam was destroying the countries, and there were messages from the leaders of those radical Islamic groups who said: We are getting our soldiers into these groups of refugees that are going into Western civilization so that we can destroy them.  I mean, they weren't even hiding what they were doing, although they didn't tell us which individuals were their soldiers.  We had heard previously about vetting of individuals. We heard testimony in our committee that at least people coming from Iraq, when they applied to be refugees, they had some background we could compare and contrast what they were saying about their reasons to come in. We even had fingerprints on We had their criminal records from We had their government records from But as they came from Syria, some other countries, when Yemen was in chaos, we did not have the government records. We didn't have fingerprints. We didn't have anything.  We were told by those charged with the obligation of vetting these individuals: We will vet them, but we have got absolutely nothing to vet them with, so they will end up coming in, because we have got nothing to say that what they are saying is not true, even when they are radical Islamists who want to kill Americans and destroy our way of life.  What President Trump did was exceedingly reasonable, yet we had a Deputy Attorney General, Sally Yates, step forward and say: I am going to take on the role of President and justice and legislator and tell you I am not going to defend this law because I have judged it not to be up to my standards.  Well, she was wrong. She was wrong then and she is wrong today as she talks about issues even after her judgment is shown to be so flawed, as the Supreme Court has.  I know the travel ban was changed somewhat, but still, from what the Supreme Court has indicated, the President had the power to do what he did to protect Americans, despite what ``Justice'' Sally Yates said, without her black robe on, when she defied orders and defied the Constitution and refused to carry out her duties.  So that is a bit of good news.  Sarah Carter has another great story today that she got out. It can be found on hannity.com: ``FBI Supervisor Booted From Mueller Probe Interviewed Mike Flynn.''  The article says: ``A supervisory special agent who is now under scrutiny after being removed from Robert Mueller's special counsel's office for alleged bias against President Trump also oversaw the Bureau's interviews of embattled former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, this reporter has learned. Flynn recently pled guilty to one count of lying to the FBI last week.[[Page H9616]]  ``FBI agent Peter Strzok was one of two FBI agents who interviewed Flynn, which took place on January 24 at the White House, said several sources. The other FBI special agent who interviewed Flynn is described by sources as a field supervisor in the `Russian Squad, at the FBI's Washington field office,' according to a former intelligence official with knowledge of the interview.  ``Strzok was removed from his role in the special counsel's office after it was discovered he had made disparaging comments about President Trump in text messages between him and his alleged lover, FBI attorney Lisa Page, according to The New York Times and Washington Post, which first reported the stories. Strzok is also under investigation by the Department of Justice Inspector General for his role in Hillary Clinton's email server and the ongoing investigation into Russia's election meddling. On Saturday, the House Intelligence Committee's chairman, Devin Nunes, chided the Justice Department and the FBI for not disclosing why Strzok had been removed from the special counsel 3 months ago, according to a statement given by the chairman.  ``The former U.intelligence official told this reporter, `with the recent revelation that Strzok was removed from the special counsel investigation for making anti-Trump text messages, it seems likely that the accuracy and veracity of the 302 of Flynn's interview as a whole should be reviewed and called into question.' ''  Now, the 302 is the section 302 report summary by the FBI agent of what was said by the witness.  So we have a biased witness at the FBI who is not recording what Mike Flynn said word for word. He is writing down in his notes his biased, skewed opinion of what Mike Flynn said. We know it is biased, it is skewed.  Since Mike Flynn worked faithfully for so many years under--and survived--the purges over and over of Commander in Chief Obama and very, very briefly worked for Donald Trump, it would appear that Mike Flynn should have had more credibility than this Strzok character who hated Donald Trump so much.  I have heard talk that Mike Flynn could have fought this, but he basically had been bankrupted by the Department of He could not afford the attorney's fees anymore and, as sometimes happens, they threatened to go after his son. So he agreed to plea on this one count, since apparently the biased, prejudiced, partisan FBI agent Strzok had something different in his notes, his summary of what Mike Flynn said than what Mike Flynn said he said. So he pled out from under the terrible legal fees and this task force that seems to have unlimited authority, that doesn't seem to be reined in by Mr.Rosenstein that appointed  Then we found out, well, heck no, of course not, because Rosenstein and Mueller were involved in getting files sealed; the facts of which, from what we understand, should have prevented the sale of American uranium from ever going forward.  So it only makes sense, gee, to convince Jeff Sessions to recuse himself. He says he talked to the career guys, like He considered Rosenstein a career guy. Then he appoints his buddy who helped him in the Russian investigation over a number of years, which established that Russia was trying to corner the market, that they were bribing and they were committing crimes trying to get American uranium. For heaven's sake, if all of that came out, then Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been able to get her buddies to approve that sale so that Russia could end up with so much of our uranium.                              {time}  2130  Of course, if Russia didn't end up with so much of our uranium, do you really think $145 million from Uranium One--from the stockholders who ended up with the uranium and all the money that flowed with it, do you really think they would have given that to the Clinton Foundation? Because let's face it, they haven't given a dime since.  If they were all that charged up with all the good the Clinton Foundation was doing, doesn't it make sense they would have kept giving after Hillary Clinton was no longer the Secretary of State and when there was still hope of her being President? Even though that is gone, gee, wouldn't they have still contributed if it was all about the good the Clinton Foundation was doing?  Instead of a quid pro quo, if you get us this uranium, we will make you rich. You will hit the Russian lottery, the megamillions lottery for the And hit the Russian lottery they did.  ``A former FBI agent said the investigation into Strzok and the reported text messages between him and Page shows a `bias that cannot be ignored particularly if he had anything to do with Flynn's interview and his role in it.'  ``The former U.intelligence official questioned, `how logical is it that Flynn is being charged for lying to an agent whose character and neutrality was called into question by the special counsel.'  ``According to an anonymous source in The Washington Post, Strzok and Page had exchanged a number of texts that `expressed anti-Trump sentiments and other comments that appeared to favor Clinton.'''  That was apparently between Strzok and his lover. So it is not because he is a man full of hate; apparently, he is a man full of love.  ``McCabe told Flynn: `Some agents were heading over to the White House, but Flynn thought it was part of the routine work the FBI had been doing and said they would be cleared at the gate,' the source said.  ``'It wasn't until after they were already in Flynn's office that he realized he was being formally interviewed. He didn't have an attorney with him,' they added.''  ``According to another source with direct knowledge of the January 24 interview, McCabe had contacted Flynn by phone directly at the White White House officials had spent the `earlier part of the week with the FBI overseeing training and security measures associated with their roles so it was no surprise to Flynn that McCabe had called.'''  Snuck up on him. Apparently that is supposed to be a lesson: the FBI calls, you never know if it is somebody who hates you and hates the people you work for.  An article by Daniel Flynn of Breitbart: ``The former Assistant Director of the FBI wonders who investigates the investigators in the wake of former Trump administration National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleading guilty to lying to the FBI and agreeing to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller's probe.  ``'Bob Mueller should have never been offered nor accepted the job as special counsel as he has a huge conflict of interest,' Jim Kallstrom tells Breitbart `He should have recused himself.'''  It sounds like what I have been saying for many months now.  ``Not only do observers describe Mueller and the man he recommended to replace him as FBI Director, James Comey, as close or even best friends, but the special counsel pursues an investigation heavily involving the Bureau he once led. How one maintains detachment in leading a team that includes numerous anti-Trump partisans in a probe involving one's close friend and the former Bureau for which Mueller served as Director goes unexplained.  ``Other problems Kallstrom sees include the means by which investigators obtained information and what constituted probable cause to obtain it.  ``'The Obama administration apparently had the advantage of using electronic surveillance, collecting information on the Trump campaign,' Kallstrom explains. `That collection, in my view, may be found to be unlawful.'  ``At the very least, one administration conducting surveillance on the opposition party looking to replace it strikes as unusual if not unprecedented. In 1972, for instance, President Richard Nixon's political team relied on former agents of the FBI and CIA to gather intelligence on the Democratic  ``If the surveillance and investigatory methods prove unlawful, Kallstrom notes that this puts Mueller in an awkward position of looking into its close friend and perhaps the Bureau that both men once led.  ``'If they used the phony dossier as the predicate for the FISA order they obtained, that could be a huge problem,' Kallstrom tells Breitbart News.[[Page H9617]]`If they knew the information was phony, that is a felony. If they did not know it was phony, they were incompetent.'  ``The `dossier,' which Americans belatedly discovered as an opposition research investigation funded by Hillary Clinton's campaign and other partisan sources, served as a justification in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court to obtain a wiretap to Trump campaign adviser Carter Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence officer who compiled the opposition research dubbed an intelligence dossier in the media, admits that he neither traveled to Russia nor spoke to many of the sources for the anti-Trump document that the Clinton campaign funded and the FBI used in its investigation.  ``'This whole matter with the dossier and the investigations that ensued, including FISA surveillance and the unmasking of hundreds of names, in my view, will prove to be violations of the rules set down by the Congress for unmasking, or worse, will be found to be violations of Federal law,' Kallstrom concludes. `The Justice Department should find out if the FBI paid for this phony dossier and should inspect the affidavit that was given to FISA court to determine the accuracy of their probable cause.'''  Hopefully, that is what is being done at this time, but, as I understand it, the pro-Hillary Clinton people still at the Justice Department have not been forthcoming with the information. That remains to be seen.  Other articles are talking about the anti-Trump text messages showing a pattern of bias on Mueller's team, by Chuck Ross today in the Daily  Jonathan Easley with The Hill: ``FreedomWatch Sues to Remove Mueller.''  Thank goodness for FreedomWatch doing so.  The article says: ``A conservative group filed suit on Monday seeking to remove special counsel Robert Mueller from the Justice Department's investigation into Russian meddling.  ``Conservative lawyer Larry Klayman, the founder of the watchdog group FreedomWatch, filed a complaint in U.District Court that seeks to force the Justice Department to investigate leaks from the special counsel, as well as `the obvious conflicts of interest among staff.'  ``The complaint against Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray states that `it is a criminal offense to leak grand jury information' and seeks Mueller's removal.  ``'Robert Mueller is not a ``man of integrity'' as the Washington, D.C., Democrat and Republican political establishment like to spin,' Klayman said in a statement. `He is just another pol who is representing his establishment benefactors in both political parties who want to see the Presidency of Donald Trump destroyed.'  ``There is deep anger at Mueller on the right and growing calls for him to recuse himself from the special counsel investigation into whether Trump campaign officials had improper contacts with Moscow during the 2016 election.  ``Klayman is hanging his legal effort on the notion that Mueller is too close to former FBI Director James Comey and allegations that his team has leaked damaging stories about those he's investigating to the press. The complaint also argues that Mueller has politicized the probe by hiring Democrats for his investigative team.  ``Conservatives have also argued that Mueller's probe has extended beyond his mandate of investigating Russian meddling.  ``More recently, conservative media and others on the right have drawn attention to Mueller's time as FBI Director, questioning why he didn't alert regulators that a subsidiary of a foreign uranium mining company was under investigation before a controversial deal for the sale of the company to a Russia-owned firm was approved.  ``'He must be held accountable to the law and should not be able to do as he pleases to further his and his friends', like former FBI Director James Comey's, political agenda,' Klayman said. `We are hopeful that the court will order Justice to do its job and conduct an expeditious and impartial investigation and then order Mueller to step down as special counsel. There are others, perhaps who practice outside of the Washington, D.C., swamp, who could step in and do an honest and conflict-free investigation of so-called Russian collusion.'''  Quite interesting, but this article today from Samantha Schmidt, Washington Post, is quite ironic. ``James Comey, Sally Yates and Eric Holder Defend FBI After Trump's Twitter Attack.''  Now, this is the same Eric Holder who lied to us repeatedly in our Judiciary Committee hearings. He obfuscated, concealed evidence, refused to disclose evidence, was found in contempt, but he still has the unmitigated gall to step forward as if he is a paragon of virtue and can stand up for Mueller's character, I guess.  Comey also has taken to tweeting out Bible verses. I think that is wonderful. I applaud him reading the I wish he had been relying on the Bible a little more when he was FBI Director before he started preparing the statement that would indicate there was nothing to prosecute Hillary Clinton over before she was actually investigated and before he gave immunity to people, before he let her lawyer, who was a witness, sit in on conversations before he was part of exonerating her, even though the evidence that he recited made clear an offense had been committed.  There were stories that the only reason he came out before the election and said he was reopening the investigation was so that he could keep FBI agents who had found all these tens of thousands of emails on Anthony Weiner's computer, Huma Abedin's--they said that this surely justifies because here are emails that she said didn't exist.  So he goes public and says they reopened. If that is true, they kept those FBI agents from coming forward, resigning, or saying that he was doing what it appears now, with more evidence, that he was apparently doing, exonerating Hillary Clinton, though evidence was there to go further.  I remember telling some media back then, well, we will know whether this is a serious reopening of the investigation, words like that. If he comes back in a week and says, ``Oh, no,'' before the election, ``nothing here,'' then clearly he would not have had enough time to go through all the emails. And they hadn't, but he came forward and exonerated her anyway.  The New York Post had an article yesterday, the editorial board: ``Another Anti-Trump `Smoking Gun' Turns Out to Be Nothing.''  ``Once again, a supposed big break in the drive to destroy President Trump over `collusion' with the Russians during the 2016 campaign stands exposed as nothing more than bad reporting. Plus, the professionalism of the FBI looks compromised by anti-Trump bias.''  As it does by the comments by people like Yates, Holder, and  It says: ``The media went berserk Friday on news that former Trump confidante Mike Flynn had copped a plea deal with special counsel Bob All the usual suspects launched an orgy of speculation on what beans Flynn `must' have spilled.  ``It all went into overdrive as ABC's Brian Ross reported that Flynn had been instructed to reach out to Moscow during the campaign: This seemed to be the long-awaited proof of collusion with Vladimir Putin against Hillary  ``Except that Ross retracted the claim hours later: The reach-out was only after election day, when any President-elect is expected to start connecting with other world leaders, U.S.-friendly or not.''                              {time}  2145  That is the whole sad thing about Mike It was not a crime for him to reach out to the Russians after the election. The claim was that there was some big collusion to bring down Hillary Clinton, when it appears we really don't know who hacked into the DNC server. It certainly could have been an inside job involving the Awan brothers, or at least Imran Pretty sad days.  The Hill reports dismissed FBI agent changed Comey's language on Clinton emails to ``extremely careless.'' Olivia Beavers, today, reported:  ``The former FBI official, who was recently fired from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia team over messages critical of President Trump, reportedly edited a key phrase that removed possible legal implications in[[Page H9618]]former FBI Director James Comey's statement about his decision on the Hillary Clinton email investigation.  ``Peter Strzok, who served as a counterintelligence expert at the Bureau, changed the description of Clinton's actions in Comey's statement, CNN reported Monday, citing U.officials familiar with the matter.  ``One source told the news outlet that electronic records reveal that Strzok changed the language from `grossly negligent' to `extremely careless,' scrubbing a key word that could have had legal ramifications for An individual who mishandled classified material could be prosecuted under Federal law for `gross negligence.' ''  Pretty tragic.  The article goes on to say:  ``Strzok, who served as the 2 official leading the probe into the Clinton email server, has been thrust into the center of controversy after news of his dismissal from Comey's team.  ``A group of people were part of the drafting process, using a red pen on Comey's statement before he publicly came forward, another U.official familiar with the matter told  ``Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley questioned the revised language change after receiving FBI records last month before CNN reported Strzok's edits.  ``Mueller and his team are broadly investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, including whether Trump campaign aides colluded with the Russians.''  And, boy, ``broadly investigating'' is an understatement.  ``In July 2016, Comey said that Clinton's use of a private email server while Secretary of State was `extremely careless,' but he added that `no reasonable prosecutor' would charge her.''  Mr.Speaker--I want to finish on this note--Salem, Oregon; FOX News; Jonathan Easley reporting:  ``A Mexican man, who was deported from the United States more than a dozen times was sentenced Friday in Oregon to 35 years in prison after pleading guilty to sodomy, kidnapping, sex abuse, and other charges in separate attacks on two women.  ``Sergio Jose Martinez told victims' relatives he would see them in hell after sentence was pronounced Friday in a Portland courtroom.''  And I would interject, there is a decent chance they may not be at the same place he is in the next life.  ``Just a day earlier, another man who had also been deported multiple times for being in America illegally, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, was found not guilty by a jury in San Francisco in the shooting death of a woman. That case that touched off a national immigration debate.''  I just want to finish by saying that there is a lot of talk about amnesty, DACA, all these different things, but, Mr.Speaker, the truth is: until the border is secured, we should not even be talking about amnesty, about any kind of legality for people who are here illegally, because it creates another swarm across our border. And if we are going to do this, we are going to have to keep doing it every few years because the people are going to keep coming.  We must build a wall where it is needed, and we must secure the border. When that is done, we can work these other things out. But until the border is secured, we should not even be talking about it.  People, like these criminals, these rapists, shouldn't even have been in this country. People are dead who should be alive.

570,topic-id,789,"Mr.Speaker, as folks head back to their districts--and I will be doing so shortly--it is important to take a look at some things that have been rather important here in our country.[[Page H9589]]  The Department of Justice does need an investigation into the matters that have been raised and clearly were not handled properly regarding the Russian Uranium One program and the sale of a significant percentage of United States uranium, ultimately, to  There appears to be collusion, for sure. It is still staggering to think that the person who accepted the role as special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, would accept that, knowing that he and the person that selected him as special prosecutor, Mr.Rosenstein, were involved in the Russian investigation that went on for a number of years and involved a person working undercover and clearly established for Director Mueller, as head of the FBI, and for Mr.Rosenstein, the U.Attorney, that Russia was trying to corner the market by acquiring American uranium.  Yet, while you had a man like Jeff Sessions trying to go out of his way to ensure that nobody could say he acted inappropriately--I think it was done prematurely, but he recused himself--not wanting to be a burden to the  As much as Attorney General Jeff Sessions was trying to be fair and avoid even the appearance of questions about him handling the Russian investigation, you had Robert Mueller and the Deputy Attorney General acting--or appeared to be--even more inappropriately than Jeff Sessions was acting, beyond the pale of honor, as they are two people involved in the investigation of Russia acquiring American uranium, even though it wasn't just Hillary Clinton that signed off on it. It was also Eric Holder and some others.                              {time}  1145  All that needed to be investigated, but not by the people who covered up the prior Russia investigation and saw to the sealing of many of the documents involving that investigation. In fact, Mr.Rosenstein's name was actually on the motion to seal matters involved in that investigation.  It seemed pretty clear that if you are going to go to the trouble of sealing an investigation like that, and the extraordinary measure of getting the person who is acting undercover, force him, threaten him, get him to sign a nondisclosure agreement under threat, seems to me that wasn't an arm's-length transaction. That was done under coercion by the most powerful law enforcement people in the country at the time, threatening to bring down the full weight of the United States Government on the man who was working for them, helping them find the evidence that showed how Russia was acting so inappropriately and illegally trying to get hold of our uranium.  Just when you think, ``Well, just can't be much more in the way of surprises,'' The Daily Caller's Richard Pollock has a story on November 30: ``DOD Inspector General Opens Probe Into Alleged Retaliation by Obama Holdover.''  It says: ``The Pentagon's Inspector General has launched a preliminary investigation into charges that James Baker, the Director of the Defense Department's Office of Net Assessment, ONA, is retaliating against a whistleblower who warned of `rigged' contracts to outside consultants, The Daily Caller News Foundation has confirmed.  ``The DCNF verified through two independent sources that the Acting IG, Glenn Fine, initiated a formal `Whistleblower Reprisal Investigation' September 28 to look into allegations that Baker unleashed various reprisals against Adam Lovinger, a senior ONA official. Lovinger warned about potential sweetheart deals to politically connected outside contractors, including one with a woman Chelsea Clinton has referred to as her `best friend.'  ``The IG is investigating Baker's actions under Presidential Policy Directive-19, an October 2012 directive designed to protect members of the intelligence community who report waste, fraud, and abuse. The directive pointedly states that it `prohibits retaliation against employees for reporting waste, fraud, and abuse.'  ``Baker is an Obama holdover appointed by Secretary Ashton Carter in May 2015, who remains the ONA Director 11 months into the Trump administration.''  I might insert here: This has got to be so frustrating to the President of the United States as the Senate Democrats continue to hold up efforts to get nominations confirmed so that he can start implementing the policies that he was elected to carry out. They are thwarting him by continuing to have Obama holdovers, even though that term apparently, we are told, offends our National Security Advisor McMaster--a guy who apparently can't stand the President and is thwarting his efforts at every turn he can.  But the guy is an Obama holdover. He should not be making calls, yet he is staying around, according to this information, to carry out vendettas against someone who was a whistleblower complaining of sweetheart deals to people, including ",CREC-2017-12-01-pt1-PgH9588-7.txt,1801,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,1,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1574,topic-id,6015,"Mr.Speaker, we had a lot to be thankful for this Anybody who was in America, in the United States, has a lot to be thankful for. People are counting on us across the country to make sure we don't mess the country up because we have done a great deal of damage from Washington, much of it done by bureaucrats.  But the only way they can do it is when Congress relegates and delegates obligations that we should have to bureaucrats, especially unaccountable bureaucrats like those at the Consumer Financial Protection  It is time to get power back to where there is accountability. And there is a better chance of having accountability right here in Congress than there is in some agency, some bureau that thumbs its nose at the executive, legislative, and judicial branches and says: We are above the We are above everything else in the country. We do what we want to, and nobody can say otherwise.  Well, they are finding out at the CFPB that that is not the case. Everybody in America has some accountability somewhere.  It makes me smile to hear friends from across the aisle talking about running up a deficit because I remember that talk in 2006, and we were properly excoriated on the Republican side of the aisle for running up a deficit of around $160 billion more than we brought in. We were castigated. We were beat up in all kinds of ways, and Democrats were right.  Who would have ever dreamed that the people who were belittling Republicans for allowing a $160 billion deficit would soon be so very proud since they had the majority in the House, the Senate, the Presidency, just a couple of short years later, they would have a $1.5 trillion to $1.6 trillion deficit?  We would be treated to the first 4 and the first 8 years in our Nation's history under a President during which the economy never grew up to 3 percent. It never grew up to 3 percent. It did not, the whole time the Democrats had the majority in the House and the Senate, those 4 years they had the majority in the House and  That time when they had the House, the Senate, and the White House, they managed to run up the debt higher than anyone has ever come close to before. But the good news for those who have forgotten that the talk of $160 billion deficit being so outrageous before[[Page H9463]]they ran up a $1.5 trillion to $1.6 trillion deficit, those who don't remember those days can be reminded of those now as we begin to hear the rhetoric about the current proposed appropriation.  We passed all 12 appropriations here in the We did our work. It is time the Senate did their work. Now we are being told: Oh, well, you have got to get over all that stuff you did. All of that hard work, all the cuts to Planned Parenthood, all the things you did standing on principle down there in the House, you have got to forget about that because we don't work like that down in the We are just going to be lucky to fund the projects we are interested in. We have no interest in taking up the hard work that the House of Representatives did.  But it is time the Senate tried that. I think if they will look into the appropriation bills the House passed, they will find out we actually did some very good, solid, amazing work.  For some reason, before we ensure that the Second Amendment applies everywhere across the country that the Constitution meant for it to apply, we are going to take up a background check bill tomorrow. The abbreviation is NICS, which gathers information on people's backgrounds who want to buy a gun. Despite all of the inaccurate information that is often touted about the lack of background checks, of how you can order online or at gun shows, these kind of things, there are background checks when you order online.  It is really unfair to the gun stores who didn't actually make the sale, but anybody who orders a gun online still has to have the background check, and they still have to go in and pick it up at a store and meet the requirements of the law and the background check.  We have heard many times about how the background checks have prevented 3 million Americans who should not have guns from getting guns, but that is not true nor accurate. Apparently, the last year that the Obama administration decided to bless us with actual information about background checks, they reported that about 73,000 Americans were prevented from getting a gun on the first check under the law as it exists. There are five different checks. And because the first check does not take all of the information that someone buying a gun has to fill out, not the date of birth, not Social Security number, not any of the information that is replete on the document being filled out, none of that is used.  They take a phonetic--well, the pronunciation of the name and use the phonetic pronunciation to do a background check. That is why they have so many millions of hits since this has been going on is because if someone's name just sounds a bit like somebody else's, it comes up as a hit and an initial denial.  But then at each stage, each one of those five checks, more and more are found to not be the person who should be prevented from having a gun. In the last year--we have data--I was talking to John Lott about this earlier this afternoon, but in 2010, there were 73,000 denials, approximately, of the ability to buy a gun.  As they went through each of those five checks, they found out that so many actually were not the person who should have been blocked from buying a gun. When the Obama administration got down to the bare facts, they found that out of about 73,000 initial denials, there were only 42 cases that were referred to be prosecuted for potential prosecution.  If I recall correctly, the Obama administration only prosecuted about a fourth of what the Bush administration prosecuted. So out of the 42--and I don't mean 42,000 out of 73,000, I mean 42.0 out of 73,000--the Obama administration only decided to get 13 convictions.  Mr.Speaker, there were 73,000 initial denials. It tells you the system doesn't work very well at all. It doesn't make sense that we would have a system that would use all of the information that somebody provides to look for hits of somebody who should not be able to buy a gun. Use the date of birth. Use the Social Security number. Use the information there to check to see if someone is ineligible to buy a gun.  Then we can get serious about better gun enforcement, especially since we now have a Department of Justice--except for the special prosecutor that is interested in just them, just us kind of justice--except for that special prosecutor's group, we do have a Department of Justice that truly is interested in doing justice.  So when it comes to background checks, yes, we will continue to have them, but I hope we make some needed changes in the law, and I also hope that we are able to pass a bill this week out of committee, get it to the floor, pass it out of here, and hopefully the Senate will do their job on it. But that would allow reciprocity for people who are allowed to carry a gun in one jurisdiction to be able to carry that gun across the country. It is something we are working on.  Mr.Speaker, I was so greatly encouraged seeing an article about Those people have always been such an independent-minded people, even though they have been yanked to and fro. Whether it is Russia, Prussia, Germany, they have had a difficult time--They have had a tough time. But they have always been independent-minded. As President Reagan and as the former Polish Pope noted, and as President Trump has noted, Poland, generally speaking, understands what people who go through the 12-step program understand. There is a higher power.  But by the grace of God, we would not have this incredible little experiment in self-government. We would never have lasted as long as we have. There are miracles where the divine hand of God truly stepped in during the Revolutionary War, during the early days as a nation when we could have, and probably should have, fallen, one after another. As the Founders would say, divine providence protected this little experiment, and it is in trouble right now.  There are so many people who have been taught across the country that America is an embarrassment and owes the world an apology.                              {time}  2030  Bill Ayers and all of those who were hippies--not all of them, but so many of them who were hippies--found that, as terrorists like Bill Ayers was, they didn't get the results they were seeking by blowing up things or people. They got a lot more done by moving into universities, becoming tenured professors, and teaching future teachers an improper history and an inaccurate history of these United States so that now we have, we are told, half the people coming out of college thinking socialism would be a better way of living.  They don't understand. They have never thought it through. They don't look at what has really happened because they haven't been taught true history. They don't understand. They don't know that every time socialism--progressivism if you would rather call it that as so many in this body do--always failed and always will fail to the end of the age as long as there is jealousy, greed, avarice, and even common sense.  As I have mentioned here on the floor, the Russian farmer who said, ``I make the same number of rubles here in the shade, if I am in the shade here or if I am out there in the sun, so I am in the shade,'' that explained why socialism does not, will not, and cannot ever work. It always fails.  The only way you can have it is where people share across from those according to their ability to those according to their need. What a lie. It didn't come from those according to their ability. Once socialism sets in, so does malaise. There is no incentive to work harder and harder except if you can get politically entrenched sufficiently, then those in political power. As a Russian college student told me back when I was a college student over there in the Soviet Union: In America, you can advance yourself by making more money and working harder. Here in the Soviet Union, we can only advance ourselves by stepping on others and trying to get political power by stepping on others.  This is a better system, even with all its flaws. Churchill said that capitalism is the worst form of government except for all the others. But it allows people to succeed or fail as they are driven to do. It is called freedom. We have had it. We have been losing it.  When the Democratic House and majority set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, they set up an[[Page H9464]]agency, a bureau, that didn't have to answer to They could violate the Constitution's Fourth Amendment and Fifth They didn't care. They are all powerful. In fact, they are so full of themselves that they think no one can hold them accountable and they can do whatever they want. They don't need money from They get it from the Federal They are a perpetual bureau that is not answerable to the President, to the Congress--not to anybody. They are finding out today that is not the case, but they sure thought it was.  When I was a felony judge, if the government wanted someone's bank records, they had to either get that person's permission or they had to come to a judge like me; and with either live or affidavit testimony sworn under oath, they had to prove that a crime was probably committed, that this particular person probably committed the crime, and that these bank records were needed because of the probable cause that existed from the evidence. I would consider the evidence and then decide if probable cause existed. If it did, I would sign the warrant, and the government only then could get the bank records.  Not so with the They are in the protection racket. It is right there in their name, Consumer Financial Protection It is a protection racket like the mob used to be in. They got their money from the Federal Reserve, and they are here to protect us all.  So they gather up people's banking records and debit and credit card activities. Why? Because they are there to protect us from greedy, evil banks.  Some have said: Wait a minute, though. How about you just leave my privacy alone, and if a bank messes me around, then I will come tell you? You don't need to get all of my private records.  But since the CFPB has the unmitigated gall and arrogance to think they are totally unaccountable, they don't care what the Constitution says or what some court says. They don't need a warrant. They get whatever records they want to. Why? Because they are in the protection racket, out to protect us. You do what they say or they ruin you.  What a racket, not accountable to anybody. That has got to change. The President is doing what he can to change that. Thank God and thank President Trump, both. We have got a chance of reining in an unconstitutionally acting body. Fortunately, there is at least one judge who recognized that, and hopefully there will be more.  Those in Poland are amazing. As I continue to meet people who have lived in areas like Poland under the Soviet boot or who were alive during the ravages of World War II, those people here in the United States seem to understand more what is at stake right now than most any natural-born They know what it is like not to have freedom. They know what it is like to have a government watch every move and tell you what you can or you cannot do and sometimes punish on a whim just to keep citizens terrified of the totalitarian government, a totalitarian government that has to exist in order for socialism, communism, and progressivism to exist.  In fact, when I was in college, I was doing research and saw back in the days, I believe it was around 1960, `61, in that time, that the Premier of the Soviet Union, Khruschchev, understood that, under the idea of communism or progressivism, everyone would share and share alike; and the ultimate form of that progressivism or communism or socialism would be, when there was no need for government, everyone just shared and shared alike from those according to their ability, according to their need. Everyone shared.  Of course, in the Soviet Union in 1960, `61, under Premier Khruschchev, it was indeed a very totalitarian country, not as bad as it had been under Stalin, but those millions and millions of Ukrainians who lost their lives when Stalin saw to their starvation, those who lost loved ones during that period of starvation at the hands of Stalin, they understand what freedom is and what it isn't. They understand the only way a progressive or communist or socialist can exist is you have got to have that totalitarian government forcing or taking money or goods away from those who earn them and work for them--created them--and giving them to those who did not.  So Khruschchev realized that, in the ultimate form of communism and progressivism, there is no government. So he appointed a committee or commission to study the issue and figure out how we eventually achieve that perfect state where there is no government and everyone is sharing and sharing alike. How do we get to that place?  They were always big on having 5-year plans in the former Soviet Union, so he thought perhaps this commission, this group of learned people, could set up the plan for how they could move forward each year until there was that state of perfection, there was no government, but just people sharing and working, working together, sharing together, sharing with those who had not and could not.  But as I learned from studying, Khruschchev eventually had to disband the commission. They realized there is no way you ever reach that perfect state of progressivism or socialism or communism. You can't ever achieve that in this world. There will always have to be a totalitarian government that has taken away people's freedom and tells them what they are allowed to do. That has been the direction of this government for years now: Let's lure people in to total dependence on the government, and then we get to tell them where they will live and what they will do.  Do you think that is a stretch? Look at what happened when the Democratic House and Senate voted to take over all college loans. That is a lot of power. When the Federal Government takes over all college loans, it enables the Federal Government to get into an area of governance that the Soviet Union did. The friends I came to know that summer I was there, the government told them whether they were going to be allowed to go to college. They told them what they would study in college. They told them where they were going to go work when they finish college. They told them what they were going to do in that place that the government directed them to go.  Heck, there were 15 states in the former Soviet You couldn't even cross the states without having a visa to go between the states. I was shocked by that.  But if you are going to have progressivism or socialism or communism, the share-and-share-alike mentality, spreading the wealth--as our former President liked to say: If you are going to take from the sweat of someone else's brow and give it to someone who did not earn it, you are going to have to have a totalitarian government.  When the Federal Government here in the United States took over all college loans, it put itself in a position of being able to say: We know, historically, what the Soviet Union did, and we like that kind of power, so here is what we are going to do.                              {time}  2045  You do this job or that job or go to this place and we will start forgiving that huge amount of debt you owe for your college loans that we are in charge of. That is power.  When the Federal Government takes over flood insurance, it gives the Federal Government the power to tell people where they can or can't live. Thank goodness we finally were allowed to reform the flood insurance. That is why--probably, the biggest reason--some of us didn't vote for the second swath of money for the disasters this fall.  There were no reforms that we were promised that would be there, like for the lady who said she had to rebuild her home in the same place 21 different times. There were so many homes the Federal Government has paid for since we took over flood insurance because, apparently, you had to build where your home flooded, even though you wanted to move elsewhere so your home wouldn't flood again. If you wanted the money, you had to rebuild right there.  That is what one lady was explaining. She didn't want to still be there, but she couldn't sell her lot with a destroyed, flooded home on it for enough money to build anywhere else. So she had to keep rebuilding where her home kept flooding.  We needed a reform so people could move and we wouldn't have to keep paying for people's homes over and over again in the same place. If they want to pay for private insurance and[[Page H9465]]live in the same place, fine. The Federal Government shouldn't be forcing people to build in the same place and keep them there as financial prisoners.  At least in the House, we finally passed some reforms recently. That was a good thing, and I am grateful we did.  Through all of these decades, for the last 100 years, the people of Poland understood what freedom is and they understood when they didn't have it.  I can recall back in the seventies being on a train coming--I believe it was--from Gradna, on the border between Poland and the Soviet Union, coming across Poland, which was considered to be one of the satellite nations over Soviet domination.  An American made the mistake of saying in the presence of a Polish gentleman: This land looks just the way it had for the last couple of days.  The man became outraged. He said: No, no. In the Soviet Union there are huge farms and you can't tell what is cultivated and what isn't because they are not farmed very well. You look out here at the farms in Poland and they are much smaller because we own our own farms and work our own farms.  He got very upset. I thought it was kind of a beautiful thing, how proud he was of his country, and the difference between a progressive or socialist-style government that rewards sluggishness. He pointed there in Poland to a place where their hard work actually showed.  We keep heading in the direction of the countries that have failed as they have tried this progressivism that always fails. It doesn't make sense to keep trying it. It never works. It didn't work in the New It didn't work for the pilgrims. It will work in Heaven, in a perfect world, in paradise, with no jealousy and everyone pulling the same direction, loving, caring. But in this world, it will not ever work.  In Poland--I was reading yesterday--their government leaders have come to the conclusion that life was better when they followed a Biblical example and had 1 day of the week where people rested and they were with their families. They went to church and they worshipped They found that is not a bad idea.  Now there are people in Poland in leadership positions who are saying: We have had 7-day workweeks, but families have suffered significantly. Maybe we should look back at that Biblical example of having 1 day of rest, 1 day together to worship; a day to be with family, a day to rest, and to love each other.  It seems like sometimes we get moving so fast that we forget the best things in life. It looks like that is what some of the Polish leaders are now saying.  They have also made clear to the EU that, just as President Trump has here, as leaders of a nation, a leader owes to that nation the protection that they were elected or hired to provide and survive. Survival is supposed to be what the leaders are ensuring.  As a result of the policies we have seen change in the last 11 months, we now have had 2 months--1 month was a record for the last 8 years--but now we have had 2 months, as I understand it, where growth has gone over 3.4 percent in the economy. We can keep that up and continue to grow. We are going to have plenty of money to pay this country's bills.  In fact, the only way we will ever get out from under the massive debt we are about to leave and impart to our children and grandchildren is if we grow the economy sufficiently to grow our way out of that indebtedness.  I believe the Laffer Curve is true. It is a truth economically. If you tax up to a certain point, then at some point, the more you tax, the more you overburden the work, and there gets to be less and the economy is brought down, you end up yielding less as a percentage of what you were bringing in.  As Arthur Laffer explained to President Reagan and his aids, if the goal is to maximize Federal revenue, you want to hit that percentage of tax that encourages work and growth to the greatest extent, and then you will bring even more money in.  The trouble is, like in Ireland, when they dropped their corporate tax rate so low--apparently, in the eighties, tax rates were dropped--revenue starts flowing in better and better and Congress started spending. They did the same thing in Record revenue comes in, even bigger record spending took place. We can't be doing that.  There is an article here today in The Washington Times by Dave Boyer: ``Pence, commemorating Israel's birth, says Trump `actively' seeks to move U.Embassy to Jerusalem.''  We have had Presidents saying for years that they would move the embassy to the true capital of It has been the capital of Israel since King David moved it there about 3,000 years ago.  I know that there are some that are very upset and say: No, no, you cannot move the Israeli capital from Tel Aviv to  Well, Jerusalem is the capital. But perhaps a compromise might be that, since we know when King David became ruler over all of Israel, he first went to Hebron--I have been there a few times. I have stood there at what is strongly believed to be the tomb of King David's father, They think they found the small synagogue he created. It looks like that is what it was.  Hebron is where Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are all buried. In fact, Abraham made a big deal. He wanted to pay for the land where he and his family would be buried so that there would never be any question that it was their land where they were buried.  The town of Hebron is where King David first went and ruled over Israel for 7 years and 6 months. After 7\1/2\ years, he then moved the capital to So I would be fine if we wanted to compromise and say: Okay, you need time to get used to the idea, then let's move the capital from Tel Aviv to Hebron and make that the capital of Israel for 7\1/2\ years, like King David did.  Then, following King David's example, after 7\1/2\ years with Hebron as the capital, move it to That would give people time to get used to the idea.  I do want to make a comment. The Senate--at least some, but not all Senators--is dragging its feet on getting something passed in the way of tax reform. I was totally shocked to hear that some Senators were saying they wanted to have the corporate tax rate cut, put off, for a year. That seems crazy.  As someone who has been to China and met with different CEOs and asking, ``Why did you move all these manufacturing jobs from America to China,'' I thought the answer would be labor unions, it would be over regulation.  Well, those were all problems for them, they said. But I loved hearing repeatedly corporate leaders saying: Our best quality control, our best workers were in  I loved hearing that. They seemed sincere. The reason we moved to China is because of the corporate tax rate being about half of what it is in China as compared to what it is in the United  They said: So we have saved so much money by more than cutting our tax rate in half.  What a corporate tax is, as Steve Moore said, which is such a great way to explain what it is: We like to say we are making the greedy corporations pay.  Actually, you are making their customers and clients pay.  If a corporation does not, whether it is subchapter S or a C corporation, pass those taxes on to their customers, their clients, they can't stay in business. So it is a part of the price of their goods and services.  I have advocated doing away with it. You will have so much more people working, so many more people making so much more money. The income taxes from the individuals will make up for it. It will be a beautiful thing. It is not a zero sum game. Everybody can do better and better and better.                              {time}  2100  It would be a beautiful thing to see the economy expand like that, and it could. We could get those jobs back. But a corporate tax, the corporate tax here in America is the highest tariff any nation puts on its own goods or services, anything made in corporate It is a tariff on our own goods.  Why do we do that? We could be so much more competitive around the world if the government didn't put this burden on corporations.[[Page H9466]]  I was hoping that President Trump's figure of 15 percent that undercuts the Chinese at least a little bit would be even more incentive to bring back manufacturing jobs to America, because any nation, any powerful nation that does not produce what they need in a time of war--because there will always be wars--is not going to remain a powerful nation beyond the next war.  We need to be producing steel and rubber and all the things we need. We need to produce them right here in the United There is no reason we can't, but we drive those jobs away because of the corporate income tax.  President Trump had the right idea, 15 percent. He compromised, so it is at 20 percent. Thank goodness he didn't let them work him up any beyond that, but there are some in the Senate trying to work beyond that--huge mistake.  This economy can explode. It is already the top 3 percent, and it can keep climbing. Laffer tells me that after the final part of the 30 percent tax cut kicked in, in 1983, they hit over 7 percent growth in the economy. That is just unheard of.  There were people saying, in the Obama administration, you know, we will probably never ever hit 3 percent again. It may just be an impossibility. No, it is not. You get rid of the corporate tax or at least get it down to where we are not putting such an enormous tariff on our own goods and services, and that economy can grow like that again, and we can get our manufacturing jobs back.  An article here, Todd Starnes--he and I were both honored recently with an award that people like Tom Landry, Cal Thomas, and others have received for being Christians and speaking up for our faith, our beliefs. Todd Starnes, today, has this story: ``Thank you, Mr.Trump, for bringing `Merry Christmas' back to the White House,'' and I certainly echo those feelings.  It is amazing, this story from Maxim Lott, FOX News: ``Media twist tax plan studies to claim it hammers middle class.''  I have been hearing people here on this floor talking about how the tax proposal that we passed here in the House was going to hammer the middle class. Actually, the corporate tax cut alone will get the economy going so strong everybody is going to benefit. But I wish we had just had an across-the-board flat tax created: you make more, you pay more; you make less, you pay less. That is where I wanted to go. That is true reform.  But politics being what it is, because the Republican leadership did not want to have to fight a battle that, ``Oh, we're just helping the rich,'' the highest tax rate is the only one we didn't change. The idea was, well, if the only tax rate we don't bring down is the 39.6 percent tax rate that the richest Americans have to pay, then the Democrats won't be beating us up. They won't be able to beat us up for raising taxes on the poor and middle class to help the rich.  Well, they were wrong. Despite the fact that there will be more people now under the Republican tax plan that has passed here in the House--the Senate will just adopt it--there will be more people who will not be paying taxes. I kind of wish all of us, every American, had a little skin in the game. If they are making money, then they pay something. That is where a flat tax comes in. If you just make $10, you only pay $1. If you make $100, you pay $10. If you make $1 million, you pay $100,000. That is fair.  But anyway, we passed our bill. It gives a tax break to the poorest It is going to help the economy grow, but we have got to get it done. I am hoping and literally praying that the Senate keeps their elimination of the individual mandate from ObamaCare so that people have the freedom to get policies that are best for them and not something forced on them by the government.  And, yes, we know there will be unfair media that will do nothing but complain about millions who no longer have health insurance. Well, I can tell you, there are millions who are paying taxes now to the government because they can't afford an insurance policy that won't ever pay them because the deductible is too high, and they don't want to keep paying our income tax because they can't afford the ObamaCare policies.  There are people who are paying for ObamaCare policies where the deductibles are so high, they will never get any benefit. Yes, there is apparently a segment, a small minority who--maybe as much as 20, 25 percent--who, like in the Soviet Union, are getting their money from where somebody else has earned it, having that money pay for their insurance, some of that coming from people who can't even afford their own insurance. So they are paying higher income tax so this other group of Americans take their money from those working poor and pay for their insurance. What is fair about that?  Forcing the working poor in America to pay higher income tax or pay for policies where they will never get anything back because the deductible is too high; also, that some people who will vote Democrat will get their insurance for free, that is not the way America became the greatest Nation that it was and can be again.  And, yes, North Korea fired an ICBM today in the last 24 hours, and I am very grateful to President Trump for taking it seriously. I am so glad he is there. I am glad we don't have the same people who gave North Korea the ability to have nuclear bombs during the Clinton administration.  How foolish was it to basically say: Oh, look, North Korea, we will give you what you need to make nuclear weapons if you will just agree not to ever use those materials for nuclear weapons. And, of course, the North Korean leader said: Sure, you do all that, all I got to do is sign. Sure, you give me all I need for nuclear weapons, I ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ill sign saying I will never create nuclear weapons. And what do they do? They make nuclear weapons because that is what they do. That is what those leaders do. The people of North Korea deserve better. And Iran is the same way. They can't be trusted.  So we need a firm leader who understands enough is enough, and I am glad President Trump is that leader.

2130,topic-id,6780,"Mr.Speaker, this has been a big day.  There are so many people who have suffered in this country, especially since the passing of It is difficult to call it the Affordable Care There is a small percentage that supposedly has done better.  Usually, when my friends across the aisle and most of the media talk about how much better off Americans are under ObamaCare, they ignore the real results, and, instead, they point and say: There are so many people--millions of people now--who have insurance now that didn't have it before.  Well, the reason they could say that was because ObamaCare forced people to buy insurance. We went through this with some family members, helping them make the calculation: should they pay the penalty through additional income tax, or should they buy insurance that they will never, ever be able to use?  On some occasions, you are better off paying the extra tax, which means the government wanted your money a lot worse--well, not worse than the individual--but the government has the power to steal from people and call it legal, and then it is legal.  There was a massive amount of legalized stealing under ObamaCare that took place. This bill we passed today would end so much of the stealing from individuals that the government has been doing legally since ObamaCare passed.                              {time}  1415  But, yes, there will be millions of people, I would suspect, that when we legally end the individual mandate, they are not going to continue to pay for insurance, huge amounts every month that they can't afford--people making $25,000, $30,000, or so, who couldn't afford to pay for health insurance who were required to do that.  Do you want to pay higher income tax? Are you going to pay for health insurance that you are never going to be able to use? The premiums cost you more than you can afford, the deductible is so high. Clearly, you are young. You are never going to use it. The odds are 99.99 percent you will never use it. But the government forced them to pay more taxes or pay more for insurance they couldn't use.  The good news for those people is that now you will be able to--well, once this becomes the law, and it does need to pass the The Senate has a little different version, and there are a few things in the Senate version I like better than ours, but there are a lot of things in our bill that I like better than the  If the Senate will go ahead and do their job like they did not do on repealing at least part of ObamaCare, they will do their job on this, the American people are going to benefit. We are going to see the economy take a big jolt forward and upward, more jobs coming to  Nobody gets everything they want. I believe what the President really wanted was going to be best for the country. If we could hold to a 15 percent corporate tax, I wanted to see that across the board for S corporations, C corporations. But as the President knew--I know he knew because we talked about it more than once--that 15 percent would undercut the corporate tax that China has. If we undercut the corporate tax that China has, then it means we were going to be getting manufacturing jobs back to  We have had so many manufacturing plants pick up and move to other places--mainly China, Mexico, other places. We need to be manufacturing here.  I know there are those elitists who have been educated with degrees far beyond their intellectual capacity to absorb. They got the degrees, but they didn't get the wisdom. And some have ventured to say: No, we don't need to be a manufacturing country. We have evolved above being these lowly manufacturers. That is for developing countries, not a wonderful country like ours is.  Obviously, they spent too much time in other places than studying history. This is something else I have talked about with the President--he knows it just from his business acumen; I know it from studying history--that any nation that is a powerful nation in the world that cannot manufacture the things that that country needs in a time of war will cease to be a great nation after the next war. And be assured, there will be wars.  Jesus, the wisest to ever walk this planet, said there will always be wars and rumors of war. And that is true because this planet has evil: people who will do evil, countries that will do evil, people who get jealous when some other country has more freedom, more assets. And there is going to be evil in this world as long as this world exists.  We saw that down in Sutherland Some lunatics--again, many of them educated well beyond their ability to be wise--had popped off and said, well, if prayer worked, those people would never have been shot in a church where they were praying and worshipping.  As long as people are in this world, there is going to be evil--not that God wants evil to prevail. He doesn't. He doesn't want that any should stumble. But as a parent knows, you could force your child to say, ``I love you'' or to throw their little arms around your neck, hug you, and say, ``I love you.'' You could force them to do that. It doesn't mean a whole lot. But when you give people the free will to choose to love you, to choose to follow your rules, it is overwhelming to a parent when a child freely chooses to do that.  So we have freedom of choice. Some choose to do evil. Some want governments to be all powerful because, in their lack of wisdom, they think that the government needs to be in control of everything and everybody.  The late Justice Scalia, who could make me laugh--he loved good jokes and stories like I do. There have been a lot of unpleasant memories, a lot of unpleasant fights, a lot of fights that I haven't won, but I stood up for what I believed was right.  When I would get around Justice Scalia, having lunch together or breakfast together, we would get to telling stories and jokes, and he was so clever. It was often hard to find a joke or a story he had not heard, but it was just fun to be around him.  But in one of those, I think it was a lunch that time, he said: You know, back when I was working for the Attorney General--and I don't remember which Attorney General it was back in the 1970s--he said: We had a weekly meeting, and one morning the Attorney General came in, and he said: Well, I was at a cocktail party last night, and for the first time I heard a definition that explained the difference between Democrats and  He said: I actually think it is pretty good. I think it is very descriptive.  He said: What I learned was Democrats are people who want to control everybody and everything, and Republicans are people who don't want them to.  Well, I found that rather amusing. Actually, that is pretty accurate. Some people on the Republican side of the aisle go: Why don't we plot and plan as well as the Democrats do? They are always trying to figure out how they get power, how they get over on this and that, and we just want people to live and let live. We want as little government as necessary to keep order but allow people to succeed with no ceiling, no limit.[[Page H9419]]  But to succeed, you also have to have the opportunity to fail, just like Edison did. In the hundreds of things he tried, finding a filament, the element that would heat up and not burn in two to make a light bulb, he knew it would work. Somebody asked him about all those failures, and he said, no, each time he tried something that didn't work, it wasn't a failure. He just learned that that is one less thing that might work.  But Fisher, who came up with the space pen--I love those space pens. The email still goes around that says that Americans spent $4 million to develop a pen that would work in outer space, government money. Russians just use pencils. Not a dime of government money was used.  With an intellect like Fisher, he knew there had to be a way that you could develop a pen that would write in gravity and with no gravity, underwater, above the air--or above the Earth's atmosphere, so he came up with it. But he knew he was going to have to pressurize a pen, and this is such a cartridge.  So he sealed it, put about 30 pounds of pressure. But the trick was finding an ink that didn't explode out when you put 30 pounds of pressure on it or that was not so thick that it wouldn't work when you tried to write. Eventually, he was able to do that.  Lots of failures, but you have got to allow people a chance to fail if they are going to have a chance to succeed. If the government puts its thumb on the scales, it is not real success, it is not real failure, and, eventually, those cards are going to come falling down.  Well, what we have done today with our tax bill, it is a huge step because I know, Mr.Speaker, most folks here are well aware, it is hard to get a majority agreement on much of anything, but we did today. We had a significant majority that agreed. It isn't perfect. Nothing any human ever does will be, but it moves the ball down the road.  One of the things I love about my friend from Texas, Kevin Brady, is I would hear from people back home--and talk to He is open to talking not just to He will talk to everybody. And I found that with so many members on the Ways and Means My friend David Schweikert was always available to answer questions, and he was doing his homework thoroughly.  One of the things that has deeply troubled many Americans, and especially seniors, either seniors in poor health or younger Americans who had severe health problems, is, in the ObamaCare bill that was so unaffordable, it changed the deductibility of medical expenses.  Before, it was, if you had medical expenses, you had a really bad time of it, then our hearts go out to you and we want your life to be a little easier when you are going through so much difficulty with bad health, so the deductibles were any medical expense over 5 percent of your adjusted gross income.  In order to come up with the billions and billions of dollars that ObamaCare, I would submit, wasted, they had to cut out some of the deductions like that, so they ended up raising the threshold from 5 percent to 7\1/2\, 10 percent. So it has been 10 percent. You had to have more than 10 percent of your adjusted gross income in order to deduct it, but we still had a lot of, especially, seniors who had more than that.  I had accountants from home send me information about seniors, particularly seniors who had been paying a great deal of medical expense because, no, Medicare didn't take care of them.  And of course we know AARP jumped on the bandwagon for ObamaCare--not because it was going to be good for the seniors. In fact, it was extremely violent to the finances of seniors and to their health, as well. But AARP was more interested in the massive amount of money they could add to their coffers, even though they are considered a nonprofit. So they jumped on board, and, of course, companies that sold other policies had to pay a 2 percent tax on each policy.  AARP got the sweetheart deal. Their policy they embraced didn't have to pay the 2 percent tax. And I haven't seen the provision, but I am told there was a provision that exempted their executive so they didn't have the normal cap on their executive income.  So the people at the top of AARP, they did great. Seniors really got harmed, losing $716 billion in cuts to But for all those seniors who got harmed, couldn't get the surgery, couldn't get the medical help they need, just keep in mind, AARP was able to sell a lot more policies and make a lot more money even though it did a lot of harm to some seniors. Just remember, AARP came out great out of that.  But nonetheless, for those of us who were very sympathetic to seniors having hundreds of billions of dollars cut from Medicare, they heard the President say: Now, this isn't going to affect you seniors at all. It is only going to cut some of the profits from healthcare providers--basically, what was said.  But many of my seniors in east Texas figured out: Wait a minute. If you are not going to pay the healthcare provider for my medicine, for my surgery, for what I need, then I am not going to be able to get the procedure, the surgery, the healthcare that I need if it is not going to be paid for.  So I have had many seniors talk to me about surgeries being delayed or that they couldn't get the same thing they had before ObamaCare passed.                              {time}  1430  So we haven't repealed ObamaCare, but in this bill, we repealed the ObamaCare mandate, the individual mandate. That means that some people who were forced to pay a higher income tax--they didn't get one of these ridiculous insurance policies--they are going to have that much money in their own pocket. If they were paying for a policy that they knew was never going to help them out, they won't have to buy that.  And, of course, the Democrats, for all the Main Street media, will say, ``Oh, look at how many people don't have insurance,'' when the truth is so many of those people chose not to buy insurance because they knew it was a terrible deal.  I still want to see a reform of healthcare, a real reform of healthcare, but that would mean getting away from either insurance companies or the government being between us and our doctors, our healthcare providers. The way you do that is that you make it so attractive to put money in your own health savings account--and I expect us to pass something to make it much easier and much more attractive. It is not in this bill. This was a tax bill--but I am still hopeful that we are going to do a reform of healthcare and repeal, at least most of I had that hope. And I hoped that today was a start, not only toward getting tax reform and getting tax relief for Americans and seeing the economy get going again, but also put back in motion true repeal of ObamaCare and getting healthcare laws in place that will be good for  But how can you have competitive prices in healthcare if nobody knows what these procedures or medicines cost? You see, you get a notice from the healthcare provider--your insurance company--that something costs $12,000, but you don't know that the insurance company satisfied that $12,000 payment demand with an $800 or $900 payment. But if you knew that if you were paying cash out of your health savings account, a $12,000 procedure would only cost $800, you wouldn't be so big on paying $2,000 a month to a health insurance company.  And these health insurance companies still don't see that, under ObamaCare, their days are numbered. It was designed to fail. And America gets so mad at health insurance companies because it was built into Not only were they going to have record profits, like some of them did last year, but they were going to get bailouts on top of their record profits.  It was going to make America so mad at the insurance companies that even conservatives would say: Well, I never thought I would say this, but anything has to be better than what we have with these insurance companies. Why don't we have the government just take over everything?  Then, voila, we then have VA healthcare for all Americans, except much worst than the VA provides, because everybody is forced to be in it.  I was amazed, as an exchange student in the Soviet Union, to see the type of medical care that was in the Soviet Union in the seventies. I just thanked[[Page H9420]]God that we didn't have that kind of socialized medicine, and we were so much more advanced.  But it was clear that physicians, back in the Soviet Union in the seventies--I am sure there were some that were really dedicated, but, for most, it was an 8-to-4-, 9-to-5-type job--the fewer people they could see, the better they liked it. But that meant a lot of people waited in long lines, didn't get seen, had to come back and come back, and they didn't get the procedures that they needed.  Or, like in Canada, a fellow, named Tyler, told me that his dad died of a heart attack after he had been on the list to get bypass surgery for 2 years.  I said: Two years? It really took that long?  He said: Well, they kept moving people in front of him.  I said: Well, now wait a minute. I understand it is a crime to pay or do anything to get yourself moved up the list.  He said: Oh, yeah, that is the way I understand it, too. But we had a board that would pick and choose among the American citizens who would go in front, and they kept putting people in front of my dad, who finally had the heart attack and died because the board kept putting people in front of him.  That goes back to what Sarah Palin said. She called it a death panel. She was speaking with hyperbole, but the truth is--whether you want to call it a death panel or not--they were making decisions over who would get what; that would mean they lived or died in some occasions, or it meant whether they were going to live in pain or live in comfort. These were government boards making these decisions, just like they used to do in the Soviet Union before it fell.  So I see this tax bill today as not only a step in the right direction to get people more money in their own pockets they can use to make the economy grow, but I see it also as a step in the right direction toward reforming healthcare again because we eliminate the individual mandate.  I still would like to see these further reforms, like I am talking about. I put in a bill, I filed years ago, that healthcare providers would have to post, at least at their facility, but certainly online, if they were online--and now it ought to be a requirement--post exactly what you charge an individual paying cash, an individual with Blue Cross, or Aetna, or whatever it is. Let people know exactly what things cost. Don't send a $15,000 bill for going into the hospital that you know you are going to accept $1,000 as payment in full from an insurance company. If you are going to accept $1,000 for a $15,000 bill, then say it costs $1,000.  If we could require everybody to post exactly what things cost, they wouldn't be in such an all-fired hurry to make sure that they had insurance, other than catastrophic, really catastrophic insurance. Because instead of paying $2,000 a month to an insurance company--$24,000 a year--well, they would be better off paying $1,500 as payment in full for $15,000 in charges.  We still have a good ways to go, but you don't get anywhere until you take that first step, and today was a giant step, in my opinion.  I didn't realize, until I saw this notice from the Farm Bureau, but the headline says: ``House Poised to Take up Farm Bureau-Supported Tax Bill.'' It was good to see that.  Another article from Heritage Action: ``House tax plan propels reform forward.''  FOX News has an article, by Newt Gingrich: ``House and Senate tax plans have more in common than you think.'' That makes some excellent points.  It is good news all the way around. It is a step in the right direction.  I am hopeful that some of the things we disagree on, we are going to be able to work out with the One of those things, like I mentioned, the Senate, as I understand it, their bill currently has an allowance for deductions of medical expense beyond 10 percent. Hopefully, we can eventually do better than that and get it back from where ObamaCare put it, maybe back to 5 percent, at some point.  But we have seniors on fixed incomes, and Medicare doesn't cover what they are needing in the way of healthcare, and they are being overwhelmed by medical expense. Once again, I think if we can get some reforms in--it doesn't have to be a total reform of healthcare, but just get some things in there--even if we can't get the total repeal because of the Senate's recalcitrance, at least let's get some reforms to get people the help they need.  I would also like to address the issue of the Roy Moore allegations. Having prosecuted sexual assault crimes, I have even been forced against my will--but you get an order, and you follow the order to defend sexual assault crimes--in one case finding that a trumped-up case against my African-American client was totally bogus, trumped-up, and we were able to prove irrefutably as such.  But sexual assault allegations are a very dangerous thing. We have in America what we call statute of limitations on most crimes. The reason we have statute of limitations on most crimes is because if you are going to be accused of something, it needs to be made in a timely manner, so that if you are going to accuse somebody of committing a crime, they have a chance to find witnesses.  One of the very reasons that there are statutes of limitations on crimes like sexual assault is that if you wait 38 years to accuse somebody of a sexual assault, it is almost impossible to prove exactly where you were. And I have heard some people in the Senate say: Oh, well, there are just so much specifics coming out that it just seems irrefutable.  Well, usually people's memories wane over the period of three to four decades on times and exact places. And I know, from my days as a judge, sent many rapists and sexual assaulters to prison for many years, including life, I was particularly hard on people who committed sexual assault crimes because they violate so much more than just a physical violation. It is an abominable crime.  But we have limitations. So if somebody makes an allegation against you that you did such and such at 2 in the afternoon on such and such afternoon, and it was at this particular location, and these people were not around, I mean, if you put a bunch of specifics in there, within a year, then the individual being charged can go back to his calendar, or her calendar, and see: Okay, on that day, oh, I wasn't even in that city, I was over here in this city, I was in court across town, I was not even where that happened. So I can bring in and show--not just raise a reasonable doubt--but show absolutely for sure that never happened. That is why we have limitations.  I would just encourage people that when they hear alleged factual allegations that occurred decades previously, no matter how many specifics are thrown in, reserve judgment, and give it a chance to get all of the facts in.  That is why, in every single case I have tried as a judge--and there were thousands of felony cases that came before my court--but in every single case I tried, after the prosecution finished, I then turned to the defense for their chance to submit evidence. It is why, after every witness testified for the prosecution, I turned to the defense attorney and gave them a chance to cross examine.  And there were times I heard charges that, in my mind, were so outrageous, but I knew we have a system in place to protect innocent people from spurious allegations, and we have to go through the process, including an appeal, after the trial. And I have reviewed many appeals as an appellate chief justice.  You have got to let the process play out. And any time somebody comes running in and wants somebody tried in the court of public opinion, and they are only going to give them 3 or 4 weeks, then immediately that should be suspect. Not that it can't be proved out as true, but it should immediately be suspect because these people tried to game the system. They didn't want to give enough time for the ones allegedly committing an offense to prepare a defense.                              {time}  1445  They didn't want to give adequate time to investigate, even after 38 years. How do you go back 38 years later and say: Gee, where was I? I don't have a calendar that goes back that far. I don't know if I was in town, if I was out of the country. I don't know where I was. Gee, it seems like around that[[Page H9421]]time. Maybe I was here or there. I don't know.  The odds of being able to mount a proper defense three or four decades after something allegedly happened is just almost impossible.  So all you can do to defend yourself--and I am speaking hypothetically. If somebody, hypothetically, made outrageous allegations against you, and, you know, I know I never did that, how do I prove it?  Well, you are not going to be able to find witnesses to say where you were at that specific moment in time because you don't even remember where you were. How will you find a witness that will back you up?  And if you do find a witness who can say, ``Oh, I remember that very second,'' 38 years later, ``this is where he was,'' then that witness becomes suspect because you just don't remember like that.  So I hope, Mr.Speaker, that people will allow an election to go forward with the parties the people have chosen and give time for all the facts to come out.  I like Roy Moore, and I appreciate the man of faith that he is. I think the election needs to go forward just as it is. I think we should not intervene in Congress, and we should let the people of Alabama decide, based on proven facts, not on some last-minute attack.  We should give time for all of the facts to come out, not just the facts that have been set up over the last several months, in all likelihood, in preparation for being able to blindside a candidate, so you have all the facts and you can keep slipping stuff out day after day; because it could very well end up just like Ted Stevens' case, where at least one FBI agent and a prosecutor created a case that not only had reasonable doubt about it, but it was absolutely false.  Senator Ted Stevens was not the most lovable guy. He was kind of a crotchety guy when I was around him. It wasn't very often. They accused him of not filing notice about a hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollars gift improvement onto a home he had.  The FBI--at least some in the FBI, as was borne out by the affidavit by an FBI officer who actually had a conscience, not like his superior FBI agent lead investigator. They fabricated evidence. They hid evidence. The evidence that they had gotten when they served warrants, went to his home, took every piece of paper, every bank record, everything he had, computers, all this, raided the bank, got all their information, got any notes and things, he didn't have the evidence to defend himself because the FBI got it all.  A guy named Robert Mueller was the head of the This was probably the biggest case that went through the FBI while he was Director, at least one of them. He saw to it that the FBI agent that blew the whistle and pointed out that they have evidence that shows that Ted Stevens not only did not get a free hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollars, $600,000-, $700,000-addition to his house, that he paid hundreds of thousands of dollars more than that. Apparently, there was some communication between the contractor and Senator Stevens saying: You are overpaying. Quit overpaying.  Senator Stevens said: I am strong-willed in the Senate, so I have always got people looking to try to make something up, so I have to overpay.  The man overpaid.  The FBI, under Mueller, fabricated a case. They tried it the week before the election, and there was a reason for that. They tried it the week before the election. They got a conviction. He lost the election, I think it was by 1,200 votes or so.  After he had lost the election, there was no way to rewind that clock. He was out of the The Democrats got the seat. They sure didn't care that they won the seat based on a lie, a fraudulent case brought by the U.They didn't care. They were glad to have the seat.  It is kind of like Senator Harry Reid said after he made false accusations against Mitt Romney that he hadn't paid any taxes, and when he was asked about it later after Mr.Romney lost the election, his response was basically: Well, it worked, didn't it?  He had no remorse for destroying a man's reputation falsely without any evidence or with manufactured evidence, lies. No remorse, just: It worked, because we got the seat.  And I have a feeling that, when the smoke clears and we find all of the evidence that is left after 38 years, we are going to find that there was a problem not as much with Roy Moore as there was with the accusers, but we need to wait and see. Nobody needs to be rushed to trial.  We have a system of government that prevents somebody from being punished by the government, but the fact is the government is being used to try to punish Roy  Let's say, hypothetically, you were an establishment leader in the Senate and you have been pushing for amnesty. You didn't want illegal immigration stopped, because there are donors that give a lot of money that want illegal immigration to continue. You wanted amnesty, and you know in the Attorney General's Office you have a guy there, regardless of things you disagree on, who has really cracked down on illegal immigration.  You know you have got a guy that just won the primary in a State, and you spent tens of millions of dollars trying to destroy the guy in the primary and it didn't work. He won. So it looks like he is about to win the election, the general election, even though you are in his same party.  I am just thinking hypothetically. Certainly none of this would be true, surely, but, wow, what a great deal if somebody made accusations, true or not true, against the guy that you tried to destroy with millions of dollars, that, you know, if he is elected, he is going to come in. He is not going to be your best frien because you called him everything in the book; you tried to destroy him.  So, wow, even though he is in your own party, maybe you would be better off if you had a Democrat you feel like you could work with that was more establishment than the guy that you tried to destroy, that, if he would have gotten along with you--probably not now because you went after him so strongly--what if you could have that guy taken out with allegations, whether true or not, and then you could kill a number of birds.  You know that Steve Bannon has said he is going to war after you. And Bannon went all in to support this guy in his primary and this election, so if his candidate gets destroyed, you have just destroyed his ability to raise money.  And then on top of that, if you could talk the unsuspecting President into talking his Attorney General into leaving that post to try to go to the Senate, wow, you get rid of the guy that has gotten tough on illegal immigration, you get rid of the guy that has been raising money and going against the establishment, and you get rid of the guy that you tried to destroy with tens of millions of dollars even though he was in your own party--I am just saying, hypothetically.  Maybe it would make for a good fiction novel someday, and maybe there is somebody out there writing that novel, but I am just saying, what if. What a novel piece of fiction that might be some day. Maybe we would see it in a movie someday. Maybe the Senator would even be from the  I also know, having been a district judge, I signed everything original. I know there are some judges that don't sign their orders; they just let somebody stamp.  I made clear the day I became a district judge that nobody is stamping my signature on anything; if it is a stamp, it is going to be clear that it is a stamp, that anything that has got to be originally signed, I am going to sign it.  Now, as I understand it, Judge Moore signed things originally, but on other things, on copies--we would put a stamped signature and note that it was a copy. But his, they either stamped or his assistant wrote his signature, and because the assistant's name had initials D.A., put ``D.A.'' out beside his name to denote that he didn't originally sign this. This was the assistant on his behalf. So litigants would normally get a copy and not the original, of course, unless you make multiple originals.  I wondered when I saw in the yearbook the picture of the signature, I thought: DA? I didn't think he was ever a  Well, he wasn't. He was assistant He was a district judge. He was a chief[[Page H9422]]justice of the supreme court there in He was never the  It is interesting, if someone believed that a guy molested their minor daughter and that person later had a divorce pending in that guy's court, I know I would certainly ask for a different court. There is no way I would let a judge who molested my child have any jurisdiction over my divorce. If I had never brought out about the alleged molestation before, I would certainly do it then. People would need to know that the judge in that court, and particularly the judge on my divorce, was a child molester. They would need to know.  If you don't let people know at that point, you are basically an accomplice. You are allowing this assaulter out there to continue whatever he may be doing to others. You need to come forward and report it. It is not a crime not to report it, but it need",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 to be reported, and certainly if that person goes on the bench.  It must have been quite a realization for Judge Moore when he saw that ``D.A.'' and realized: Somebody has forged what they thought was my signature, when it was really my assistant, and that is why the assistant put ``D.A.'' out there, to denote that I didn't sign that.  That must have been quite a feeling for the judge.  There is a story from Joel Pollak on November 16, ``Gloria Allred's Blunder on Roy Moore's Yearbook Challenge,'' that talks about that.  There is another story by John Nolte, also November 16, ``Journalist Leann Tweeden Accuses Senator Al Franken of Fondling, Kissing Her Without Consent.'' I don't know where that is going to lead. I don't know whether the same people will demand his ouster or not. Maybe we need to wait and see if the photograph is forged or if it was photoshopped, something like that.                              {time}  1500  There is just so much going on, but the bottom line is, today, we have taken a big step toward making America great again. It is not the 15 percent tax I had hoped it would be. In fact, people have got to understand that my friend, Steve Moore, who used to be the senior economics editor for The Wall Street Journal, helped President Trump as an economic adviser. Steve told me a number of times that he likes my definition of corporate tax better than any.  But my definition describes what a corporate tax really is, especially the U.corporate tax: 35 percent. It is the largest tariff any modern country has ever put on its own goods or services, because, let's face it, when we put a corporate tax on a company, and 35 percent, they are going to have to put that on their products. If they don't collect that tax on top of the cost of the product, they are going to go out of business. That has got to be added to the cost of the goods or services.  When you look at all the businesses and all the huge manufacturing plants in America that have closed down, and you look at what they were doing before they closed down and you deduct that 35 percent corporate tax or, I would submit, tariff, they could have been selling their product competitively not just in America, but probably in places all over the world. Instead of having to close their doors, they could have kept producing and expanding, but for that huge tariff that was put on their own goods.  Most countries are smart enough not to put a tariff on what their own companies make before they ship them out. But we have been doing that.  So why have we been doing that?  Because it was a great way, people in Congress thought, to raise revenue.  You tell people this mean, evil corporation was paying this tax. We really put it over on this corporation. We made them pay all this tax.  What you did was add 35 percent to the cost of their products that they had to figure in somehow to cover that, in addition to what it cost to manufacture; and you have made them noncompetitive, here or abroad, and that is why they had to close.  That is why I love the idea of either eliminating the tariff or at least getting it down to 15 percent so we undercut the 17 or so percent that China has. If we undercut their tariff on their own goods, goods produced in China, then those manufacturers are coming back.  I have been amazed that reporters have asked, when I would talk about this publicly: But how are you going to make up for all of that lost income?  They didn't understand, yeah, you are not collecting it as corporate tax, but now you are collecting directly from the people. So it is not a hidden, insidious tax. There are more jobs, and they are paying more money, and the economy is growing and hiring more people. There are more jobs, more income, and more income tax, and it is better for everybody.  But the forces of greed around this country and around this town like to try to convince people they are really sticking it to somebody else, when the truth is that the individuals are going to end up paying it, wherever it is, or the company is not going to stay in business. I would rather them stay in business, add jobs, and give raises.  Mr.Speaker," may I inquire how much time I have remaining?  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Faso).

2131,topic-id,1167,"So in the last 10 minutes I have here, this will be the last session before Thanksgiving I am greatly disturbed that we have so many young people in America who can't explain what Thanksgiving Day is, why it was originally started, who thanks was given to. Many thought it was to the Indians, but it was not.  This is a declaration, May 2, 1778, to troops at Valley Forge: ``The Commander in Chief directs that divine service be performed ever Sunday at 11 o'clock in those brigade to which there are chaplains--those which have none to attend the places of worship nearest to them. It is expected that officers of all ranks will, by their attendance, set an example to their men.  ``While we are zealously performing the duties of good citizens and soldiers, we certainly ought not to be inattentive to the higher duties of religion. To the distinguished character of patriot, it should be our highest glory to laud the more distinguished character of Muslim''--I am sorry. It says, ``Christian.''  George Washington said that the highest glory of a patriot soldier would be the more distinguished character of a It was an order he gave.  So I know people are saying this is totally appropriate now, and they wonder why evil seems to keep growing in But as we look where we came from and we look at what prior leaders did to defeat the forces of evil that are here in this world--and will be as long as it is here in this form--it seems like there is a correlation between when the country is praying to God and asking for his protection and blessing, and when evil seems to be growing.  Thomas Jefferson, in 1781, noted, and it is engraved in his memorial: ``The God who gave us life gave us liberty. Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God, that they are not to be violated but with his wrath?  ``Indeed, I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just, that His justice cannot sleep forever.''  That is Thomas  John Quincy Adams, on September 26, 1810, wrote a letter to his son, the U.Minister at Saint Petersburg: ``So great is my veneration for the Bible, and so strong my belief that, when duly read and meditated on, it is of all books in the world that which contributes most to make men good, wise, and happy.''  Former President nominated Supreme Court by James Madison, and this on March 30, 1863, by Abraham Lincoln, a great Lincoln said: ``It is the duty o nations, as well as of men, to own their dependence upon the overruling power of God to confess their sins and transgressions in humble sorrow, yet with assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon, and to recognize the sublime truth announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that those nations are only blessed whose God is the Lord.''  This is Lincoln's written word: ``We have forgotten We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us. And we have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were[[Page H9423]]produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to God that made us.  ``It behooves us, then, to humble ourselves before the offended power, to confess our national sins, and to pray for clemency and forgiveness.''  That was a national proclamation by Abraham Thank God that a majority of Americans participated in that and prayed to  In his second inaugural, he is talking about North and It is inscribed on the inside north wall of the Lincoln About half to two-thirds of the way through there, in the middle, he is talking about North and He said: ``Both read the same Bible and pray to the same The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. `Woe unto the world because of offenses. . . .' Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said 3,000 years ago, so still it must be said `the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.' ''  I want to finish with this from John He was talking at the lighting of the Christmas tree; but at a time of Thanksgiving, it is certainly appropriate. He said: ``With the lighting of this tree, which is an old ceremony in Washington and one which has been among the most important responsibilities of a good many Presidents of the United States, we initiate, in a formal way, the Christmas season. We mark the festival of Christmas, which is the most sacred and hopeful day in our civilization.  ``For nearly 2,000 years, the message of Christmas, the message of peace and good will towards all men, has been the guiding star of our endeavors.  ``This morning, I had a meeting at the White House, which included some of our representatives from far-off countries in Africa and They were returning to their posts for the Christmas holidays. Talking with them, I was struck by the fact that, in the far-off continents, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, as well as Christians, pause from their labors on the 25th day of December to celebrate the birthday of the Prince of  ``There could be no more striking proof that Christmas is truly the universal holiday of men. It is the day when all of us dedicate our thoughts to others; when all are reminded that mercy and compassion are the enduring virtues; when all show, by small deeds and large, and by acts, that it is more blessed to give than to receive. It is the day when we remind ourselves that man can and must live in peace with his neighbors, and it is the peacemakers who are truly blessed.  ``In this year of 1962, we greet each other at Christmas with some special sense of blessing of the peace.''  Mr.Speaker, this period of Thanksgiving that we will have in the next week will, hopefully, be a time when we will come back together more as a nation; when we will bind our hearts in prayer and Thanksgiving and ask for God's protection, as our greatest Presidents did. And I know those prayers will be answered.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

1020,topic-id,243,"Mr.Speaker, the Stopping Abusive Female Exploitation, or ``SAFE,'' Act addresses the internationally-recognized human rights violation of female genital mutilation (FGM). The Center for Disease Control estimates that approximately 500,000 women and girls in the US have undergone the procedure or are at risk of having it inflicted upon them, and it has only grown in prevalence over the last two decades. FGM provides no health benefits for women and girls, and has long-lasting and harmful physical and psychological consequences.  While FGM is rightly a federal crime under current law, the current penalty is insufficient. It does not reflect the barbaric and medieval nature of the crime; nor does it reflect the harm caused to these young girls. That is why we are considering the SAFE Act today.  As a father and grandfather, I can think of no more important work than protecting our children from those who seek to do them harm.  I commend Representative Dave Trott, an alumnus of this Committee, and Representative Carolyn Maloney, for introducing the SAFE Act and for their tireless efforts on behalf of FGM victims. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

1524,topic-id,382,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Today we are voting on H.2228, the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness This bill is designed to equip local law enforcement agencies with information and resources to address mental health challenges faced by officers.  Our policemen and -women report for duty every day, facing and responding to danger on our behalf. We often see them and we always appreciate them. However, we often don't consider the mental aspect of the challenges facing our officers who put themselves in harm's way to protect our communities.  Today we consider the toll their jobs take on their psychological well-being. Every day, these brave men and women face some of the highest stress situations one can imagine. When officers hang up their badges at the end of a shift, they cannot easily hang up the lingering effects of their high-stakes encounters. As this stress accumulates, it can lead to serious physical and mental health problems. Research has shown time and again that police officer occupational stress is directly correlated to heart disease, divorce, alcohol abuse, and major psychological illnesses, including acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders.  Over 900,000 men and women serve as sworn law enforcement officers in the United Each year, more of them die from suicide than from gunfire and traffic accidents combined. Many departments have started mental health programs as preventative measures. These programs have been successful in reducing the number of police officer suicides from 300 in 1998 to 126 in 2012. But in departments where mental health and wellness programs remain absent, these problems continue. We must address this gap.  H.2228 directs the Department of Justice, in consultation with the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, to equip local law enforcement agencies to address mental health challenges faced by police officers. It also permits DOJ's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services to award grants to peer mentoring pilot programs, and it directs the Attorney General to make recommendations on how to make these and other programs more effective.  Mr.Speaker, we all recognize the profound challenges faced by law enforcement in this country. Today we also acknowledge the unseen toll that these challenges can take on the health of these brave men and women.

It explores the possibilities, which is only a small step. Indeed, if mining was to occur, there is a litany of permits, years of process required to take that following step.  Indeed, the arbitrary decision, the day before President Obama left office, halted a $400 million project, jeopardized 17,000 American jobs, cut $3 billion from K-12 schools, and slashed $2.5 billion annually from local governments and the  These types of effects I feel in my own district where our industries have been taken away. Any time there is a proposal to do anything like that, whether it is timber harvest, mining, or whatever, you then hear about how the whole zone is pristine and unique, never been touched. These operations can happen environmentally correctly, environmentally soundly, and that is the standard for which we have in this country, is that we will do things correctly now, and we will put them back when we are done.  Though a 20-year moratorium was imposed on the area, similar plans for mining have previously been approved by Congress twice. Mining operations across the country already commit to a strict environmental review process to ensure the public safety and the protection of natural resources, as we all expect. You mine an area under the strict guidelines, and you reclaim it.  In most cases, mining companies must also put up bonds to pay for cleanup, sometimes for billions of dollars before a single shovel is ever turned. In this case, we are talking about exploration of the area to see what the potential is.  This bill does not overturn existing Federal, State, or local environmental reviews. Instead, it ensures all projects are held to clear, consistent requirements, not arbitrary political decisions. Allowing politicians to prohibit one project or another, based solely on a whim, goes against American ideals of fairness and equal opportunity.  These minerals are essential to our economy. To those claiming that mining will damage the environment, I would ask you this: Where would you prefer that these minerals come from? Do you want the mining to occur here in America, under these kinds of strict guidelines, bring American jobs to the front; or do we want to do it elsewhere in the world, places like China and others that have little respect for the environmental process or review or operations that are sustainable?  I think we should have it here. Where would you have us get our minerals? Where would you have us get the rare earth materials that are needed for production of new technologies?  H.3905 protects Minnesota's economy, schools, and State budget; it protects the rule of law; and it protects the domestic access to these important materials and minerals we need to have our economy get stronger--a very narrow scope; it is sound legislation and sound policy.

We are not talking about the red or the yellow in the previous document. Let's go through what we see.  Minnesota's Democratic Governor was for mining in the area before he was against it.

By greater than 2-to-1 margins, respondents support the building of a new copper-nickel mine and believe copper-nickel mining can be done in an environmentally responsible way. They demand that. More than 60 percent support an underground copper-nickel project, the Twin Metals mine.  In October 2013, a poll of more than 600 registered Minnesota voters statewide found, among other results, a majority of voters, 56 percent, favor expanding Minnesota's mining industry.  A plurality of voters, 48 percent, support expanding the nickel-copper mining industry in the  All mayors, State legislators, the county commissioners that represent the Iron Range region, and the area proposed for the withdrawal are pro-mining advocates.

1752,topic-id,932,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We have heard some other charges that H.3905 changes five Federal laws for Minnesota's national forests. This bill alters no current environmental laws or protections. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act, NEPA, and all other environmental laws still apply to  Let's go through this history. In 1950, Congress took action to make land available for mineral exploration and development within the Superior National Congress did. Then again, in 1978, Congress passed the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act, a compromise that prohibited mining within the 1.1 million acre Boundary Waters; once again, the red area and the yellow. No mining.  But again, it specifically authorized mining in the Superior National Forest, the green. Once again, red, no; yellow, no; green, go. But that is fulfilling all current legislative and environmental laws.  The General Mining Act of 1872 that we heard about earlier governs most mining on Federal lands. However, in this case, it does not. It is the Weeks Act that controls projects in this area because they are located on acquired National Forest mineral leases on these lands. There are no indefinite agreements. They typically retain a nondiscretionary right--nondiscretionary right, once again--to renew every 20 years. The two leases for the mineral deposit in question began in 1966, were renewed in 1989, and again in 2004, without controversy.  The MINER Act halts last-minute political mineral withdrawals by requiring congressional approval. Once again, the magical words are ``congressional approval.'' The return to federalism--amazing--renews those two mining leases that were denied for political reasons under the same terms they were renewed twice previously and ensures any future mining projects will have to satisfy all existing environmental permitting requirements, including  These people demand that they do it in a righteous way. There is no digging right now. These are proposed. The Minnesotans whom I came up to visit, they happily shared their history and their area with me. They want it done right because they have to live with the consequences; not somebody who comes from Twin Cities once in a blue moon.  Once again, let's go back. This is the Boundary This is what you have heard misrepresented all the way around. There is no mining going on in the Boundary There is no mining going on in the buffer area. Once again, no other buffer exists around a national monument except this. This is hallowed ground. Green, go.  Now, it is also very unfortunate that we hear rumors going around from Members of Congress that the Department of the Interior actually is against this. That rumor is far from the truth. We just received an email from the Secretary of the Interior that they are not opposed to this bill.

1760,topic-id,615,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, once again, we may want to go back to misinformation. This does not pertain to the Mining Act of 1872. In fact, this is under the Weeks Act, which controls projects in this area because they are located on acquired natural forest land. Mineral leases on these lands, though not indefinite agreements, typically retain nondiscretionary right for renewal every 20 years.  The two leases for mineral deposits in question began in 1966, were renewed in 1989, and again in 2004 without controversy.  I would also like to take the opportunity to go through a number of groups that actually are against this amendment and endorse the bill.  Fifty-three bipartisan State legislators from the State of Minnesota are for this bill: ``As elected leaders of the Minnesota Legislature, we are writing in strong support of H.3905. This legislation supports jobs, economic development and industry in northeast Minnesota, and will reverse an onerous, overreaching, and politically motivated decision by the Obama administration. H.3905 has bipartisan support, and it is our sincere hope that it will become law for the well-being of our State and its citizens.''  A second one from the Range Association of Municipalities and Schools:       The results of the withdrawal and a potential 20-year      moratorium would have a devastating impact on the financial      support for our statewide public school system and future      generations of Iron Rangers who would be employed in any      future mining developments. It has been estimated that within      20 years of mining for precious metals, our Permanent School      Trust Fund would reap nearly $3 billion in royalties if      allowed to go forward. The Miner Act does not infringe or      restrict these very strenuous and stringent environmental      review processes, and we emphasize there will be no mining in      the Boundary Waters or the buffer zone specifically      surrounding the Boundary  Let's go to the next one from the American Exploration & Mining Association: ``H.3905 will eliminate delays, return to good stewardship of fair process and restore the opportunity to explore strategic metals critical to our economy and national security in one of the richest mineral deposits in the . . . The emerging mining industry is an investment in the future well-being of our State and Nation; without this legislation, that future is at risk.''  Here is another one from the Competitive Enterprise Institute: ``The bipartisan H.3905 is a welcome reassertion of congressional authority over public lands. Article 4 of the Constitution vests Congress--not the President--with plenary power over public[[Page H9512]]lands. Members on both sides of the aisle should take umbrage at President Obama's lameduck machinations to withdraw from the multiple-use framework more than 230,000 acres of public lands in Minnesota--with the mere stroke of a pen. By treating public lands regulation as a means to build a Presidential legacy through midnight regulation, the previous administration flouted the spirit of participatory and inclusive lands-use statutes as designed by Lawmakers should correct the course by passing the excellent H.3905.''  Finally, the Associated General Contractors of Minnesota:       H.3905 changes no environmental review processes,      relaxes no environmental standards, and specifically restates      Congress' prohibition on any mining activity in the Boundary      Waters and surrounding protective buffer areas. H.3905      would reaffirm longstanding congressional intent that      actually espouses that this area be designated for mining and      timber sales.

Further, there are more than 4 billion tons of ore containing copper, nickel, and other metal resources within the area the previous administration tried to shut down, which represents the largest known undeveloped deposit of strategic and critical minerals in the world.  If left unchallenged, these political anti-mining and anti-education actions set precedent for a sweeping executive power grab that threatens communities throughout the country. Education will be significantly harmed, as Minnesota is projected to lose up to $3 billion in royalty revenues for the State's permanent school trust fund that would support nearly 900,000 K-12 students statewide if the withdrawal application and canceled leases are not rejected.  As the President, on January 19, was leaving office, he actually proposed a massive land withdrawal in northern Minnesota, immediately placing 245,000 acres off limits to development potentially for 20 more years in the future.  In conjunction with this massive mineral withdrawal, the Obama administration's Bureau of Land Management inappropriately rejected Twin Metals Minnesota's application to renew two hard rock mineral leases in Minnesota's Superior National  Finally, I want to put to rest the false claim raised by the extremist groups that this bill would affect the 1.1-million-acre Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness that already has a significant buffer between it and the forest.

In fact, the bill clearly states on page 4: ``Nothing in this section may be construed as permitting the prospecting for development and utilization of mineral resources within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness or Mine Protection Area.''

442,topic-id,862,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.1164, the bipartisan Taylor Force I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Eliot Engel, who is my friend and colleague and a real leader for our party and for this issue, for all of their hard work and leadership to bring this legislation to the floor. All of us in Congress could learn from and emulate their friendship and bipartisan working relationship, especially when it comes to our foreign policy and support for our vital ally Israel, and in our fight against terror around the world.  I commend the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.Lamborn) for introducing this important legislation, and I am proud that Ranking Member Engel and I were the very first Democrats in the House to cosponsor this measure.  Mr.Speaker, I serve on the House Financial Services Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance, where, day in and day out, my colleagues and I track the flow of money to terrorist groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, and ISIS through illicit financial networks.  For years, the Palestinian Authority has shamelessly engaged in an equally heinous practice out in the open: the awarding of official payments to terrorists it inspires to go out and kill innocent civilians, including American citizens like U.Army veteran Taylor  Israeli citizens live under the constant threats of stabbings, suicide bombings, and vicious terrorist attacks. Palestinian leaders, including President Abbas, have not just refused to call for an end to these attacks or to speak out against those who promote hate and violence, rather, they celebrate, defend, and promote terrorism through an elaborate system whereby the Palestinian Authority literally ``pays to slay.''[[Page H9652]]                                {time}  1515  That is because for decades the PLO and the PA have provided payments in some form or another to terrorists and their families, as well as various other awards and titles and honorifics, but the practice is especially heinous because today it is enshrined into Palestinian law. The deadlier attacks of terrorism will be rewarded with even more money.  I know because I have read the laws and seen the accompanying payment charts. There is literally a payment schedule based on the severity of the terrorist attack, which encourages more severe and gratuitous violence and terrorist activity.  For instance, a terrorist who slayed three people in 2015, including an 18-year-old American citizen, Ezra Schwartz, who was spending his gap year in Israel and planned to attend business school at Rutgers University in New Jersey, would be rewarded by the PA with a monthly salary--the terrorist--of more than $3,000.  In sum, these payments total hundreds of millions of dollars that the PA redirects from its own budget to pay off the murderers of Jews, Israelis, and foreigners. The Taylor Force Act will eliminate U.foreign aid to the West Bank and Gaza that directly benefits the Palestinian Authority until the Secretary of State can guarantee that they have ended these payments. This legislation is carefully targeted to achieve maximum leverage over the PA to end the funding of terror.  Mr.Speaker, this legislation stands in stark contrast to a partisan, one-sided, offensive, and harmful bill recently introduced in Congress under the guise of promoting human rights that would cut aid to Israel for cracking down on terrorism. Israel has the right and obligation to defend itself and its civilians who have been the targeted victims of brutal attacks and murders while going about their daily lives. The United States ought to stand with them by condemning Palestinian incitement.  Members of both parties have been working together to do just that. Since fiscal year 2015, Congress has reduced, dollar for dollar, the amount of money that the PA and PLO pay to terrorists and their families from the Economic Support Fund aid that the U.provides. While this has resulted in the reduction of our foreign aid, it has not yet brought an end to this practice.  In May, I joined Representatives Claudia Tenney and Tom Suozzi and 33 of our colleagues who demanded that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson address these terror payments directly with Palestinian President Abbas during his visit to Washington, D. It has been suggested that the PA may be more receptive to international pressure. I am glad that this bill urges the Secretary of State and the U.Permanent Representative to the United Nations to highlight this issue with the international community to condemn these horrific acts of violence. But that is simply not enough.  The United States must use every tool at our disposal to counter violence and terrorism. The PLO and the PA may well continue down the path of more hatred, violence, and terror without regard for the damage inflicted or for their role in diminishing the prospects for peace. But so long as they pay citizens to murder civilians, then they will do so without benefiting from the support of the United States taxpayer. There is no question that should be asked about that.  Mr.Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in standing in solidarity with the families of the victims of terror to bring an end to this appalling system of paid violence, and I urge support for this bill.

903,topic-id,1299,"Mr.President, I want to make a few brief remarks regarding the introduction of the Security, Enforcement, and Compassion United in Reform Efforts, and we have selected the acronym SECURE for this piece of legislation we are introducing today. This bill promotes and protects the interests of the American people in a lawful immigration system and provides a fair and equitable solution on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, and everyone in the Senate knows that by the acronym It is the product of several months of hard work between this Senator and Senators Cornyn, Graham, Tillis, Lankford, Perdue, and I think, before the day is out and the Senate closes down, you will hear from almost all of those folks on their approach to this legislation and their support for it.  Before I discuss what the bill does, I want to explain the process we used to reach this point. On September 5, 2017, Attorney General Sessions announced that President Trump had decided to rescind former President Obama's unlawful Executive amnesty program. Because almost 700,000 young people relied on President Obama's false promise, the Trump administration called upon Congress to do what the President doesn't have the legal authority to do and to find the only real type of long-term solution to this issue. Obviously, we are here because that is a legislative solution and not something the executive branch thinks up and tries to put in place.  Starting in September, I have held multiple meetings with Senators Cornyn, Graham, Tillis, Lankford, Perdue, and Cotton to determine how best to fix Our aim was to find a solution that not only is fair for DACA recipients but also promotes the interests of the American people. The immigration policies of the previous administration carried consequences that weren't always in our best interest. For example, President Obama allowed thousands of people to illegally cross our borders and to stay in our country, including dangerous gang members, sex offenders, and violent criminals. So robust border security is crucial to bring integrity back to our Nation's immigration enforcement.  The enforcement policies of the previous administration enabled dangerous, unauthorized criminals, individuals like Kate Steinle's killer, to have free rein in our country, risking the safety of innocent The[[Page S7835]]flagrant disregard of so-called sanctuary jurisdictions unfairly takes tax dollars from hard-working Americans, only to ignore the rule of law and their own people's public safety.  In crafting our bill, we also considered the inherent unfairness in our Nation's immigration court and asylum adjudication systems and how hundreds of thousands of aliens wait in backlogs for years at a time. That is wrong. It hurts the people who are stuck in the backlog, and it is unfair to ask the American people and legal immigrants to bear the burden of supporting these people while they wait.  Finally, thanks to the leadership of Senators Graham, Perdue, and Cotton, we discussed in our small group of Senators the need for a merit-based immigration system, one where we bring people to this country based on what they can contribute and not simply because they have some attenuated family relationship to a legal immigrant who is already here.  So after having these discussions and after meeting with the President to get his input and his support, we have come up with a plan. This plan is fair to all parties. It is pro-American, and it is a solution to  Our plan, as I said, which goes by an acronym, the SECURE Act of 2017, provides a solution to all of the issues we discussed. First, building off of the hard work and leadership of Senator Cornyn, we are putting days of porous, uncontrolled borders behind us. We are doing this by mandating the construction of tactical and technological infrastructure at the border. We are also beefing up our law enforcement and judicial resources, and we are putting more boots on the ground in the border States so that we can better apprehend and prosecute those who enter our country illegally.  Our plan takes meaningful steps to end the lawlessness and tragedies at the hands of dangerous criminal aliens throughout our country. We do this by cracking down on sanctuary cities, ending the misguided catch-and-release policies of the previous administration, and finally taking real steps to address intentional visa overstays.  In recognition of the many Americans who have lost their lives to criminal aliens, we included Kate's law, named after the person murdered by a criminal felon who came back into our country five times--Kate So it is Kate's law. This legislation enhances penalties for repeat illegal border crossers and expands the inaccessibility and expedited removal of terrorists, gang members, aggravated felons, and drunk drivers. We also provide a fix to the disastrous Zadvydas decision so that the government doesn't keep releasing dangerous criminals onto our streets just because of the refusal of their home countries to take responsibility.  Our bill takes steps to eliminate many of the ``pull'' factors that encourage people to immigrate illegally. We do this by permanently authorizing the E-Verify Program and providing immunity and other incentives to encourage small businesses to participate in that E-Verify We also take meaningful steps to reduce immigration court and asylum adjudication backlogs by hiring more judges and personnel, limiting the number of continuances an immigrant can receive, and imposing new safeguards to combat well-documented fraud and abuse.  Again, thanks to the leadership and advocacy of Senators Graham, Perdue, and Cotton, our bill eliminates the phenomenon known as chain migration. From the day this bill becomes law, immigrants will be able to bring only their spouses and minor children into the country. This bipartisan, pro-American worker reform, which the President strongly supports, is an important first step toward creating the merit-based, economically productive immigration system that both Democrats and Republicans want.  Finally and most importantly, we provide a bipartisan solution to protect undocumented young people brought to the United States as children by adopting a bill that goes by the acronym BRIDGE, Bar Removal of Individuals who Dream and Grow our Senator Durbin called the BRIDGE Act ``an opportunity for supporters and critics of DACA to come together and address a compelling humanitarian issue on a bipartisan basis.''  We agree with Senator The BRIDGE Act is supported by Senators Graham, Durbin, Gillibrand, Heller, Murkowski, Feinstein, Nelson, Flake, Schumer, and It would provide relief from deportation and work authorization to DACA recipients, allowing them to continue to fulfill their dreams, and they will continue to contribute to our economy.  As you can see, Mr.President, our plan has fair, bipartisan, and serious provisions. By listening to colleagues and adopting solutions that both sides can agree on, we are providing a real solution to the immigration issues our country is facing. Our plan protects the DACA kids, it cracks down on criminal illegal aliens, and it provides real long-term reforms to our Nation's immigration system that benefit the American people. It does so through the proper legislative process, in other words, by a constitutional way--unlike a previous President tried to do this--providing greater certainty for Americans and immigrants alike.  Importantly, it is also supported by the That is all the more reason to pass this bill and fulfill our promises to the American people and the DACA recipients.  Again, I want to thank the hard work of Senators Cornyn, Graham, Tillis, Lankford, Perdue, and Cotton, and their staffs, especially, in developing the solution. I am looking forward to considering this measure in the new year and seeing President Trump sign it into law, as he asked us to do.  I see that two of my colleagues, Senator Lankford and Senator Tillis, are here. I am giving up the floor, if you would like to speak.  I yield the floor.

1404,topic-id,2722,"Mr.President, earlier this week, I spoke about the history of the blue-slip courtesy. I hope my colleagues will read that history as well. I explained in that speech earlier this week that in my nearly four decades in the Senate, I have regularly returned my blue slip even when I would have preferred that the President had nominated someone else.  Today, I am announcing that the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing for two circuit court nominees, each of whom has one home State Senator who has not returned a blue slip containing a positive endorsement.  The hearing for Justice David Stras, nominee to the Eighth Circuit, and Kyle Duncan, nominee to the Fifth Circuit, will take place on November 29. Both of these nominees appear to be very well qualified, and they deserve the Judiciary Committee's further consideration. I would therefore like to offer an explanation as to why I am choosing to proceed on these nominations and allow the hearing despite the lack of two positive blue slips.  As I explained earlier this week, the blue-slip courtesy is just that--a courtesy. For 100 years, the Judiciary Committee chairmen have asked for the views of home State Senators on judicial nominees via the blue-slip process. The blue slip is meant to solicit insights into nominees and ensure that the White House is adequately consulting with home State Senators as the advice part of the advice and consent would apply.  Let me be very clear. I will maintain the blue-slip courtesy, but some of my Democratic colleagues and leftwing outside groups mistakenly assert that the blue slip affords a home State Senator veto power over a nominee. That is not true. Only 2 out of the 18 previous chairmen of this committee in the last 100 years allowed a single Senator to wield veto power over a nominee.  Senator Joe Biden, when he was the Judiciary Committee chairman, articulated what I consider to be a sensible policy with regard to the blue slip. He said that a negative blue slip will be a ``significant factor'' for the committee to weigh, but ``it will not preclude consideration of a nominee'' unless the administration were to fail to consult with the I intend to follow this practice for negative and unreturned blue slips. This practice is consistent with the vast majority of the blue slip's history.  I will add that I am less likely to proceed on a district court nominee who does not have two positive blue slips from home State Senators, but circuit courts, as we know, cover multiple There is less reason to defer to the views of a single State's Senator for such nominees when that nominee is going to serve several States in a circuit.  It is important to remember that the judicial confirmation process has changed over the last several years. Previously, when home State Senators did not return a positive blue slip, their colleagues often defeated that very same nomination on the floor but not in committee.  When President Bush nominated Carolyn Kuhl to the Ninth Circuit, her home State Senators did not return positive blue slips. Chairman Hatch, nevertheless, held a hearing and a vote for that nominee. Her home State Senators, however, convinced their colleagues to filibuster the nominee on the Senate floor. Carolyn Kuhl was never confirmed.  A few years ago, as we know--I think it was in 2013--Democrats abolished the filibuster for nominees to the lower courts. They argued that a minority of Senators should not be allowed to block nominees who had majority support.  Our colleague, the Senator from Oregon, said: `` `Advice and consent' was never envisioned as a check that involved a minority of the Senate being able to block a Presidential [nomination].'' Well, now that Senator is withholding his blue slip for a nominee to the Ninth If he did not believe that 41 Senators should be able to block a nominee, he surely wouldn't believe that a single Senator would have that right.  I think the Democrats now seriously regret that they abolished the filibuster, as I warned them about at that particular time when they were trying to add a lot of people who were not needed on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, as an example--packing the court, in other words. They cannot veto it because there is not a filibuster, so they want to use the blue slip for that purpose. It is very clear from the history of the blue slip that that is not what the blue slip was meant for.  On the other hand, some have argued that the blue-slip courtesy has no place in modern judicial confirmations. The LA Times recently suggested getting rid of the blue slip, as did the New York Times several years ago. Even our committee's ranking member, Senator Feinstein, once advocated for abolishing the blue slip.  I disagree that we should abolish the blue slip. The blue slip serves the important purpose of encouraging consultation between the White House and the Otherwise, the constitutional provision of advice and consent is just consent. But there is opportunity to advise ahead of time. That is what the blue slips help to do. The blue slip serves the important purpose of encouraging consultation between the White House and the The White House has an obligation to engage in good-faith consultation with home State Senators for the purpose of advice.  I will not allow the White House to just steamroll home State Senators, but, as I have said all along, I will not allow the blue-slip process to be abused. Ever since last November, when the press had asked me about the blue slip, I have said that we are going to honor the blue-slip process but that there are always exceptions. I am not going to allow Senators to prevent a committee hearing for political or ideological reasons. Those are the least reasons not to have a hearing. Using the blue slip for these purposes is not consistent with historical practice.  This brings me to one of the two nominations we are having on November 29, that of Justice David Stras of  Justice Stras appears to be exceptionally well qualified. He graduated first in his class from the University of Kansas Law He clerked for both the Ninth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit and then for U.Supreme Court Justice Clarence After several years in private practice in Minnesota, Justice Stras joined the faculty of the University of Minnesota Law He remained there until his appointment to the Minnesota Supreme Court in 2010. In 2012, he was[[Page S7286]]elected to a full 6-year term on the court by 56 percent of Minnesota voters. Think about one's not returning a blue slip when somebody gets 56 percent of the vote to be returned to the court.  Justice Stras was raised by a single mother in He is the grandson of Holocaust survivors. He carries the lessons passed down by his grandparents with him each day.  I want to refer to a writing he just submitted to a leading newspaper. Writing recently about their survival in Auschwitz and then immigrating to the United States, he recalled that his grandfather had ``the uncommon gift of being able to see the light of human generosity in the midst of near-total darkness.''  He wrote that his grandparents embraced ``a message of optimism, intended to ensure that their children and grandchildren were able to lead a life free from the atrocities that they had witnessed.''  Justice Stras has an impeccable reputation in the Minnesota legal community.  His former colleagues at the University of Minnesota Law School describe him as a person who ``engaged in debate respectfully, listening to opposing ideas while backing up his own views with facts and arguments'' and who ``wanted our students to be exposed to a wide range of beliefs.''  Another group of colleagues of Justice Stras from his days in private practice describe this justice as the type of attorney who ``never talked down to people'' and ``there was never any hint that he felt himself superior to anyone.'' Instead, Justice Stras ``listened to others' views, and worked to find an approach to legal problems that was both effective and acceptable to everyone on the team.'' They also note in that letter his dedication to mentoring young lawyers.  Despite these accomplishments and accolades, one Senator has withheld his blue slip. Evidently, my colleague from Minnesota believes that Justice Stras has not even earned a hearing before the Senate Judiciary But the reasons given for withholding the blue slip are not consistent with the blue slip's purposes and history.  Justice Stras was nominated to the Eighth Circuit on May 8, more than 6 months ago. After many months, my colleague formally announced that he would not return a blue slip. He cited Justice Stras's ``deeply conservative judicial philosophy,'' as well as his admiration for Justice Thomas and Justice To me, this amounts to an ideological litmus test: Admirers of Justice Thomas and Justice Scalia need not ever apply for being on a circuit court.  The Minnesota StarTribune's editorial board summed it up. They said the Senator from Minnesota ``rejected Stras for one reason: the justice's conservative views.''  The editorial board of the largest newspaper in Minnesota echoed the retired justice, Paul Anderson:       While Stras is more conservative than I would like, that is      not the point. The question is whether Stras is qualified to      serve on the Eighth And he is.  My colleague later claimed that he was not adequately consulted by the White House, which would be a legitimate reason for withholding a blue slip, as I hope I have implied several times during my remarks today and before. So I looked into this by reviewing the records of consultation--and thank God the White House keeps pretty good records. It is clear the White House earnestly and repeatedly attempted to work with both home State The White House reached out to my colleague from Minnesota several times between January and May of this year to discuss the Eighth Circuit vacancy that Minnesota supplies a member for.  It wasn't until May 2 that my colleague suggested alternatives to Justice That was more than 3 months after initial contact by the White Nevertheless, the White House did what they should under the Constitution by listening to They considered my colleague's two suggested nominees. I am satisfied that the White House adequately tried to consult with both home State Senators as the Constitution requires under advice and consent. Therefore, I am not going to deny Justice Stras a hearing.  I would like to say a brief word about Justice Stras's supposedly rigid conservative views. The Judiciary Committee has received numerous letters attesting to Justice Stras's intellectual honesty and, probably more importantly, open-mindedness. It is clear that he has great respect for the rule of law, and his tenure on the Minnesota Supreme Court demonstrates that, like any good judge, he is able to put aside his personal views and apply the law faithfully.  One letter, written by a bipartisan group of attorneys from Justice Stras's former firm, noted that they ``never doubted for a minute that he reached his decisions based on his well-considered view of the law, and not personal, political, or ideological considerations.''  They went on to note:       The lawyers whose names appear at the bottom of this letter      span the political spectrum, from Democrat to Republican,      liberal to conservative. We differ in our political views,      but we are united in our support of Justice Stras's      nomination to the Eighth Circuit Court of  There are all kinds of people writing that letter--Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives. Why is a Senator concerned about the justice's ideological views when people who know him well seem to think that is not a consideration because he is going to make a good judge?  A group of former colleagues at the University of Minnesota agree. They wrote a letter to the committee stating:       We are Minnesota law professors with diverse political      views ranging from very conservative to very progressive.      Some of us have appeared before Justice Stras as advocates,      and all of us are familiar with his academic and judicial      track records.  Now as I continue the quote, I want to say to everybody, get this:       He is no extremist, and he has approached his academic and      judicial work without bias or favoritism.  This support is echoed by his colleagues in my State of The committee has received several letters of support from the faculty at the University of Iowa College of Law where Justice Stras teaches as an adjunct professor. Among his supporters are the dean of the law school, Gail Agrawal, and Professor Sheldon Kurtz, a self-described ``life-long liberal.''  Justice Stras is a widely respected jurist, and he should have a hearing. Ideological differences should not prevent the committee from moving forward.  I would also like to address my decision to hold a hearing for Kyle Duncan, a nominee for the Fifth He also has not had two positive blue slips returned. He is a widely respected appellate lawyer who has litigated over 30 cases in Federal and State appellate courts, including the U.Supreme  My friend and colleague, Senator Kennedy of Louisiana, has declined to return a positive blue slip. However, Senator Kennedy expressed that while he is undecided on Mr.Duncan's nomination, he does not oppose a hearing for Mr.This seems to me to be a very sensible approach. It is the correct distinction that a Senator should make when deciding whether to return a blue slip. The blue slip is not meant to signify the Senator's ultimate support or opposition to the nominee. It only expresses a Senator's view about whether the nominee should have a hearing.  Senator Feinstein made this precise distinction in 2003 for Carolyn Kuhl's nomination. I referred to that nomination earlier in my remarks. Senator Feinstein returned a blue slip which noted that she ``reserved judgment'' on Carolyn She also supported holding a hearing for Judge Ultimately, after Judge Kuhl's hearing, Senator Feinstein decided to oppose confirmation.  Evidently, the hearing served a useful purpose, and Senator Feinstein was able to distinguish between allowing a hearing and supporting a nominee. Senator Kennedy has shown that he understands this distinction as well.  I look forward to hearing from Justice Stras and Mr.Duncan at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on November 29.  I think that all 100 Senators ought to look at the advice and consent clause. We have an opportunity to give advice to a We have an opportunity then, if that nominee comes up here, to vote for that nominee.[[Page S7287]]  Do we want to preserve the ``advice'' part of advice and consent? If we do, I would suggest that we look at the blue slip as a useful tool for accomplishing a very important part of the process. If it is abused--at least while I am chairman, you don't have to worry about it going away. But if it is abused, someday it will go away, and then all we are going to have, when it is all said and done, is consent.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.  Mr.Mr.President, I listened carefully to the excellent remarks of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, outlining the history of the blue slip. I am going to say to the chairman that he has outlined a sensible use of the blue slip, which involves consultation but does not lead to a one-Senator veto of a nominee.  I thank the chairman for the history lesson. It is a history lesson that the Senate needed to hear.  I also thank the chairman for the spectacular job that he has done all year long with this new administration in processing and bringing forward highly qualified nominees. For generations to come, Americans who follow the third branch will be indebted to the chairman for the way he has handled these nominations, processed them, moved them out on to the floor, and given the Senate the opportunity to express its will.

1659,topic-id,1815,"Mr.President, the last time Congress modernized the Tax Code was in 1986. That was more than 30 years ago, which is quite obvious to anybody who can subtract. In the generations since, the Tax Code has grown out of control. It has been a dream come true for whom? The professionals in accounting and the lobbyists who protect the loopholes. But it happens to be a real nightmare for most I would say, for most Members of Congress, as one reads regularly, very few Members of Congress do their own taxes.  The outdated Tax Code helps the powerful and the well connected but hurts American workers. It hurts American industry, and it hurts America's ability to compete with the rest of the world. That means lower wages and less employment.  The bill that passed out of the Finance Committee moves us very much in the right direction to make our Tax Code simpler, fairer, and more competitive. At the heart of the legislation is a middle-class tax cut. A typical family of four with two children making $59,000 a year could see a tax cut of more than $1,700. That is very significant tax relief, but you would never know it by listening to the rhetoric of my colleagues of the other political party. They have repeatedly recited the tired line that Republicans are only interested in giving tax cuts to the wealthy. In fact, they began pushing that narrative even before this bill was written. In going way back to September, they started analyzing a bill that didn't even exist. It was a charge made by a document that was put out, called the Big Six framework. But the framework was no piece of legislation; it merely provided guidelines from which to start for the tax-writing committees.  The partisan Tax Policy Center then filled in the gaps with policy assumptions and crafted an analysis to fit its narrative and its analysis of a piece of legislation that had not even been written. The problem is that its narrative hasn't changed. The Finance Committee provided policy details that it should have used to change its narrative, but it still keeps with the same old rhetoric. I think even the Tax Policy Center would have to agree that the Finance Committee's product differs drastically from the underlying assumptions of its initial analysis.  I am going to try to explain what the Tax Policy Center says about the tax law that we ought to pass in comparison to our bill, and you will see that there seems to be a real closeness in some of the ideas that ought to be done that we get from the left that are in this bill, but they don't even recognize it.  The Finance Committee used all of the available tools it was granted under the unified framework to target more relief to middle-income taxpayers and retain the progressivity of the Tax Let's take a look at some of the major features of the Finance's bill and how it provides relief for the Nation's middle-class and low-income earners.  First, it nearly doubles the standard deduction, which means that many lower income Americans will be removed from the tax rolls completely and that tax filing season will be simpler for millions more. Second, it doubles the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 and moderately increases its refundability. Both of these are made possible in large part by repealing personal exemptions. Personal exemptions for the taxpayer and spouse help to increase the standard deduction, and the personal exemptions for children help with increasing the child tax credit.  Interestingly enough, these provisions mirror a proposal that was put out by the leftwing Tax Policy Center in December of just last year. Nearly identical to the Finance bill, the very liberal Tax Policy Center's paper argued for repealing personal exemptions, nearly doubling the standard deduction, and increasing the child tax credit to $2,012. According to the authors of the liberal Tax Policy Center's proposal, such a change would ``reduce complexity, remove inequities, and mitigate marriage penalties.'' That is exactly what the bill before the Senate does, but they don't seem to recognize that. They sure wanted that as a goal last year.  The fact is that these changes provide more tax relief to the middle class and at the same time simplify the Tax As the liberal Tax Policy Center's paper points out, the value of the personal exemption is largely dependent on the tax bracket of the taxpayer. The higher the tax bracket, the more benefit that comes from the personal exemption. In comparison, the child tax credit generally lowers a taxpayer's tax liability dollar for dollar regardless of the tax bracket. As a result, repealing the personal exemption[[Page S7398]]in favor of expanding the child tax credit makes the Tax Code more progressive and targets more relief to lower and middle-income taxpayers.  Admittedly, there are some differences between what was suggested by the liberal Tax Policy Center and what is in the bill before us. Its proposal would have been more generous on the refundable feature of the child tax credit, but on the opposite end, it would have made the child tax credit available to everyone, including to millionaires. The Finance's bill is less generous to the affluent because it phases out the credit for married taxpayers with incomes of over $500,000. One would think that those on the other side--meaning the Democratic Party--in their finding fault with this bill, would offer some credit for taking this rather progressive approach to providing family tax relief, but no. They continue repeating their line over and over that this bill is a tax cut for the wealthy.  Another major feature of the Finance's bill that provides relief to middle-class and lower income earners is the reduction of tax rates for middle-bracket taxpayers. First, it retains the 10-percent bracket, which many on the other side expressed concern about being repealed based on the Big Six framework. They were wrong in using the framework, but they have not admitted that.  Next, it lowers the current law's 15-percent bracket to 12 percent and expands its applicability.  Additionally, it reduces what is essentially the current law bracket of 25 percent down to 22 percent and what is essentially today's current law 28-percent bracket to a much wider 24-percent bracket. These rate reductions target tax relief to the very heart of America's middle class.  One may be wondering how this middle-class tax relief bill will be financed--largely by repealing the State and local tax deduction, also known as the SALT deduction. Our colleagues on the other side have tried to argue that the repealing of the State and local tax deduction is a tax increase on the middle class. Nothing could be further from the truth in considering the reduced tax brackets, which I just discussed, in combination with the higher standard deduction and the doubled child tax credit.  The repeal of the State and local tax deduction is actually a very key piece of this legislation that makes the middle-class tax cuts possible. The State and local tax deduction overwhelmingly benefits the so-called wealthy, who our colleagues on the other side vehemently argue should receive no tax benefits under this bill.  I am going to tell you now how the liberal elements in this town see the State and local tax deduction as something that should have gone away anyway, and now they are complaining because we are doing away with it. Don't take my word for it. Here is what several partisan think tanks have said about the State and local tax deduction in the past.  According to the Tax Policy Center--remember that is the leftwing organization finding fault with the bill even before it was written--about 40 percent of the State and local tax deduction benefit goes to taxpayers with incomes exceeding $500,000. So we do away with the State and local tax deduction because it benefits wealthy people, and they don't give us any credit for it.  Keep in mind that tax filers with incomes of half a million or more make up only about 1 percent of all tax filers, making it a very lopsided benefit. Here is what the very leftwing Center for American Progress has said about the State and local tax deduction:       The deduction for state and local taxes disproportionately      benefits high-income taxpayers, property owners, and      residents of high-tax states. That is because these groups      pay the most taxes at the state and local level. It also      benefits high-income taxpayers because any kind of deduction      is worth more to people in high tax brackets than in low tax      brackets.  I just finished quoting the Center for American Progress, which said that the State and local tax deduction ought to be done away with because it benefits wealthy people. Yet they complain to us that our tax bill is a tax benefit for the wealthy.  To further illustrate who eliminating the State and local tax benefit really hits, I would like to highlight a recent Bloomberg article entitled ``Tax-Hike Fears Trigger Talk of Exodus From Manhattan and Greenwich.'' This article is not about the concerns of middle-class police officers or teachers on repeal of the State and local tax deduction. Instead, it highlights concerns of wealthy hedge fund managers who may now consider moving out of the high-tax State of New The Bloomberg article states:       The problem for the Connecticut hedge-fund set--and, more      broadly, for a lot of the Wall Street crowd--is that      Republican proposals in both the House and Senate would drive      up taxes for many high-earners in the New York City area. By      eliminating the deduction for most state and local taxes, an      individual making a yearly salary of $1 million . . . would      owe the Internal Revenue Service an additional $21,000.  This legislation repeals that deduction and makes the person making a yearly salary of $1 million pay $21,000 more in taxes, and liberal groups are proposing doing away with it, and we put it in our bill so that we don't let these wealthy people get the benefit of the tax deduction, and they don't recognize it. So I ask my colleagues on the left: Are you prepared to go to bat over SALT deductions for millionaire hedge fund managers?  From listening to my Democratic colleagues' rhetoric, I am really surprised by this article. I thought Republicans were all about ``tax cuts for the wealthy'' and giveaways to Wall But this article suggests otherwise. In fact, these types of taxpayers are likely to experience sizable tax hikes under the proposal on the Senate floor now.  According to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, by 2023, nearly 30 percent of taxpayers with incomes exceeding $1 million will experience a tax hike. That does not sound like a giveaway to the wealthy to me.  I yield the floor.

1974,topic-id,456,"Mr.President, I rise to commemorate November as National Adoption During this month, we are reminded of the importance of adoption to so many families and children in Iowa and all across the country. As Americans are celebrating the season of Thanksgiving with family and friends, adoptive families are celebrating with their new families, giving thanks for the joy of somebody they adopted.  Since the first recognition of National Adoption Day 16, 17 years ago, nearly 65,000 kids have been adopted on National Adoption Day, which is always celebrated on the Saturday before Thanksgiving each year. In 2016 alone, over 4,700 adoptions were finalized on National Adoption  National Adoption Month is certainly a time to celebrate the joys of a new family; however, it is also a reminder of the obstacles that so many children may face. Nationally, there are over 425,000 children in foster care. Over 100,000 of these children are hoping to be adopted. In Iowa, there are about 1,000 kids in foster care who are eligible for adoption.  This year, the special focus of National Adoption Month is older youth waiting to be adopted. Teenagers, unfortunately, face more difficulty in being adopted than do younger children.  As cofounder and cochair of the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth, I have had the chance to hear directly from teenagers in foster care. In fact, our Senate Caucus on Foster Youth has a couple, three seminars every year just to listen to older youth in the foster care system, particularly those who are about ready to age out. These young people tell me that, more than anything else, they want a loving family. They tell me that they need families and that nobody is too old to be adopted. The support that parents provide to teens is critical to navigating the transition to adulthood--from making decisions about higher education to finding a job or buying a car. A loving family continually provides the support teens need to succeed.[[Page S7403]]  Congress must continue to work toward policies that help make adoption a reality for our foster youth. We must work to ensure that all children, no matter their circumstances, have permanent, loving homes and consistent, caring adults in their lives. I am glad that the Senate preserved the adoption tax credit in the tax reform legislation, and I am hopeful that Congress will continue to work on policy that promotes adoption and improves the lives of those in foster care.  As National Adoption Month comes to an end tomorrow, I thank all of those who work to improve the lives of children. I thank advocates for children who tirelessly work to make adoption possible, and I thank adoptive parents and families for opening their hearts and homes.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-29-pt1-PgS7402.txt,457,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,29,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1756,topic-id,636,"Mr.Speaker, the American people are getting ripped off in this bill. The Chilean mining conglomerate behind this bill makes out like a bandit.  They get two expired leases back, as well as exemptions from several key environmental laws that could be used[[Page H9511]]to stop any of their dreams of massive profits from a giant copper mine.  The American people are the ones that are getting ripped off. This land is being given away for next to nothing. For the past 50 years, the leaseholder has been paying rent of $1 an acre per year. Think about that, $1 an acre per year, unchanged for 50 years. The American people are the landlords here. They are charging the Chilean company about $420 per month for 5,000 acres of prime land right next to the most visited wilderness area in the country.                              {time}  1630  I can only imagine how many hardworking Americans would desperately love to be guaranteed having only to pay $420 a month for their homes for as long as they want, particularly if their home was over 2 million square feet, as these leases are.  But we are not talking about someone building a house here. We are talking about a giant, destructive copper-sulfide mine that threatens one of the greatest unspoiled natural spaces in the country, the Boundary Waters Don't be fooled by the claims that the Boundary Waters are protected in this bill. They are not even remotely protected.  Copper-sulfide mining results in acid mine drainage, the same kind of pollution that comes from abandoned coal mines and has destroyed thousands of miles of streams and rivers throughout Acid mine drainage from these leases would flow into the Boundary Waters into a neighboring Canadian wilderness and into Voyageurs National This would permanently impact millions of acres of lakes, rivers, fish and wildlife habitat, and risk the entire tourism and recreation economy of the region.  The majority says it is all worth it because of all the money that will flow into the State's coffers and be used for education. Give me a break. The only education benefit from this legislation would be children learning the chemistry of how acidic water flows out of mines, the biology of dead fish, and the economics of a shattered tourism and recreation industry.  But if the majority is truly concerned about the amount of money that a destroyed wilderness can bring to the State, they should be embarrassed by the sweetheart deals in these leases: $1 per acre per year and a royalty of 4\1/2\ percent on production. These numbers are absurd. These rock-bottom prices effectively subsidize a foreign company to mine on public lands right next to an irreplaceable wilderness.  My amendment would make sure that the company would pay a royalty rate of just over 60 percent because that is the same rate that Senator Murkowski has determined that companies should pay for oil that would come from the Arctic National Wildlife If that is the cost of destroyed wilderness in the Arctic, then it should be no cheaper to destroy wilderness in  With the extra billions of dollars the State receives from the more reasonable royalty rate, perhaps they could fund education and also help all the owners and employees of tourism and recreation companies that would be put out of business by a giant copper mine.  To be clear, I will not support H.3905 even if this amendment is adopted. But Members should be given the opportunity to demonstrate that they don't believe that a foreign mining company should be allowed to get public land and public resources at rock-bottom rates and out in the West for free.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the taxpayers, support my amendment, and oppose the underlying bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, let me just close by saying that this precedent being set here with H.3905 is a precedent that I think every Member of Congress needs to consider.  The backdrop is a mining law of 1872 that has not been changed one iota since then that basically provides the public resources, the extraction of our public lands for free to any company and more prevalent now are foreign mining companies. No return to the taxpayer and no consequences considered on the environmental damage that these mines have caused, the abandoned mines that haven't been cleaned up.  This is a backdrop to a deeper and more serious problem that this Congress has to grapple with, which is the mining law of 1872, and on this piece of legislation a precedent that establishes a template that can be destructive for the future and cut the public and the processes out that involve the public and safeguard the environment at the same time.

1885,topic-id,651,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this House resolution. The resolution is one part of the Committee on House Administration's comprehensive review of the laws, procedures, and resources concerning workplace harassment in the A harassment-free policy and workplace is vital in creating that culture that will require everyone on Capitol Hill to work together effectively.  First and foremost, Mr.Speaker, there is no place for sexual harassment in our society, and especially in Congress--period. I believe as Members of Congress, we must hold ourselves to a higher standard, a standard that demonstrates we are worthy of the trust[[Page H9492]]placed in us by our constituents and the American public.  There have been a number of accounts by current and former colleagues and staff that suggest not every office is achieving this goal. That is simply unacceptable.  This resolution will mandate that each Member, officer, employee, intern, and fellow of the House of Representatives is fully aware of the laws that apply to them and their right to a harassment-free workplace under the Congressional Accountability  The Committee on House Administration recently held a hearing as its first step in its review. We heard from Members, House employment counsel, and the Office of There was a broad consensus that mandatory training is a necessary step for the House to prevent and eliminate harassment in the workplace.  It is important to note, Mr.Speaker, that Republicans and Democrats have joined together to take this step, and I want to specifically thank Representative Comstock and Representative Speier for their leadership on this issue.  The resolution requires training and education to ensure that each Member, officer, employee, intern--paid or unpaid--and fellow knows their obligations and rights. Further, the resolution requires that each congressional office post in a prominent place a notice describing the rights and protections provided to House employees under the Congressional Accountability Both of these measures are regular order in the private workplace, and the House should do nothing less.  The American people have entrusted each of their Representatives with an enormous responsibility. Each Member is sent here to help make our country better. The first place we should start is in our own Training on workplace rights and responsibilities will ensure that those who are victims of harassment can obtain justice and work in that harassment-free environment.  In Ronald Reagan's farewell address, he spoke of his vision of America as the shining city on the Hill, one built on rocks stronger than oceans, with everyone living in harmony and peace. We are not perfect and we never will be, but I believe in that vision.  This resolution can be one important step to protect the members of our Capitol Hill community and to demand that we have respect for each and every person here in this workplace.  The resolution sets an important requirement that each Member, officer, and employee, including interns and fellows, must undergo this mandatory training or education every year.                              {time}  1430  For the current Congress, everyone must complete this training within 180 days of the start of the second session of January 3. Following that, individuals will have to complete the training within 90 days of the start of each session.  It is often said that the urgent gets in the way of the important on Capitol Not today. This is an important issue, and today we will vote to ensure that the entire House community receives the needed training on how to ensure a harassment-free workplace.  This harassment-free environment should be afforded to every single member of our community from that unpaid intern to the Speaker of the Awareness, education, and training is a first step in the prevention and elimination of sexual harassment, which has no place on Capitol I look forward to working with my colleagues to achieve this goal.

I see his work behind closed doors, and I know his passion and personal commitment to this issue. I thank the Senator from  Mr.President, on February 16 of this year, which was 292 days ago, I offered my maiden speech as a new Member of the U.The subject of the speech was immigration--in particular, an emphasis on DACA and the Here we are 292 days later, and we have failed to move forward in any substantial or substantive way in bringing relief to these Dreamers who have qualified for DACA status. So we stand here, these 292 days later, talking about an issue that we must ultimately, and before the end of this year, resolve.  Let's also be clear that 3 months ago today, on September 5 of this year, the administration arbitrarily, recklessly, and cruelly ended DACA--the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA allowed young immigrants who were brought here by their parents to live and work in this country without fear that they would be deported. Later this week, on Friday, December 8, funding for the government runs out. I have been clear, along with my friend from Illinois and several other colleagues, that any bill that funds the government must also include a fix for  I want to talk with you about why I believe it is important that we resolve this issue. I do believe there is a lot of misinformation out there. I think it is important that we as policymakers, as leaders in our country, craft and create public policy based on facts, not on misinformation and certainly not fear.  Let's begin by being very clear. The decision to rescind DACA is part of a much broader and troubling attempt to remake the demographics of the country by cracking down on immigrants. We have an administration that has ignited anti-immigrant sentiment, characterizing immigrants as rapists and murderers and people who are going to steal your jobs. We have an administration that has implemented an aggressive anti-immigrant agenda. This administration has called for a border wall that could cost up to $70 billion. They have implemented Muslim bans which severely restrict immigration from six Muslim-majority countries. They have requested 10,000 new ICE agents and 5,000 new Border Patrol agents when they have not given the resources to be able to fill all the vacant positions they now have. They have ended the protected immigration status, known as TPS, for Haitians and Nicaraguans who fled disasters and may crack down on the protective status on Salvadorans as well. They are seeking to lower the refugee cap from 110,000 to 45,000 at a time when we have seen an increase in the worldwide number of refugees who are in crisis. This is the lowest number ever in the history of this country--actually, since 1980. John Kelly, the President's Chief of Staff and former Homeland Security Secretary, said that he wishes the number of refugees we would admit into our country were between zero and one.  I want to be clear. I have an incredible amount of respect for the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security, who each day leave their homes, committed to doing the work of keeping our homeland secure. It is noble and important work, and their mission is critical. I believe the vast majority of those frontline agents are doing their jobs honorably and effectively, but it is troubling when the White House has encouraged frontline agents to ``take the shackles off.'' In fact, the Acting ICE Director has said:       If you're an immigrant in this country illegally . . . you      should be uncomfortable. You should look over your shoulder.  When you look at these independent acts, there is a clear constellation that has formed. This enforcement surge is a barely disguised purge. This is not leadership. Leaders should not be in the business of inciting fear and sowing hate and division. Instead, leaders should be about creating smart public policy based on facts. So here are some of the facts.  It is a fact that there are 700,000 DACA recipients, 200,000 of whom are in California alone.  It is a fact that the Dreamers have been extensively vetted before they have qualified for They have gone through a process. They have turned over copious amounts of paperwork with incredible detail. They have gone through background checks. They have given personal information about the circumstances of their arrivals. They have answered questions that seek to figure out whether they have committed crimes. If they applied and they received DACA status, we determined that they were not threats in that regard to our public safety. We asked questions that sought to figure out if they have graduated high school. Are they living lawful and productive lives? It is only when they cleared that extensive vetting that they qualified for DACA status and received DACA status.  Let's be clear. These Dreamers who receive DACA status study in our colleges, serve in our military, and work in Fortune 100 companies. They are contributing to our economy in a way that we all are benefiting. If DACA recipients were to be deported, it is estimated that California would lose $11 billion a year. The U.economy as a whole would lose an estimated $460 billion over a decade.  It is also a fact that these young people have stood in classrooms and stood in line in many places and have placed their hands over their hearts, pledging allegiance to the flag of the United States--a flag that many of us wear on our lapels, a flag that represents the best of what we are in terms of the ideals upon which we were founded. We must be true to those ideals and consistent in the way that we approach so many issues as applied to this issue about what we do with these DACA kids. We must keep our word and our promise to them and guarantee what we promised, which is that we would not share their personal information with ICE and that they would not be deported if they continued to follow the rules.  In my experience, it is also true that many who have opinions or who have expressed opinions or who have the opportunity to make decisions about this issue have never met a We cannot fault them, but what we can ask is that those who have the power to make a decision on this issue make it their business and make an effort to really understand who we are talking about. Senator Durbin talked about it, and Senator Carper talked about it. My colleagues will be talking about who these Dreamers are, who these young people are.  I have to say that I have been a bit troubled when I have had this conversation. I remember when I had a conversation many months ago with the then-nominee to head up the Department of Homeland Security, John I asked him if he had ever[[Page S7855]]met a Dreamer, and he said that he had not. When I asked him if I could arrange a meeting, he then went on to say: How about if I could take a meeting, instead, with their representatives? That is disheartening.  Before our colleagues make a decision about where they stand on this policy, I believe that it is only fair--it is only the right thing to do--that they make an effort to sit down and talk with Dreamers and get to understand who they are, the circumstances of their arrivals, and how they are contributing to our country.  There are going to be hundreds of Dreamers here tomorrow on Capitol I want to thank them for their leadership and their tireless advocacy because their stories will change hearts and minds. Let me just speak of a few. My colleagues have shared some; I will share some others.  I met Yuriana Aguilar, whom I took to the President's joint session address this Her parents brought her here from Mexico when she was just 5 years old. She grew up in Fresno, She attended public schools, and she attended UC She was the first DACA recipient to earn a Ph.and now is a biomedical researcher in Chicago who is focused on the human heart. She is doing everything that she can to improve the condition and the lives of the people in our country because of the work she has done and the research she has done.  I met Eric Yang, who came from South He grew up in Irvine, CA, and is now studying business economics at UC Irvine, where he works to help other students.  My husband and I recently attended a play in Los It is a great program at which there is free entertainment in the community park, and families show up and have a wonderful evening outdoors with each other in fellowship. I met a young woman who came up to me. She was with a group of friends.  Her friends said: Tell her. Tell her.  I looked at this young woman. She looked as if she was about maybe 19 years old.  I said: Tell me what? Tell me what is going on.  She looked at me, and she spoke so quietly that I didn't hear what she had said, so I asked her to repeat herself. She looked at me, and she started crying.  She said: I am  She was trembling as she cried, absolutely in fear of what her future may hold.  I suggest that before we take a position on this issue, we take a moment, each one of us as colleagues and each one of us as individuals, to see these young people, to truly see them--to see them not through a lens that is about partisanship or politics, not through a lens that is ideological, but based on who they really are and the practical realities of the lives they lived that brought them to this country, the circumstances that brought them to this country, and the lives they are living every day now.  These are incredible young people who are doing everything that we hope and pray will epitomize the American dream--work hard, be respectful, play by the rules, contribute to your community, have dreams and aspirations about how you can be productive. That is who these young people are.  Let's reject the fearmongering. Let's also understand that this is an imminent issue and that this is something we must address immediately. Let's agree that each day in the lives of these young people is a very long time. Each day that they go to sleep at night and are worried about a knock on the door at midnight that might tear them away from their families is a very long time. Let's not wait. Let's not wait to help them.  Let's reject those folks who say that there is no crisis, the folks who say that this is not an emergency. Let's understand that for these 700,000 Dreamers who cannot concentrate at school or at work and who are terrified of that midnight knock, this is an emergency. Let's think about the classmates and the coworkers and our neighbors and family members who have these children who are terrified that this protected status will be stripped and taken away. For them, this is an emergency.  Let's think about the 122 Dreamers who are losing their DACA status every single day, 851 of them every week, over 11,000 of them since Let's agree that this is a crisis, that this is an emergency. It has been 91 days since this administration ended DACA, and we cannot wait a single day longer.  Let's reject the fearmongering. Let's find a bipartisan consensus to act in the way that we know we should and can. Let's put the Dream Act to a vote today. I believe it could pass and would pass if everyone looked in their hearts and looked at the facts.  Today, 35 House Republicans signed a letter, writing that they want a DACA fix before the end of the year. It included Members from California and Texas and Florida and Utah and Pennsylvania and New Earlier today, my colleague, the junior Senator from Arizona, said:       We don't need to make a statement. We need to make a law.  I could not agree more. Let's give these Dreamers a future.  I yield the floor.

41,topic-id,583,"Mr.Chairman, for far too long, the Republican majority in Congress has treated Federal workers as if they are the problem.  We have spent years beating up Federal employees, implementing pay freezes, implementing hiring freezes, and cutting benefits in order to drive employees away from government service. The legislation we are debating today continues this offensive unfair trend.  This bill doubles the probationary period for employees of the civil service, in an effort to make it easier to fire the employees without giving them any chance to challenge that decision. In doing so, my Republican friends are sending a clear message, and that message is that they see Federal employees as untrustworthy and unworthy of being secure in their employment.  The amendment I am offering would exempt those who have served this country through programs such as the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps from the 2-year probationary period under this legislation, instead keeping them at the 1-year level of probation already in effect.  Last night, I offered an amendment at the Rules Committee to extend this same exemption for veterans, but it was blocked from consideration.  Let me say that again because I want every one watching to hear me loudly and clearly. Last night, the Republican majority on the Rules Committee voted to block an amendment that would have protected veterans employed in the government from being fired without cause.  I was told by my colleague who introduced this measure that being able to fire veterans within a 2-year probationary period--footnote right there: veterans would have already served 2 or more years before becoming civil servants at that level--but I was told that, without giving them any legal protections, recourse, or even an ability to improve ``helps the veterans, just like it helps everyone.''  Well, Mr.Chairman, I am here to tell you that is hogwash. Veterans should not need to prove themselves worthy of a government job for a full 2 years before they are afforded the rights that should be inherent their position.  We ought to be spending time working to strengthen our Federal workforce through better training and more plentiful diversity programs. Instead, this bill needlessly undermines our civil service and the fine people who work within it, while simultaneously making it a less attractive place of employment for our best and brightest at a time when we are in desperate need of such people.  This amendment would protect those who have already served our country in the national service from this bill's intentions. In my opinion, we should be expanding protections for everyone--for veterans, women, minorities, LGBTQ Americans, and especially for disabled  Let me say one more thing that I said last night, and this is with due respect to my colleague, Mr.Connolly, who is managing for the minority in this case, and the extraordinary number of constituents that he and the Members, both Republican and Democrat, in the near curtilage of this area here in metropolitan Washington, they do an incredible job. Their constituents virtually all are saying to them that this is an unnecessary measure.  I am sure that Mr.Connolly has made that very clear. I heard him introduce measures that I introduced in the Rules Committee last night from a variety of organizations. I will not burden you more but to say that we should be about the business of trying to build a Federal workforce and not put obstacles in their way.

He contributed greatly to this effort for a number of years, and his steady presence has definitely been missed.

1096,topic-id,2032,"Mr.President, I have sat here and listened to Democrats, year after year, talk about how they are so much more committed to the middle class and to the poor, as they have driven us right into bankruptcy.  Instead of trying to work on these matters so that we are not driven into bankruptcy, it is more and more spending, more and more Federal Government, more and more regulations, and more and more controls, all of which tend to make us less and less efficient, less and less successful, less and less able to do the will of the people, less and less able to really do the things we have been sent here to do.  Now we are having a lot of complaining about what is going on right now, but, to make a long story short, the Democrats are pushing a financial system that was bound to take us right into bankruptcy. We might have had 2 more years where payments could be made, but we have gone right straight to hell as far as being able to handle the matters that are so important to every one of us in this country.  Now, I have to admit that our side has some flaws, too. Some of our people think that we should do a better job without any money, or that we should do a better job without any increase in taxes, or that we should do a better job without the Federal Both sides have been in error. Both sides have been, from time to time, wrong.  But I have to say, as a former Democrat when I was coming up in Pittsburgh, PA, when I went to Brigham Young University, by the end of my time at Brigham Young University, I thought: My gosh, how could I have ever believed this stuff--which is more and more government, more and more spending, more and more bureaucracy, more and more controls over all of our lives, and less and less freedom.  I can remember the days when we couldn't get the other side to work as hard as we should on national security issues, which were critical.  Both sides have room to grow. Both sides have room to improve. Each side could do a better job here, and I have lived for the day when we both could work together, arm in arm, for the betterment of this country. But the betterment of this country isn't to go to socialized medicine, which is where the Democrats actually took us, until we finally pulled them back a little bit. Now, they had the help of some Republicans to do that, but the fact of the matter is that they were moving us right to socialized medicine, which really has never worked anywhere. It is as though they prey on the poor as though they are the only ones who could help them, when in fact they are part of the reason we are poor.  The government cannot do everything. The government should not do everything. We, as a people, have to help ourselves and do a lot to help our country in the process.  I get a little disgusted sometimes when I see the lack of communication between the two sides, the lack of working together. One side believes the Federal Government is the last answer to everything. My gosh, you have to be a real raving idiot to believe that. Well, maybe I shouldn't have put it that way. The other side sometimes has trouble seeing how we should help the poor and help those who are less fortunate than we are. But we have a lot of people on the Republican side who have spent a lot of time trying to help the poor, trying to get this country going again, trying to get the economy on top, and trying to get it so that we really can help the poor and not just mouth off about it.  I am very concerned because, if we don't get together and start working together, it is going to get worse and worse and worse. But I think the crocodile tears on the other side, as we have watched them over the last year pushing us more and more toward socialized medicine--something that will not work, one-size-fits-all government programs, with no real restraint of growth or spending, just more and more buying of votes. I come away pretty disconsolate and concerned about the direction in which we are going.  Both sides have enduring pluses, and both sides are wrong in some ways. Sooner or later, we have to find some way of assisting the greatest country in the world--which has the greatest economic system in the world, which believes in the free market system--and to do so without total government control.  My friends on the other side like that government control because it means more control by them. We dislike it because we think they shouldn't have this kind of control. We know that is not good for the country. It is not good for the people. It is not good for our future. It is not good for our economy, but that is where we are. I would like to see us someday just really start working in the best interest of the country and a little less in the best interest of our respective parties.  I am concerned about where we are going. I am concerned about how little effort is being put forth to try and bring us together. I am concerned about the itty-bitty, stupid, partisan infighting that goes on here constantly. It is not all bad, but it is not all good either. I am very concerned about a lot of this driven by a media that is one-sided, that really doesn't tell the truth, that really doesn't help us in this country--everybody--to know what is wrong. I think the media has gotten better in recent years, but it has pretty well been one-sided. I don't think anybody with brains would deny that.  I am really concerned because I believe we have great people here. There are some wonderful people on the Democratic side. We know we have a lot of good people on the Republican side. We have to somehow find a way of bridging the gap and getting together and making this country solid, dependable, economically sound, and deserving of being called the greatest country in the world. I think we can do that, but we can't do it if we don't work together. We can't do it if we can't put aside Republican and Democratic itty-bitty problems and work together. We can't do that if we don't care. We can't do it if we keep having the ridiculous, stupid politics that go on around here year after year. It is not all bad, but it is certainly not all good either. I hope that somehow the more reasonable people on both sides will get together and start to work together.  I remember when I became chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee in 1981 with the advent of Ronald The Democrats had been in control for years, and they knew it. My gosh, when I got here, there were 60 Democrats in the Senate--62 Democrats, 38 It was hard to get a point of view across; that is, the Republicans' point of view. Then Ronald Reagan came along. I have to say, it brought an awareness to the public that something was wrong here, and he was able to bring us together.  I saw some of the greatest Senators over the years on both sides work together. I saw Daniel Patrick Moynihan come here and work with people like me. Some mentioned Senator Kennedy and Senator When I became chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, Kennedy had been chairman of the Judiciary Committee and came over to become my ranking member. I have to give him credit because he was willing to give and to work together. He always had to have his share of whatever it was, but he did move. He did come over. He was willing to. Some point to that particular Hatch-Kennedy period as a pretty good period at the time in the U.Certainly Ted Kennedy did. He was calling me from the Cape before he died, knowing I cared for him, knowing we were people who fought for very hard battles against each other, from time to time, but who really respected each other because we both believed in our respective sides, and we were willing to stand up for our particular beliefs. I don't see as much of that today as I did then. Maybe I am shortsighted. I don't know, but I don't think so.  I am very concerned that we are not doing the job for the American people in our little bitty fights that we have around here that don't amount to a hill of beans. I am somewhat depressed because of the way things are going right[[Page S7511]]now. I can't say I am discouraged because I keep thinking we can come back, we can do better, we can witness things, and we can find ways of getting together. We can work together, but so far I haven't seen that, not for a number of years. We can blame both parties for it, I am sure. One party believes the Federal Government is the almighty blessing to all of this, while the other believes, hey, we need not allow a central government to control everything. It is good that we have two differences of opinion in these areas. I don't think it hurts the country at all to have differing opinions, but it does hurt the country when one side thinks their opinion is the only opinion that should be given any credence or consideration. I have seen a lot of that around here. Both sides are at fault, by the way. I am very concerned about it.  I look over at my colleague from When he was chairman, I was his ranking member. When I am chairman, he is my ranking member. We have gotten along well. He is a proud liberal, and deservedly so, and I am a proud conservative. I think most people would say deservedly so. We are two people who can make this place sane and who have been working assiduously together to try to help our country.  I see these two-bit, partisan politics arising all the time around here, and I don't think we benefit from it. In fact, I know we don't benefit from it. I am not meaning to blame anybody, but I think we ought to all do some self-awareness studies and determine what role we have in the deterioration of what has always been great about the U.What role do we have? Are we living a plus role or are we living a minus role? It would be wonderful if we could all live plus roles.  I like my Democratic colleagues, every one of them. There is not one of them I don't care for. I am hoping we can start working together and open our eyes and our hearts and our minds to some of the points of view of the other side. It is hard to do sometimes because we have people around here who are so partisan that they think there is only one side. I can tell you, there are two sides.  I remember the day when Republicans wouldn't vote for any social spending program, and I remember the day when Democrats thought everything should be a social spending program and didn't care where the moneys were coming from or if they were there at all. I have seen both sides, both extremes, throughout my 41 years in the U.I have also seen times when leadership, true leadership, has brought us together, where consideration was given to the Democratic side, consideration was given to the Republican side, and we worked out our difficulties. We worked together. We didn't mouth off all the time against the other side. Naturally, I like those days better than what we have today.

1815,topic-id,2311,"Mr.President, I rise today to address two elements of the Senate's process for evaluating judicial nominations: the role of the American Bar Association and the so-called blue-slip courtesy. Each can influence the appointment process, and we must be diligent to ensure that neither is abused.  The Eisenhower administration was the first to request the input of the ABA--American Bar Association--on prospective judicial nominations. Speaking to the 1955 ABA convention, President Eisenhower thanked the ABA for helping him and his advisers to ``secure judges'' of the kind he wanted to appoint. If that sounds as though the ABA was a part of the administration, it was.  The ABA evaluated individuals before they were even nominated. Individuals deemed not qualified by the ABA were almost never nominated. No other interest group was given such a quasi-official veto over nominations to any other office.  What could justify such a special role for an interest group? What could do that? The theory is that the ABA was a nonpolitical professional association concerned only with the legal profession and the practice of law.  At its 1933 annual meeting in Grand Rapids, MI, for example, the ABA's executive committee considered changing the ABA constitution to allow ``discussion and expressions of opinion on questions of public interest.'' After arguments that this would revolutionize the scope and purpose of the ABA, no one--not one person--supported the amendment, to the best of my knowledge.  In February 1965, ABA President Lewis Powell, who later served on the Supreme Court, wrote that ``the prevailing view is that the Association must follow a policy of noninvolvement in political and emotionally controversial issues.'' If that view actually prevailed in 1965, it did not last.  The ABA House of Delegates soon crossed the political Rubicon and began taking positions on a host of issues through Federal arts funding, affirmative action, the death penalty, welfare policy, immigration; you name it, and the ABA has endorsed the liberal position, oftentimes the most liberal position. The ABA not only opines on such issues through resolutions but also lobbies legislatures and files briefs in court cases.  The ABA has done exactly what it chose not to do back in 1933 and revolutionized the scope and purpose of the organization. It abandoned nearly a century of noninvolvement in political issues, the condition that was said to justify a special role in the judicial appointment process. It hardly seemed reasonable that the ABA could somehow seal off its evaluation of judicial nominees from all of this political activism so that its conclusions could still be trusted.  In 1987, several members of the ABA evaluation committee said that Judge Robert Bork was not qualified to serve on the Supreme I said at the time that the ABA was ``playing politics with the ratings.''  Three years later, several of us on the Judiciary Committee, including now-Chairman Grassley, expressed the same view in a letter to Attorney General Richard We wrote that the ABA ``can no longer claim the impartial, neutral role it has been given in the judicial selection process.''  This conclusion has been bolstered by academic research. In 2001, Professor James Lindgren of Northwestern University law school published a study in the Journal of Law & Politics that examined ABA ratings for nominees of Presidents George H.Bush and Bill Controlling for race, gender, and a range of objective measurable credentials, Professor Lindgren found that Clinton nominees were 10 times--10 times--more likely than Bush nominees to be rated well qualified by the In fact, he found that ``just being nominated by Clinton instead of Bush is better than any other credential or than all other credentials put together.'' Professor Lindgren concluded that ``the patterns revealed in the data are consistent with a conclusion of strong political bias favoring Clinton nominees.''  A decade later, three political scientists published a study in the Political Research Quarterly, looking at ABA ratings for U.Court of Appeals nominees over a 30-year period. Applying recognized social science methods, they concluded that ``individuals nominated by a Democratic president are significantly more likely to receive higher ABA ratings than individuals nominated by a Republican president. . . . [W]e find . . . strong evidence of systematic bias in favor of Democratic nominees.'' You don't say.  President Trump recently nominated Steven Grasz to the U.Court of Appeals for the Eighth The distinguished Senators from Nebraska have, in the Judiciary Committee and here on the Senate floor, detailed Mr.Grasz's extensive experience and wide support throughout the legal community. He served as chief deputy attorney general of Nebraska for nearly a[[Page S7349]]dozen years, during which time he defended the constitutionality of the State's law banning partial-birth abortion. That might have been his most serious sin in the eyes of the ABA, which has aggressively embraced the abortion agenda for more than four decades.  In 1969, the ABA formed a committee on overpopulation, which immediately launched a project on the law of abortion and endorsed the Uniform Abortion Act in 1972, even before the Supreme Court's now-infamous Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion on demand. The committee endorsed Federal funding of abortion in 1978, and in 1990, by more than two to one, they opposed any requirement of parental notification before abortions are performed on minors. The ABA, again, fully embraced the abortion agenda in 1992 and never looked back. It is no wonder that they would deem someone like Mr.Grasz not qualified for the bench.  President Trump has also nominated Brett Talley to the Federal district court in Tally attended Harvard Law He spent years in a prestigious clerkship at the Federal appellate and trial court levels. He has worked here in the He has served as a deputy solicitor general of the State of He has served in the Justice Department most recently as Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal He enjoys the support of both of Alabama's home State Senators and has a sterling reputation in the legal community. Yet he, too, has been deemed not qualified by the How is that possible? That determination is nakedly political and should not be taken seriously.  The ABA once defined its purpose in terms of the legal profession and the practice of law. It has, however, chosen a different path. By doing so, the ABA has not only abandoned what once might have justified its role in judicial selection but has also cast serious doubt on the credibility and integrity of its judicial nominee ratings. The ABA was, of course, free to do so, but it should not expect that its actions have no consequences.  The other element of the judicial confirmation process that I want to address is the so-called blue-slip courtesy. This is an informal practice, begun in 1917, by which the Judiciary Committee chairman seeks the views of Senators regarding nominees who would serve in their This practice really gets noticed only when the President and Senate majority are of the same party. In that situation, as we face today, the question is whether a home State Senator can use the blue-slip courtesy to block any Senate consideration and, therefore, effectively veto a President's nominees.  Since the blue-slip courtesy was established, 19 Senators, including myself, have chaired the Judiciary Committee--10 Democrats and 9 Only 2 of those 19 chairmen treated the blue-slip courtesy as a single-Senator veto. One of them, apparently, was to empower southern segregationist Senators to block judges who might support integration.  The other 17 chairmen fall into two categories. The early chairmen allowed objecting home State Senators to present their views in the nominee's confirmation hearing. In the last few decades, chairmen of both parties have said that a negative blue slip would not veto a nominee if the White House consulted in good faith with the home State That is the approach that Chairman Joe Biden took and that I continued when I was chairman, each of us under Presidents of both parties.  The blue-slip courtesy, then, has been a way to highlight the views of home State Senators and to encourage the White House to consult with them when choosing judicial nominees. And it works. When chairmen of both parties have chosen, only a handful of times, to proceed with a hearing for a nominee who lacked two positive blue slips, their decision was consistent with this approach.  Today, Democrats want to rewrite the history of blue slips and redefine the very purpose of the courtesy behind the process. They want to weaponize the blue slip so that a single Senator can, at any time and for any reason, prevent Senate consideration of judicial nominees. They want to change the traditional use of the blue slip because they can no longer use the filibuster to defeat judicial nominees who have majority support.  Democrats opposed filibustering judicial nominees during the Clinton administration. Then, in just 16 months during the 108th Congress, Democrats conducted 20 filibusters on judicial nominees by President George These were the first judicial filibusters in history to defeat majority-supported judicial nominees.  The filibuster pace dropped by two-thirds under President Obama when Republicans conducted just 7 filibusters in 30 months. Claiming that declining filibusters were nonetheless a crisis, Democrats in 2013 abolished nomination filibusters for all executive and judicial nominations except for the Supreme  Democrats took away the ability of 41 Senators to block consideration of judicial nominations on the Senate floor, but now they demand that a single Senator have that much power in the Judiciary Committee by turning the blue-slip courtesy into a de facto filibuster. Like the ABA's rating of nominees, nothing but politics explains this flip-flopping and manipulation of the confirmation process.  On October 31, I addressed this issue here on the Senate floor and suggested that the history and purpose of the blue-slip courtesy could help guide its application today. I still believe that. The views of home State Senators matter, and the White House should sincerely consult with them before making nominations to positions in their Home State Senators enjoy countless ways to convey their views to colleagues here in the Senate, and every Senator may decide whether and how to consider those views. But in the end, the blue slip is a courtesy, not an absolute veto. This distinction matters because tomorrow the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on a nominee to the U.court of appeals from a State with two Democratic One has returned the blue slip; the other has not.  Chairman Grassley's decision to hold a hearing is completely consistent with the history and purpose of the blue-slip courtesy. Democrats falsely claim that Chairman Grassley is eliminating what they say is a longstanding precedent that home State Senators may automatically veto appeals court nominations. No such precedent exists, or ever has, unless the practice of only two chairmen for only a fraction of the last century constitutes controlling precedent--and we all know it shouldn't.  It is beyond hypocritical for Democrats to pretend they actually care about the confirmation process precedent. They began the practice of forcing time-consuming rollcall votes for nominees with no opposition at all. They began the practice of using the filibuster to defeat majority-supported nominees. They began the practice of forcing the President to renominate individuals multiple times. They began the practice of forcing cloture votes on unanimously supported judicial nominees and then delaying a confirmation vote for days. These weren't actions undertaken by There is one side, and one side only, that has continuously pushed this envelope.  Democrats cite a 2009 letter to President Obama from the Republican conference and an op-ed I publishing in 2014 defending the blue-slip courtesy. In each situation, the Democratic majority was actually threatening to abolish the blue-slip policy altogether. In my op-ed, I emphasized that the blue-slip courtesy is intended to encourage consultation by the White House with home State  When he became chairman in 2015, Senator Grassley explained the blue-slip process to his constituents in a Des Moines Register op-ed. He wrote that the process has value and that he intended to honor it. He is doing just that by returning to the real history and purpose of the blue-slip courtesy.  My Democratic colleagues seem to think that the confirmation process should be whatever they want it to be at whatever moment they so choose. Now they demand that, contrary to most of the last century, a single Senator should be able to do informally what 41 Senators can no longer do formally. They demand following precedent that does not exist while creating new obstruction precedents of their own. Democrats have forced the Senate[[Page S7350]]to take 60 cloture votes on nominations so far this year, 13 of them on judicial nominations. That is nearly nine times as many as during the first year of all new Presidents--all new Presidents--since the cloture rule was applied to nominations in 1949.  I have been in the minority a number of times, multiple times. I get it. Democrats want their way, and they don't always get it. That hardly means that the majority in general and Chairman Grassley in particular are not being fair, consistent, or evenhanded. The blue-slip courtesy has a history, and it has a purpose. It exists to allow home State Senators to share their views with the Judiciary Committee and to encourage White House consultation with them before making nominations.  Neither a liberal interest group like the American Bar Association nor abuse of the blue-slip courtesy should be allowed to further distort and politicize the judicial confirmation process.  It is a disgrace. It really is a disgrace, the way the Democrats changed the rules automatically, overnight, without even consulting with Republicans, and doing it solely to give advantage to their side, even though this is a process that really ought to have fair treatment on both sides at all times.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1963,topic-id,2202,"Madam President, I have listened to the minority leader's remarks. If anybody believes that we are going to be able to work together closely when they just want a bill for the Federal Government at all costs--they had us right there on the cusp of socialism just a month ago, and we are still right on the cusp of socialism. I hate to say it, but our Democratic friends are pushing us toward socialism, which has never worked anywhere in the world, and it is not going to work here. Their answer to everything is big government.  There are two different points of view here. I have to tell you I used to be on their side when I was a young fellow. I was raised in poverty. I came up the hard way. I learned a trade. I became a journeyman metal lather, which was one of the most skilled trades at the time.  I have to say that these haunting refrains were used by Democrats back then, too, but look at this country and the mess it is in, and it is in a mess because of their philosophy. We have to change it. I admit, with him, that the business community isn't always right, and they are not always the best to spend our money, but they are sure a lot better than government spending it all the time. So much for that.  The Senate will soon vote on a motion to proceed to legislation to reform our Nation's broken Tax Code and to provide significant relief for tens of millions of middle-class families.  Members from both parties have worked for years on this effort. As we move to consider this legislation, we will take another step toward accomplishing what has--until recently, anyway--been a bipartisan goal. I want to thank all of those who have helped us advance this process, especially the members and staff of the Finance Committee, who have worked tirelessly to get us to this point. I also want to thank our distinguished majority leader, Senator McConnell, for his work and leadership on this as well.  Of course, we are not there yet. We have a number of additional steps to take, including today's vote. I don't want to put any carts ahead of any horses, but I am optimistic that we can get a positive outcome today.  Our tax reform bill is crafted with the primary purpose of providing tax relief to the middle class and growth to our economy. To accomplish these goals, the bill lowers individual tax rates across the board. The bill also expands the zero tax bracket by nearly doubling the standard deduction, doubling the child tax credit, and increasing the child tax credit refundability, all of which, combined, will eliminate income tax liability for many hard-working American families and significantly cut taxes for tens of millions of middle-class taxpayers. That sounds like the right thing to do to me.  Some examples, I think, can be illustrative here. Under our bill, a family of four making the U.median family income of around $73,000 a year will see their taxes go down by more than $2,000 a year. That is a savings of more than $180 a month. Overall, this represents a nearly 60-percent reduction in that family's tax liability. A single parent with one child making $41,000 a year, under the bill, will pay about one-quarter of the Federal income taxes he or she may pay today, an annual reduction of almost $1,400. Now, that is real money for these families. It will help them to make car payments, to pay their rent or mortgages, to bring down credit card balances, or to increase their ability to save for the future.  In addition to reducing the tax burden on low-income to middle-income families, the changes in our bill will make filing taxes much simpler for most of these taxpayers. According to JCT, or the Joint Committee on Taxation, more than 9 in 10 American families will opt for the standard deduction under this legislation, avoiding altogether the difficult and complicated process of itemizing deductions. This means less time and money spent on tax compliance and preparation for millions of middle-class taxpayers. It may hurt the legal profession, but it is going to give freedom to the American people.  The bill also repeals one of the most regressive taxes in American history--the ObamaCare individual mandate tax, which overwhelmingly burdens middle-income and low-income families. In fact, 80 percent of the families that pay the tax make less than $50,000 per year. Yet this repeal has been the source of much consternation for my friends on the other side of the aisle. I will have more to say on that in a moment.  For most small businesses that pay taxes on the owners' individual returns, or passthroughs, the bill provides significant relief in the form of a simple tax reduction applied to qualified business income. This will reduce the overall tax burden for passthrough businesses, which are the primary engines of our job creation in the United In addition, our bill helps Main Street businesses by enhancing expensing and expanding the availability of simplified cash accountability. All told, this means more expansion, more investment, and more jobs for U.workers employed by small businesses.  Make no mistake, this bill is pro-small business, which is why the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the largest small business association in the country, has enthusiastically expressed its support for our legislation. They are not stupid. They are brilliant people. They know how badly the small business community has been treated by our tax writers over the years, and they are looking forward to this legislation passing.  It should probably go without saying at this point that the United States currently has the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world, and, as a result, we are seeing businesses flee our country for more favorable tax conditions overseas, while others are getting purchased by foreign companies. Some of them are just giving up and letting foreign companies take them over. That is not good for American workers, and that is not good for  Former Presidents Clinton and Obama have spoken in favor of lowering the corporate tax rate to allow our country to be more globally competitive. That sentiment has been shared by countless Democrats in this Chamber, including the current ranking member on the Finance Committee and the Senate Minority With this bill, we are taking their advice by lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent.  We also shift to a more territorial system of international tax--another idea that was explicitly endorsed in a bipartisan working group report, coauthored by my good friend Senator Schumer, by the way, who just spoke here. This shift is paid for largely through the use of a ``deemed repatriation,'' another idea supported by Democrats in recent years. We are creating both incentives and penalties to prevent base erosion, a goal that has become clearly bipartisan during the recent waves of corporate inversions.  Long story short, there is quite a bit in this bill that both Republicans and Democrats should be able to support. Of course, anyone who gets their information solely from the statements and talking points from our friends on the other side would never get that.  Over the next few days, I expect we will hear quite a few misleading claims, both about the bill and about the process which led us here. For example, I think we will hear that this bill is just a massive giveaway to the so-called rich. That is always the claim of the Democrats: It is a gift to the so-called rich. Gosh, give me a break. I get so tired of that phony, lousy argument that they make all the time. They have hurt the middle class so badly in this country; it is unbelievable.  My colleagues will make the claim that this is a massive giveaway to the so-called rich even though they have the same data from the Joint Committee on Taxation, which clearly shows that middle-class taxpayers will receive the largest proportional tax cuts under the bill and that none of the existing tax burden will be shifted downward from those at the top. In fact, those in the highest bracket, according to JCT, or the Joint Committee on Taxation, will pay a higher percentage of the overall tax burden than they do now.  I expect we will hear that, by repealing the individual mandate tax, the bill will be taking people's health insurance away and raising taxes on the[[Page S7371]]poor. That claim will be made despite confirmation from congressional scorekeepers that nothing--nothing--in the bill removes or limits anyone's access to health insurance. The approach they are taking toward health insurance will put us into a socialized medicine situation overnight. If anybody thinks that is a great idea, I ask them to look at the socialized medicine countries and compare them to what we have been able to have. Instead, JCT and CBO predict that, with no individual mandate, people will choose to not get health insurance even if they still have access to premium subsidies, employer-provided plans, or even free health coverage through This bill provides choice. It doesn't take anything away from those individuals.  We can quibble with that conclusion and question whether tens of millions of people who currently have health insurance--including a few million who are currently getting it for free--will suddenly opt to go uninsured once the mandate penalty is zeroed out. Given that most observers have concluded that the mandate has essentially failed to draw enough participants into the healthcare market to keep premiums from skyrocketing, there is room for questioning whether the scorekeepers are right on that score. However, even if they are 100 percent correct, no one will lose their health insurance under this bill when the mandate is repealed. Anyone going uninsured will be doing so voluntarily. We are not kicking anyone off their insurance by zeroing out the individual mandate penalty, and it is a blatant distortion of reality to claim otherwise.  Similarly, no one's taxes will go up if the mandate is zeroed out. True enough, our scorekeepers have produced distribution tables showing an uptick in taxes at the low end of the income spectrum due to decreased utilization of premium tax credits under My colleagues, I am sure, will talk about this at length as well. However, I would like to have one of them explain how a person's voluntary decision to forego a tax subsidy amounts to a tax hike. So far, I haven't heard a serious attempt at such an explanation. In fact, during our recent markup, when the chief of staff of JCT sat at a table and told my colleagues that no one will owe a dime in additional taxes as a result of the individual mandate repeal, none of my colleagues disputed this conclusion. Instead, they opted to ignore it, even after they were shown a JCT table showing that, if the behavioral effects of the mandate repeal are removed from the equation--as they should be when we are talking about taxes owed--every income group will see their taxes go down under this bill. I hope our colleagues and those watching will remember these facts when they are evaluating the claims being made by some on the other side.  We have a good bill here, under the circumstances, and I believe Members of both parties, if politics were removed from consideration, could support it. We have gotten significant support throughout the business community, with associations and companies from almost every industry and sector publicly in support of the reforms in this bill.  I know some of my Republican colleagues have concerns, and I have been committed to working with them to see if improvements can be made, and, as this process moves forward, we are going to have to make a few more changes. This, of course, is how the legislative process works. Our process is designed to produce legislation that reflects the combined views and interests of a majority of Senators and, more importantly, the constituents they represent.  As with any legislative endeavor of real significance, the perfect should not be considered the enemy of the good. As I have said before, I have been around long enough to know that anyone demanding perfection when it comes to major legislation is bound to be waiting a very, very long time and likely will not accomplish much.  Before I close, I want to underscore how much of a once-in-a generation opportunity this is. We need to get this done. The costs of failure and continuing with the status quo are just too high. The American people deserve a tax system that provides greater opportunity, a stronger economy, and better jobs. We need a tax code designed to work for the world of 2017 and beyond. Our bill will accomplish these goals. We need to take this next step so that we can continue the work. So I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes on the motion to proceed.  I yield the floor.

Legacy Elementary School serves nearly 540 students and was one of three schools in North Dakota to be designated as an Exemplary High Performing School under this award. Receiving recognition as a National Blue Ribbon School signifies the hard work and dedication of the educators, students, and parents involved, and I have no doubt the students at Legacy are on a path to success. The school has received the Let's Move Active Schools[[Page S7844]]National Award and the Star Award from their local Dakota Medical These awards show Legacy's dedication towards promoting health and wellness among students and staff. Such health strategies include building wide flexible seating and personalized learning spaces, movement built into their curriculum, along with multiple health snack and food options and initiatives, which work to build both short- and long-term healthy habits for students.  As school leadership states, ``At Legacy, our school Mission is: Our school Vision is: Everyone Learns.'' It is through this dedication that Legacy helps students excel academically, physically, emotionally, socially, and culturally. The school does so by often writing their own curricula to ensure they teach what fits students' needs and implementing programs that grow skills such as critical thinking, perseverance, problem solving, and sportsmanship. The innovation shown by the faculty at Legacy serves as a model that all schools can look towards when finding new ways to promote student growth and development.

Kindred Elementary School serves nearly 460 students and was one of three schools in North Dakota to be designated as an Exemplary High Performing School under this award. Receiving recognition as a National Blue Ribbon School signifies the hard work and dedication of the educators, students, and parents involved, and I have no doubt the students at Kindred Elementary are on a path to success. Kindred Elementary hires and retains highly effective teachers that operate using professional learning communities. This allows school staff to collaborate on a daily basis and develop methods for continuous improvement based on student data and progress. To support its students, the school uses a multitiered approach called response-to-intervention, RtI, that offers timely support to students' academic and behavioral needs. The RtI team consists of classroom teachers, special education teachers, speech and occupational therapy staff, and other key staff. Kindred's innovative approach and commitment to developing student potential has resulted in high student outcomes that we can all be proud of.  School leadership states the ``school district thrives because of the strong relationship between students, their families, community members, and the school district staff.'' To further the communal relationship, the school offers enrichment opportunities through lyceums, field trips, and guest presenters and performers. It is through this dedication that the school provides a tailored education that allows student, staff, and faculty to succeed.  The Kindred Public School District's mission statement reads, ``Improving tomorrow, by learning today.'' This mission embodies all that Kindred Elementary is working to accomplish by looking at the needs of each individual student, as well as providing a safe and respectful learning environment that breeds success. I wish the very best to the community of Kindred and congratulations to all engaged at Kindred Elementary for achieving this high honor. Thank you for your commitment to our children and leaders of tomorrow.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-05-pt1-PgS7843-2.txt,2174,CLOTURE MOTION,2017,5,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A National Blue Ribbon Schools flag overhead has become a mark of excellence in education recognized by everyone from parents to policymakers in thousands of communities. Since the program's founding, the U.Department of Education has bestowed this coveted award to more than 8,500 of America's best schools.

Receiving recognition as a National Blue Ribbon School signifies the hard work and dedication of the educators, students, and parents involved, and I have no doubt students at Longfellow are on a path to success. At Longfellow Elementary, every educator serves multiple roles in their students' day-to-day activities. To best support its students, families are heavily involved in the school and its functions. Unlike many schools in the Nation, Longfellow Elementary enjoys strong engagement and support from their students' parents, making them a shining example of how our public schools can thrive through robust community support.  Longfellow is one of two elementary schools in the Fargo Public School District that provides an educational setting for students with a wide range of impairments that require extra attention. The multiple impairments magnet program provides speech, occupational, and physical therapy services to students. Cass County Public Health supports the program with regular visits by a nurse, and a music therapist visits with the class two times a week. It is through the Longfellow community that the school has been able tailor the teaching to their students' needs.  The Longfellow's vision includes, ``Equitable opportunities will ensure a quality educational experience to stimulate and support all students in their intellectual, social, and personal growth.'' This vision statement embodies all that Longfellow Elementary is working to accomplish by including parents and family in their discussions. I wish the very best to the community of Fargo and congratulations to all engaged at Longfellow Elementary for achieving this high honor.

My appreciation for all of their service and sacrifice is immeasurable.  During World War II, more than 260,000 Filipino soldiers from the U.Commonwealth of the Philippines answered President Roosevelt's call to fight under the American flag. These individuals fought bravely, some making the ultimate sacrifice in defense of democracy and freedom. More than half a century later, our Nation made a commitment to honoring them for their service.  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I believe it is our solemn responsibility to recognize those who put their lives on the line. That is why I was proud to work with my colleague Senator Hirono to pass into law the Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act, Public Law 114-265, to recognize the dedication and heroism of these individuals.  On October 25, 2017, Congress paused to recognize Filipino World War II veterans with the Congressional Gold Medal, the Nation's highest civilian honor, and I could not be more proud and humbled that Nevada is home to Filipino veterans who served and are most deserving of this medal. Today I would like to again recognize and honor Filipino veterans who are living in Nevada: Regalado Baldonado, Aurelio Dela Cruz, Benito Anton, Leonardo Palao, and Maximino To these heroes, your place in history will not be forgotten. There are also many other Filipino veterans from Nevada who have passed on, but our gratitude extends to their family members who will ensure their legacy lives on.  While the awarding of this Congressional Gold Medal is a proud moment for the Filipino community and America, many Filipino veterans have yet to receive recognition for their service. There is no doubt to me that Filipino soldiers served honorably in the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines, Recognized Guerilla Forces, and New Philippine Scouts alongside U.troops during World War However, some have still not been verified by the U.for their service because they don't have the documentation the U.requires. This is an injustice that I will continue fighting so that every Filipino veteran is afforded respect for and acknowledgement of their contributions to our country.  I am honored to acknowledge all Filipino and Filipino-American veterans for their dedication to our country and am proud this Congressional Gold Medal will serve as a constant reminder of the importance of the Filipino and Filipino-American community in our Nation's history.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-04-pt1-PgS7819-2.txt,1863,NATIONAL MONUMENTS DESIGNATION,2017,4,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

693,topic-id,717,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.1699, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing It is an important bill that is cosponsored by a bipartisan--I repeat, bipartisan--group of members, and it was approved by the Financial Services Committee with a strong bipartisan vote of 42-18.  In fact, this proposal has a long track record of bipartisan support with a similar bill having passed the last Congress with votes from both Republicans and  I want to thank my colleague, Representative Barr, the chairman of our Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee for his leadership in introducing this legislation and for leading congressional efforts to help Americans, particularly those of lower and moderate incomes, to help them achieve a greater level of financial independence and being able to achieve their American Dream of homeownership.  Here is the problem, Mr.Under the CFPB's regulations, many small-balance manufactured home loans are now being considered ``high cost.'' This means that many people, particularly those with lower and moderate incomes who want to buy a manufactured home, aren't able to buy that home.  Their access to credit is being unfairly restricted through no fault of their own. Lenders are leaving the market. Five County Credit Union in[[Page H9574]]Maine, Zia Credit Union in New Mexico, Manhattan Bank in Montana, and the list goes on and on and on. Lenders are leaving the market.  As we know, many consumers who live in rural areas, including those in the Fifth District of Texas who I have the pleasure and honor of representing, they just don't have access to rental options or other affordable housing. So the CFPB rules are unfairly penalizing rural residents and working families, many of whom happen to be retirees, single moms, working families, veterans, and they simply want to buy a manufactured home that they can live in. They are being denied that opportunity.  So here in Washington, inside the very elite beltway bubble, there is simply not an appreciation for manufactured housing and the role that plays in our vital affordable housing component.  But let's listen to what the American people tell us outside of the beltway. A 75-year-old retiree from Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, said he purchased a manufactured home because ``it was affordable, and it was in a desirable location.''  A 57-year-old single mom from Albuquerque, New Mexico, purchased a manufactured home. She said: ``It provided the best value for the money. There were no other housing options available. I searched for over a year to find affordable housing. All of the site-built homes in the area were over $100,000, which was out of my price range.'' Manufactured housing is within the price range of many working  A 28-year-old single mom of two from Jenera, Ohio, she had been renting. She wanted her own home. And when she purchased it, she said, she ``found this, allowed us to own a home for less than we would have to pay to rent another.''  Stories like this are commonplace all over America, Mr.And it is why it is so important that we recognize the rights of our fellow citizens to give them the opportunity of affordable housing. You can't protect consumers by protecting them out of their homes. Manufactured housing is affordable housing.  So we have a regulation from an agency that is supposed to be protecting consumers, but, instead, it is preventing families from purchasing affordable housing. We must change that.  We have to pass this bipartisan bill, H.1699. With just a few minor clarifications to the definition of mortgage originator, loan originator, and high-cost mortgage, this bill will ensure that consumers of small-balance mortgage loans have access to the mortgage credit they need. These minor technical clarifications will help preserve consumer choice and financing options for those seeking to buy a manufactured home.  Now, some on the other side of the aisle will say: Well, this eviscerates important consumer protections. Well, number one, loans under this bill will still be covered by the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Housing Act, the ability to repay rules, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and all of the consumer protection laws passed by the various  So let's support working Let's support affordable housing.

1154,topic-id,1404,"Mr.President, the Republican tax plan we are debating today is a sham. It is a solution in search of a problem.  The President and his allies in Congress are bound and determined to give the richest people in our country and large corporations huge tax cuts that will magically trickle down to create a fantastic, incredible, wonderful economy. Why? Why do we even need this?  Corporations and the richest 1 percent of people in our country are doing just fine, thank you very much. They certainly don't need any more goodies. Over the past 10 years, corporate profits have grown exponentially. More wealth is concentrated in the hands of the top 1 percent than at any time since the Great  Groups like the U.Chamber of Commerce claim this bill will spur new investment and help workers. What world are they living in?  Corporations have sheltered over $2.6 trillion offshore to avoid paying taxes. This is money they could already be using to create jobs, build factories, or raise employee wages. It is not happening, and it will not happen.  These people and corporations do not need more money and profits. On the other hand, middle-class families have been seeing stagnant wages for nearly 20 years. Healthcare continues to be a political football, with the President sabotaging the Affordable Care Act and congressional efforts to repeal the healthcare law. The cost of a college education is increasingly out of the reach of middle-class families.  The list goes on.  Rather than crafting a tax plan that would actually help middle-class families, Donald Trump and the Republican Party have decided to screw them over instead--all to give rich people and corporations huge tax cuts they do not need.  In Hawaii we have a word to describe what is happening here. The word is ``shibai'' or B. We have had little time to debate the devastating impact of this massive bill, but even in the short amount of time we have had, it is clear how many of the major provisions in this bill would harm middle-class families. For example, this bill eliminates the individual mandate for healthcare, which is just another way to repeal the Affordable Care How many bites out of this repeal apple are the Republicans going to take? Thirteen million people will lose their health insurance. Premiums for everyone else will increase significantly every year as a result of this yet another bite out of the ACA apple. Do they think these millions of people who will be hurt will not notice what is happening to them and their healthcare? I don't think so.  The devastating impact of this bill is not limited to the parts we have all heard about. The Republican tax scam has a number of obscure provisions that are already having or will cause real harm.  The House bill, for example, eliminates the ability of State and local governments to issue something called private activity bonds. This kind of bond is certainly not something you hear being discussed on ``Morning Joe'' or Wolf Blitzer, but they are critical to our communities. Through private activity bonds, the Federal Government allows State and local governments to issue tax-exempt bonds to finance certain kinds of projects that help our communities. State and local governments routinely issue these kinds of bonds to construct schools, hospitals, et cetera.  Although this bill hasn't even passed Congress yet, it is already having a devastating impact. Let me give a concrete example. Residents of West Maui have been waiting for a hospital for decades. Right now, on their side of the island, if there is a medical emergency, the only way an ambulance can get to West Maui to Maui Memorial--the island's only hospital--is on a two-lane highway. One lane winds around the side of a cliff, making it susceptible to falling rocks and flash floods. The other lane is being eaten away by coastal erosion. So on a normal day, when nothing goes wrong, it will take over an hour to reach Maui Memorial from West Maui, but if there is traffic or an accident on the highway, you can forget about it. For serious injuries, even an hour is too long to wait for lifesaving medical care.  Construction of the West Maui Medical Center is clearly important and needed. When the project is completed, West Maui will have, for the first time, a dedicated emergency room and will offer essential surgical and radiological services. It will save lives. Although initial work on this project has begun, construction has stalled. Why? Because the financing for the project is being held up out of fear that Republicans in Congress will eliminate the private activity bonds this project needs for completion.[[Page S7526]]  Other hospitals in Hawaii have used these kinds of activity bonds. Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Hawaii that offers prenatal care and services for women has expanded their facilities and their ability to treat literally thousands of new people.  I have visited this hospital. I have heard from them. They cannot understand why Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress could, in good conscience, cut a program that saves lives, all to finance tax cuts--not needed--for the richest people and corporations in our country.  The theory, certainly not reality, is that these huge tax cuts will magically trickle down to create a fantastic, incredible, tremendous economy. The fact that this theory has been thoroughly discredited and in reality shown to be false is of little concern to them.  What exactly, then, is the problem this bill is supposed to address?  Over the past 10 years, corporate profits have grown exponentially. This bill eliminates the State and local tax deduction that thousands of taxpayers in Hawaii count on. These tax giveaways to the rich will force States to make huge and painful cuts to public education, essential social services, and infrastructure investment.  When the project is completed, West Maui will have a dedicated emergency room and will offer essential surgical and radiological services. It will save lives.  Brian Hoyle, the president of Newport Hospital Corporation, which is building the West Maui Hospital, said, ``We're waiting to see what Congress does. All of the health care community does not like this bill. It's a very bad bill for the state of Hawaii.''  Other hospitals across Hawaii have used private activity bonds to finance much-needed expansions of service.  With the help of private activity bonds, Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu recently finished construction on its Diamond Head Tower, which houses some of the hospital's most important neonatal functions.  Last year, I visited the new 40,000-square-foot Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, The NICU is five times larger than its former facility and can better serve the more than 1,000 of the most vulnerable babies born at the hospital every year.  In only a few days, Kapiolani will open its new emergency room, which is twice the size of its old one, to the nearly 125 patients who come through their doors every day.  I heard from Michael Robinson, Kapiolani's vice president of government relations and community affairs, on how private activity bonds could literally mean the difference between life and death for Hawaii residents.  He wrote to me, saying:       Private activity bonds were critical in the construction of      Kapiolani Medical Center's Diamond Head Tower, enabling us to      expand our bed capacity and meet the needs of the most      critically ill children and their families throughout       It's difficult to understand why Congress is considering      eliminating private activity bonds when this method of      financing has been essential in providing non-profit      hospitals the resources to provide care to the patients they      serve.  As Michael said, it is hard to understand how Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress could in good conscience cut a program that saves lives to finance tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations.  If this bill passes before the end of this calendar year, it could trigger $136 billion in mandatory cuts to essential programs, including $25 billion in cuts to Senator Booker, Senator Murray, and I have submitted an amendment that would automatically undo the corporate tax cut if these cuts to Medicare happen.  If we are serious about a tax plan that will truly help middle-class families in a meaningful way, we need to kill this terrible bill and start over.  I yield the floor.

1808,topic-id,837,"Mr.President, the judges Donald Trump appoints to lifetime positions on our Federal courts will be a lasting legacy, and he is determined to do whatever it takes to place as many nominees with an ideologically driven agenda on the bench as possible.  Today the Senate is debating whether to give Gregory Katsas a lifetime appointment to serve on the U.Court of Appeals for the DC Throughout his career, including as Deputy White House Counsel under Donald Trump and as a senior official in the Justice Department under George Bush, Mr.Katsas has demonstrated a profound conservative bias that is inappropriate for service on the country's second most important court.  As Deputy White House Counsel, Mr.Katsas has been deeply involved in crafting the legal justification for many of the Trump administration's most controversial policies. He also played a key role in deciding which court cases the administration would support or oppose and recommending candidates for various executive and judicial appointments.  The legal issues he has managed, the advice he has given, and the appointments he has recommended raise serious concerns about whether he should receive a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench.  In the early days of the administration, Mr.Katsas participated in crafting the legal justification for the President's Muslim ban, a policy at odds with the Constitution and our values as a nation. Mr.Katsas has also been involved in orchestrating the administration's opposition to LGBTQ rights in the courts. In particular, he openly admits his role in the Justice Department's decision to argue in a case before the Second Circuit that title VII in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. This position is inconsistent with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's 2015 guidance and with a recent en banc decision from the Seventh Circuit Court of  During his confirmation hearing, Mr.Katsas testified that he was involved in the administration's decision to file an amicus brief in the Supreme Court case of Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Civil Rights He thus supports the position that a private business[[Page S7344]]should be able to refuse to sell a wedding cake to a gay couple.  By elevating a corporation's religious views over the rights of their customers, Mr.Katsas and the Trump administration argued that businesses should be able to say that their work is an expression of their religious beliefs. This would allow them to discriminate against certain customers and turn our system of antidiscrimination protections in public accommodations on its head. These actions and positions should disqualify Mr.Katsas from serving on the DC  But there is more.  We can also trace his record of pushing a partisan, ideological agenda during his time in the Bush Justice In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, Mr.Katsas argued that the military commissions the Bush administration established after 9/11 were legal and consistent with the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva In Boumediene v. Bush, Mr.Katsas also argued that people deemed enemy combatants and detained at Guantanamo could not challenge their detention on habeas corpus grounds. The Supreme Court repudiated these arguments in their landmark decisions in both cases.  Mr.Katsas was also the public face of the Bush administration's opposition to the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, also known as the Akaka bill. As the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General in the Bush administration, Mr.Katsas testified in Congress that the Akaka bill was unconstitutional. He went so far as to say that it would ``create a race-based government offensive to our Nation's commitment to equal justice and the elimination of racial distinctions in law.''  What was really offensive was that his testimony was legally wrong and insulting to a Native people, the Native In rebuttal, a bipartisan trio of highly respected former DOJ officials said in written testimony that Mr.Katsas failed to provide a credible and coherent legal argument against the Akaka bill. They argued that his testimony presented ``a caricatured view of the text of [the bill] and the governing law, and should not be considered an authoritative guide for resolving legal disputes in this area.''  I agree. The Akaka bill did not confer status to a group of people based on race and ancestry. It did so by virtue of residency and sovereignty. With no grounding in fact or law, Mr.Katsas advocated treating Native Hawaiians differently from other indigenous people.  Mr.Katsas' position on Native Hawaiian rights is of particular concern at a time when the DC Circuit could hear legal challenges to the 2016 Interior Department rule through which the Native Hawaiian community could reestablish a government-to-government relationship with the Federal  Mr.Katsas has a disturbing record of pushing a partisan conservative agenda not based on sound law that has no place in the DC We cannot simply ignore his record and decouple his past actions from the person responsible for them. Mr.Katsas has clear policy preferences that are red flags as to how he will decide cases should he be confirmed to this lifetime position.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this nomination.

1564,topic-id,1451,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss the tax relief bill, which the Senate is working very hard to try to pass. I brought some charts with me to show the impact this bill will have in terms of reducing the tax burden for hard-working American taxpayers and also helping to grow our economy.  It is important to understand this is not just about making sure American taxpayers can keep more of their hard-earned wages and income but also this is about making sure we have a growing economy, that we have more jobs, and that we have rising wages and rising income for American workers. Here are just some of the statistics that show that. These statistics are according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation and also the Council of Economic What you see from this first chart is, this tax relief package is about real economic growth, not just making sure our taxpayers get a tax cut but about growing our economy. This top number, which comes from the Council of Economic Advisers, is $4,000 that workers, on average, would receive from the economic growth created by the combination of reducing the regulatory burden, which is something we have been working on all year with the administration--reducing that regulatory burden--and combining that then with tax relief to generate more[[Page S7352]]economic growth. As I said, according to the Council of Economic Advisers and the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, it also generates almost 4 percent in terms of a larger economy.  So this is about reducing the tax rates but growing the base and making sure, as I said, there are not only more jobs but also rising wages and income from that demand for labor that comes with a growing economy, that comes with investment, and that comes with job creation. For an average family of four, the tax cut is about $2,200 under the Senate bill. It generates about 925,000 new jobs over the scoring period and, as I said, almost a 4-percent larger economy.  This next chart shows that across all income groups, across every income group, you see tax relief, and that is because we start by reducing the tax rates. So across the board, we work to make sure you are applying a lower tax rate to whatever income cohort you are talking about. So new rates are 10 percent, 12 percent, 22 percent, 24 percent, 23, 35, and a 38.5-percent top rate, but when you combine the lower rates along with an increased standard deduction--we increase the standard deduction. We about double it, from around $6,000 to about $12,000 and $24,000 for married filers, $18,000 for a single filer with a dependent. The result is, across every income group, we reduce the amount of tax they have to pay.  At the same time, we preserve and expand many of the current tax provisions that are important to our American families. For example, the child tax credit, which is something the Presiding Officer has worked on very diligently, would be doubled. We double the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000. More family-owned small businesses and family farms will be protected from the death tax because we double the exemption amount. Right now, the unified credit is about $5.5 million, and we double that to more than $11 million so that if you have a small business or a farm, you are able to pass that from one generation to the next without being forced to sell it. To help save for college, expecting parents will be able to open a 529 savings account, again, helping families with children. Businesses will be encouraged to provide paid family and medical leave by giving them a tax credit to partially offset an employee's pay while caring for their child or for a family member.  We do all of this while maintaining tax deductions that are important to many These include continuing the mortgage interest deduction--very important for homeowners--continuing the deductibility of charitable contributions to ensure that charities continue to receive contributions that are so important to them, continuing the child and dependent care tax credits, the adoption tax credit, the earned income tax credit, and the deferred treatment for 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts. That was something that came up earlier. There was some concern about reducing the limits on what could be contributed to retirement accounts on a tax-deferred basis, and we continue those levels so individuals can continue to save for retirement. We also continue the medical expense deduction, which is important to seniors who have significant medical expenses.  The resulting increase in aftertax income will allow families more financial freedom and empower them to save for their retirement or perhaps for their children's education. Considering 50 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and over one-third of all families are just $400 away from serious financial difficulty, this is much needed relief, and it is certainly overdue.  This tax relief is also very important for small businesses, so our third chart really goes to small business, which of course is the backbone of our economy. In my State, farming and ranching is incredibly important, but across the country, the backbone of our economy is small businesses. Ninety percent of the businesses in America are small businesses, and what this chart shows is that for passthroughs, which typically small businesses are passthroughs, that there is income relief again at all income levels. Remember how these passthrough small businesses work. Whether you have a sub S corporation, a limited liability corporation, a limited liability partnership, or a regular partnership, all these different types of small businesses are passthroughs, meaning the income flows through the business entity and is taxed at the individual level. That is why it is very important that we show that across the board, at all different income levels, small businesses benefit from this tax reduction.  By reducing the maximum tax rate for sole proprietorships, partnerships, S corporations, and all the other passthrough entities I just mentioned, we are creating greater economic growth and opportunities as small businesses reinvest in their companies, reinvest in their employees, and reinvest in their communities. For many small businesses, equipment, business supplies, and other capital expenditures are very costly, and it cuts into their profit margin. So this is about helping them make those investments that enable them to grow their businesses, increase wages, and hire more employees.  Our tax bill also allows businesses to immediately expense or write off the cost of new investments, effectively reinvesting in our small businesses and driving economic growth, job creation, and higher wages for American workers.  We increase the amount allowed under section 179, something very important to small businesses, which essentially allows them to expense or write off their investments. This is a hugely important expensing provision for farmers, for ranchers, and really for small businesses across the board, and we enhance that section 179 expensing.  All the while, we work to make sure we have stable government revenues through a broader tax base, a growing economy, and a more efficient tax system. That means we encourage investment, and it means the revenues that come to government come from a larger tax base and lower rates. So, individually, the hard-working citizens pay less of their earnings and businesses pay less as a percentage of their revenues, but because you have that economic growth--you have that rising tide that lifts all boats--government actually has more and stable revenues from economic growth not from higher taxes. That is some of what I showed in that first slide; that this is about growing our economy and driving that economic growth.  The bill ensures that we are competitive in the global economy. In fact, as a result of the tax relief and tax reform we are undertaking, there is something like $2.5 trillion that is currently overseas that now has an incentive to come home and is invested here at home in our businesses, creating jobs in America and expansion of America's economy rather than having that money parked overseas or invested overseas.  So, for all these reasons, I urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work to pass this tax relief, this tax reform. This really is about making sure hard-working American taxpayers decide what to do with their hard-earned dollars. Again, I ask that all of us work together, pass this bill through the Senate, get it into conference with the House, and get the very best tax relief product we can for the American people and that we get it done before the end of the year.  With that, I yield the floor.

This key aspect of our bill removes the punitive barriers of the current worldwide system and allows companies to reinvest their overseas profits in America, without fear of getting hit with an excessive tax burden. This important change ensures that America remains the best place to start, grow, or invest in a business.  As companies begin to see the benefits of this new territorial system, I look forward to continuing to work with the chairman to explore ways to move toward a residency-based taxation system to ensure that American citizens have a level playing field around the global as well.  I have heard from companies, American companies, that say as they expand their operations overseas, the Tax Code has made it prohibitive for them to hire Americans for these jobs. In fact, our current system of citizenship-based taxation makes Americans nearly 40 percent more expensive to employ overseas than their foreign counterparts.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman very much for his understanding of this issue and look forward to our continued work to ensure that talent, not tax burden, is the driving factor in the hiring decisions of multinational companies.  I am proud to support this bill. I look forward to it growing the economy and ensuring businesses of all sizes have the capital necessary to hire more employees, grow their operation, and give Americans the raise they deserve.

But, Mr.Speaker, both the House and Senate bills are bad bills, and this is a sad day in the  Hypocrisy is on stark display. Responsibility is absent, and politics--and donors--have subverted policy.  This conference is a sham: an attempt to make it appear that the House and Senate are going through regular order. Sadly, we have not gone through regular order. The thought is we will reconcile the two versions of the dangerous Republican tax increase and deficit bill. I call this a death tax because it will explode the deficit, as happened in 1981, when, under Ronald Reagan for 8 years, we increased the debt of this country 189 percent.  The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee mentions Mr.Obama, who increased it 88 percent, or less than half of the Reagan increase in the debt. And we were promised then, as we are promised now, that cutting these taxes would grow the economy. It would if that were the case.  But there won't be any real regular order in this conference, just as there hasn't been throughout this entire process. There will only be further closed-door, backroom antics by Republican leaders on their own, asking Republican Members to take it or leave it. And this motion to instruct, of course, will be defeated.  But Democrats are offering it because, from the very beginning, we have made clear that we are here to work toward the kind of tax reform that the American people want: tax reform that I worked with in 1986.  And they don't want an elimination of the deduction for State and local taxes, which our motion would instruct the conferees not to do. The deductions for State and local taxes support schools and first responders in our communities, and the American people don't want to kick 13 million people off of their health insurance coverage.  So our motion would instruct conferees to take that dangerous provision out. But no motion to instruct can address all of the ways that the Republican tax bill has put our people, and our future, in danger.  The Senate bill raises taxes on somewhere around 78 million middle class households, not as a pejorative, but as an income spectrum. Why? To offset massive tax cuts for those not with whom we are at war, but who are doing very well and don't need our help.  It plunges our children and grandchildren--of which I have a number--an additional $1.7 trillion in debt--and I think that is the minimum--making them pay tomorrow for what Republicans refuse to pay for today.  And for what? For what, Mr.Speaker, are we being asked to do all of these things? For economic growth? For jobs?  We know it won't grow our economy in any substantial way faster. Why? Because almost every economist tells us that. And we know that the few jobs the Senate bill would create--and listen to this: that they claim that they will create--will cost $1.9 million per job.  The vast majority of Americans won't benefit from this plan; but those who are already extremely wealthy will benefit greatly--as a matter of fact, 52 times what the gentleman will tell us.

1860,topic-id,2284,"Mr.Speaker, the subject of my Special Order, as we have seen, is the very dangerous tax bill that this House passed and that the Senate is now considering. In fact, of course, the Senate bill is worse than the House bill, if one can imagine that.  On November 16, the Republican majority in this House passed a bill to raise taxes on 36 million middle class households and place our country another $1.7 trillion in debt.  Now, you will hear $1.5 trillion and you will hear $1.7 trillion.  What is the difference?  The difference is about $200 billion that we will pay in interest to others to effect this tax cut. So not only is it going to be the $1.5 trillion immediately impacted by the tax cut itself, it will be the $200 billion additional that we will have to pay to borrow the money to give the tax cut and, as I am going to point out, give that tax cut essentially, for the most part, to the wealthiest enterprises in  227 Republicans voted to do that to their constituents. Every single Democratic representative who was present, joined by 13 Republicans, did what, in my opinion, many of their colleagues wanted to do, but for political reasons, not policy reasons, chose not to do.  They did so, Mr.Speaker, following impassioned remarks by Majority Leader McCarthy and by Speaker Both addressed this House and the American people and claimed to be pushing these tax bills in order to help the working people of our country, a worthy objective, an important objective.  Perhaps one could justify this extraordinary escalation of the national debt, probably the largest increase in the national debt of any single bill that has been passed. They cited struggling families and the need to provide a leg up to those in our middle class. Those, of course, are very resonant messages, very important messages. Frankly, we ought to be talking about how we create jobs, not debt. They are being employed to sell a tax plan that would do exactly the opposite of what they say.  In his speech on the floor, Speaker Ryan lamented: ``Seventy-eight percent of our workers in this country today are living paycheck to paycheck. . . . Instead of thinking about getting ahead, families are struggling just to get by.''  He is right about that and he is right to be concerned about that. What he is wrong in is his response.  Those living paycheck to paycheck will be the ones hurt the most by this tax scam. Let me repeat that. The Speaker talks about those living paycheck to paycheck. That concern is an absolute legitimate concern for every one of us in this House and every Member of the  Unfortunately, he has offered a bill, however, that will hurt the very ones he says that he wants to protect. They will see their taxes go up over the next decade. In that same period, as middle class families are struggling to get by, they will watch the wealthiest get farther and farther ahead.  This is not about class warfare. This is about a judgment of who needs help, who needs lifting up.  He talked about the people who need lifting up. The problem is that he didn't lift them up. They will watch the wealthy be lifted up, and they are very high right now. God bless them.  Why, I ask, would the Republican tax plan take $1.7 trillion away from our children and grandchildren and give 62 percent of it to the top 1 percent?  Mr.Speaker, the people get it. The people think this bill is not going to help them. That is what polls show, and they are right.  Under the Republicans' plan, it is wealthy individuals like Donald Trump who win, and regular working Americans and our middle class who are trying to get ahead who lose.  House Republican leaders cajoled their members. Cajoled is a very polite word. They pressured and they scared their members. They said: If you don't pass this bill, you are going to lose the election not because the people are for it, but because, as one Member said from New York, their donors demanded it.  They urged their members to vote for a flawed bill many of them did not want and that none of them believed would become law. They did that so they could hand the reins to the Senate to send back a version no one had yet read or contemplated. They put their House majority on the hook to accept whatever the Senate would pass word for word. We will see whether they do that.  That Senate bill that is now being considered would deeply harm middle class families, particularly those in congressional districts across the country where more taxpayers choose to deduct their State and local taxes, like my State and other  Dozens of House Republicans from such districts voted enthusiastically to move the process along. In other words, they voted against their taxpayers and for their party--party above people--to move it along by supporting the House tax bill with the promise that it would be improved in the  These members would be asked to make further concessions against the interests of their constituents to vote for the Senate bill, were it to come to this floor, because it is worse for their constituents, not better.  That is not how Congress is supposed to work, Mr.That is not regular order.  The American taxpayers and American businesses seeking to grow in our economy have been asking Congress to enact tax reform that is bipartisan and permanent.  You heard Mr.Larson talking about the 1986 bill. It was a bill that was worked out between President Reagan; Speaker Tip O'Neill; Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, a Member from the Democratic Party from Illinois; and the gentleman from Oregon, the chairman of the Finance Committee, a  The Republican bills in the House and the Senate can be called neither bipartisan nor permanent.  So what can we call them?  In his floor remarks before the vote on their House bill, Speaker Ryan called it: ``The single biggest thing we can do to grow the economy, to restore opportunity, and to help middle-income families that are struggling.''  That is not true, Mr.However, it is the single biggest thing we can do to put our children and grandchildren further into debt. I have heard so many of my Republican colleagues stand on this floor and say that we cannot spend this money because our children will have to pay the bill, and they are right.                              {time}  1945  We have a pay-for problem, Mr.We ought to be paying for what we buy. Here, we are not paying, we are borrowing $1.5 trillion, as I said earlier, to give to some of our wealthiest citizens; for that is what their plan would do, raise taxes on the middle class today, and on our children and[[Page H9460]]grandchildren tomorrow, to pay for the wealthiest few to get tax cuts that they don't need and that won't grow our economy.  Let me stress, I think everybody in this room, everybody in the country, would like to be wealthy. This is not talking about penalizing the wealthy. It is simply to say: God bless you. You have done well, but we need to make sure that others do well as well.  The University of Chicago's Booth School of Business released a survey, Mr.Speaker, on November 21, just a few days ago, in which 42 expert economists were asked whether the Republican tax bill would produce the higher economic growth promised by its authors; 42 of the most prominent economists. Only one--only one--said that it would do so and, ironically, later admitted he had misread the question.  None of the 42, not one, agreed that the tax cuts for the very wealthy included in the Republican bill would eventually pay for themselves; and that is why we say, it is one of the greatest debt-creating pieces of legislation that any of us have considered.  Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who presided over the basis for 4 years of balanced budgets, so he has some real credibility on how to bring balance to our fiscal posture in America--he served at the time of historic budget surpluses. He pointed out this fallacy in his op-ed in The Washington Post on November 15. He said this: ``The tax cuts,'' he wrote, ``will not increase growth and, given their fiscal effects, would likely have a significant and increasing negative impact.''  He went on to make several compelling arguments about the dangers of the Republican tax proposals. Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a copy of his op-ed piece.                  [From the Washington Post, 15]          Op-Ed: The Republican Tax Plan's Five Worst Dangers                          (By Robert Rubin)       The deficit-funded tax cuts advancing through Congress are      a fiscal tragedy for which our country will pay a huge price      over time. While the details of the tax plan remain in flux,      its fundamental contours will not change. Nor will its $1.5      trillion of deficit funding, the amount stipulated in the      recently passed budget resolution.       Perhaps it's hopeless to expect those in Congress who have      long bemoaned deficits and the debt to oppose the plan. If,      however, as a matter of conscience or renewed reflection they      decide to take heed, here are the fiscal dangers posed by the      plan.       To start, the tax cuts will not increase growth and, given      their fiscal effects, would likely have a significant and      increasingly negative impact. The nonpartisan Tax Policy      Center's latest report estimated that, over 10 years, the      average increase in our growth rate would be roughly zero,      counting the crowding out of private investment by increasing      deficits but not counting other adverse effects of worsening      our fiscal outlook. The Penn Wharton Budget Model, using the      same approach, estimates virtually no increase in long-term      growth. Goldman Sachs projects an increase of 0.1 percent to      0.2 percent in the first couple of years and an average      increase over 10 years of just 0.05 percent per year, not      counting any of the adverse fiscal effects.       These estimates reflect three underlying views held by      mainstream economists. First, individual tax cuts will not      materially induce people to work more. Second, corporate tax      cuts will likely have limited effect on investment or      decisions about where to locate business activity, given the      many other variables at play. Third, deficit-funded tax cuts      will have little short-term effect on growth, except perhaps      for some temporary overheating, because we are at roughly      full employment.       With no additional revenue from increased growth to offset      the tax cuts' cost, the publicly held debt of the federal      government would increase by $1.5 trillion. An additional      danger is that the actual deficit impact would be increased      by abandoning the Congressional Budget Office's nonpartisan      evaluation that has been used for decades by both parties in      favor of partisan calculations by those pushing the tax cuts.       Adding $1.5 trillion or more to the federal debt would make      an already bad situation worse. A useful measure of our      fiscal position is the ratio of publicly held government debt      to economic output or gross domestic product, called the      debt/GDP ratio. In 2000, the debt/GDP ratio was 32 percent.      The ratio is now 77 percent. Looking forward, the CBO      projects the debt/GDP ratio to be 91 percent in 2027 and 150      percent in 2047. After $1.5 trillion of deficit-funded tax      cuts, those future ratios have been estimated to increase to      roughly 97 percent in 2027 and 160 percent in 2047. These      estimates likely substantially understate the worsening of      our fiscal trajectory. That's because they do not account for      the increasingly adverse effect on growth of the difficult-     to-quantify effects of fiscal deterioration.       Exacerbating our already unsustainable fiscal trajectory      with these tax cuts would threaten growth in five respects.      These are highly likely to be substantial and to increase      over time.       First, business confidence would likely be negatively      affected by creating uncertainty about future policy and      heightening concern about our political system's ability to      meet our economic policy challenges.       Second, our country's resilience to deal with inevitable      future economic and geopolitical emergencies, including the      effects of climate change, would continue to decline.       Third, funds available for public investment, national      security and defense spending--a professed concern of many      tax-cut proponents--would continue to decline as debt rises,      because of rising interest costs and the increased risk of      borrowing to fund government activities.       Fourth, Treasury bond interest rates would be highly likely      to increase over time because of increased demand for the      supply of savings and increased concern about future      imbalances. That, in turn, would raise private-sector      interest rates, which could also increase due to widening      spreads vs. Treasuries, further reflecting increased concern      about future conditions. And even a limited increase in the      debt/GDP ratio could focus attention on our fiscal      trajectory's long-ignored risks and trigger outsize increases      in Treasury and private-sector interest rates. The ability to      borrow in our own currency, and to print it through the      Federal Reserve, may diminish these risks for a while, as      might capital inflows from abroad. But these mitigating      factors have their limits; at some point, unsound fiscal      conditions almost surely would undermine our currency and      debt markets.       Finally, at some unpredictable point, fiscal conditions--     and these market dynamics--would likely be seen as      sufficiently serious to cause severe market and economic      destabilization.       We have an imperative need to address our unsustainable      longer-term fiscal trajectory with sound economic policies.      Few elected officials want to face this fact, but, at the      very least, they should not make matters worse. We can only      hope that responsible elected officials will prevent this      irresponsible tax plan from being adopted.

1861,topic-id,2949,"Mr.Speaker, furthermore, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan group, Speaker Ryan was flat wrong, flat out wrong, to say that their plan would ensure that ``the average family at every income level gets a tax cut.'' The Joint Committee on Taxation says that is not true.  I presume the Speaker was misinformed, because taxes would go up on all income groups below $50,000. Perhaps the Speaker misspoke.  Speaker Ryan said: ``I am a chart guy.''  Well, I like charts myself, Mr.Speaker, and I want to bring up this first chart. I will bring this a little closer so I can explain this.  The Speaker claimed that a family of four making $59,000 would get a ``$1,182 tax cut in the first year alone.'' Well, now if you hear that, that sounds, I suppose, like a pretty good deal.  Unfortunately, for that family, their cut would shrink every year. This is the shrinkage. And then it would drop precipitously. By 2024, it would become a tax increase, increase, increase, increase. And, as you see, that increase escalates the 4 years: 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027. So starting in the seventh year of this program, middle America, $50,000, you get a tax increase.  But guess what? That is not what happens to the wealthiest in  It is even worse. The Speaker mentioned the family making $59,000 a year, and what he said is: They get $1,182 a year in a tax cut. What he didn't say is what the upper 1 percent get. They get $1,198 per week--52 times more than the middle class families that the Speaker spoke about and lamented the fact that they needed more dollars in their pocket.  He didn't talk about the wealthiest. He didn't say what they got. I don't blame him because, in his bill, he decided to give $1,198.52 a week to the wealthiest, and $1,182 a year to that middle class family he says is struggling and living paycheck to paycheck.  What kind of fairness is that? What kind of rationale is that? What kind of real help to the middle class is that?  That is about, by the way, $25 per week versus $1,198.52 per week.  Speaker Ryan showed us a chart that highlighted how, under the House bill, those middle class families promised a tax increase get to see an extra $1,182 in savings the first year. We put it down, and then we put 52 layers above that for the people in the upper 1 percent.  Under that same plan, as their cut shrinks--you saw that in the last[[Page H9461]]chart--the wealthiest taxpayers would see an average tax cut of $1,198 every week. And it is even a wider disparity under the Senate bill. Now, that is a gulf of disparity, a gulf of unfairness, a gulf of not helping the average working person in But the Senate bill--the Senate bill--is even worse.  The Senate GOP tax scam would increase taxes on 82 million--remember I said in the House bill, 36 million middle class taxpayers got an increase? Well, the Senate has doubled that, actually more than doubled that. Eighty-two million middle class households will get a tax increase under the Senate tax bill.  And with substantial tax increases on 36 million middle class households over the next decade in the House bill, it is hard to imagine a worse plan, yet, somehow, Senate Republicans achieved it.  The Tax Policy Center, another nonpartisan analytic group, found that, under the perverse structure of the Senate bill, sunsetting individual benefits in a few short years, even as it offers permanent--get this, follow this. We are talking about--Speaker Ryan spoke from that rostrum, talked about these struggling Americans living paycheck to paycheck. He offered a bill, and the Senate is now doubling down on the proposal of making sure those struggling Americans got, over the life of this bill, less and less and less, and then finally, paid more and more and more, while the wealthiest had no cut.  The Tax Policy Center said that the sunsetting individual benefits in a few short years, even as it offers permanent corporate tax cuts, 82 million middle class individuals and households will pay more in taxes than they would under the current system.  Mr.Speaker, I want to make that point again. The Tax Policy Center says people are going to pay more under this tax bill, some 82 million of them, than they would under the current system.  On top of that, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has pointed out that, under the Senate bill, undermining the Affordable Care Act--so not only will their taxes be increased over the life of this bill, but 13 million Americans would lose their healthcare under the Senate bill--not the House bill, but under the Senate bill. And that is what the House is going to be asked to vote on. I hope the Senate doesn't pass that.  Mr.Larson talked about sequester and the PAYGO Act requiring a $25 billion cut in Medicare as a result of this bill. The Senate has added in there legislation to adversely affect the Affordable Care Act, which will adversely affect 13 million Americans; some of them may be the same people who get the tax increase, some may not. They would kick 13 million off healthcare.  So the Republican tax plan is not bipartisan, and it is not permanent tax reform. The way you achieve those, as I said at the beginning, is through bipartisan cooperation. But, as Mr.Larson pointed out, there was no intention to do that, no intention to include the public, no intention to have markups over a period of time. They did have markups, but they were very short in duration, and no American had the opportunity to weigh in and give their opinion. There were no hearings, and there were less than zero witnesses. I guess there can't be less than zero. There were zero witnesses.  So the bill is not a tax cut. Speaker Ryan has also tried to describe it as a job-creator. Now, again, we are talking about, correctly, the folks in this country who are living paycheck to paycheck and having a hard time, and we need to help them. We need to work on creating them jobs.  By the way, there is no jobs bill that has been sent down here from the President, but they claim this is a jobs bill. As a matter of fact, they claim that it not only explodes the debt, costs taxpayers $1.9 trillion, but it would create, they say, 890,000 new jobs.  Now, in order to create what they say are 890,000 new jobs--and, by the way, going back to Secretary Rubin, he does not believe that will happen. He is the one that led us to balanced budgets.  In fact, every one of those jobs, every single job is going to cost $1.9 million to create. That is what the Speaker said. This is going to create 879 million, we are going to borrow $1.7 trillion to do it. By golly, you could give everybody 100,000 bucks, and you would be way ahead of the game. But that is not what was done.  We are creating large, large debt, and we will not create the jobs the Speaker said. And if we did, they would cost $1.9 million per job.  According to the conservative Tax Foundation, using the most optimistic model projecting economic growth so far presented, that may be technically true, over 10 years now.  But with a price tag of $1.7 trillion in added debt over the same period, that means that each job would cost $1.9 million, while 82 million working Americans, those struggling Americans of which Paul Ryan spoke, would get a tax increase under the Senate bill--nearly $2 million of added debt to create a single job. Nearly $2 million of added debt to create a single job. So this clearly isn't a jobs bill either.                              {time}  2000  This has already been discussed, but let me reiterate the key point I made earlier.  It can't be called bipartisan. Republican leader after Republican leader after Republican leader has lamented the fact that we passed the Affordable Care Act without it being bipartisan. The difference, of course, was we had literally thousands of meetings, scores--well over 60--of hearings, amendments offered by Republicans and It took over a year of consideration by the country, well vetted--controversial, but well vetted. This bill has been rushed through without hearings, without any kind of consideration and input from the public--in 1986, 30 hearings; in 2017, zero hearings.  I am repeating what Mr.Larson said, but it is important to understand the dramatic difference: a bipartisan bill with President Ronald Reagan and Speaker Tip O'Neill leading the way for bipartisanship and agreement on a bill that, by the way, was revenue neutral, it did not create any new debt, as opposed to the $1.7 trillion--that is with a T, trillion--that will put every child in America deeply in debt for decades to come.  In 1986, 450 witnesses; in 2017, zero.  Bipartisan support, yes; bipartisan support, no.  Markup, I mentioned markup. That is when you put the bill together, when you give it thoughtful consideration. You offer amendments. You try to perfect it. Twenty-six days in 1986; 4 days in 2017.  This is a bill of over 600 pages. I remember everybody saying how long the Affordable Care Act was and you possibly couldn't do it. Again, over a year and a half of consideration of that bill; 4 days, introduced, the next week markup, 4 days, on the floor.  I was here in 1986, Mr.Speaker, the last time we rewrote our Tax That was a truly bipartisan process. I hope everybody read the remarks of Senator John McCain when he came back to the Senate and voted to move the process forward on the Affordable Care Act but then voted against the final product.  He voted, and he gave a speech in which he said, speaking to the president of the Senate:       Mr.President, I have been here for some period of time,      and my experience has essentially been that, when we did      things in a partisan way, they were neither lasting nor very      good. But when we do things in a bipartisan way, they are      much better and they are much more permanent. There is much      more competence in that product that was reached in a      bipartisan way.  Speaker Ryan made a point in his remarks about how long overdue we are for a tax overhaul, and he said it has been 31 years since we last did this. Now, of course, he didn't say: I was chairman of the Ways and Means Committee for 11 months and didn't report out a single tax bill.  I am not sure why, but that was the case.  We did bipartisan in 1986. We did permanent tax reform. We did it together, and we did it in a way that was paid for. That is not what this is. Neither the House bill nor the Senate bill achieves those key aims.  The Republican tax overhaul process is dangerously flawed precisely because it is partisan, because it rejects the benefits of compromise in favor of the pitfalls of expediency.  I called it, in my speech in opposition to its adoption, ``reckless and feckless.'' It was reckless because it would[[Page H9462]]heap that $1.7 trillion with a T, $1.7 trillion of additional debt on our party, on our country, on our children, on our people. Bob Rubin, in that column which I referred to, said that that debt would undermine expansion because it would rob the capital markets of money that could be used to build small businesses and to build medium-sized businesses and invest in large businesses to create and keep jobs.  It is feckless because the same people who used to call themselves fiscally responsible--Senator McConnell, Speaker Ryan, Senator Hatch, others whom I could name--have all stood on the floor of the House or in a press conference and said we need to have the debt reduced, and yet they offer a bill that adds $1.7 trillion to the debt; feckless because the same people who used to call themselves fiscally responsible are now choosing to ignore fiscal sustainability in favor of a short-lived political win.  This is not about policy. It is about politics. It is about appealing to a relatively small group of very, very connected people, but it is our country that will lose.  I told people during that speech that I have been in office for some time. I served in the State senate and now in the It takes no courage--no courage--to vote for a tax cut. What takes courage is to pay for what you buy, whether it is national security, which I support, whether it is education, which, if we don't invest in, our country will not be great. It is great in part because we have invested in our education system.  Unless we invest in the health of our people, which is the health of our society, we will not be great, and unless we invest in the security of our people domestically, in law, in order, enforcement, in protection for our people.  It will not be great unless we invest in basic biomedical research to make sure that the diseases that exist now and that may exist in the future can be met with medical cures and palliatives.  We will not be great if we sink our country deeply, deeply, deeply into debt and do not have the courage to say, in this generation, we will pay for what we need and not simply buy and pass the debt along to our children and to our grandchildren, because that is what we are doing in this tax bill.  It is not only an intellectually bankrupt policy, it is an immoral policy that we pursue. As the Senate version takes shape, Mr.Speaker, Republicans who voted grudgingly for the House bill ought to be deeply concerned; and I hope, for the sake of their country, they are good people.  There are good people on both sides of this aisle. There are conscientious people on both sides of this aisle. There are Americans on both sides of this aisle, Americans who have sworn to protect and defend the Constitution of our country and have, as well, sworn to protect the people of this country.  There ought to be deep concern among people of good conscience, concern that it does not meet the very same criteria that Speaker Ryan set forth in laying out what tax reform ought to achieve and what he claimed their House bill achieved. Neither does it adhere to the Speaker's clear promise not to package together separate matters into the same legislation.  Make no mistake, the Senate bill House Republicans will be asked to vote for isn't just a tax hike for the middle class, although that it is. It is also a repeal of a significant component of the Affordable Care Act, which will hurt that same middle class. It may have been difficult for Republicans to cast their votes for vague promises on November 16, but I suggest to you, Mr.Speaker, it will be even more difficult to do so for a legislative product that puts their constituents, those the Speaker talked about struggling just to get by, people who, if they have a $500 debt, are not sure they can pay it, it will affect those folks and put them in even greater danger should the Senate bill make it back to the  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to reject this bill. I urge my colleagues in the House to look deeply into their souls and not at their polls and reflect upon what they are doing to their country by perpetuating the fiscally irresponsible policies of borrowing, of borrowing, of borrowing and not having the courage to pay this generation's bills now and not pass them along to our children and to our grandchildren.  Every Member of this House and of the Senate, Mr.Speaker, ought to look themselves in the mirror and say: When I gave those speeches, when I referenced that to the press, was I being honest? Am I following a policy today that is consistent with that assertion? I think they will come to the inexorable answer: If I vote for this tax bill, I am not.  Therefore, I hope that all of us will reject this partisan piece of legislation that vastly increases our debt, increases the taxes on middle class workers, threatens Social Security with a $25 billion cut, and threatens our economy.  Let us have the courage to serve our people honestly and take the tough vote and then come together in a bipartisan fashion and do what we showed we could do in 1986: pass a bipartisan bill that, yes, makes our corporations competitive internationally and, yes, gives the bulk of the tax cuts to those who the Speaker referred to as struggling. They are the ones who need relief, and we could do that in a bipartisan fashion, and we can pay for it.  David Camp showed us the way. I didn't agree with all of his bill, but he showed the courage--a Republican from Michigan who was chairman of the Ways and Means Committee--and put up a bill on tax reform that was paid for. The Republicans were in charge of this House and they dismissed it out of hand, too tough.  Mr.Speaker, let's do the right thing. Let's reject this bill.

2055,topic-id,663,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  This is the most irresponsible bill that I will have been confronted with in the 37 years that I have been in the Congress of the United  This bill, Mr.Speaker, is both reckless and feckless. It is reckless because it would add more than $1.7 trillion--the chairman says over $2 trillion--to the debt over a decade in a shameful act of hypocrisy for its supporters who, for years, have called for fiscal responsibility. It is feckless because its authors write it with an eye toward politics, not policy.  There is no courage in voting for this bill. It is easy to vote for a tax cut. What is hard to do is paying for what we buy. Neither side does that particularly well.  There is no courage in voting for this bill, only a suspension of common sense and their now abandoned commitment to fiscal sustainability.  Furthermore, my Republican friends call this bill a tax cut. The gentleman who just spoke, the whip, said it is a reduction in rates, but 36 million working Americans will receive a tax increase under this bill. It was a very careful articulation of reduction of rates, but taxes for 36 million Americans, working Americans, will go up.  Furthermore, they call this bill a tax cut. It is not a stretch of the imagination to presume that, given Republicans' urgency to reject bipartisan compromise and deflect public input, the Members of this House will be asked to accept whatever version of the tax bill can pass the United States  Yesterday, the Senate Finance Committee rejected this bill 36-0. The Senate Finance Committee, headed by Republicans, rejected this bill 36-0.  I am reminded of what Representative Matt Gaetz, a Republican, said last month about the budget resolution that teed up this tax plan. He said that we were being ``asked to vote for a budget that nobody believes in so that we have the chance to vote for a tax bill that nobody's read.''  Mr.Speaker, I won't ask anyone to raise their hand if they have read this bill.  One hand.  Those who take this vote will have to live with it and just hope that whatever mystery tax package their Senate colleagues send over here won't gut whatever concessions they have extracted  I heard the whip say no special provisions in this bill. I don't have the time to go through every special provision that has been used to get people to vote for this bill.  Mr.Speaker, this isn't the tax reform the American people were promised or the tax reform the American people want.  Mr.Speaker, let's sit down together. Let's sit down together, the chairman and Mr.Neal, two responsible, good Americans, sit down together not in a partisan way, but in a bipartisan way. That is the way we did the 1986 bill. That is why it was such a responsible piece of legislation.  Let's enact tax reform that focuses on the working class, the middle class, the people who need the money, not give over half of it to the richest people in I don't have any beef with them, we would all like to be rich, but they don't need a tax cut, and the middle class does. Why give 50 percent of the revenue to them?  Let's enact tax reform that focuses on the middle class. Let's enact tax reform that doesn't give half the benefit to those making more than $900,000 a year.[[Page H9408]]  Let's enact tax reform that improves our long-term fiscal position rather than adding the $1.7 trillion to our debt that the CBO projects that this bill would add.

168,topic-id,1150,"Mr.President, let me pause in this class warfare for just a minute to make a couple of observations that I think are certainly important to me.  First of all, I agree that no one has said that the underlying bill is perfect.  Incidentally, I will not respond to the Senator's specific request until I have time to go back and get the proper response, and then I will be glad to do it. But I will say this. We are going to have a conference. There is going to be opportunity for us to go and get some of the things ironed out--some of the things we are both concerned about. There are a couple of things I want to serve notice right now that I am going to be concerned about. One is that the bill that we have punishes trust ownership. It doesn't treat the trust ownership the same way it does ordinary ownership. I think they both should be treated equally. I talked to a number of people who will be participating in this on the other side of the aisle, and I would like to kind of serve notice that we are going to be talking about this, because I think it is very, very significant.  The second thing is that we hear a lot of good ideas. Certainly, there is this idea that somehow there isn't a good idea unless it emanates from this body. I have to tell you this. It is interesting for me to be standing here because I am not on any of the committees that have anything to do with this bill. I am not on the Finance Committee, and I am not on the Budget If you want to talk about defending America and roads and highways, I will talk to you about that. That is my specialty. I am on those committees and have senior leadership in those committees. But as a Member not directly involved in this debate, I have looked at it and I have heard good ideas from the outside. I heard one a week ago that actually came from the Hugh Hewitt show. I heard an idea that I tried to pick apart, and I can't find any faults with it. So I have developed an amendment that we are going to have that will address this idea that I am talking about. That amendment would offer an alternative to those who have retirement programs, where the individual is not to pay for the income until the withdrawal date--say, age 59\1/2\.  The amendment would provide that there would be a one-time opportunity to withdraw up to 25 percent of the retirement account for a single flat fee of 10 percent in lieu of paying income tax at that time.  There are a lot of benefits that I think are pretty obvious. We are talking about retirement programs where the individual is not to pay for the income until the withdrawal dates--let's say, at age 59\1/2\. This would have the immediate revenue of 10 percent of all savings that are withdrawn, and this would actually amount to billions of dollars. We are talking about immediate dollars, not dollars that may be there in the future.  Now, you could argue that this might reduce some revenue at some future date because the individuals will have already pulled this out for a fee of 10 percent. So, perhaps, it would have some negative effects in the distant future. But when you stop to think about the benefits--I know a lot of people on the other side of the aisle don't realize this--we are going to have huge benefits.  If you just look at what has happened in this administration in the second and third quarter of this year, we have gone through years in the Obama administration with maybe a 1.5-percent[[Page S7661]]increase in GDP, and we have enjoyed 3 percent in the second quarter and 3.3 percent in the third quarter. That is a huge increase. For each 1 percent increase over a period of 10 years, we are talking about $3 trillion. So we are all considering this.  This amendment that we are talking about that merely allows people to take money out that is already their money is something that would have a great stimulation in the economy. I am one of the few ones who was around here--not in this body but in the other body--and I was aware of this back during the Reagan years of 1981 and 1986. In 1981, the amount of revenue that we had coming into the Federal coffers was $469 billion. Ten years later that was $750 billion. That was after the first great reduction. Let's remember that reduction took the top rates down from 70 percent to 50 percent. Again, in 1986, when the total revenue was $569 billion, there was a further reduction. The top rate went down from 50 percent to, I believe, 28 percent.  Now, with all of those reductions, that increased 10 years later from $569 billion to $1 trillion. Consequently, we know that if we can stimulate the economy, we are going to have more revenue coming in. That is a fact. I think this will be something that I think a lot of people can look at.  I talk about when you get into the conference. I will not be one of the conferees, and I am aware of that, but there are a lot of good ideas out there along with those on the floor today. They will be pursuing them at that time. That is assuming we pass this bill, and I think we will pass it.  Additionally, tax reform will ensure that American families and businesses see a meaningful reduction in their tax burden. The Senate bill provides a substantial tax deduction to small and family businesses that are structured as passthrough entities. These small and family businesses are household names such as Love's Travel Stop, the Country Stores, Hobby We are all very familiar with Hobby  By the way, I will say that in the event there is anyone here who has not been down to see the Museum of the Bible, that is Hobby Lobby who paid for that. Those are the types of people who would benefit. Unfortunately, the Senate does not allow tax deductions for these companies or passthrough entities if they have trusts. This is not right.  For these companies trusts were for long-term business purposes, not to evade their fair share of taxes. These companies use the income to invest capital in operations to grow their businesses, to hire people, and to contribute to the economic growth that we need in this country. We should not penalize passthrough companies for their businesses because they are trusts. My amendment would fix that.  With that, I yield the floor.

1397,topic-id,2741,"Mr.President, this week, after 3 years of planning and construction, we now will be dedicating tomorrow and officially opening the Museum of the  This is led by Steve Green of Hobby We all remember Hobby Lobby of Steve has been a friend of mine and his parents have been friends of mine for a long period of time. He is the chairman of the board of directors for this long-awaited museum that will allow visitors from not just this country but from all over the world--they will be coming here to see what it is all about and how this plays a pivotal role in our country's history. There is no better place than Washington, DC, in our Nation's Capitol, to remind us of the scope of the Bible's impact on our history and our narrative. It has been long-awaited.  Indeed, one of our Founding Fathers, Patrick Henry, was renowned for his readings of the He said at the end of his life: ``This book is worth all the books that ever were printed, and it has been my misfortune that I never found time to read it with the proper attention and feeling till lately.''  He is the one--and not many people are aware that historians are relooking at the history of this country, and they are saying we could not have won that war. I mean you have to sometimes close your eyes and envision the greatest army on the face of this Earth coming down with thundering marches, going through Boston, and going up to Lexington and There is no way in this world that a handful of trappers and hunters could have won that thing. Yet we know why, and he knew why, when you talk about Patrick They said: We are not strong enough. It can't be done.  There is one thing they overlooked, and that is the strength that comes from God that we had, and they didn't have. He said:       We are not weak if we make a proper use of those means      which the God of nature hath placed in our power. . . . armed      in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that      which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy      can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our      battles alone. There is a just God who [reigns] over the      destinies of nations; and who will raise up friends to fight      our battles for us.  And he did, and they fired that shot heard around the world.  I think that is really important today to think about because people come to this country and they want to know what makes America work.  I have been privileged to sponsor the African dinner every February, and people come in from all over They are always surprised when they come and they find out walking through the Capitol what real significance God and the Bible has to the history of this country. We are the largest Christian community in the world. We cannot and should not deny the role our Judeo-Christian values played in the formation of this country.  Our first President, George Washington, was steadfast in his belief of God, His law, and that liberty is God's gift. Washington's leadership was based on the conviction that Americans are entrusted by God to preserve basic freedoms established in the  In a letter, Washington wrote, ``We should be very cautious of violating the rights of conscience in others, ever considering that God alone is the judge of the hearts of men and to Him only in this case they are answerable.''  It is clear our Founding Fathers recognized and enshrined the importance of religious liberty, one of our most precious and foundational religious freedoms that allowed them to live their lives according to the teaching of the  The Bible's role in the founding of America is just one remarkable example of how the Bible has profoundly shaped world history. It has influenced cultures in every corner of the globe, and the Museum of the Bible, which is going to be opening tomorrow, pays tribute to its impact and intersectionality with the world religions.  Whether considering the Bible through a secular or faith-based lens, it is impossible to deny its impact on individuals, countries, and, indeed, all world history. The Museum of the[[Page S7280]]Bible is the first educational experience I have encountered that truly appreciates the full magnitude of the Bible's role throughout history.  The six exhibits, curated by a panel of faith leaders that span religious and geographic divides, truly bring the Word of God to life in a way that positively educates, informs, and encourages people of all faiths and beliefs to learn more about the Bible  General Washington reminded us in his Farewell Address: ``Let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion.''  Steve Green's father David founded Hobby I remember this so well because I was in the State legislature at the time this happened. They started in their garage making frames for pictures. It turned out to be this giant, worldwide corporation, the largest arts and crafts retailer in the history of America, currently or in the past.  Remember Hobby Lobby, when ObamaCare required that all employers provide free access to the pills that terminate pregnancies, David clearly recognized this as a violation of his faith. That is what America is all about. If you believe in it, you do it, you take a risk. He was risking millions of dollars, but the morality was so significant from the teachings of the Bible that he went ahead and did it. He took the challenge all the way to the U.Supreme Court and won in a split decision. He successfully argued the importance to maintain the fundamental freedom of religion to apply his faith convictions to how he operates his private business.  David won his case, but his family understood we needed to do more. So he started the Museum of the I actually was there last June, when it was under construction at the time, as we walked through and visualized what it was going to look like later on. It is magnificent.  They have a stage, and you live on the stage. He is going to have performances there. I am so anxious to be there tonight, the night before the official opening, to see now what it looks like.  I am so grateful David's son Steve and his entire family are leading this effort to make the Bible and its impact more accessible to the whole world. I am especially honored that the museum will open on my birthday tomorrow. I am not sure they really knew that when they made the decision, but somebody knew it.                          Energy Independence  Mr.President, let me turn to another topic that I think is very important right now; that is, our energy independence. It is a huge issue. People are not aware, while we may have talked about the importance of the budget reconciliation process to set up and to pass the historic and much needed tax cuts for our individuals and small businesses, the process also allowed the Senate to use reconciliation for something equally as valuable--to allow energy exploration in  Yesterday the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee met to consider legislation to open up a very small part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for responsible energy development. This bill was successfully passed by the committee, and I look forward to helping it continue to move through  I have long been an advocate for this to happen. It is interesting, the people in Alaska all want it. The polling is something like 96 percent of the people really want this to happen. They know the benefits that will come to Alaska, the money that will be there. People talk about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as if it is this great big thing. It is the size of South It is a very small thing. Right now, we are going to be able to go up there to create jobs and opportunities and authorize the leases in We will also increase revenue to the United  It is estimated that the energy production in Alaska could lead to over $1 trillion in revenue. Responsible management will have a positive impact on reducing our national debt and most significantly opening ANWR is allowing Alaska to do what they want to do.  We are so good in this body thinking that we know more about what is good for Alaska and what is good for Oklahoma and what is good for Georgia than they do in their own One of few things we do right around this place is how we do our highway bill. In the highway bill, we get the priorities from the States when they come in, and they decide what it is they want to do in their  Remember the issue about the ``bridge to nowhere.'' Everybody was concerned about this. All the talk shows jumped on it without realizing, until it was too late, it had already gotten committed.  Here was something that happened right for a change. I was chairman of the committee at that time. The ``bridge to nowhere'' in Alaska didn't go ``nowhere,'' it went somewhere. The problem was, there weren't any people there once you got there, and the reason is you couldn't get there. On their list of 100 priorities, 4 was to build that bridge, but we, in our infinite wisdom here, said: No, you can't do that. Somehow the public didn't know what they were talking about. Well, that is kind of the same situation we have right now. We have something in Alaska that was their 1 priority to develop, and for years and years we have stopped them from being able to do with their land what they wanted to do with their land. The Federal Government has been keeping Alaskans from acting in their own best interest.  Finally, increasing energy production in Alaska is a key part of making the United States not only energy independent but energy dominant. We are on the verge of doing just that. Earlier this week, the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, said the United States ``will become the undisputed global oil and gas leader for decades to come'' and that ``the growth in production is unprecedented, exceeding all historical levels.'' ANWR could be and should be a part of that story.  Energy independence is vital to our national security. How many of these countries over there that have been part of the old Soviet Union want their allegiance to us, and yet they are forced to buy their oil and gas from Russia and from Iran and they don't want to do it. Now we are taking them off the hook.  I had a great experience not long ago. I was invited by the President of Lithuania to come and open up their first terminal. Now we are changing all that.  We have a guy named Harold Hamm, an Oklahoman who is the chairman and CEO of Continental Resources in He announced they would begin exporting oil to Exporting to China is kind of a big deal. He talks about how we are going to become undeniably a leader in exporting energy that will have an impact on the rest of the world.  President Trump has been clear that he intends to make the United States a net energy exporter, something we haven't been since 1953. Opening up the National Wildlife Refuge, which just took place this last week, will be a big step toward this initiative, and I applaud the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee for helping the administration make this happen.                  National Defense Authorization Bill  Mr.President, the leader of the Senate, a few minutes ago, talked about the NDAA and John McCain's role in that. John McCain, of course, has been and is an American hero. Everybody knows his past and knows what he did and the suffering he went through.  He was very instrumental--sure, we had some disagreements on some of the finer parts of the bill--but this is one that had to be done. All of a sudden we are changing what happened, unfortunately, in the past.  I can remember about 3 years ago we got all the way to December before we voted this out. We have now voted. This is the 55th year in a row that we have passed a Defense authorization bill. If we didn't by the end of December, then our kids wouldn't be getting hazard pay or pilots wouldn't be getting flight pay, and it would be an absolute disaster. Of course, it didn't happen because we are now doing it.  I have to say this. One thing that hasn't been said enough is what Senator McCain and a lot of his supporters were able to do; that is, reprioritize what defending America is about.  Read the Look at the history of this country. I always say people should sometime get out that old document that nobody reads anymore, the Constitution, and see what we are supposed to be doing around here.[[Page S7281]]  Do you know that what we are supposed to be doing in this body primarily is defending America, 1, and they called them post roads, back then, building roads and transportation. That is what we are supposed to be doing, but what has happened in our military is something people don't know about. I applaud our military in uniform now because they are saying it for the first time in my memory that we are in the most threatened position this country has ever been in. We have adversaries out there. Some are somewhat mentally deranged. They are rapidly getting or already have the capability of hitting an American city with a weapon. As tragic as it was when we went through 9/11, what a lot of people don't realize is, if that were to happen, a whole city could be wiped out.  The problem is that we have gotten away from prioritizing the fact that the 1 concern should be and the mission should be for us to defend To give an example, up through the 1960s, we spent over 50 percent of all the revenue that came into the Federal Government on defending Do you know what it is today, Mr.President? It is 15 percent. So we have gone from 50 percent down to 15 percent. What does that tell you? It tells you that the priorities aren't right.  So we have looked at this, and this is a first step. This McCain-led NDAA is the first step in reprioritizing where we are. If anyone questions this, if you look at the Obama administration, when we were trying to recover on sequestration, he had a policy. He said: For every dollar we put in, we are going to have to put an equal amount into social programs. That shows you the lack of priority. All that is being changed.  About 10 minutes ago when I started, I quoted Patrick You stop and think about the courage it took at one time to get to the point that we are going to be progressing to, starting with this bill, when he said: There is a just God who reigns over the destinies of nations and who will raise up friends to fight our battles with us. The battle is not to the strong alone but to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Gentlemen may cry ``peace,'' but there is no peace. Why stand we idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, is peace so sweet, it must be bought at the price of chains and slavery?  That is what it used to be. That was the priority. And this bill reestablishes that priority as the 1 priority, as our history reflects we should be doing, as our Constitution has charged us with doing, and we are doing it with the passage of the national defense authorization bill. We are on the road to recovery, and I am very excited about it.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

1692,topic-id,1355,"Mr.President, for 20 years now, I have viewed the development and deployment of a layered ballistic missile defense shield as vital to our national security. The experience that we witnessed yesterday is something we have been talking about for a long time that was going to happen. Sometimes our DIA, or Defense Intelligence Agency, has said it is going to happen 5 years from now and then 4 years from now. The question is this: When will North Korea have the capability of a weapon and delivery system that would reach Washington, DC, or any of the States of the United States? The adversaries like North Korea are developing ballistic missiles with increasing range and accuracy. It is important for us in the Senate to communicate to the American people the credible, grave, and immediate threat that we face.  Today the world is more dangerous than it has ever been before. I have said so many times in the past that I look wistfully back at the days of the Cold War when things were predictable. We had two superpowers. We knew what they had, and they knew what we had. It is not that way anymore. Every time we have someone coming in to our Defense Committee to testify, they talk about the fact that North Korea is not predictable. So we don't know what is going to happen and what they are capable of doing.  I have been here on the floor on this issue in 2001, 2009, 2012, and this will be the third time this year. Over the last 30 years, we have witnessed our missile defense programs go through dramatic investment changes from administration to administration, depending on who is Remember how everyone ridiculed President Reagan about ``Star Wars,'' hitting a bullet with a bullet. They felt that it was pretty funny at that time. Right now, everything he said that was going to happen is happening and happened yesterday.  In 1993, they cut out of the Reagan budget and from the Bush budget the missile defense budget request for fiscal year 1994. They terminated the Reagan-Bush Strategic Defense Initiative Program and downgraded the national missile defense--this is all during the Clinton administration--to a research and development program only and cut 5 years of missile defense funding by 54 percent, from $39 billion to $18 billion.  In 1996 they cut funding and slowed the development of the THAAD program--the THAAD program we are so dependent on right now to defend against an incoming missile in many parts of the world with our allies. They cut the Defense authorization bill, which required accelerated development.  In 1999 they delayed by at least 2 years our Space-Based Infrared System satellites, designed to detect and track missile launches, necessary to coordinate with any effective national missile defense system.  Then along came By the end of 2008, the Bush administration had succeeded in fielding a missile defense system that was capable of defending all 50 During that period of time, we had 44 ground-based defense systems in the United The Obama administration cut that back down, but the Bush administration wanted a system that would take care of all 50  Here is the problem, though. All of our ground-based systems were on the west coast--in Alaska and California--so we didn't have anything else. At that time, they thought that was where the threat was going to be, but during the last years of the second Bush administration, we realized that we needed to do something about the rest of the country--something about the east coast--and something about Western  We made a deal with the Czech Republic and Poland to have a ground-based system in the Czech Republic and Poland, along with the radar that was necessary to operate it. I remember that. I was there and had a conversation with Vaclav Klaus in the Czech  He said to me: If we go along with building this system, we are going to incur the wrath of Russia, and it is going to be very difficult for us. So can you assure us, if we agree to do this, that you will not pull the rug out from under us?  I said: Certainly, we will not do that. This is something that we are committed to doing.  The problem is that the first thing that happened when the Obama administration came in was he pulled the rug out from under them. So we found ourselves vulnerable to, maybe, having one shot at a defense system in the eastern part of the United States and in Western  Then, in April, there came the first of the Obama defense cuts, which began disarming America and dismantling our layered missile defense system. Additionally, due to President Obama's overall reduced budget request for defense, there were not enough Aegis ships or missiles to meet the demand that was there.  Since Kim Jong Un took power in 2009, he has already conducted more than 80 ballistic missile tests. That is far more than his father and grandfather conducted. North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests of increasingly powerful weapons. The latest test was in September of this year. That bomb had an explosive yield estimated to be 100 kilotons, which is almost 7 times more powerful than the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima and as much as 11 times more powerful than what North Korea tested in January of last year.  In April of this year, at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Policy and Strategy in the Asia-Pacific, a panel of expert witnesses agreed with me that North Korea currently represents the most imminent threat to our national security. On July 4 of[[Page S7392]]this year, North Korea made a major breakthrough with its first successful ICBM launching. If it had been launched on a standard trajectory, the missile could likely have traveled up to 5,000 miles. That would have been enough to have reached On July 28 of this year, North Korea tested another This missile demonstrated the potential ability to reach mainland U.targets with a nuclear-armed  Yesterday was the big day. Yesterday, it finally happened. Yesterday, North Korea proved that it could reliably range the entire continental United States with a test of its latest developed and newest version of the It is important to remember that all of this power is being wielded by the erratic despot Kim Jong We don't have the luxury of time. He has stated that his goal--listen to this--is to attain a nuclear-capable ICBM that can annihilate the United Each and every day, he gets closer to this goal, and, yesterday, he proved that it could be done.  Secretary Mattis confirmed the technical advances that were displayed in yesterday's test. The missile had 53 minutes of time in flight, and Mattis confirmed that it had gone higher than any previous shot they had ever taken.  David Wright, an analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, wrote that yesterday's test indicates that North Korea can now hold the United States well within missile range. Wright wrote: ``Such a missile would have been more than enough range to reach Washington, DC, and in fact any part of the continental United States.''  When one talks about the real threats that are out there, we now know that even though people didn't believe it 20 years ago, 10 years ago, 5 years ago, it finally happened yesterday. They have the range that could reach the continental United States, and they have proved that they have a missile that can do that. The only argument they use is that this may not have had a payload, that maybe they couldn't have done that with a payload. Actually, it had that kind of a range. That doesn't give me much comfort. I really think that we are to the point at which we have to recognize that we are in the most threatened position we have been in as a nation, and now it is a lot easier to believe that because we witnessed it yesterday.

They know this bill takes from the struggling middle class and bountifully rewards the billionaire class and transnational corporations that ship our jobs overseas. In fact, the only permanent tax giveaways in their bill are[[Page H9614]]for rich corporations and those lovely Wall Street banks that care so much for the American people.  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates a $1 trillion addition to our national debt as a result of this bill. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 80 percent of Americans, those making less than $100,000 a year, will see a tax increase under their plan. But you know what? They will wait until after next year's election to lock it in.  There is very little in this bill good for average Our Republican colleagues are actually pushing America into deeper financial servitude to foreign investors from places like China and Saudi Arabia who are going to buy the Treasury debt securities, and our taxpayers will end up having to pay them principal plus billions and billions and billions in interest.

1821,topic-id,718,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to honor a great American, a man named Gus Schumacher, a man whose enduring legacy and indefatigable work ethic in the field of agriculture improved the lives of untold millions of people in our country and those America touches around the world--yes, farmers from all walks of life, including the smallest producers, not just the biggest, including people who are hungry.  I remember one time Gus spoke with me about going through nursing homes in western Iowa and how America had to do a better job of reaching places that were forgotten, places that you would not expect to find hungry people.  Gus' work touched people across a broad variety of pursuits. He wasn't limited by the false urban-rural divide that our country lives with, and he touched citizens across the income spectrum.  It was with deep sadness that we learned of the news that Gus, a former Under Secretary of the U.Department of Agriculture for both Democratic and Republican Presidents, Bill[[Page H9472]]Clinton and George Bush, and a founding board chair of an organization called Wholesome Wave, passed away unexpectedly last month.  A few days before his death, he had come to our office offering his help to the Congress on the new farm bill. He cared so much about people. He cared so much about nutrition. He understood the foundational power of agriculture in our Nation, so blessed with the resources to feed ourselves and the world if we put our shoulder to the wheel.  Simply, Gus loved and lived agriculture. He had experience from the time he was a child that directed him toward farming and all of its array. The farmers market was in his  He was born in Massachusetts on a farm in Lexington and bridged the divide between city and rural dwellers. This approach was the American way, the American family way. His grandfather and great-grandfather farmed, get this, in New York City, where they grew vegetables in enclosed greenhouses and sold what they grew at city markets. He knew agriculture from the inside, even inside a place like New York City, where now, with modern technology, we are growing lettuce on walls as high as the ceiling of this Chamber in which I speak.  When Gus was young, he was loading up his brother's truck, and a box of pears fell off the truck and scattered all over the ground. Two young boys and their mother ran up, and they began picking up the pears. The mother explained that she was on food stamps and unable to afford fresh produce for her kids. Gus' heart broke, and his life's work began and he never stopped.  Gus worked tirelessly to support local farming and local agriculture, and I cannot underline local, local, local enough. He became an American force in the farm-to-table movement, encouraging restaurants and stores to buy produce locally. He saw communities shattered across our country when that local production food chain was broken, and he used his last ounce of strength to reconnect it.  Most recently, in preparation for the upcoming farm bill, he selflessly helped create provisions in H.3699, the new Urban Agriculture Production Act, a bill that really focuses on producing, in some of the most forgotten places, with innovative farming practices, including in urban food deserts. He never stopped trying.  I loved him because he loved farmers markets, and I love farmers markets. Nothing creates community more than growing and feeding the local population. As we move to such large institutions that seem almost unapproachable by the average American, Gus was always bringing power back to people.  He expanded programs to include veterans, including the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program, as we attempt to pass a new farm bill, making sure that our veterans are included in that extraordinarily popular coupon program.  Gus was humble, kind, visionary, passionate, compassionate, generous, and dedicated, and a man for all seasons.  In closing, let me say Gus Schumacher will always be remembered as a gentle giant who packed a powerful punch. His impact will not be forgotten, and his legacy will live on and carry his dreams forward. Mr.Speaker, I will tell you, I am going to devote every ounce of energy I have in the new farm bill to making his dreams come true.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-29-pt1-PgH9471-5.txt,616,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,29,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

668,topic-id,304,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.3731, the Secret Service Recruitment and Retention Act of 2017, because I believe in the need to pay the hardworking men and women of the United States Secret Service for the critical work that they perform in dedication to the security of America's leaders.  While most Americans know the Secret Service for its role in protecting the President and First Family, many are unaware of the additional substantial roles and countless hours worked by special agents, uniformed division officers, technical personnel, and intelligence professionals. These jobs require extensive travel, often on short notice, as well as sometimes working multiple weeks in a row without a day off, because the security of our Nation's leaders depend on our constant vigilance.  This legislation demonstrates an important recognition of the men and women who wake up every day to dedicate their lives to the protection of America's leadership and financial systems. This agency has struggled to improve employee morale in recent years, due, in large part, to strict overtime pay caps that prevent adequate compensation for their work. It is very common, nowadays, in the Secret Service for agents, starting as early as June, to be working multiple hours a week of overtime, and sometimes as many as over 100 hours a month for free because they have reached the cap.  This, in turn, leads to challenges in retention and recruitment, further exacerbating staffing shortages. In 2017, the agency estimates that 1,200 employees at Secret Service will exceed the statutory pay cap, losing approximately $10 million in overtime pay, unless we, in Congress, step up.  I wish to thank each of the bipartisan cosponsors for their support of this bill, which took the cooperation of multiple committees to bring to the floor.

347,topic-id,203,"Mr.President, today I rise to discuss the historic rehabilitation tax credit. The historic rehabilitation tax credit is a vital component of pro-growth tax reform and a shot in the arm for communities across the country. For instance, in my State of Louisiana, the credit has encouraged 782 restoration projects since 2002. This amounts to more than $2.2 billion in investment into cities and towns across the Many of these private investment dollars are flowing into small and rural communities with populations less than 25,000 people.  I am pleased that the Finance Committee restored the historic rehabilitation tax credit to the 20-percent level and ensured a smooth transition for approved and underway projects by grandfathering them in under the prior law and regulations.  For purposes of the historic rehabilitation tax credit's transition rule, ``taxpayer'' refers to the person who undertakes the rehabilitation of a building. In the case where a person makes an election under section 48(d), the term ``taxpayer'' means the lessor, since the lessor is the person who undertook the rehabilitation. It is intended that the historic rehabilitation tax credits be available during the transition period only to the extent such credits would have been available under the prior law and regulations.

1476,topic-id,1481,"Mr.Speaker, of all the policy changes that are being recommended in this legislation before us today, the one that scares me the most is the repeal of the so-called Johnson amendment.  The Johnson amendment basically says: If you are a religious organization or a nonprofit and if you engage in partisan political activity, you lose your tax-exempt status.  Repealing that has the potential of politicizing the pulpit nationwide. In fact, 103 religious organizations, 4,200 faith-based leaders in this country, and 5,500 nonprofits have written a letter to every Member of Congress telling us: Don't do this.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record these letters.     Updated November 1, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker,     Washington,     Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     House Democratic Leader,     Washington,     Chuck Schumer,     Senate Democratic Leader,     Washington,     Kevin Brady,     Chairman, House Ways and Means Committee,     Washington,     Orrin Hatch,     Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance,     Washington,     Richard Neal,     Ranking Member, House Ways and Means Committee, Washington,              Ron Wyden,     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Finance, Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader McConnell, Leader      Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Chairman Brady, Chairman Hatch,      Ranking Member Neal, and Ranking Member Wyden: We, the 103      undersigned religious and denominational organizations      strongly oppose any effort to weaken or eliminate protections      that prohibit 501(c)(3) organizations, including houses of      worship, from endorsing or opposing political candidates.      Current law serves as a valuable safeguard for the integrity      of our charitable sector and campaign finance system.       Religious leaders often use their pulpits to address the      moral and political issues of the day. They also can, in      their personal capacities and without the resources of their      houses of worship, endorse and oppose political candidates.      Houses of worship can engage in public debate on any issue,      host candidate forums, engage in voter registration drives,      encourage people to vote, help transport people to the polls      and even, with a few boundaries, lobby on specific      legislation and invite candidates to speak. Tax-exempt houses      of worship may not, however, endorse or oppose candidates or      use their tax-exempt donations to contribute to candidates'      campaigns. Current law simply limits groups from being both a      tax-exempt ministry and a partisan political entity.       As religious organizations, we oppose any attempt to weaken      the current protections offered by the 501(c)(3) campaign      intervention prohibition because:       People of faith do not want partisan political fights      infiltrating their houses of worship. Houses of worship are      spaces for members of religious communities to come together,      not be divided along political lines; faith ought to be a      source of connection and community, not division and discord.      Indeed, the vast majority of Americans do not want houses of      worship to issue political endorsements. Particularly in      today's political climate, such endorsements would be highly      divisive and would have a detrimental impact on civil      discourse.       Current law protects the integrity of houses of worship. If      houses of worship endorse candidates, their prophetic voice,      their ability to speak truth to power as political outsiders,      is threatened. The credibility and integrity of congregations      would suffer with bad decisions of candidates they endorsed.      Tying America's houses of worship to partisan activity      demeans the institutions from which so many believers expect      unimpeachable decency.       Current law protects the independence of houses of worship.      Houses of worship often speak out on issues of justice and      morality and do good works within the community but may also      labor to adequately fund their ministries. Permitting      electioneering in churches would give partisan groups      incentive to use congregations as a conduit for political      activity and expenditures. Changing the law would also make      them vulnerable to individuals and corporations who could      offer large donations or a politician promising social      service contracts in exchange for taking a position on a      candidate. Even proposals that would permit an      ``insubstantial'' standard or allow limited electioneering      only if it is in furtherance of an organization's mission      would actually invite increased government intrusion,      scrutiny, and oversight.       The charitable sector, particularly houses of worship,      should not become another cog in a political machine or      another loophole in campaign finance laws. We strongly urge      you to oppose any efforts to repeal or weaken protections in      the law for 501(c)(3) organizations, including houses of      worship.

Representative Ron Kind,     Washington,       Dear Representative Kind: As a leader in my religious      community, I am strongly opposed to any effort to repeal or      weaken current law that protects houses of worship from      becoming centers of partisan politics. Changing the law would      threaten the integrity and independence of houses of worship.      We must not allow our sacred spaces to be transformed into      spaces used to endorse or oppose political candidates.       Faith leaders are called to speak truth to power, and we      cannot do so if we are merely cogs in partisan political      machines. The prophetic role of faith communities      necessitates that we retain our independent voice. Current      law respects this independence and strikes the right balance:      houses of worship that enjoy favored tax-exempt status may      engage in advocacy to address moral and political issues, but      they cannot tell people who to vote for or against. Nothing      in current law, however, prohibits me from endorsing or      opposing political candidates in my own personal capacity.       Changing the law to repeal or weaken the ``Johnson      Amendment''--the the section of the tax code that prevents      tax-exempt nonprofit organizations from endorsing or opposing      candidates--would harm houses of worship, which are not      identified or divided by partisan lines. Particularly in      today's political climate, engaging in partisan politics and      issuing endorsements would be highly divisive and have a      detrimental impact on congregational unity and civil      discourse.  I therefore urge you to oppose any repeal or weakening of the Johnson Amendment, thereby protecting the independence and integrity of houses of worship and other religious organizations in the charitable sector.

1477,topic-id,257,"Mr.Speaker, when I go to my church, South Beaver Creek Lutheran Church, Sunday mornings with my family in rural western Wisconsin by our family farm, I view that place as a sanctuary for my soul; a place for us to congregate, to commune, to spend time in fellowship with our fellow neighbors, and to check up on one another.  Yes, preach values and preach moral lessons to our children, absolutely. But by repealing the Johnson amendment, you have the potential of creating conflict in the pews. You could be creating Republican and Democratic churches, mosques, and synagogues overnight.  This is one of the last refuges, one of the last institutions that we still have as a country given how much we are self-segregating and deciding whom we like to hang out with, what clubs we join, what people we want to associate with, even our own family members, because of political affiliation. Our places of worship are one of the last places we can come regardless of political affiliation.  This will create unnecessary strife and unnecessary conflict, and it has the potential of driving young people away from organized religion because they won't put up with this. It could be a backdoor attempt for a lot of political contributors now to get tax-exempt contributions to these organizations for direct, partisan political campaigns. That is why the Joint Committee on Taxation viewed this as a cost of over $2 billion.

1164,topic-id,2512,"Mr.President, I called my motion up that is now on the floor of the U.It is a very simple one. It may be one of the most straightforward, short motions to be offered in the course of this debate. The motion is very simple. It refers this bill back to the committee with instructions to bring back a bill which is deficit-neutral. I believe that can be done, and I think it can be done in a very short period of time. I think it is important, and I am going to outline why.  Before I get to that, I will mention that Senators Tester, Whitehouse, Harris, Van Hollen, Kaine, Warner, Bennet, Udall, Heitkamp, Manchin, Coons, Feinstein, and Donnelly are all announced supporters of this motion. I offer my thanks and appreciation to them for their assistance.  Again, the motion is very simple. Recommit the bill. Have the committee work it once more, and come back to the Senate floor with a bill that does not bust the deficit.  This is one of the most important votes any of us will take in this body. I think it may be the most important. This is a bill that will affect America and Americans for a generation. If past history is any guide, this will be the major tax reform bill for the next 20 to 30 years. It will affect every business, every citizen, and our entire economy. The stakes, in other words, are incredibly high, and it is my assumption that when the stakes are high, the bar for the process will also be high. If you are doing something with such enormous ramifications, it is common sense that you take a great deal of care to thoroughly understand the provisions of the bill, its implications, its impacts, its possible unintended consequences and be as careful as possible in order to determine how this bill will affect our country and our economy.  Instead, we have the worst possible process. In other words, we have the highest stakes and the lowest process. It is the worst process, I think, I have ever seen in a public body. The Bangor City Council would not amend the leash law using this process. We are talking about one of the most important bills that any of us will ever vote on that has had zero hearings before the U.It has had no input from the citizenry, no input from outside the community of this body--in fact, outside the committee that has brought the bill to the floor. There has been no outside expert analysis. There are bound to be mistakes in this bill.[[Page S7528]]  In fact, I have a new rule I am proposing today. I am calling it, modestly, King's law. King's law is: The faster a bill goes through this body, the worse it will be. That is what we are talking about today. We are talking about bringing something through the U.Senate--supposedly the world's most deliberative body--with little or no deliberation, and the impacts are going to be enormous. I just believe we can slow down and do this right.  The last time there was major tax reform in this country was 1986. It is very instructive to look back and watch and look and see how they did it.  1, it was bipartisan from the beginning, and the Senate Finance Committee had 33 hearings on the bill--33 as compared to 0. Have we really fallen that far in this institution that we cannot even have a series of hearings to understand what it is we are doing? It took 10 months to consider that bill, come to a conclusion, and have a vote on the Senate floor--10 months. We are talking about a matter of days for the consideration of this bill. The final point about the 1986 bill is that it had passed the Senate with 90 votes.  That could happen here. Two days ago, I was on a stage with 16 colleagues--Members of the Democratic caucus--all of whom were prepared, ready, anxious, and able to support tax reform, including cutting the corporate tax rate to make our businesses more competitive, but there has been no process to let them in, to allow them to talk.  The point I am trying to make here is, the vote we take tonight or tomorrow morning--or whenever it is--does not have to be the end of this process. It can be the beginning of a real process, which is what it should be.  Now, one of my concerns--there are a lot of problems with this bill, but the concern I want to focus on today and is the background of my amendment which recommits and asks that the committee come back with a deficit-neutral bill--is the debt and deficit itself.  This is a chart that should strike fear into the heart of every This is basically the history of our national debt as a percentage of the gross domestic product. This isn't dollars because that can be misleading. Dollars, of course, are worth less now than they were in 1930 or in 1850.  This is a percentage of the gross domestic product. It started back in 1790, when the early Americans were paying off the debt from the Revolutionary If you will notice, there is a pattern here that stops right here. The pattern is, when we get into major catastrophes, including wars, that is when we have to borrow money, and that is what we did. Here is the Civil War, but it was paid down in 1910. Then there was World War I--another huge expenditure. This is why you preserve your borrowing power for when you actually need it. Then there was World War Now, this line that goes down right here is of the ``greatest generation.'' The ``greatest generation'' not only fought World War II, but they paid for it. They paid down the debt, and it goes down into the 1970s. Then we have a bump up and then down.  Look at where we are headed. We are headed to a place where we are not going to be able to sustain this debt. Everybody knows that. Yet the bill we are voting on today expands the deficit by somewhere between a half trillion dollars and two and a half trillion dollars, depending upon how it is all sorted out. Of course, there is a little bit of fake bookkeeping, where the personal changes to the Tax Code expire in order to not bump up the cost within the budget window, but everybody knows, and the people in the majority who are supporting this bill are winking and nodding and saying: Of course, those will be extended. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say they are going to be extended and take credit for that and then turn around and say but don't worry about the deficit.  This is the ``greatest generation.'' This is the ``me too'' generation that is not paying for things, and it is shameful. It is going to come back to haunt us. Here is why.  We are now in a kind of ``Alice in Wonderland'' of interest rates--the lowest interest rates that we have had in my lifetime. Around 2 percent is what we are paying on our Federal debt. The problem is, the average for interest rates on our Federal debt over the last 50 years has been about 5.5 percent. It is a really easy calculation when the debt is $20 trillion, for 1 percent on the debt is $200 billion a year. If you go to 5.5 percent, just interest on the debt is $1.1 trillion. Now, if that number rings a bell for anyone in this room, that is because that is the size of the entire current Federal discretionary budget, defense and nondefense--$1.1 trillion just in interest. Interest rates are already starting to creep up. This is not an abstract fear; this is a high likelihood.  I have been around public life and politics for a long time, and I have heard a lot about deficits. People have been concerned about deficits until today. The deficit doesn't seem to be a big deal anymore. I predict that after this bill passes, within a couple of years when the deficits start to mount up, the same people who are voting for this bill today are going to say: Oh, my goodness. We have these huge deficits. What are we going to do? I think we have to cut entitlements; we have to cut Social Security; we have to cut Medicare; and, certainly, we have to cut all of those domestic programs. I do not think that is right.  We had a hearing this morning in the Armed Services Committee with a group of people who were talking about our national defense strategy. Virtually everyone at that table--I think there were five or six--agreed that the cost of rebuilding our defense capability over the next 10 years will be about $1 trillion. That is over and above the current defense budget. We are talking about an additional $1 trillion. That happens to be the amount that this tax bill will suck out of the revenues of this country and be unavailable for any purpose, including defense.  Those who are concerned in this body about national security should be very concerned about this bill. I believe it will make it impossible to do the kind of restoration of the national security apparatus in this country that is necessary because we are not going to have the money.  What we are doing is simply borrowing money from our children to give ourselves tax cuts. That is really the essence of what is going on here. If we were cutting taxes on a revenue-neutral basis, that would make sense. I think you could make an argument for broadening the base and lowering the rates. All of those kinds of things could be done, and you could get the stimulative effect. Instead, all we are doing is shifting the tax to our kids. If you are already in a deficit situation and you cut taxes further, it makes a hole. You fill the hole with borrowed money, and that borrowed money is going to have to be paid back by these young people who are sitting in this room today.  If 5-year-olds knew what we were doing and could vote, none of us would have jobs because we are spending their money. It is as if you are lying on your deathbed, you call your children over to hear your last words, and your last words are: Here is the credit card. We had a great vacation, your mother and You pay the bill. That is what we are doing. It is wrong. It is unethical. We are passing the bill on to our children.  I know that the purpose is to stimulate economic growth, and I am all for it. I believe, and said earlier on, that I can see where a reduction of corporate tax rates and offshore rates is called for to make us competitive in the world economy, but the idea that these tax cuts are going to pay for themselves--it has never happened. It has never happened. It hasn't happened. It didn't happen with the Bush tax cuts. It hasn't happened in It just hasn't happened.  We are talking about a dramatic increase in the Federal deficit on top of what is already coming. That is what is really bothersome about this. We can't talk about this bill in isolation without acknowledging we are already spending half a trillion dollars per year more than we are taking in--in relatively good times. These are the times when we should be paying back this debt, not making it worse.  No rational business would be taking on debt when they are doing well. When you are doing well, you pay down your debt, and then you have a reserve for when you need it. We have no reserve. We are using up our cushion. We are using up whatever cushion we might need for disasters, for some kind of, heaven forbid, conflict, or simply for a recession.[[Page S7529]]  This is an incredibly destructive bill, and it doesn't have to be that way. It doesn't have to be that way.  This is a place where I believe we can work together. This isn't a yes-or-no issue. I understand the healthcare debate was a yes-or-no issue: Do you want to repeal the Affordable Care Act or not? Yes or no? This, however, is about numbers. Should the corporate rate be 25, 22, 28, or 20? Or how do we deal with the AMT or the estate tax or the personal exemption? All of those dials can be changed in order to achieve a targeted growth, which is what we all want. I realize growth is the best way to solve this problem without, at the same time, exacerbating this really serious deficit problem that we are headed into.  There are provisions of this bill that have nothing to do with economic growth. The estate tax--what does that have to do with it? Eliminating the AMT--what does that have to do with economic growth? There are provisions in this bill that don't meet the theory of the bill, yet significantly aggravate its fiscal effect.  My motion is straightforward: Recommit the bill and come back with a deficit-neutral bill, which I think can be done. It wouldn't take a month. We can have some hearings that will give us some information about what the impacts of this bill will be, and we will have a much better bill. It will be a bipartisan bill, and we can meet the responsibilities we have to the American people. I believe we owe the people no less.  As I said at the beginning, there will be no more important bill we can vote on in this body in our careers, and we owe it to the American people to, 1, understand fully what we are voting on and, 2, to do it in the most careful possible way to be the most targeted and most effective and most responsible change that we can make in order to help our economy and also to help all the people of this country.  There are many other issues with the bill, but I chose today to focus my remarks and also my motion on the effects on the deficit because I think it is one of the most long-term threats. In fact, the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that the national debt is the most serious threat to our national security in the long run, and to aggravate it unnecessarily, as this bill would do, I think is irresponsible.  We can do better, I am sure, if we will slow down, listen to one another, and do what the American people expect of us.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Cassidy).

1417,topic-id,1111,"Mr.President, I did a mathematic calculation a couple of years ago, and it resulted in an interesting conclusion. The Senate is a rural body. Eighteen Members of the U.Senate represent a majority of That means 82 percent--or 82 out of 100 Senators--represent smaller States, more rural communities.  Today, I want to talk about a disastrous development that is headed for our rural communities that we have the capability to fix, and it is one we should fix sooner rather than later. I am talking about Federal funding for federally qualified health centers, which expired on October 1. Seventy percent of the funding for the FQHCs expired on October 1. One hundred percent of the National Health Service Corps funding expired on October 1.  These are vital programs that serve rural America and provide incredibly important healthcare services. They are an overlooked part of our national healthcare system, in part because they are traditionally in rural and outback locations.  In Maine, we have 20 centers and 70 facilities scattered all over our State, and they are providing services every day to over 200,000 people. This is a vital part of our healthcare system. Yet the funding expired at the end of September, and so far nothing has been done.  How important is it? In Maine, there are 1,700 employees at these facilities; a total economic impact of over $300 million a year; $8 million in State and local tax revenue and $32 million in Federal tax revenue. They provide $16 million worth of uncompensated care that goes to Maine people who need the help. They are efficient. In Maine, they have saved Medicaid over $100 million, and $257 million is the estimate for what they have saved the overall healthcare system. Again, FQHCs provide 1,700 jobs and support another 1,000 jobs in their communities.  But this isn't only about economics and economic development and jobs; it is about healthcare. One in six people in Maine gets their healthcare from FQHCs--210,000 people. They accept everybody who comes to their door. I have been to them all over the They use a sliding-fee scale for people who are low income, who don't have insurance, and they provide all manner of services. It depends on the center; different centers have different services. They have medical, behavioral health, dental, substance abuse treatment and support, case management, optometry, podiatry, OB/GYN, prescription assistance, outreach and enrollment, pharmacy, radiology, and school-based healthcare services. These are the healthcare providers for rural And it is not only Maine; it is across the country. There are 10,000 sites across the United Some 26 million patients are at risk.  Well, what is the big deal? The big deal is that people are going to lose their healthcare services. We estimate that in Maine, we are going to lose about 400 clinicians and administrative and support staff who will have to be laid off at the beginning of the year unless we solve this problem in the immediate future. At least 25 of these sites will be forced to close, and we believe there will be almost 30,000 Maine residents who will lose access to their healthcare system.  Most of the FQHCs--federally qualified health centers--are getting by on their funding from last year, so the expiration of the funding hasn't hit them yet, but it will begin to hit them on January 1. That is what we have to respond to.  It is also already having an effect just by creating uncertainty. I got an[[Page S7291]]impassioned letter from the leader of one of our centers in Maine about the fact that they have been very diligently recruiting a dentist to come to their community. Dentists are very hard to come by in rural They had one who was ready to come, and then suddenly they heard about the uncertainty surrounding the funding--that it may or may not come through--and that dentist is now reconsidering their decision to go to this Maine community. That is a tragedy. That is a tragedy for the people of that town, where these services are literally not available.  So what does it matter? It matters because we are talking about people losing their healthcare services.  This has never been a partisan issue. I don't think there is a heck of a lot of debate around here about the importance of FQHCs and that we need to get them refunded. In fact, the Presiding Officer and Senator Stabenow have sponsored a bill, the CHIME Act, that would resolve this issue. We just need to get it on the floor and get it done.  We have proved today by the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act that we can take major issues, bring them to the floor, and move them forward, especially those that aren't particularly controversial. But my concern is that even though there doesn't seem to be controversy, it is just not happening, and now our centers are having to make plans for layoffs, for closures, and for closing their doors to the people who need the care.  This is something we can do. This is something we can resolve. It is within our power. The legislation is ready to go, and we should get this done.  We are leaving today for the Thanksgiving holiday, but if we leave at the end of the year and haven't done this, it will be a tragedy for rural It will be a betrayal of rural It will be a betrayal of our constituents.  All of us have been to these centers and seen the care that they provide, the caring that they provide, the passion that the people bring to the services in their communities, and how much they mean to their communities. This is one of the best Federal programs ever created, and it has always been supported on a bipartisan basis.  I urge my colleagues today to prepare ourselves to get this done as soon as we possibly can when we get back after We have so much to be thankful for, and I want my people in Maine to realize that they can be thankful for those health centers that are literally lifelines in their communities and mean so much to them. I believe this is something we can and should and will do.  Thank you, Mr.President, and thank you for being a leader on this issue.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.

139,topic-id,879,"Madam President, I thank Senator Nelson for his leadership on this motion. It is a very simple motion for a very simple proposition; that is, that the Tax Code should be simpler. That is true. We should make it more streamlined. That is true, but our focus should be helping the people of  Our problem with the bill that is on the floor right now is that it is weighted much too heavily in terms of helping the wealthiest among us and not the middle class. Senator Nelson's amendment, which I am a proud cosponsor of, gets right to the meat of this, to the bread and butter, to helping the middle class with their groceries--since I used meat and bread and butter--but also with their mortgages, with paying for college, with everything they need to do. Our problem with the bill right now is that too much of it goes to the top.  In fact, when you look at the numbers, it is quite startling. The first[[Page S7656]]thing you notice for the middle class is that $1.4 trillion in additional debt comes out of this bill. Now, our colleagues were claiming until yesterday, well, that is going to be offset with all this economic growth we are going to see. What did we find out? Even when you consider that--and this is by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation that looked at this. They are like the umpire. They do the scorecard. They looked at this, and they said: Yes, it is about 1.4, $1.5 trillion in debt. It does produce some economic growth, but guess what. The net is over a trillion dollars in debt.  Now, whose shoulder is that going to be on? That debt is going to be on the middle class and their kids and their grandkids, and that is the 1 reason why I am so concerned about this bill and why I stood with 17 other Democrats, including Senator Nelson, just this last week and said: Come to the table. This is your moment for our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle. While the White House is busy sending out tweets and going after this person and that person and this group and that group, someone has to govern, and this is their moment to govern, to work with us on a bill that doesn't add this debt that gives the middle class more than just a lump of debt in their stocking.  What Senator Nelson's amendment smartly does is, it says: Let's go back and actually have hearings. Let's go back and in a deficit-neutral manner help the middle class. That is what we have to do.  Even though we appeared to be very close to voting on this bill, we still don't know what exactly is in the final version of this bill. We know what isn't in it. Where is this Buffett rule that would make it more fair for everyone? What are we doing about the oil giveaways? What are we doing about the carried interest loophole? None of this is in the bill. Instead, there is $1.4 trillion in debt. So that is why I strongly support Senator Nelson's amendment.  I would also add other amendments that should be considered that I have submitted: savings for servicemembers to help lower the out-of-pocket costs for National Guard members, an amendment that would help address the cost millions of people face when they are providing elder care for loved ones, an amendment that would make it easier to use 529 education savings accounts to help workers develop the skills they need for 21st century jobs, and also other ones related to agriculture.  Senator Nelson's amendment and all these amendments are geared and focused on the middle class. We are living in a time when the wealthier have been getting wealthier and the middle class have been losing ground. They may have jobs now because our economy has rebounded, but the cost of things has gotten so expensive, whether it is their cable bill, whether it is the cost of sending their kids to college, and, with this tax bill this is our opportunity to address that.  A tax bill should be the value statement for our government, the value statement for So I ask my colleagues to come back to the table, to come back to the table to talk about a bill that would bring down that corporate rate. I am all in favor of that.  I have 18 Fortune 500 companies. I know how important they are to jobs in my State, but they don't have to go down to the extreme rate that they are. Instead, that money should be used to help the middle class, while bringing down the corporate rate, while bringing in that money from overseas and plugging some of it into this Nation's infrastructure to literally help us with the roads and bridges and rail we have now, but that isn't in this bill.  So we tell our colleagues this is a moment in time where you could actually work with us on something that makes sense for Don't squander it.  I appreciate the time from Senator Nelson and his leadership.  I yield the floor.

I actually would like to see the business rates go down. I would like to see the money come in from overseas and some incentives put in place. But this bill is extreme. This bill puts a $1.4 trillion hole in the debt. That is what it does--additional debt.  In fact, just yesterday, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation said that even when you account for any economic growth--and this is the umpire here--that would add $1 trillion to the Federal budget deficit over the next decade.  So what I would like to see--and what I thought we were talking about at the beginning of the year--is a bipartisan effort. Seventeen of us who are willing to cross the aisle and who have had a track record of working on bipartisan bills stood up just this week and said: Work with us. Instead, what we have is a partisan bill that blows up the debt. We have a partisan bill that would be devastating to our economy. No one has even had a hearing. No one has even looked at what the consequences would be in this bill. Literally, on the hour, we are getting calls in my office from small businesses, from regular people, from Main Street businesses that have no idea what is going to happen to them under this bill. All they know right now for sure is that it adds over $1 trillion to the debt.  Where is the transportation funding we thought we could do with this bill? We brought the money back from overseas and tied that into infrastructure funding. That didn't happen. What is missing from the bill? Where is getting rid of the oil giveaways? Where is implementing the Buffett rule? Where is getting rid of something the President said he wanted to change; that is, the carried interest rule. None of that is in there. Instead, what we have, what our constituents are going to get here at Christmas, is a stocking full of a big lump of debt.

1202,topic-id,297,"Mr.President, another troubling aspect of this bill is the inclusion of a provision to repeal a key part of the Affordable Care Act that would kick 13 million--13 million--people off of their insurance by 2027 and increase the individual market premiums by 10 percent. We should be helping with the premiums, not increasing the premiums. This means less money in the pockets of American middle-class families--less money to save for retirement, less money for college. That is what we are talking about here.  The American people, in fact, want us to work together to make fixes to the Affordable Care That is what we did just about a month and a half ago. The Alexander-Murray bill--12 Republicans, 12 Democratic cosponsors, and I am one of them--that bill is sitting out there. Yet, without even considering that, what does this bill do? It gets rid of the individual mandate.  Senators Alexander and Murray held a series of hearings and discussions on commonsense solutions. They actually had a hearing on their committee. They had Governors come in, Democrats and Republicans together, and that is how they put that product together. It is a model for how we can put a bill together.[[Page S7541]]  Instead of that kind of bipartisan approach, this tax bill not only repeals an important part of the Affordable Care Act, but it would lead to hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, hurting our seniors.

1204,topic-id,341,"Mr.President, this bill, as Senator Merkley has pointed out, is really a bait and switch. How? Under this bill, millions of middle-class Americans would end up paying more in taxes in the long run. It is a bait and switch: Get a little reduction, a few crumbs in your stocking in the short term, but in the long run, many of the tax cuts they receive, if they receive a tax cut at all, would only be temporary.  In 10 years, most Americans earning $75,000 or less would pay more in taxes, while people earning more than $100,000 a year would continue to pay less.  According to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, 644,000 Minnesotans with incomes below $153,800 would see a tax hike in 2027. Yes, that is almost 650,000 Minnesotans who would see a tax hike if they make below about $153,000.  I want to highlight again what Senator Merkley already discussed with the elimination of the State and the local tax deduction. Many middle-class families rely on these. In my State, we have both an income tax and State property taxes. Over 900,000 households claim the State and local income tax deduction, and over 850,000 claim the property tax deduction. We have a lot of homeowners in Both of these deductions are important for our middle-class Minnesota families. We want people to own homes. We want to make it easier for middle-class people to own homes.  For example, a policeman and a teacher with two children, with a mortgage, could see their taxes go up under this bill by $250 to $500 a year. Maybe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't think that is a lot. Well, that is a lot for a middle-class family in my Once these cuts disappear in 2027, their tax bill would be $3,000 higher. Why is that? Because it is not offset by the fact that they can no longer deduct their State and local taxes.  That is one example. Senator Merkley has others.

1206,topic-id,452,"Mr.President, the Senate bill also allows companies to blend the tax rate for income that is earned overseas, which may give companies incentives to move jobs to foreign countries, which creates a whole new tax avoidance scheme. I wanted to bring that rate down, to bring jobs here, to make sure that money is invested here, and to bring home some of the trillions of dollars that are overseas. That was a good idea. The only question was where was the rate, but not only did they change the rate, they actually changed the way we did those taxes.  Bob Pozen, the former chairman of the oldest mutual fund company in the United States, has noted that the system that is contained in this bill, which includes this new average minimum U.tax, is ``like Swiss cheese. It has so many holes that it would rarely be paid by U.firms.''  He goes on to say that, in fact, this proposal would encourage U.companies to relocate to foreign countries a lot of their intellectual property. A minimum tax would be effective only if it applied, he says, to the foreign taxes paid by U.companies on a country-by-country basis, rather than on an aggregate basis across all foreign countries. Nevertheless, both the House and the Senate bill allow these companies to utilize this aggregate approach.  Yet we have not had one hearing to look at this new system. Not only did we not have a hearing to look at what the new rate is, we didn't look at the effect of this global minimum tax which encourages companies to place jobs in countries that have no taxes so they are offset by the ones that have higher taxes.  This bill would allow a one-time opportunity to bring back some of the trillions of dollars. That is what we wanted to see in a bill, but that is not what we saw in this bill.  I have always said that if we could bring back that money from overseas, we should at least put a percentage of it in infrastructure. That was going to be a gain from this bill. Democrats and Republicans talked about this as a way of financing infrastructure.  The American Society of Civil Engineers' 2017 report card gave our Nation's infrastructure an overall D-plus grade, but is there any incentive for infrastructure in this bill? Is there any financing authority like we have discussed to put bills forward on a bipartisan basis?

1717,topic-id,871,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Gosar for his leadership on this and other issues in the Congressional Western  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, mining in the Superior National Forest, where these leases are located, has previously been authorized by Congress on several occasions. First in 1950, and again in 1978.  With that bill--the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act--Congress established a compromise in which mining was prohibited within the 1.1 million acre Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, but specifically authorized in the Superior National  Likewise, U.Forest Service plans for these areas have identified mining in these Superior Forest locations as a ``desired condition.''  Despite this longstanding precedent, in December of 2016, the Obama administration abruptly canceled mining leases that have been held and renewed for decades in northern Then in January, the day before leaving office, President Obama signed off on a mineral withdrawal for an area spanning 425,000 acres, including 95,000 acres of State school trust fund lands.  There is a torrent of misinformation surrounding this bill, with alarmist groups begging that we ``save the Boundary Waters.''  Mr.Speaker, the Boundary Waters were saved in 1978. The low-impact mining arrangements that these mining leases entail do not endanger the Boundary Waters, which is itself protected by a significant buffer as well.  The bill reiterates--redundantly, I will add, but in order to make it crystal clear--that mining is prohibited in the Boundary Waters and the surrounding buffer. To say otherwise is a blatant falsehood.  A few other facts that you won't hear from alarmists but that deserve to be said: this bill retains the full protections enshrined across the array of environmental laws and regulations which apply to mine leasing, permitting, and operation. The most notable in this case are the National Environmental Policy Act--NEPA--and the Clean Water Act, which still apply, in full.  But the fact is that this bill is not about removing environmental protections, as some may have said.  Rather, what about when you don't actually remove any?  Rather, what initiated this situation is an arbitrary overreach by the Obama administration at the last minute. It was looking to score political points on its way out the door by taking the near-unprecedented action of initiating a full mineral withdrawal. That was undemocratic, and the huge support that this bill and mining in general enjoys in Minnesota's Eighth Congressional District, where the Superior Forest is located, is proof positive. But Article IV of the Constitution vests Congress with authority over public lands, and it is now up to us to act.  Mr.Speaker, I appreciate this chance to clear the air on some of the misconceptions and falsehoods that have been tarnishing this bill. It really is unfortunate that commonsense, local issues like this one are being dragged into a national partisan brawl. Nevertheless, I hope my colleagues are able to see through the deception, recognize the clear benefits of mining in Minnesota, and vote ``yes'' on this important bill.  Finally, I would like to share some comments from the Associated General Contractors of Minnesota, who noted that ``H.3905 changes no environmental review processes, relaxes no environmental standards, and specifically restates Congress' prohibition on any mining activity in the BWCAW and the surrounding protective buffer.''  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record their full letter.

Dear Congressman Walz: On behalf of the Associated General      Contractors of Minnesota and our over 400 member firms, I am      writing to urge your support for H.3905, the ``Minnesota's      Economic Rights (MINER) in the Superior National Forest      Act,'' bipartisan legislation sponsored by Tom Emmer      (MN-6th) and cosponsored by Collin Peterson (MN-7th),      Jason Lewis (MN-2nd) and Paul Gosar (AZ-4th).      H.3905 is currently on the agenda of the House Rules      Committee, on a path for House floor action in the coming      weeks.       In 1950, Congress took action to make land available for      mineral exploration and development within the Superior      National Forest (SNF) within the Iron Range region in      Northeast In 1978, Congress prohibited mining      within the region's Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness      (BWCAW) and an adjacent protective buffer zone, while      reaffirming that mining should be allowed and promoted in the      remaining area of the       H.3905 aims to correct the injustices being thrust upon      the Iron Range by requiring congressional approval of any      mineral withdrawal or monument designation involving the      National Forest System lands in the State of Minnesota, as      well as providing for the renewal of certain mineral leases      and ensuring future leases in the area remain valid and      renewed as outlined by current law. Moreover, H.3905      changes no environmental review processes, relaxes no      environmental standards, and specifically restates[[Page H9500]]     Congress' prohibition on any mining activity in the BWCAW and      surrounding protective buffer.       H.3905 would reaffirm long-standing Congressional intent      in the management and development of critical minerals in      Minnesota, eliminate bureaucratic delays in developing      environmentally-responsible mine projects proposals, and      restore the promise of future job growth and economic      opportunity to an economically distressed region of the      state.

905,topic-id,2008,"Mr.President, I am honored to be here with several other Members to talk about the issue of immigration. This has become a very contentious issue. As soon as you say the word ``immigration,'' there is a whole group of people who immediately start screaming amnesty on every part of the conversation. Another whole group starts screaming ``jack-hooded thugs'' trying to take grandmothers out of their homes, and the whole conversation diminishes, and we lose the policy issues that are in place.  There are obvious problems with immigration. We have not taken those obvious issues on in decades. They need to be resolved, and every year they are not resolved, this issue gets harder and it gets more complicated. We should address the issue of immigration. For years, the conversation has been out there, and for years, it has remained unresolved. I would challenge this body in the next 3 months: Let's resolve some of the big issues in immigration.  Almost 4 years ago, I was in Central America with a group of other Senators and House We were meeting with Central American leaders, and we were meeting with them to talk about immigration and about some of those individuals leaving those countries who were coming to the United States illegally. But also, we met with them in Central America to determine what they should do for immigration. Multiple countries that were there in the conversation were talking about how they were increasing their border requirements at their borders, how they were managing their workforce within their country, and how individuals from other Central American countries were traveling to their countries and changing the job structure and changing the pay structure.  We somehow get this belief that the immigration issue is only an American issue. Every country in the world deals with immigration because every country in the world has the right and the responsibility to know who is in their country. Are they citizens? Are they noncitizens? I should have the ability, in my country, to be able to know who is coming in as a guest and to be able to say yes or no. That is a basic right. For some reason, that becomes lost in all of this conversation.  When we fly anywhere else in the world, we have a visa or we have a passport because when we enter that country, that country requires it. That country, when we land, wants to know who is in their country and where they are. That seems normal to us when we talk about travel, but for some reason, it gets lost in this issue of immigration. This should be a normal conversation--that our country would know who is in the country, that we would know where they are, if they are a guest, and that we would know when they are leaving.  After the 9/11 Commission finished, they challenged our Nation to resolve one of the issues of immigration that sat out there that is still unresolved to this day. It is entry-exit visas. Why can[[Page S7837]]we not know if a person comes in under a legal visa? We know when they come in, but we don't know when they leave. That is still unresolved a decade and a half later. Year after year, when I talk to Homeland Security, they say: We are doing a pilot project. We are close.  Year after year, that is unresolved. The vast majority of the people who are in our country illegally didn't cross a border illegally. They came with a visa, they overstayed it, and they never left. We are never asking the questions: Who is here, who is not here, and where do those connections come from?  What I would like to find is a way to establish a group of foundational issues that are commonsense solutions to the obvious immigration issues that we face--and find common ground. We will have disagreement in this body, but we should be able to find common ground on immigration issues that we can all look at and say: That is a reasonable way to do it. Probably, every Member of this body would do it a little bit different, and we would have a different set of preferences, but we should all agree it should be done. We have to solve the obvious issues, and there are areas of common ground to be able to do it.  Quite frankly, the President of the United States gave us quite a gift about 3\1/2\ months ago when he said to the DACA Program: That is an administrative program. It should be a legislative issue. I am not going to renew that any more as an administrative issue. That needs to be done in  For the first time in a long time, Congress has a deadline to be able to deal with immigration. That is actually a very good gift because this Congress has punted the immigration issue year after year without a deadline to get it resolved. Now we do have one. That deadline is in early I would suggest to this body: Let's get it resolved. Let's find the areas where we can actually find common ground in this area. Some should be pretty obvious.  Immigration courts, right now, have over half a million cases backlogged and pending. Currently, if you are going to hire a new judge to be able to be in the immigration courts, it will take 742 days to hire one immigration judge. That is not right. That is ridiculous. We should be able to get that resolved, to be able to add new judges to our immigration courts, and to be able to help deal with the backlog of over half a million people. The E-Verify system has been renewed in a bipartisan way year after year. Let's take it beyond the temporary program that it is right now. Some people don't know it is a temporary program. Let's move it from a temporary program to a permanent program. Let's do a permanent reauthorization. And let's make the tweaks and changes that are needed, whether it is to be able to move E-Verify into the hiring system, whether it is to be able to encourage individuals in their hiring--for more companies to be able to use it, for it to be a faster system that is more reliable. At times it can take up to 6 months to get a final answer from E-Again, that is absurd. That is a fixable issue that we should be able to do.  We should be able to resolve the issue of chain migration. We somehow believe that chain migration is an issue that has existed forever. It has not. It has been around only since 1965. Prior to 1965, our immigration issues were tighter than they are now. But now it has formed into this system where you can have initially your nuclear family, and then as you gain citizenship, you can add parents, and you can eventually add siblings, and you can add other individuals, and it continues to accelerate.  I am always frustrated when I hear people talk about our legal immigration system in the United States and say that we should be more open. We admit 1 million people a year through legal immigration--1 million a year. We are a very open country to legal immigration.  We need to be more precise. We need to base our immigration not just on chains of family connections but actually what our Nation needs to grow economically. I am not anti-family--far from it--but we should have a reasonable system. Canada doesn't do it this way. Australia doesn't do it this way. The UK doesn't do it this way. We still do. We should be able to resolve this.  We should deal with the issue of border security. There has been a lot of conversation about a wall. I don't think we should have a 2,000-mile-long wall on our southern border and a multithousand-mile-long wall on our northern border, but I do think we should be able to monitor our border and know who is coming in and out. Not everyone is coming just to work. There are individuals who are trafficking drugs and people. We do need to be able to monitor them.  I have heard folks say that we don't need a wall anywhere. I totally disagree. This whole adage of a 20-foot wall just begs for a 21-foot ladder--if you talk to the homeland security folks and the border security folks, they would say: Fine, put a 21-foot ladder there because it slows you down in the process. A wall is not designed to prevent you entirely; it is designed to slow you so we can actually interdict you, prevent you from coming in.  Yuma, AZ, can tell us the story about when they put up a wall, how it dramatically slowed down crime in Yuma, AZ, rather than just having an open border. There are areas where we desperately need a wall. There are other areas where we just need vehicular barriers. There are other areas where we need drones, and we need greater technology. But we certainly need more personnel in that area. It is one of the other challenges we face.  The President said: Let's add 5,000 new people. Do you know how long it takes to hire one Border Patrol person? It takes 450 days--450 days to hire one person on the Border It is a broken system of hiring. We need to fix that.  We need to do more rapid screening.  We certainly need to take care of the issue of sanctuary cities. All of the Nation last week did a giant sigh for Kate Steinle's family. Kate was murdered in San Francisco--a sanctuary city--by someone who had seven felonies and who had been deported five times. Then a jury said that because the bullet ricocheted off the ground, it wasn't really murder. He can go free. We have to resolve the issue of sanctuary cities. That is unjust. We are better than that as a nation.  We certainly should resolve the issue of We have kids who have been in this country and have grown up in this country. They get up every day, and they say the Pledge of Allegiance to this country. They speak perfect They have great grades and no criminal history. I asked people in my State: Who would you like to come into the country and be free to join this country? If they say the pledge every day, if they speak perfect English, if they are passionate about entrepreneurship and starting companies and getting engaged, if they have joined the military--that is exactly whom the people of my State would like to see immigrate to this country to be a part of it.  Well, guess what. We have almost a million of them already living here, but they have no legal status. They were brought here as a child by their parents under no decision of their own. We should have a long-term legislative solution. This particular bill that is under discussion now has a short-term solution to that, something called the BRIDGE It is a 3-year legislative solution. It cries out for a longer solution, but it at least gives additional certainty more so than what DACA has.  I would challenge this body to look at all of these reasonable solutions and to say: If we can't decide on these, let's start the conversation. What can we decide on? How far can we get? How much can we resolve in immigration?  Let's do it, and let's do it right. Let's start the conversation, but let's finish it this time. We should negotiate with the They have some great ideas. We should negotiate here. There are some tremendous ideas on both sides of the aisle. But let's certainly get it done. I look forward to that ongoing conversation. Let's get this resolved in the days ahead.  I yield the floor.

1807,topic-id,3346,"Mr.President, I want to address this body and talk about an issue that we do not talk about enough--the deficit. It is an issue that, for whatever reason, we have stopped talking about in Washington, We talk about tax policy, which we should. We talk about disaster relief areas, which we should. We talk about healthcare policy, which we should, and a lot of other things. We have stopped talking about the debt and deficit, and I think that is a mistake for us.  You see, after 2011, the trend moved from a high point. Deficit spending that year was $1.3 trillion--overspending in a single year. After that point, the deficit went down a little bit each year until 2015. In 2016 our deficit number--that is a single year of overspending--started going back up. It went up in 2016, and it went up again in 2017. It is turning in the wrong direction. As you will recall and as many people in this body will recall, deficits were a major topic for us starting in 2010. Each year, Congress was trying to find ways to be able to reduce the deficit. That does not seem to be the issue anymore.  What I bring is a set of solutions and a set of ideas. How do we get out of this? Are there bipartisan solutions to actually deal with deficit overspending? There are priority things that we need to spend money on, and we should spend money on those things. Yet, as to the things that are nonessential for us and on which we might all find some way to agree that there is a better way to be able to spend our dollars, we should.  So this week I have produced our third annual ``Federal Fumbles'' book. We call it ``100 ways the Federal Government has dropped the ball.'' None of these should be all that controversial, though we will not agree with all of them. But there are simple ways to look at what the Federal Government is doing, what it is not doing, where we are spending, where we are overspending, and where additional oversight is needed. There is no problem in this country that can't be solved, and, certainly, our deficit is an issue that can be solved. We just have to commit to each of us making the decision that this is actually important and that we are going to try to resolve this to try to get us back toward balance.  I have lumped all of these issues from this book back into a whole series of different process things because each one of the 100 things that we identify is not just a stand-alone; it is part of a bigger problem. So I have put them together into budget process reforms and grant process reforms, which allow for more transparency in how decisions are made and as to what decisions have been made. I would say, as well, that there are Senate rule changes that are going to be needed to be able to resolve any of these issues. We put together these four big blocks to be able to ask: What are we actually dealing with? Let me just give you a couple of ideas.  If we are going to actually deal with some of the budget issues, we are going to have to actually deal with the budget process. We are not going to get a better product until we get a better process. Since 1974, the Budget Act has only worked four times, and every year the American people have asked over and over: What just happened? How[[Page S7342]]come we are back in this budget fight? How come it is at the end of the year? How come this is not resolved? Because we have a bad process--that is why. Our process is not constitutional. It is the product of a law that was put in the Budget We need to be able to change that, and I think there are some basic ways to be able to resolve that.  I would like to do budgeting and appropriations every 2 years. That would give us more time to be able to do more oversight, and that would give us more time for floor debate on it to be able to walk through this. There are multiple other areas that need to be resolved, like aligning our committees and other things that need to be done if we are actually going to get budget work done. In the meantime, we need to be able to push through what we can with the greatest efficiency, but, long term, we are going to have to fix the broken process that we have.  We should fix the grant-making process. There has been a lot of pressure to be able to move dollars toward grants because now we have put more and more restrictions on contracting. Because there are very few restrictions on grants, a lot of agencies are now spending more on grants than they are on contracting, and they are pushing dollars out the door with there being very little supervision.  We have to work on transparency. I am ashamed to say that for 6 years I have pushed on a very simple bill called the Taxpayers Right-To-Know It passed unanimously in the House in 2 different years. It came over to the Senate, and it got tied up. The Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act is very simple. It asks every agency to list everything that it does. What a shocking thing it would be to actually know everything that every agency does--to be able to see what it does, what it spends on it, how many employees it allocates to it, and how many people it serves.  Every business in America can give a list of everything that it does except for the Federal We cannot. We should. It would give the opportunity for agency heads to find out, before they start a program, and to know if someone else already does it in the Federal I have talked to multiple agency individuals now, under two different Presidents, who have said that they have started a program, gotten it developed, committed people to it, and then a couple of months or years later determined that somebody else was already doing it. Even our agency folks do not know what the other agencies are doing. This should be a simple, straightforward solution to be able to help our agencies and to be able to help all of us have greater supervision over the budget.  The fourth thing is dealing with Senate rule changes. If we do not solve the issue of our nominations, we will never be able to get actual legislation on the floor and get back to debate again. We have stopped debating on major bills. We have stopped debating on small bills. Because it takes so much time, it is easier to just not do it at all. That is not what the American people sent us here to do. When we say that the Senate cannot debate a topic, no one can believe it. That rule doesn't get better based on inactivity. It gets better when we actually fix the basic problem that we have, and that is getting us back to debate and solving the nomination process. Let's actually get this resolved.  In saying all of that, all of the things that are in this book this year are things that I and my staff and my team--and Derek Osborn, who has led in all of the compilation of this on my team--have put together. We have put together this basic package to say: Here are 100 items. Quite frankly, I would hope that all 100 Senators could go through budget areas and that everybody could find 100 items and could identify them and say: Let's compare our lists and then ask: What are we going to do to be able to deal with the debt and deficit? How are we going to deal with some of the spending and inefficiencies of the Federal Government? We would probably have 100 different lists, but I would bet that, of the 100 different lists, we would find a lot of common ground, and we would actually start to solve some things.  What type of things did we find on our list this year? Let me give you some examples.  The National Science Foundation did a grant this past year to study the effects and how things are going for refugees in Now, I am sure that the country of Iceland would like to know how it is going for their refugees, and maybe even the U.would like to know, but I am a little stunned that the National Science Foundation used American tax dollars to study refugees in  The National Endowment for the Arts did a grant this past year to help pay for a local community theater in New Hampshire in its performance of ``Doggie Hamlet.'' ``Doggie Hamlet'' is an outdoor presentation in which a group of people yells and sings around a group of sheep and sheep dogs. I have watched the performance, and I think it is fine if the folks of New Hampshire want to do that performance. I am just not sure why the people of Oklahoma are being forced through their Federal tax dollars to pay for the production of ``Doggie Hamlet.''  Last year, the Department of Defense moved some equipment into Kuwait to be able to give it to the Iraqi army. So $1 billion worth of equipment was moved into Kuwait to give it to the Iraqi army--Humvees, small arms, mortars. All of that is fine, as we were helping to equip the Iraqi army to allow them to be able to defend themselves. The problem is that we lost track of them somewhere between Kuwait and Iraq, and the DOD doesn't know what happened to $1 billion of equipment after it was delivered to  The IRS has had multiple issues that we have tried to identify in different segments of this. One is that several years ago we noticed that the IRS was rehiring employees whom it had fired--the employees who were not paying their income taxes but were working for the IRS or the employees who were using their positions to spy on other Americans and pull up their tax information just because of their own interests. It is a fireable offense at the IRS--and it should be--to violate an American's privacy. The problem is that the IRS has started rehiring those same people right back. I don't know many companies that fire somebody and then later decide they are going to change their minds and rehire him, but, apparently, the IRS has become proficient at that. We identified it several years ago. The IRS said it would stop it. We did a check on that last year, and guess what. The IRS is still doing it--rehiring the employees it has fired, some of them even with their files that are stamped ``do not hire.'' The IRS hired them anyway. We have to be able to stop that.  The IRS also did a study, through a program that it has, to be able to research tax compliance--not of changing tax rules, just of how people are complying with the tax rules and evaluating: Are they paying the correct amount of tax? Quite frankly, our tax system is so incredibly complicated that it is hard to be able to track what is the right amount, but the IRS should be able to look at it and determine whether someone is paying the right amount based on those figures. The IRS has developed some programs to be able to recommend, but the problem is that it has not implemented those programs. Over $400 billion of taxes has never been collected by the IRS because it has not implemented the recommendations that it has in front of it already.  The IRS has also had an issue that we are trying to deal with, along with several other entities by the way: Who is alive and who is not alive? You see, the Social Security Administration keeps track of something called the Death Master It sounds wonderful; doesn't it? The Death Master File basically says who has passed away in America and what Social Security number is not functional anymore. The IRS is not fully implementing that list and, at times, it is still sending checks to people who died years ago. Then, some fraudulent people take a Social Security number from someone who has passed away and file a return on that Social Security number in January or February, and the IRS sends them a check simply because it has not listed that this person has passed away and that the Social Security number is not active. Yet the IRS is not the only one.  We also identified in the SNAP program--what some people call the food stamp program--that there are thousands of retailers who are using these[[Page S7343]]false Social Security numbers from people who have passed away. Last year, $2.6 billion was sent out to SNAP retailers based on the Social Security numbers of the people who had passed away or on the numbers that are not operable. Those are things that are fixable. There is $2.6 billion of fraud that is in the system.  We have asked the question about immigration, and immigration has been an important topic here. We talk about immigration as well and not just of the financial portion of it but of the fumble portion of things that are actually going wrong in immigration currently. A lot of folks--and some folks even in this body--say: If we will just enforce the law as it exists and build a fence, we will be fine. The problem is that 66 percent of the people who are in the country illegally came into the country legally, with a legal visa, but they overstayed the visas. They never left.  After 9/11, the 9/11 Commission said that one of the major aspects in dealing with immigration was to do an entry-exit visa system so that we would know who they were when people came in, and we would also know when they left. That was a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission, but it has still not been done a decade and a half later.  If we are going to deal with immigration, one of the key things that we have to have is not just a wall or a fence or some sort of barrier. We also have to deal with when people come in and when they leave under legal visa systems. I have heard comments about hiring more Border Patrol folks and more ICE folks. That is OK, fine. I am good with that, actually, but here is the problem. With the current system that is set up, it takes over 450 days to hire one person as a Border Patrol person because the process is so convoluted--450 days. What if you would like to apply for a job and you wouldn't hear back about it for a year and a half--450 days?  What about if we are going to add more immigration attorneys? We have a half-million-person backlog in our immigration courts right now. What if we were to hire more judges for that process? Great idea. Guess how long it takes to hire more judges in the immigration court? It takes 742 days right now to be able to hire a judge to add to the immigration courts. Our problems are not just in immigration. There are structural problems in the Federal Government right now in hiring, oversight, and in managing the reports.  I mentioned the IRS's not implementing one of the reports they have. There is also an issue with some other agencies that will put on the back of Federal vehicles their phone number with this question: How is my driving? What a great idea that is for a Federal vehicle. The problem is that when we looked at it, we found out that the agencies never actually read the reports that came in. If people called in and said that this particular car number is driving crazy, no one is actually looking at it. It is the fear that Americans have that no one is really listening to them in the Federal  Claire McCaskill and I just worked to be able to pass something in this body to try to deal with solving this basic question: Can agencies ask: How am I doing?  When most of us get a rental car or a hotel room online, we will get an email after we check out of the room or stop using the rental car asking: How is our service? How can we improve?  Do you know that Federal agencies can't do that or that it has become so complicated that they can't produce a three-question e-survey to send out to people saying: How are we doing in Social Security disability? How are we doing in the Veterans' Administration? How are we doing in our HUD assistance to you? The reason for that is the Paperwork Reduction Act, of all things. An old law that was supposed to help us is actually now in the way, now in the modern age, of our trying to do basic surveys. We need to be able to resolve that. That is something this body can lead on to be able to change.  There are a lot of things we want to be able to identify and to say that we can do better. This is our list. Quite frankly, this is our to-do list for the next year, just as the previous two volumes have been. We have seen some things that we have been able to accomplish over the last couple of years from previous ``Federal Fumbles'' books, but we can't get started on them until we actually identify them and say: That is a problem. How are we going to fix it? Our simple question for the rest of this body is this: Here is our list; what is yours? What are the things we are working on? What are the issues that we are actually going to get done and solve for the American people? What are the crazy stories and things we are wasting money on? If we only identified it and said: Let's stop that, we could and would. Let's do it together.  There is no reason that reducing the deficit should have to be an issue that has become a partisan issue. Deficits and the growing debt affect every single So let's work on it together, and let's stop finding ways to not work on it and find areas of common ground where we can work on it.  Let's fix inefficiencies in Federal Government hiring. Let's fix inefficiencies in our system. We have a tremendous number of great Federal employees who are all around the country and who work extremely hard for the American people every day and do great work, but they are trapped in a system that slows them down, that prevents them from being as efficient as they would like to be. Let's help them out by fixing the broken things that are in these agencies and systems. Let's set them free to be able to serve people the way they want to be able to serve people.  There are things we can do. Let's get busy doing it. If you are interested in knowing more about ``Federal Fumbles'' go to our website at lankford.senate.gov. We will send a copy over. We will send you a link to our website because it is cheaper and we will not have to print it off, and you can look at it online.  The issue of the day is this: Let's find out what your list is; we have started ours.  With that, I yield the floor.

This bill is an insult to Federal employees and is completely unnecessary.  Mr.Chairman, I say this is a bill in search of a problem. What are we fixing?  This is not good-government legislation. It just makes it easier to fire Federal employees without due process. By arbitrarily extending probationary periods, this bill takes away civil servants' employment rights and due process protections for at least 2 years.  Mr.Chairman, do you realize that benefits that career employees are entitled to are held in abeyance while they are on probation? They are given a different classification as being probationary than they are as being a career employee.  What are we trying to achieve?  They also give up the right to receive 30 days' notice before they are fired or furloughed, and they do not receive their rights as whistleblowers as probationary employees. This bill simply takes away workers' rights.  How many Members of Congress' parents worked as Federal employees to put them through college and to make a difference in America?  Here we are assaulting the legacy of Federal employees who work every day to make this country an amazing place to live.  This is not the way to address performance issues in the Federal workplace. As a Federal employee who had the responsibility to perform probationary evaluations, you need to talk to the supervisor if they are not doing their job conducting the proper evaluations.  We must continue to support accountability measures and tools. In addition, we must keep the spotlight on gross mismanagement.

573,topic-id,1376,"Mr.President, next week, the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, will consider a proposed rule, that, if approved, will end net neutrality as we know it and will threaten the foundation of a free and open internet. Net neutrality is the simple proposition that internet service providers should treat all internet traffic the same; they should not be able to exploit their power to charge for preferred treatment, allowing big corporations to dominate the internet.  The Chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, wants the FCC to undo its protections for net neutrality. His proposed ruling is perversely styled as ``Restoring Internet Freedom,'' when in fact it would do the opposite. It would allow internet service providers to decide which websites will be privileged and which will be throttled or even blocked. Make no mistake: This will mean that the big firms that can afford the ``fast lane'' will be protected, while harming consumers, startups, and potentially even freedom of speech online.  Alarmingly, Chairman Pai has decided to ignore millions of comments submitted by individuals across the country, citing concerns that they are not ``unique.'' As a Member of Congress accountable to my constituents, this is a particularly offensive posture. Unique or not, comments and concerns submitted to my office by Vermonters are treated with the same weight and value as any other. Until the FCC fully and meaningfully considers the more than 21.7 million comments it has received about this proposed rule, it should not proceed with this vote.  A recent New York Times article by Farhad Manjoo, entitled, ``The Internet Is Repealing Net Neutrality Hastens That Death,'' lays out clearly why the FCC's proposed repeal of net neutrality will bring the open internet one giant leap closer to becoming a corporate playground. If, as expected, Chairman Pai jams through his proposed rule change next week, it will be clear that he has done so to the benefit of a few deep-pocketed corporations and to the detriment of everyone else who relies on the internet to support commerce, communication, and community. I ask unanimous consent that the article by Mr.Manjoo be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, 29, 2017]   The Internet Is Dying, Repealing Net Neutrality Hastens That Death                           (By Farhad Manjoo)       Sure, technically, the internet still works. Pull up      Facebook on your phone and you will still see your second      cousin's baby pictures. But that isn't really the internet.      It's not the open, anyone-can-build-it network of the 1990s      and early 2000s, the product of technologies created over      decades through government funding and academic research, the      network that helped undo Microsoft's stranglehold on the tech      business and gave us upstarts like Amazon, Google, Facebook      and       Nope, that freewheeling internet has been dying a slow      death--and a vote next month by the Federal Communications      Commission to undo net neutrality would be the final pillow      in its face.       Net neutrality is intended to prevent companies that      provide internet service from offering preferential treatment      to certain content over their lines. The rules prevent, for      instance, AT&T from charging a fee to companies that want to      stream high-definition videos to people.       Because net neutrality shelters start-ups--which can't      easily pay for fast-line access--from internet giants that      can pay, the rules are just about the last bulwark against      the complete corporate takeover of much of online life. When      the rules go, the internet will still work, but it will look      like and feel like something else altogether--a network in      which business development deals, rather than innovation,      determine what you experience, a network that feels much more      like cable TV than the technological Wild West that gave you      Napster and       If this sounds alarmist, consider that the state of digital      competition is already pretty sorry. As I've argued      regularly, much of the tech industry is at risk of getting      swallowed by giants. Today's internet is lousy with      gatekeepers, tollbooths and monopolists.       The five most valuable American companies--Amazon, Apple,      Facebook, Google and Microsoft--control much of the online      infrastructure, from app stores to operating systems to cloud      storage to nearly all of the online ad business. A handful of      broadband companies--AT&T, Charter, Comcast and Verizon, many      of which are also aiming to become content companies, because      why not--provide virtually all the internet connections to      American homes and smartphones.       Together these giants have carved the internet into a      historically profitable system of fiefs. They have turned a      network whose very promise was endless innovation into one      stuck in mud, where every start-up is at the tender mercy of      some of the largest corporations on the planet.       Many companies feel this shift. In a letter to Ajit Pai,      the F.C.chairman, who drafted the net neutrality repeal      order, more than 200 start-ups argued this week that the      order ``would put small and medium-sized businesses at a      disadvantage and prevent innovative new ones from even      getting off the ground.'' This, they said, was ``the opposite      of the open market, with a few powerful cable and phone      companies picking winners and losers instead of consumers.''       This was not the way the internet was supposed to go. At      its deepest technical level, the Internet was designed to      avoid the central points of control that now command it. The      technical scheme arose from an even deeper philosophy. The      designers of the internet understood that communications      networks gain new powers through their end nodes--that is,      through the new devices and services that plug into the      network, rather than the computers that manage traffic on the      network. This is known as the ``end-to-end'' principle of      network design, and it basically explains why the internet      led to so many more innovations than the centralized      networks that came before it, such as the old telephone      network.       The internet's singular power, in its early gold-rush days,      was its flexibility. People could imagine a dazzling array of      new uses for the network, and as quick as that, they could      build and deploy them--a site that sold you books, a site      that cataloged the world's information, an application that      let you ``borrow'' other people's music, a social network      that could connect you to anyone.       You didn't need permission for any of this stuff; some of      these innovations ruined traditional industries, some      fundamentally altered society, and many were legally dubious.      But the internet meant you could just put it up, and if it      worked, the rest of the world would quickly adopt it.       But if flexibility was the early internet's promise, it was      soon imperiled. In 2003, Tim Wu, a law professor now at      Columbia Law School (he's also a contributor to The New York      Times), saw signs of impending corporate control over the      growing internet. Broadband companies that were investing      great sums to roll out faster and faster internet service to      Americans were becoming wary of running an anything-goes      network.       Some of the new uses of the internet threatened their      bottom line. People were using online services as an      alternative to paying for cable TV or long-distance phone      service. They were connecting devices like Wi-Fi routers,      which allowed them to share their connections with multiple      devices. At the time, there were persistent reports of      broadband companies seeking to block or otherwise frustrate      these new services; in a few years, some broadband providers      would begin blocking new services outright.       To Mr.Wu, the broadband monopolies looked like a threat to      the end-to-end idea that had powered the internet. In a legal      journal, he outlined an idea for regulation to preserve the      internet's equal-opportunity design--and hence was born ``net      neutrality.''       Though it has been through a barrage of legal challenges      and resurrections, some form of net neutrality has been the      governing regime on the internet since 2005.

1061,topic-id,1333,"Mr.President, I want to alert all Senators to the situation in Those of us who care about Central America have watched the election for Honduras's next President with increasing alarm. It has been more than a week since November 26, when the people of Honduras cast their votes. Since then, repeated delays and suspicious behavior, which suggests either incompetence or fraud, by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, TSE, that has been tallying the ballots, have incited large public demonstrations.  Late last week, the government of President Juan Orlando Hernandez suspended constitutional rights and imposed a 10-day, 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. Several protesters, including a 19-year-old girl, have reportedly been shot and killed by Honduran troops, and hundreds more have been arrested. Salvador Nasralla, the main opposition candidate, called for a new election and reportedly urged the Honduran police and military to disobey orders of their commanders to fire on demonstrators.  Even before the Honduran people went to the polls, the prospects for a free, fair, and peaceful election faced many challenges. The most obvious point of contention is that President Hernandez is seeking a second term, since until recently the Honduran Constitution had been interpreted to strictly limit Presidents to a single 4-year term.  Ironically, in 2009 former President Manuel Zelaya was forced from power by a coalition of military officers, businessowners, and conservative politicians, including Hernandez, after they accused Zelaya of using a popular referendum on a proposed constitutional convention to extend his own rule.  Zelaya's ouster was initially labeled a coup by the U.State Department, but it was not long before the United States accepted the result and resumed sending economic and military aid to the government of President Porfirio During the next 3 years, the influx of illicit drugs and the incidence of violence, including assassinations of journalists and other civil society leaders, increased dramatically, and Honduras became among the most violent countries in the world.  After Hernandez became president of the National Congress, he and his National Party replaced the Supreme Court with justices intended to support their political agenda. In 2013, Hernandez was declared President of Honduras after an election fraught with reports of vote buying and threats and assassinations of political opponents.  Two years later, the same Supreme Court ruled that he could run for a second term, paving the way for last week's election. Just 8 years after former President Zelaya was pushed out for allegedly proposing that the Honduran people vote on the question of a second term, President Hernandez had consolidated his control by replacing the justices of the Supreme Court, appointing the TSE, maintaining a majority in the Congress, and using the state media to drown out his critics. It was widely predicted that he would coast to victory.  President Hernandez's government, in addition to becoming increasingly autocratic, has been dogged by accusations of pervasive corruption.  For these reasons and because of the opaque and bizarre conduct of the TSE during the vote tallying process, it is perhaps not surprising that the situation has deteriorated to the point of becoming a national crisis of confidence in the integrity of Honduras's democracy.  Contrary to past practice, the TSE did not issue early results until the day after the polls closed. At that time, it announced that, with 57 percent of the vote counted, Mr.Nasralla, a former TV sports journalist, was leading by 5 percentage points. This indicated the possibility of an historic upset, and while based on past practice the final count was expected the next day, the process of tallying the votes dragged on behind closed doors with no further announcements.  While Nasralla and his supporters celebrated and the third-placed candidate, Luis Zelaya of the Liberal party, conceded, President Hernandez and his allies in the press insisted that he would come out on top once the rural votes were counted.  The TSE also said the rural vote count was delayed, and on Wednesday, after a long silence, the TSE indicated that Nasralla's lead had started to shrink, but the press reported that no technical reason was apparent to explain the delay as the results from all polling stations were reportedly transmitted electronically as soon as the polls closed.  As time dragged on, suspicions of fraud escalated among Nasralla's supporters, and last Wednesday afternoon, the TSE said its computer system had inexplicably ceased functioning for 5 hours. Then on Wednesday night, the TSE reported that President Hernandez was ahead by several thousand votes, which triggered protests by Nasralla's supporters, some of them reportedly throwing rocks and lighting fires in the streets, who were met by troops firing tear gas and live bullets.  According to press reports, the opposition is questioning ballots from 5,300 polling places and has called for a recount of ballots from three rural departments. Yesterday morning, after only a partial recount, the TSE announced its final tally in favor of President Hernandez by just 1.49 percent, a gap of 52,333 votes.  The process has been so lacking in transparency, so fraught with irregularities and inexplicable delays, and coupled with reports of excessive force by the Honduran police and military against peaceful protesters, it is increasingly obvious that the TSE's announcement made a bad situation worse. There is too much suspicion of fraud and too much distrust.  On Saturday, I asked the U.Embassy in Tegucigalpa three simple but important questions about the delays, the TSE's tally of the votes, and the reports of shootings of protesters. It is late Tuesday afternoon, and I have yet to receive answers. This lack of responsiveness in such a time of crisis is troubling, and I hope it is not a new standard.  Yesterday evening, the OAS issued a statement that ``the tight margin of the results, and the irregularities, errors and systemic problems that have surrounded this election do not allow the Mission to hold certainty about the results.'' There were also reports that large numbers of Honduran police officers, many of whom have longstanding grievances, are refusing orders to use force against the protesters. Earlier today, I was informed that there may[[Page S7842]]be at least 15 fatalities and many people injured from gunshot wounds. There are reports that the police and military fired many shots, sometimes in the air and other times at the crowds.  The importance of this election, which will determine who leads Honduras for the next 4 years, cannot be overstated. This is especially so because of the way it came about in the first place. There was already resentment toward President Hernandez for the double standard of participating in the coup against Zelaya and then orchestrating his own path to reelection. As one Honduran was quoted saying, they ``are reliving the entire crisis from the coup of 2009, and the majority of people don't really like that because it brings back some ugly memories.''  President Hernandez and Mr.Nasralla offer significantly different approaches to tackling the country's problems. Given the debacle of the past week and the growing popular outcry, it is apparent that establishing the credibility of the electoral process and the integrity of Honduras's democracy requires either recounting the contested ballots from each of the 5,300 polling places in the presence of representatives of the political parties, representatives of civil society, and international observers or holding a new election.  In the meantime, it is the responsibility of the Honduran Government, particularly the police and the military, to respect and defend the right of the Honduran people to freely and peacefully express their opinions.  Honduras faces a defining moment in its modern history. How the government resolves this crisis will determine the path of the country for the foreseeable future. It will also determine the extent of validity and support the next government receives from the United States because only a credible election, accepted widely by the Honduran people as free and fair, coupled with a demonstrable commitment to transparency, to freedom of expression and association, and to the rule of law, will justify that validity and support.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-05-pt1-PgS7841.txt,1383,NATIONAL MINERS DAY,2017,5,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1249,topic-id,1136,"Mr.President, during Thanksgiving last week, families across the country came together to give thanks for the blessings of the past year. One group in particular--corporate CEOs--had a special reason to be thankful: the Republican tax bill we are considering today. Rather than engaging in a bipartisan process to develop and enact meaningful tax reform that will benefit working Americans and small businesses, Republicans in Congress have spent the last few weeks. crafting tax cut legislation that will overwhelmingly favor large corporations and ultrawealthy Just in time for the holiday season, this bill delivers everything on the Republican donor class's wish lis while providing the vast majority of working Americans with little more than a lump of coal.  This tax bill would have harmful and far-reaching effects, in countless ways, for our economy, for the budget, for our healthcare system, for our environment, and for the pocketbooks of middle-income Americans from coast to coast; yet despite these enormous threats across the board, rarely, if ever, have I seen such a secretive and slapdash process and such a shoddy result. Republican leaders purposely chose a partisan process, not a bipartisan process.  This bill has one clear goal: provide corporations with permanent tax cuts at any and all costs. Unfortunately, the costs of providing these unnecessary cuts are high and fall disproportionately on lower and middle-income Americans, who will only see temporary cuts that will expire in 2025. The true purpose and slant of this bill are belied by the fact that huge tax[[Page S7553]]cuts for corporations would be permanent, while the meager adjustments for hard-working Americans are only temporary. Critical deductions relied upon by many Vermonters, including the State and local tax deduction, are reduced or eliminated. These changes are likely to result in higher taxes for many working families. To add insult to injury, even after targeting the middle class to pay for permanent corporate tax cuts, the bill will still end up adding more than $1.4 trillion to our deficit and debt over the next 10 years.  This is a bill that cheats our future for the sake of a tax-cut windfall for the 1 percent. It does absolutely wonderful things for the wealthiest taxpayers, like the President, his cronies, and his family, but it does not advance the common good. It offers crumbs to hard-working Americans, while the wealthiest individuals and corporations reap the rewards of this bill, with the false promise of trickle-down benefits to everyone else. The wealthiest are doing just fine, and big corporations already are pulling in record profits, which they are not investing but salting away. They don't need more tax cuts. More than 400 millionaires have urgently told Congress that they don't need more tax cuts.  Even more appallingly, to pay for these tax giveaways for corporations, Republicans intend to strip health insurance from 13 million Americans, a move that threatens to seriously destabilize the health insurance market. Americans with health insurance today will face higher premiums as a result of this bill becoming law. As the Congressional Budget Office found in its recent analysis, by 2027, the bill takes away billions of dollars in Federal healthcare support for Americans making less than $75,000. This needlessly putt innocent lives at risk. To the extent that working Vermonters see any benefit from the tax cuts included in this bill, those gains will be more than wiped away by these changes to our healthcare system.  What is more, this Republican proposal will also cause irreparable harm to our environment by opening up oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR--all to pay for tax breaks for corporations, including those in the oil and gas industry. Exposing this breathtaking area of the country to the ravages of oil and gas drilling would be an environmental tragedy. Even worse, the rationale for it may be built on a false premise. There is evidence to suggest that opening this area for development would not even provide the economic benefits being claimed. Turning ANWR into an oil field is yet another gift to corporate interests at the expense of the American people and at the cost of damage to their public lands.  These are just some of the devastating consequences this bill will have if it is enacted, and we know this isn't even the bill on which we will ultimately cast a vote. This bill has been written and rewritten so many times behind closed doors, and we have every reason to believe Republicans will conclude this arcane reconciliation process by offering a final amendment, unveiled at the last minute, without the benefit of thorough review and debate. For an issue this complex that touches every aspect of our economy, moving at a breakneck, partisan pace is a dangerous and reckless approach. How many Senators who support this legislation can look their constituents in the eye and honestly tell them they know every detail of this bill and how it will impact them and our country? Can the Senators who support this bill in good faith promise it won't raise their constituents' taxes, today, tomorrow, next year, or in a decade? Or that it won't set in motion slashing cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid?  Remember the promises the Republican majority made just months ago? They promised their bill would boost the economy and help middle-class Americans and that it wouldn't explode the debt and the deficits. The President himself promised that the bill wouldn't benefit him or other wealthy taxpayers. Now, we know the truth. The independent Congressional Budget Office and countless economists have made clear that those promises have been utterly shredded. Further damage is done by this direct hit on the health insurance that is relied upon by millions of Americans and by the elimination of the deductibility of State and local taxes. Blowing a hole in the budget will seed the ground for rising interest rates that will hit every family and drag down our economy, and Republican cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will follow.  Even these huge corporate tax cuts are not structured in a way that would truly encourage investments here at home and boost workers' wages. There is no bang, let alone a popgun pop, for shoveling out these more than 2 million bucks.  We need to go back to the drawing board and start this process over again. Let Republicans and Democrats work together on real tax reform that simplifies the Tax Code and provides real benefits to working This bill is not tax reform. This is a cartoonish caricature of what real tax reform should look like. It is dishonest to its core. It is cynical, and it can only breed more cynicism by the public. It is not only bad policy, it is horrible policy--and it is wrong.  ",CREC-2017-11-30-pt1-PgS7508-4.txt,1383,HONORING MAYOR WILLIAM V.

337,topic-id,1632,"Mr.President, I stand in support of the child tax credit. It is something that this bill goes a long way toward promoting.  This is a great day in the sense that the Senate is moving forward with promoting the interests of the American family, doing something to weaken, to soften the impact of a little known feature called the parent tax penalty.  A lot of people are familiar with the marriage tax penalty in the Tax It is a pernicious feature, one that punishes people for getting married, one that can produce a series of adverse effects simply by saying ``I do.'' That is wrong. Most Americans acknowledge that it is wrong. This bill goes a long way toward undoing that.  There is a different thing called the parent tax penalty that, like I say, is less understood, less frequently discussed than it should be.  Here is how the parent tax penalty works. It is a basic function of the interaction between the Federal income tax system on the one hand and our Federal senior entitlement programs, on the other--Social Security and  Here is how it works. Imagine two hypothetical couples, couple A and couple Couple A and couple B are identical in every respect but one, and that is that they are identical in their income patterns, charitable contributions, mortgage interests, so on and so forth, except for one characteristic. Couple A has four children, and couple B chooses to remain childless.  Over the course of their lifetimes and while raising their children, couple A will, on average--according to what some have described as lowball estimates produced by the U.Department of Agriculture--incur around $1 million in childrearing expenses, just the cost of raising their children. Couple B, of course, being childless, will not incur those same expenses. At the same time, they are paying more or less at the same tax rate. There are a few differences in the existing Tax Code, but nothing to offset the disparity between the two couples in the sense that couple A, while incurring this $1 million in childrearing expenses while they are raising their children, is also paying into Social Security and They are also paying taxes, and they are not having their contributions to this solvency of Social Security and Medicare adequately taken into account.  In other words, because Social Security and Medicare are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis, we have to remember that it is today's workers who are paying the retirement benefits of today's retirees. It is today's children who will be tomorrow's workers who will be funding the requirement benefits under Social Security and Medicare of today's workers and tomorrow's retirees.  This is what the parent tax penalty is all about. You see, the Federal Tax Code doesn't adequately take into account the enormous contribution of working parents and contributing toward the solvency and sustainability of Social Security and  This is why a little over 4 years ago, back in 2013, I started pushing this idea of the need to increase the child tax credit to help soften the impact of the parent tax penalty. This is not, to be sure, something that is intended to incentivize or compel parenthood. That is not our purpose at all. This is not social engineering.  It is one thing for the government to tell people they have to do something or to incentivize them to do another. It is quite another thing to simply tell people: We are going to punish you less for bringing about the possibility of sustaining Medicare and Social Security, for bringing children into this world, and raising tomorrow's generation of workers who will pay for the Social Security and Medicare benefits of today's workers and tomorrow's retirees.  This is important, and this is something that I am thrilled to see as part of this tax reform package. This tax reform package does, in fact, increase the child tax credit to $2,000 per child.  What I would like to see, and what I have been working on with Senator Rubio, is also to increase the refundability of the child tax credit, to move that refundability all the way up to $2,000 per child and make it refundable up to the amount of taxes paid, including payroll taxes--in other words, up to 15.3 percent of earnings.  What this would do is it would result in an effective cut in the payroll tax liability of middle-class, hard-working American moms and dads, some of whom might see their payroll tax liability exceed their income tax liability. They are still paying taxes.  Tell a construction worker or a secretary or a police officer that he or she is not paying Federal taxes simply because their biggest tax liability is found in the payroll tax. In this circumstance, this amendment is needed in order to give these people significant tax benefits under this bill.  It is important to remember that some 70 percent of the benefits under this bill go to America's corporations and 30 percent to individuals. It is our desire to help spread out some of the benefits of this and to help spread it out, in particular, to America's hard-working middle-class moms and dads.  Now, the Rubio-Lee amendment, in its current formulation, would involve a very slight adjustment to the corporate tax rate, taking it from 20 percent to 20.94 percent. This is not an enormous difference.  This reminds me a little bit of a story that I first heard told by Emo Emo Philips described himself as walking across the Golden Gate Bridge one night very late. He was alone on the bridge, or so he thought, until he got to about halfway across the bridge when he discovered he was not alone. He found somebody else standing on the outside of the guardrail of the Golden Gate  Emo said: I could tell right away that this man was in trouble, and the thought occurred to me that maybe this man is thinking about taking the unfortunate step of ending his life by jumping off the bridge.  Emo said: I stopped and asked the man the first thing that came to mind: Do you believe in God?  The man said:  Emo said: Me too. Are you a Christian?  The man said:  Emo said: Me too. What denomination are you?  The man said: I am a  Emo said: Me too. Are you a northern Baptist or a southern Baptist?  The man said: I am a northern  Emo said: Me too. Are you a northern fundamentalist Baptist or a northern reformed Baptist?  The man said: I am a northern fundamentalist  Emo said: Me too. Are you a northern fundamentalist Baptist, conference of[[Page S7696]]1857 or a northern fundamentalist Baptist, conference of 1812?  The man said: Northern fundamentalist conference of 1857.  Emo said: Die, you heretic. And he pushed him off the bridge.  The point here is that sometimes we have to acknowledge that very minor differences between us do not make us heretics.  There is a very minor difference between a corporate tax rate of 20 percent and a corporate tax rate of 20.94 percent. But that minor difference would make all the difference in the world to America's hard-working moms and dads, many of whom are on the very cusp of where many parents find themselves, especially while their children are young.  Imagine the construction worker, police officer, or school teacher who are just making ends meet and who realize that if they were to take themselves out of the workforce, they might be able to receive government benefits that they are currently not receiving. They might, in some ways, find their quality of life going up, at least in the sense that they wouldn't have to go to work. We don't want them to have to do that, you see, because when they get into that circumstance, they might forgo other career opportunities.  Without that job, there will not be the next job, the next promotion, and the next promotion after that. They might find themselves trapped in a web of poverty, held down by the very government programs that are there to help them.  That, in turn, might contribute to this growing expanse of the Federal Government and might inhibit economic growth.  You see, sometimes we have to remember that America's ultimate and most important investor class is not necessarily just those people gathered around the boardroom. They are often in maternity wards or at the altar in a church saying ``I do.'' Sometimes the most important investments we make are in those children whom we rock to sleep at night, whom we raise to be the next generation of taxpayers, the next generation of contributors to our great society.  This is why making sure that the child tax credit is there for them, is available to them, and is refundable up to the amount of taxes paid is so important.  These are not freeloaders. These are not people who would be seeking a welfare benefit, because the only benefit available to them under this child tax credit would be there for them only to the extent that they have been working and paying taxes, paying into the system. This is an imminently reasonable request.  In any event, this is a great moment in the very sense that we are having this conversation, in the very sense that we are poised right now to increase the child tax credit to $2,000 per child. This would go a significant way toward offsetting the parent tax penalty.  It is my hope and my humble request that my colleagues will heed this call to make it even more meaningful by making the child tax credit refundable up to the amount of taxes paid, including payroll taxes.

1649,topic-id,597,"Mr.President, I am grateful to my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Florida, for his work on this issue.  He noted a couple of issues that we focus on in this amendment. He noted, among other things, the marriage tax penalty. That is a more obvious defect within our Tax There is another defect he also mentioned that doesn't get as much play as it should. It doesn't get as much play, especially considering the amount of damage it does. It is called the parent tax penalty.  Here is how it works. We have American parents from one end of the country to the other who are essentially propping up and securing the future of our senior entitlement programs, not just once but twice and in a pretty unfair way. They prop up Social Security and Medicare two times--first, as they pay their taxes, and secondly, as they incur the substantial costs associated with child-rearing and thereby prop up and secure Social Security and  Social Security and Medicare are paid for on a pay-as-you-go basis. Many of today's workers pay for the benefits of today's retirees. Today's children are tomorrow's workers who will, in turn, be working to pay the taxes to fund the Social Security and Medicare retirement benefits of today's workers, who will be tomorrow's retirees.  Those costs add up over time. According to one very lowball estimate--an estimate that doesn't include a lot of things that it probably should, such as education, higher education, and so forth--a family raising three children can reasonably expect to incur $700,000 in child-rearing costs as they raise their three children. Those three children are going to go on to be tomorrow's workers, paying the Social Security and Medicare benefits for today's workers, tomorrow's retirees. This is important.  We need to end the marriage tax penalty. We also need to end this parent tax penalty. The best way to do that is to make sure that we increase the child tax credit up to $2,000, as the current Senate proposal would do, but just as importantly, we need to make that sum refundable up to $2,000, up to the total amount of taxes paid, including payroll tax liability--in other words, up to 15.3 percent of earnings. If we do this, it is not going to end the parent tax penalty altogether, but it is an important first step.  I also want to echo something said by Senator Rubio a moment ago, and I think it is worth mentioning. This is not a handout. This is not a welfare benefit. This is money they are making. It is not welfare when you say that the government's not going to take away something that you have worked hard for, that you have earned.  We should at least be doing that for those people who are America's ultimate, most important entrepreneurial class, America's most cherished group of investors. The most important investment decisions are not necessarily those made around the boardroom. They are made at the altar. They are made in delivery wards in hospitals throughout They are made when a couple says ``I do'' and they agree to raise children. Those are the investors we need to be encouraging and certainly not punishing.  We can fix this problem. We need to do it by passing the Rubio-Lee amendment and increasing refundability so that we can all benefit from this and so that America's families can stop being punished as a result of the interaction between our Tax Code and our senior entitlement programs.

At the same time, I want to express concerns about the full thrust of the resolution.  It makes it clear that the military in Burma is the main perpetrator of the crimes committed against the Rohingya people. In November, Secretary Tillerson called the violence against the Rohingya ``ethnic cleansing,'' holding the military responsible.  Some have urged that Aung San Suu Kyi does not control the military and there is a danger that the military would use the present crisis as a way to dismantle the civilian government. It has also been said that the civilian government is working within a deep traditional bias against the Rohingyas, and some see them as illegal immigrants from  Others point out the pressure on the civilian government could lead to Burma moving closer to the Still others point out that talks about Rohingyas returning to Burma must be afforded time to work out, and the process has only begun.  None of these factors must undermine the realities of the persecution of the As a U.official has stated, it is ``a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.''  The Pope was under great pressure to not mention the Rohingyas by name. He expressed his deep concern while visiting the country.

The resolution earlier introduced by Senators McCain and Durbin expressed the overriding need for the world to step up to the plight of the I introduced the same resolution in the These resolutions reflect what many esteemed historical figures have said.  Theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, executed by the Nazis, said: ``Silence in the face of evil is itself evil.''  Desmond Tutu has said: ``If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.''  Elie Wiesel said: ``We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.''  I quote the statement of Martin Luther King, who said: `` . . . an individual who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.''

1466,topic-id,218,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for all of his work he has done over the years.  The Republican tax bill is built on massive deception. The deception is that, as the Speaker put it: ``The focus is on middle class tax relief.'' That is simply not true.  As the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation said, roughly one out of every four Americans with income between $50,000 and $100,000 would pay higher taxes in 2023, far overshadowing the $1,000 or so for other families. In 2019, those earning over $1 million would get an average tax cut of $73,000.  Even as modified in last-minute desperation, the wealthiest would receive 90 percent of the new tax break for so-called passthrough income.  Another deception is that tax breaks pay for themselves. On this, some people may have been in the past fooled once, fewer twice, but none thrice.  A further deception is that exploding the deficit and national debt to $1.7 trillion will disappear as it promotes growth. Not only is this a 180-degree Republican turn, but it threatens Medicare and other critical programs and will worsen the vast inequalities in income and wealth in  It is said that necessity is the mother of invention. In this case, Republican political necessity is the mother of desperation and deception.

1854,topic-id,593,"Mr.Speaker, I thank our whip for trying to whip some common sense into this debate.  I want to focus on the claims of the Republicans that this is a middle class tax cut. Halloween is over, but the masks of the Republican are still on. I think the largest and the most dangerous one is the claim that this is a middle class tax cut.  Mr.Speaker, I want to quote the President: ``It is a tax bill for middle class.''  Again, the President: ``We will cut taxes tremendously for the middle class--not just a little bit, but tremendously.''  The Speaker: ``The focus is on middle class tax relief.''  The chairman of the committee: ``The truth is this is whole tax reform is designed for the middle class family that is working so hard or that Main Street business that is working so hard.''  The majority leader in the Senate:       To keep growing again, like we need this code to do, to get      new jobs, opportunity, and significant tax relief for the      middle class.  Mr.Mnuchin: ``On the personal tax side, middle-income people are getting cuts and rich people are getting very little cuts or, in certain cases, increases under the Republican bills.''  Mr.Mnuchin again: ``Any reductions we have in upper income taxes will be offset by less deductions, so there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class.''  Senator Hatch: ``Tax reform will provide relief and bigger paychecks to low- and middle-income families, make America a better place to start and grow a business, and allow American businesses to compete in the global marketplace.''  The Joint Tax Committee and other entities have shown that this is not at all a middle class tax cut. The main beneficiaries are the very, very wealthy.  Also, in terms of passthrough, there is so much talk that this will help the small-business person. The truth of the matter is that the vast majority of the benefit for passthroughs is going to go to the very wealthy.  Mr.Speaker, Mr.Hoyer has been taking the lead on this and I salute him.  Mr.Speaker, I just want to close by saying one thing about the deficits. You know, I don't think they called Mr.Hoyer a deficit hawk because he always wanted a balance, and he always said: ``Look, deficits by themselves aren't the only issue, but they are deeply relevant.''  Mr.Hoyer and I have stood together with others. When bills came up, which seemed so attractive, but were unpaid for, hundreds of billions of dollars, we said to the Republicans and anyone who voted with them: ``You are increasing the deficit, and it is very risky.''  Mr.Speaker, as true as that may have been--and Mr.Hoyer and I thought it was some years ago, or last year included--it is now even more relevant and more dangerous because here we have a proposal in the House and it is going to be duplicated in the It is going to increase the deficit at least $1.5 trillion, and the notion is it will be taking care of growth.  Mr.Speaker, I close by saying maybe that is the second biggest Halloween mask on the bill here and in the The notion of ``Don't worry about tax losses all of a sudden, don't worry about the deficit increasing, because growth will take care of it,'' we have seen that mask before.  Mr.Speaker, I just wanted to join Mr.Hoyer, but also to salute him for his dedicated and endless determination to really talk sense and talk the truth.  Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Hoyer for yielding to me.  ",CREC-2017-11-28-pt1-PgH9457-3.txt,683,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,28,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We know on the House Administration Committee that we are going to have to dig in and make sure that the training that is referred to in this bill is a lot better than what we have right now.

Clearly, Mr.Speaker, the overregulation of Dodd-Frank, coupled with unfettered agencies like the CFPB, have hurt Americans from Wall Street to Main But today, Mr.Speaker, I am not here to talk about Wall Street or Main Street but a little two-lane street in Cassville, Georgia, named ``Mac Johnson.''  Cassville is a rural community that has a small post office, a little country store, and a lot of hardworking people who call it their home. Many of the people who live in Cassville work at one of the many factories in the local area.  While these hardworking Americans are not the upper middle class, they are the backbone of America's economy. And like 22 million other Americans, many of them live in a manufactured home. Along Mac Johnson, you will find a number of manufactured homes--some on individual lots, some on farmland, and some in quaint, little mobile home parks.  As it is across the Nation, almost half of those living in these homes have incomes of less than $30,000 a year, and many are retired or disabled.

1719,topic-id,654,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, this legislation is quite simply a giveaway of mining rights on roughly 5,000 acres of public lands right next to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in northern Minnesota to a Chilean mining conglomerate so that it can develop a copper mine that will, in all likelihood, leach toxic acid waste into the Boundary Waters for decades, if not centuries, to come. In order to do this, this bill overrides multiple laws that are in place to allow priceless natural places to be protected and it vetoes the scientific conclusions of the U.Forest  Last year, the Forest Service recommended that two undeveloped 50-year-old mining leases in Minnesota's Superior National Forest be allowed to expire, stating that the development of a copper mine on these leases could lead to potentially extreme contamination of the Boundary Waters wilderness from acid mine drainage and leached materials.  The Boundary Waters isn't just a pristine and unique wilderness, it is also an economic engine for northern Over 1,000 pristine lakes, 1,200 miles of streams, and 2,000 campsites attract more than 150,000 visitors each year to canoe, kayak, fish, bird watch, ski, and simply explore and enjoy the natural beauty and peacefulness that is unlike anywhere else in the United These visitors bring in tens of millions of dollars annually, supporting thousands of local jobs.                              {time}  1530  The ecological and economic value of the Boundary Waters led the Forest Service to conclude: `` . . . development of a regionally untested copper-nickel sulfide-ore mine within the same watershed as the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness might cause serious and irreplaceable harm to this unique, iconic, and irreplaceable wilderness area.''  As a result, the leases were not renewed, and the Forest Service began a study to look at whether to protect the area adjacent to the Boundary Waters from mining for the next 20 years. This 2-year study is open. It is a public process designed to gather scientific information and local views on the potential impacts of copper mining, which is immediately adjacent to the Boundary Waters, and it is supported by an overwhelming majority--79 percent--of the voters in  Even this administration here in Washington has said that it intends to allow the study to run its course before making any decisions, but this legislation would make that study meaningless. It would reinstate the leases and make it almost impossible for them to expire. It would block the Forest Service from acting on its study no matter what it found and how the people in the region feel, and it would make it impossible for the President of the United States to protect this area using the Antiquities Act, all so a Chilean mining company can move forward with a dangerous mine next to one of our most pristine and special natural places.  Mr.Chairman, our public lands belong to all Americans, not simply to wealthy mining companies with the connections and the cash to try to overturn decisions they don't like through legislation. The company that we are talking about is challenging this decision to not renew their leases in court. That is the appropriate venue for that debate, not here in the Halls of We shouldn't rewrite the law to make sure that they get their way.  Even if the company wins the case, we should not be tying the Federal Government's hands to make sure that this mine gets developed, no matter what, instead of listening to the science. That is the wrong thing to do for any project like this, let alone one that sits right next to a unique and delicate wilderness like the Boundary  This bill is a blatant attempt to reward an individual foreign company at the expense of the American people and the American landscape, and I urge my colleagues to reject this legislation.

1735,topic-id,388,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, we have heard a lot about jobs. Jobs, this is going to be great job creator, this mine. I just want to highlight, though, some of the very inaccurate numbers that have been tossed around today.  The sponsor of the bill earlier today said that 10,000 jobs would be created. The majority's legislative analysis says that the bill will create 17,000 jobs, but that is not correct. That is not correct. Even the company behind the project doesn't claim that many jobs.  In their May 2017 fact sheet, and this is the fact sheet for Twin Metals of Minnesota, they report that once operational, they will directly employ 650 people and ``will create an estimated 1,300 spinoff jobs in other industries.'' That is 1,950 jobs. That is good, but that is a long way and a far cry from 10,000 or 17,000 jobs.  Let's also look at the down side. An economic study of the tourism industry in the region has shown that putting in a copper mine could result in the loss of nearly 5,000 direct jobs and up to 22,000 indirect jobs.  That is a terrible tradeoff, and that means that this mine is potentially a net job destroyer, not a creator.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to protect jobs and to oppose H.3905.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to make sure that my friends on the other side are aware of a simple fact, and that fact is very important in this debate: water flows downhill.  They make a big deal about the fact that no mining would take place in the Boundary Waters, but how happy would you be if someone dumped millions of gallons of toxic waste just uphill from your home and said not to worry because they didn't dump anything in your house?  These leases that we are talking about are right on the border of the Boundary Waters wilderness area. Take a look at this map. These red parts are the leases we are talking about. There is no gap.

As has been pointed out, northern Minnesota has had a long history of mining, but the mine that we are talking about here is not like any other mine in the This is a copper-sulfide mine. These types of mines are notorious for generating acid mine drainage.  As the Forest Service puts it: These mines are known worldwide for producing acid mine drainage that requires continuous management and perpetual water treatment.  Even in the absence of a major spill, having this acidic waste chronically leaking into the environment will create a problem that will last for generations and may never be fixed.  A study of 14 similar copper mines found that all but one had significant water quality impacts due to failures of the water collection and treatment systems from keeping the contamination from seeping out.  As was pointed out by the opposition, the majority, most of these mines are in dry areas of the American Southwest where there is far less water that needs to be treated than in a very wet environment like northern  The Forest Service also describes the specific threat that the Boundary Waters are under. They point out that there is ``a direct flow of water from these leases to the Boundary Waters, and that there is a high likelihood of acid mine drainage from these ores, and that the drainage from the mine is likely to be highly acidic.''

701,topic-id,485,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.Barr) for his continued commitment to issues surrounding the availability of affordable manufactured housing. He has been a patient champion on this and many other issues that impact Americans seeking access to mortgage financing.  The legislation we consider today amends the Truth in Lending Act to specify that a retailer of manufactured housing is not a ``mortgage originator'' subject to requirements under that act. Similarly, the bill specifies that such a retailer is generally not a ``loan originator.''  So what do we mean with regard to these technical concerns? They mean that more people in Missouri and Kentucky and every other State will have access to manufactured housing.  Certain regulations stemming from Dodd-Frank constricted credit for manufactured homes. This legislation would help consumers by restoring access to financing that is currently blocked.  If you want more access to credit, if you want more competition, you need to support this. What has happened is that the rules and regulations have constricted the ability of banks and credit unions to be able to make these kinds of loans.  Housing options in rural America aren't necessarily the same as those offered in other parts of the Our rural communities can face a severely limited affordable housing stock, making the availability of and financing for manufactured housing all the more important.  That may not be significant to every Member of this body, but it is certainly important to me and my constituents. Roughly 10 percent of them live in manufactured housing. It is important to the more than 20 million Americans living in manufactured housing today and the many Americans who will turn to manufactured housing to fulfill their housing needs.  As someone whose first home was actually a manufactured home, I can tell you that this is extremely important to lots and lots of people in communities in my district.  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have suggested this legislation will dilute consumer protections. In reality, this bill maintains consumer protections. H.1699 allows, for example, continued CFPB oversight of manufactured housing loans, requires that consumers be provided with the full litany of disclosure requirements, and maintains the ``ability to repay'' requirements established in Dodd-The idea that this legislation guts consumer protections, Mr.Speaker, is simply not true.  There has also been the charge that this legislation would help retailers that originate mortgages. To be clear, H.1699 does not exempt parties that are actual mortgage originators. If a retailer is compensated for acting as a mortgage originator, the legal requirements that apply to other mortgage originators will still apply to them after passage of this bill.  Manufactured housing provides not just a housing alternative, but an opportunity for individuals and families to become homeowners. This legislation ensures manufactured housing remains available and affordable, without eroding important consumer protections.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.

I don't think there is a person who has signed more bills in a bipartisan way with my Republican friends than I have--who has voted on more Republican bills or more Republican amendments than I have as a  I am really so frustrated. I thought that we could make this place work. That was my purpose in being here. I truly have done everything I possibly could. I reached out. The White House was kind enough to reach out to me. I sat down and I talked to all of the people who are in charge of writing this legislation from the White I sat down with my colleagues. I gave them some suggestions and ideas. We brought people together, thinking we could find a bipartisan way.  I will tell you, as I see it unfold tonight, this has been designed not to have even me, as one Democrat, on the bill, and I want to be. I want to be part of a reform for the first time in 30 years. I look back at Ronald He was a hero to all of us. He had 97 votes; 97 Senators voted for the legislation that he crafted. There were adjustments--a give-and-take. But every time, I would think, well, if I have some ideas, shouldn't you at least listen to me; listen to what we think?  Two days ago, we did a press conference. I invited all of my colleagues. I thought: Well, I and Senator Heitkamp from North Dakota and Senator Donnelly from Indiana--I knew the three of us would show up. I had 14 other colleagues who were craving to be involved; they wanted to be involved. I saw my good friend, Bob Corker, Senator Corker from I asked him: Can we have a few more days to look at this? That was denied.  I don't know what it is going to take. Maybe we have hit the proverbial wall. This is the first time I know of, in the history of the United States of America, that we have ever done this type of major reform without having a bipartisan objective for it. There is not one bipartisan vote on this piece of legislation, and I am looking; I have been looking and trying.  People have called me today from my home, asking: What have you seen? Do you like something? I said: I haven't seen that much. I am still trying to find the bill. I promised them: I will see something before I vote on it. I won't be able to read it, but I am going to see it. I want to see something.  I would love for us to take the time to sit down and work on this and see it. I think you would be surprised. I think not only could we get to 60, we could get above 60 votes on this, and that is what it should be.  In 2010, I thought my Democratic colleagues who voted for the Affordable Care Act with not one Republican on it were wrong. I thought that was wrong. I understand from the history--I wasn't here; I was a Governor at that time--[[Page S7683]]that at least they tried. They went through the markups. They went through the hearings. They had an awful lot of input. I understand that.  Still, I don't think any major legislation that affects every American should go through without a bipartisan buy-in, without bipartisan votes, without bipartisan support. If this is designed to be a political ploy--to basically have one side, and one side only, not wanting one Democratic vote--this will fail, and it is a shame for our country and for my colleagues.  I have made it a point that what I thought was broken in this place--I have never, ever campaigned against a sitting colleague. I have never campaigned against a fellow I have never made a phone call against a fellow I have never raised money to be spent to try to defeat a fellow Republican, my friends, because I don't think I could face them if I am trying to defeat them and then ask them to work with me. I have never done that nor will I ever do that. That is not my purpose for being here.  All I have asked for is to have the chance to work with my colleagues. That is all I have wanted to do.

1166,topic-id,1681,"Thank you, Mr. Mr.President, I rise in support of the motion of the Senator from He is sitting right at the heart of this issue, and that is that this is nothing more than a con game by the Republicans to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people and the wealthiest corporations in America and then, ultimately, to wind up with a huge addition to the Federal deficit.  I thought I would take this time just to explain to the American public what this whole concept of a reconciliation process is. It sounds like a very fancy word, ``reconciliation.'' What does it mean, though, in the legislative context?  You have to take it for what it is, and the key part of the words ``reconciliation plan,'' when we are dealing with the Republicans, is the word ``con'' because the whole thing is a con job that they are trying to pull on the American people.  Step 1 is for them to argue that they are going to give huge tax breaks to the wealthiest corporations and the wealthiest individuals in The vast, overwhelming percentage of it goes to them. Pennies on the dollar go to average working families as tax breaks.  Then they begin to argue that there is going to be a huge increase in economic growth in the United States, although they made the same argument in 1981 with the Reagan tax breaks, and it turned out it exploded the deficits. Then they made the same argument with the Bush tax breaks, and it exploded the Federal deficit. The economic growth, which they said was going to happen, never happened. Now they are just bringing it all back again--deja vu all over again--hoping that everyone will just buy the same, exact, now-debunked economic argument for the third time in our history.  So the key is, first, we provide the tax giveaways to the wealthiest--the wealthy corporations. That then results in exploding deficits. Then they say: Well, there may be some additions to it, but that is just a side impact. That is where they are extremely deceptive because, in fact, that is a feature of their tax breaks. A feature of their tax breaks is to create exploding deficits. How do we know that? Well, because the Republicans have already called for, in their budget, cuts in Medicare and They have already called for a $450 billion cut in They have already called for a $1 trillion cut in  The beauty of the Republican plan, to give all of these huge tax breaks to the wealthiest in America, is that it creates such a huge deficit that their elephant symbol is shedding crocodile tears about how big the deficit is going to become. Of course, that will be next year, when they are shocked at how needed it is to cut Medicare and But they have already given us the preview of coming attractions by putting it in their budget this year. This reconciliation game, this con job, tries to separate the tax breaks for the wealthiest from their brutal, vicious cuts to programs for the poorest, the sickest, the elderly, the neediest in our country. That is the game. That is the con game, the reconciliation game that they are playing with the American public. By trying to divide this story line, they seek to have it sneak through without any full understanding of the ramifications for the American people or the implications for their families.  Make no mistake about it, as they give the tax giveaways to the wealthiest, that will result in exploding deficits, which will result in the Republicans, once again, really caring about deficits. I will tell you an amazing thing about the Republican They care passionately, deeply, about deficits when the Democrats are in[[Page S7530]]charge. But when they are in charge, oh no, oh no. Do they care about deficits? Somehow they can turn a blind eye to their own actions, which lead to exploding deficits. There it is, ladies and gentlemen, the tribute that hypocrisy has to pay for virtue.  They have to say the right things about investment. They have to say that this will not lead to exploding additional debt for our country. But every single economic analysis of this bill, going back to the 1981 tax breaks, shows it is all the same play--a Trojan horse to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our country. That is what David Stockman actually said in 1985, in his famous book, ``The Triumph of Politics.'' When he looked back at the 1981 huge tax break for corporations and the wealthy, he said that actually the whole thing was a Trojan horse to get tax breaks for the upper 1 percentile. He was honest about it.  He also said another thing. He also said that ultimately the Republicans didn't have the nerve then to cut their own special projects or to stop advocating for massive increases in defense spending, which runs totally contrary to their ostensible goal of reducing the debt. So we are going to hear that. We are going to hear that. We are going to hear a request from Republicans for a massive increase in defense spending, along with their massive cuts in taxes, as though somehow or other they can get a balanced budget out of that.  You don't have to be an accountant or an expert on budgetary matters to figure out that does not add up--unless, ladies and gentlemen, they are going to cut Medicare, unless they are going to cut Medicaid, unless they are coming back for it again. If you kick them in the heart, you are going to break your toe.  That is what this is all about--giving away trillions of dollars to the wealthiest to create pressure on the programs for the poorest, for the sickest, for those most in need in nursing homes in our country. That is what it is all about, and, to boot, in order to get votes for their bill, they then say to their own Members: We are going to allow the oil industry to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--this pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--for oil, even as just 2 years ago they had advocated for lifting the ban on the exportation of oil from our country that had been on the books for 40 years and even as we still import 3 million barrels of oil a day from We are now exporting 1 million barrels of oil a day from our country. Where are they going to get it so they can send it out of the country to China? They are going to go to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, this pristine place.  So here is where the oil companies are right now. They are going to get huge tax breaks out of this bill. And in order to get even more votes on their side, they are going to allow for drilling in a pristine Arctic wildlife refuge.  In both cases, what is happening is that the next generation of Americans, regular Americans, is the one that is getting shortchanged. A despoliation of our environment, tax breaks that put inextricable, inevitable pressure on the social programs that go right to the heart of the safety net to protect ordinary family in our country--it is a con game, ladies and gentleman. It is a reconciliation con game that they are trying to play out here, and they do it time after time to kind of hide their real agenda.  All I can say is that what the Senator from Maine is proposing is for there to be just a little bit of honesty in terms of what the real agenda is here, and what his motion calls for is for the Finance Committee to ensure that there is no increase in the deficit in the bill we are going to vote on on the floor. But that will never pass because the Republicans have a con game going. All of a sudden, they don't care about deficits anymore. They don't care about debt. They don't care about the pressure that is going to be put on ordinary families. Who will be paying back this debt? Well, disproportionately, it is going to be the regular families in the country. They will be paying back that debt for the rest of their lives, and the debt is caused by giving tax breaks to the wealthiest. And to boot, it will then be the programs for those ordinary families that get slashed in order to pay for it because that is what is coming out here on the floor of the Senate in the very near future, this not-so-secret plan to actually fulfill their promise to the donor class of the Republican They have a sacred duty that they have pledged to their donor class to get them these tax breaks and to do so at the expense of Medicare and That is the simple deal here. That is the con job they are trying to perpetrate upon the American people.  That is why this vote is one of the most important votes in the history of the United States of There are no votes that are bigger than this. It goes right to the shape of capitalism. They are seeking to reshape capitalism as we know it--who gets the incentives to be productive in our society and who then has to pay for those incentives that are being created.  So, ladies and gentlemen, this momentous, historic moment is something that I hope every American reflects upon as we head into next year because the next stage is their all-out assault on Medicare and Medicaid and probably Social Security as well, if they are ever going to fulfill their commitment to their Republican base.  I thank the Senator from Maine for making this motion. I think it goes right to the heart of the debate that we need to have in this country.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

It has provided so many young immigrants safety, security, dignity, respect, and opportunity. These are young people who study, who work, who live next-door to us every single day. They are our friends, our neighbors, and our loved ones.  I would like to speak for a few minutes about one of these DACA beneficiaries. She is 28-year-old Paola Sanchez, who came to the United States from Bolivia when she was 14 years old. Paola's father passed away when she was just 8 years old. Her mother was in a wheelchair and was unable to work. With her family facing hardship, Paola came to America to live with an aunt and uncle in New There, Paola worked in the manufacturing industry while she attended high school full time. She often got home late at night and grabbed a few hours of sleep before getting up to head to school to do it all over again.  In 2007, Paola graduated from high school and moved to my State of Massachusetts, where she has lived ever since. She now works 30 hours a week as a case manager while attending Bay State Community College full time. She has been a model student, earning a 3.9 grade point average, and she hopes to enter nursing school in  Paola has been a DACA recipient since 2013, but her current status expires next year. This means that unless Congress acts and saves the program, Paola and thousands like her will have to leave the United States for countries they do not really know and no longer consider to be home.  Paola's case, like many others, is even more difficult because she has a 4-year-old son--a child who is an American citizen by birth and has never known any other home than the United  All Paola wants is to stay here with her son, get her nursing degree, get a good job, and give back to the country so much more than she has been given. Instead, Paola and countless other young people and families across the United States face uncertain futures. Instead of going to sleep tonight knowing they will be able to live their lives in peace and plan for the future, they are left with uncertainty, vulnerable to deportation, and unable to work legally. This is a human tragedy in the making. It is heartbreaking, it is unjust, and it is just plain wrong. We should not punish these young people who have no other home than the United States of We should not go back on the word we gave when[[Page S7856]]we told these young people to come out of the shadows.  These Dreamers are engineers, police officers, teachers, future nurses, and students, many in our great Massachusetts colleges and universities. They serve bravely in our military. They are our best and brightest and are making the most of the opportunities that the United States has always provided to immigrant communities.  The ball is in the court of the Republican leadership in the House and Speaker Paul Ryan and Leader Mitch McConnell can listen to a growing chorus of their own colleagues and to business CEOs, including those at Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, General Motors, and to academic leaders, countless college and university presidents, all of whom support DACA--or they can side with the forces of intolerance and injustice.  Congress should pass the Dream Act so that people, like Paola, who were brought here at a young age and who have served in the military or pursued higher education can earn citizenship.  I urge everyone to listen to Dick Durbin, to listen to this chorus of voices from around our country. Protect these 800,000 young people. Protect them because they deserve it, and America will be the beneficiary of these great Americans who are serving our country right now.

1457,topic-id,1350,"Madam President, last year, Chairman Pai, of the Federal Communications Commission, threatened to take a weed whacker to the FCC's net neutrality rules. On December 14, Chairman Pai and the FCC are likely to make good on that promise. Last week, they issued their plan. They are quite proud of it. Chairman Pai is very proud of their plan. They got that done last week. Then, on December 14, they are going to execute their plan to execute the net neutrality rules of our country.  Net neutrality applies the principles of nondiscrimination to the internet world, ensuring that broadband providers--America's internet gatekeepers--do not block, slow down, or prioritize internet traffic. In 2015, the FCC correctly adopted the open internet order, enshrining these net neutrality principles into law, but now net neutrality and the free and open internet--this diverse, dynamic, democratic platform--are under attack.  Here is what Chairman Pai is proposing. 1, he would gut the rule against blocking. What does that mean? It means an internet service provider could block any website it wants. It could block something just because it decided to. That includes a website of a competing service or a website with a contrary political view. Whatever they want, they can block. The biggest companies--Comcast, AT&T--they can just block it.  2, Chairman Pai would gut the rule against throttling. What does that mean? That means the internet service provider could slow down any website it wants.  3, Chairman Pai would gut the rule banning paid prioritization. What does that mean in easy-to-understand language? That means the internet service provider could charge websites for an internet fast lane--meaning those websites would load quicker, while websites that can't afford the internet ``EZ pass'' would be stuck on a gravel path, taking more time to load and frustrating consumers with long buffering times.  4, Chairman Pai would gut the forward-looking general conduct rule. What does that mean in easy-to-understand language? That means whatever discriminatory conduct ISPs think of next in the coming months or years would be perfectly legal.  5, Chairman Pai would create an unregulated interconnection market. What does that mean, an unregulated interconnected market? In plain English, it means the Federal Communications Commission would lose authority to oversee places where the internet service providers connect to the internet and extract fees.  6, Chairman Pai would prevent States and localities from adopting their own net neutrality protections. If you live in Massachusetts or you live in California or you live in Alabama,[[Page S7325]]your State can't give you any protections. They can't say: Here's how we want the internet to be operating.  What will replace these enforceable net neutrality rules? Chairman Pai will leave it to the internet service providers--to the big companies we all subscribe to--to regulate themselves. We will just put them on the honor system. We know the broadband industry--your cable, your wireless or telecommunications provider--cannot regulate themselves. They struggle to even show up on time to install or fix your service. Do we really trust the broadband industry to resist leveraging their internet gatekeeper role and putting their online competitors at an unfair disadvantage? Of course not.  What is Chairman Pai's silver lining in light of gutting all of these rules? He has proposed to keep some transparency rules, requiring the internet service providers--these broadband behemoths--to disclose their practices to consumers. What good is transparency when most Americans have little or no choice for high-speed broadband access? After all, 62 percent of Americans have one choice for high-speed fixed broadband. If a household's only choice for high-speed broadband is transparent about its plans to set up internet fast and slow lanes, the consumer has two choices: accept the internet provider's terms or live without the internet. That is not a real choice at all. People are not going to be living without the internet in the 21st century. You are going to pay whatever that company tells you, you are going to pay.  It is clear that most Americans do not want what the FCC is proposing. A record number of people--over 22 million--made their voices heard at the Americans know the internet--the world's greatest platform for commerce and communications--is at stake. Consider that, today, essentially every company is an internet company. In 2016, almost half of the venture capital funds invested in this country went toward internet-specific and software companies. That is $25 billion of investment. To meet America's insatiable demand for broadband internet, U.broadband and telecommunications industry companies invested more than $87 billion in capital expenditures in 2015. That is the highest rate of annual investment in the last 10 years.  We have hit the sweet spot. Investment in broadband and wireless technologies is high. Job creation is high. Venture capital investment in online startups is high. With these net neutrality protections in place, there is no problem that needs fixing, but under Chairman Pai's plan, broadband providers get exactly what they want--an unregulated Wild West where they can set up internet fast and slow lanes.  Chairman Pai proposes to have the FCC completely abdicate its rightful role to oversee telecommunications networks under title II of the Communications Chairman Pai claims that the FTC--the Federal Trade Commission--provides a sufficient backstop to discriminatory behavior by the big broadband companies. That is simply not true.  Under the Federal Trade Commission regime, the big broadband barons would establish their own net neutrality policies, and if the internet service provider wants to block websites, slow down the competitors' content, or charge innovators and entrepreneurs to reach their customers, they will be free to do so. That is because the Federal Trade Commission can only step in if a broadband provider violates its own net neutrality policies, but what if the internet service provider has a written policy that charges websites for internet fast lanes? There is nothing the Federal Trade Commission can do about it because the broadband baron told you what they are going to do. They were transparent about what they were going to do, but you just have no recourse whatsoever going to the Federal Trade It is a false promise of protection that Chairman Pai is presenting.  The only way to protect a free and open internet is with strong net neutrality rules of the road, not voluntary guidelines. Chairman Pai's proposal would put the future of a free and open internet in the hands of big corporations and the powerful few at the expense of ordinary consumers all across our country. Our consumers will be tipped upside down and have money shaken out of their pockets because they will not have the protection of net neutrality provisions that are now the law but are soon to be wiped off of the law.  The Trump administration is waging an all-out assault on our core protections: the Affordable Care Act, the Paris climate accord, the Clean Power Now Trump's Federal Communications Commission has net neutrality in their sights. For all of those who rely on the free and open internet--whether it is for commerce, education, healthcare, entertainment--I urge you all to rise up and create a firestorm of opposition to this assault on net neutrality. This goes to the fundamental principles of nondiscrimination online. This is the greatest engine for commercial job development our country has ever seen. It is the engine for new companies to be started. It is the way in which young people are able to disrupt established companies, to take new concepts that create jobs but also benefit consumers across our country. That is the opportunity this represents, and it is also a powerful force for democracy, for everyone's voice being heard equally. That is what net neutrality is about. That is what the Trump-Chairman Pai Federal Communications Commission is about to end, and that is why we must fight. That is why I am so proud to be standing as part of this effort with our great ranking member of the Commerce Committee, Senator Bill Nelson from the State of Florida, because this is a fight worth having.

1767,topic-id,468,"Mr.Speaker, as a practicing obstetrician and gynecologist for 25 years, I certainly had a very unique perspective of many of the unique challenges faced by women in the workplace.  For many women, I would see them once a year and, in a very casual greeting, ask them how they were and what was new. Once in a while, a woman would have a new job, and I would ask her: ``You had a great job. Why did you leave that?'' Too often, the answer was because of sexual harassment.  Now, as a United States Congressman, I think it is important that I do more than just listen to these constituents of mine.

172,topic-id,785,"Mr.President, I am here to support the motion offered by Senator Cantwell, to speak out against a tax bill that is nothing short of highway robbery on New  This tax plan is about one thing. It is about cutting taxes for wealthy corporations and asking working families to pay for it. It is especially bad for middle-class families in New Jersey, New York, Washington, Maryland, and other high-earning States that make bold investments in education, that drive the most innovation, that generate the most Federal revenue.  Don't let the Republicans fool you if they airdrop an amendment at the last minute that throws a few crumbs at New Jersey families and call it a victory. Carve-outs, caps, and exceptions are nothing but gimmicks meant to distract the public from what is really going on. No matter how you slice it, gutting or even limiting the State and local tax deduction is a direct assault on middle-class families in America's highest earning, most economically productive By gutting the SALT deduction, Republicans will literally force millions of middle-class families across America to pay taxes on their taxes.  In 2015 alone, nearly 1.8 million New Jersey households deducted a combined $32 billion in State, local, and property taxes from their Federal tax bill. These families aren't living large. They are middle-class folks who had to work hard for every dollar they have. In fact, IRS data shows that more than 85 percent of taxpayers who claim the SALT deduction make under $200,000 a year and over half make under $100,000 a year. So it is wrong to ask millions of Americans who had to fight their way into the middle class to pay more just[[Page S7663]]so big corporations can pay less, and rubbing salt in their wounds is the fact that Republicans let corporations keep on deducting their State and local taxes on top of the huge tax cuts lavished on them by this tax plan.  If deducting State and local taxes is so important for big corporations that make billions of dollars each year, Republicans should understand why it is so important for middle-class families in cities and suburbs across That is why I am offering this motion with Senator Cantwell to send the bill back to committee to fix this fatal flaw and restore the SALT deduction. If it is good enough for huge corporations, it should be good enough for middle-class families.  I have heard many of my Republican colleagues complain about the SALT deduction as if it is some subsidy for States like New Jersey, and that hypocrisy is just amazing to me. Far from subsidizing successful States like New Jersey or New York, the SALT deduction actually benefits the entire Nation, which is able to share in the economic rewards created by the high-powered economies of States like New Jersey, and now Republicans want to take even more. Well, we are sick and tired of it, and we want our money back.  I will make a deal with any Republican from a taker Since you are so opposed to subsiding other States, how about you take all of the extra Federal dollars you receive beyond what you pay and transfer it back to donor States like New Jersey? Sound like a deal? I don't think so.  Each and every year, States like New Jersey, New York, and Virginia generate billions of dollars in Federal revenue that go to Americans in less productive, lower income States that are more reliant, more dependent on Federal spending. They are America's economic powerhouses, America's donor States, precisely because they invest in public education, law enforcement, mass transit, infrastructure, and economic opportunity for all.  It is no surprise that everyone from the Fraternal Order of Police to the American Hospital Association, to AARP support keeping the State and local tax deduction. Taking it away is a direct threat to the funding States need to educate our kids, keep cops on the beat, equip first responders and firefighters, and provide healthcare to the most vulnerable--all this just to give big corporations big tax cuts.  If multinational corporations get to keep deducting their State and local taxes, there is no reason to stop millions of middle-class Americans from doing the same. Make no mistake, any reduction in the State and local tax deduction is a direct assault on America's highest earning, most innovative, most economically productive Guess what. All Americans will lose out when America's economic powerhouse States aren't so powerful anymore.

1248,topic-id,2572,"Mr.President, this tax bill is truly astounding. Only in Washington--only in Washington--could Republicans borrow $1 trillion from China to fund massive tax cuts for big corporations and still need to raise taxes on millions of Americans in order to pay for it.  Look, I understand my Republican friends are in a pickle. They need to give President Trump a win. The problem is that this White House is asking them to pass a tax plan built on the most unpopular policies in America, and I think my colleagues know it.  They know that after all the American people have been through--the financial crisis, the great recession, decades of wage stagnation, soaring education, housing and healthcare costs--after all of this hardship, cutting taxes for corporations, taking healthcare away from 13 million people, and raising taxes on the middle class aren't exactly a recipe for winning the hearts of voters, let alone a strategy for building a more dynamic, inclusive, and prosperous economy for all  So, yes, Republicans are in a tough spot. They know that if we had a sensible campaign finance system, policies this disastrous would spell disaster for them in 2018. That is why they designed a tax bill that has nothing to do with simplifying our Tax Code and nothing to do with growing the wages of American workers.  I appreciate my friend from Alaska talking about growth. I am all for growth. But first of all, I want to see growth in American wages, and it is really hard to have growth when you take $1 trillion, or more, and add it to the debt of the next generation and think that you are going to have growth when you are saddling them with greater and greater debt. This bill has nothing to do with creating jobs and everything to do with pleasing corporate special interests that fund their campaigns.  That is what brings us here today. That is how Senate Republicans are on the verge of trying to pass massive tax cuts for corporations that will be permanent. They don't have to worry about it. They will be permanent--paid for, however, by raising taxes on working families and saddling our children and grandchildren with trillions in debt.  I know some at home might wonder: How does the GOP get away with parading this bill around as a middle-class tax cut? It is because they are using smoke and mirrors to dupe you into thinking you are getting something of a tax cut. These so-called deficit hawks passed a budget that gives themselves permission to add $1.5 trillion to the national debt by 2026--only a short 9 years from now--so long, however, as they don't add a dime to our deficit the year after, in 2027. Isn't it nice if you can be at home and give yourself permission to go ahead and add an enormous amount of debt and not worry about it? That is what they do.  Here is the problem. It is damn near impossible to permanently slash the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent without hiking taxes on millions of average people. I call it inconvenient math. That is why Republicans offer some families tiny, temporary--I underline ``temporary''--tax relief without owning up to the fact that Cinderella's chariot turns into a pumpkin really fast.  By 2019, Americans who make under $30,000 a year will be financially worse off under this plan. By 2021, Americans earning $40,000 a year will be worse off. By 2027, anyone earning less than $75,000 a year will get hit.  I will admit, they found some pretty clever ways to pull off this con job. First, they end the State and local tax deduction and force millions of hard-working middle-class families in States like New Jersey to pay taxes twice on the same money. These families aren't high rollers. In fact, 83 percent of New Jerseyans who claim the State and local tax deduction make under $200,000 a year. As a matter of fact, nearly half of them make under $100,000 a year. I will say it again. Ending the State and local tax deduction is like one giant hit job on middle-class families in States like New My constituents can't afford to subsidize the rest of the country any more than they already do.  Speaking about some of these comments early, earlier this evening, the junior Senator from Pennsylvania said on the Senate floor that the State and local tax deduction is a subsidy to States like New York and New He said: ``I don't know how it could be possibly fair to force my constituent who lives in, say, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, why they should pay more in income taxes to subsidize somebody who gets to live in a multimillion-dollar condo in the Upper West Side of Manhattan.'' That hypocrisy is amazing to me. Far from subsidizing successful States like New Jersey and New York, there are States that are actually taker They get more than they send to the Federal In fact, according to the Rockefeller Foundation, on average, each resident of Pennsylvania takes nearly $1,500 per year in Federal benefits more than they pay in Federal taxes.  Even if the Rockefeller Foundation is wrong, let me read part of a letter sent by some of the very county executives and elected officials who represent Dauphin Here is part of a letter they sent to their representatives: As county elected executives representing Pennsylvania's counties, we are writing to express our deep concerns with proposals to eliminate deductions for State and local taxes as the primary funding offset for Federal tax reform.  They go on to say: Across the State--meaning Pennsylvania--more than 1.8 million households claimed the State and local tax deduction for a total of $32.24 billion. We are particularly concerned that the loss of the State and local tax deduction will harm middle-class homeowners and overall property values. Without the State and local tax deduction, our taxpayers, Pennsylvania taxpayers, would be doubly taxed. Such a policy is contrary--I am reading from their letter--to the intentions of our Founding Fathers and overturns the precedent set in the Civil War income tax imposed by President Lincoln and again in the original Federal Tax Code of 1913. There is strong rationale why the State and local taxes are included as one of the original six Federal tax deductions. Simply put, the State and local tax deduction is not a special loophole but instead a core principle of fiscal federalism that should be preserved.  That is the letter. There is more. It is signed by a series of individuals who are elected representatives in Pennsylvania, including those who represent Dauphin  Every year, successful blue-chip States like New Jersey, New York, and Virginia contribute billions of dollars in tax revenue that goes to Americans in less productive, lower income Now Republicans are trying to take even more. We are sick and tired of it, and we want our money back.  In fact, I will make a deal with you. Since you claim to not support States subsidizing other States, how about you send all of the Federal tax dollars you receive above and beyond what all of your taxpayers paid to the Federal Government and you transfer that back to my State of New Jersey? I will make that deal with you right now. Sound like a deal? I didn't think so.  Here is another thing that really ticks me off. It is the sneaky, secret tax hikes Republicans buried in this bill that bilk billions of dollars from Americans' paychecks in the next two decades. Again, we know why they have to do it. Even after borrowing $2 trillion from China, there is no way to pay for permanent corporate tax cuts without taking a bigger cut from American workers. Boy, have they found a sneaky way to do it. It is the most complicated, convoluted, boring tax increase in history, but, boy, it takes $500 billion out of American paychecks and sends it straight into the coffers of multinational corporations. That is really something to be proud of. It is called the Chained It seems like a tiny tweak to how the government measures the cost of living. It is something we call inflation.[[Page S7552]]  Here is the thing about inflation. Ask any American walking down the street if their wages have kept pace with rising costs, and they will laugh in your face. They will tell you that their incomes have barely budged, while everything from the cost of milk to college tuition gets more expensive every year.  What if the government pretended that the rising costs weren't such a hardship? That is what we call the Chained CPI tax increase. Don't take it from me; take it from a Republican tax hero, Grover Here is what he had to say about this very provision, Chained CPI, in 2013. He said:       This is one of those things invented by people who are      trying to raise taxes and pretend they're not. If you change      the law to get more money, that's a tax increase--doesn't      matter how you do it or what you call it.  We all expect to pay a little more in taxes if we get a big raise at work. Now Republicans want you to pay more in taxes even if you don't get a raise. Each year, more of your income, under this provision, will be taxed in higher brackets, at the very same time your deductions and tax credits slowly lose their value. It is a clever way for the government to shave a bit more off your paycheck every year, even if your income hasn't risen in years. It is a Republican tax on wage stagnation and a Republican tax on the millennial generation. That is right--millennials are just now entering their prime earning years, and apparently they haven't had it hard enough, not after the great recession, not after drowning them in student loan debt. That is what Congress really is doing--stick it to the millennials so that the Koch brothers can get a nice tax cut.  The American people deserve to know the big lie at the heart of the Trump tax plan. The meager tax cuts for families are written in disappearing ink, while the sneaky tax hikes are carved into stone. It is the Republican majority's dirty little secret--the secret that even after borrowing $2 trillion from China, they can't permanently cut taxes for corporations without hiking taxes on millions of middle-class Americans and millions more who dream of becoming middle class. We have heard this all before--wild claims about tax cuts for the rich trickling down to working families. The truth is, they never do.  I was in the House of Representatives when Congress passed the Bush tax cuts. I opposed taking the historic surplus that President Clinton had created to be used by President Bush--which he inherited and squandered it on tax cuts, 27 percent of which went to the top 1 percent of That is chump change compared to the 60-plus percent that goes to the wealthy in the Trump tax plan.  By 2027, Americans who make $40,000 to $50,000 a year will pay a combined $5.3 billion more in taxes, while those who make millions get a $5.8 billion cut--pretty close. Americans making $40,000 to $50,000 a year pay a combined $5.3 billion more in taxes. Those who make millions get a $5.8 billion cut. There you have it. Republicans are A-OK with wealth redistribution so long as it is taking it from working families and giving it to the richest 1 percent.  That 60-percent number doesn't include the death blow this plan delivers to the Affordable Care Act, the financial cost to families when 13 million Americans lose their healthcare coverage and everyone else gets saddled with higher premiums.  Meanwhile, some Republicans are openly admitting that this tax bill will be the first shot fired in their race to dismantle Social Security, Medicaid, and In fact, the Congressional Budget Office--the nonpartisan scoring division for the Congress--already said that these tax cuts will trigger huge, multibillion-dollar cuts to And that is not the only way this bill screws over America's seniors. According to the AARP, 5.2 million seniors will face higher taxes in the next decade. Think about that--asking seniors who have given this country a lifetime of hard work to pay for corporate tax cuts.  We know what corporations do with those tax cuts. During the Bush tax holiday in 2005, the Republicans promised big gains for workers, but corporations didn't bring the billions of dollars they stashed offshore back home so they could build new factories or create millions of new jobs or pay their workers better wages. The lion's share of that windfall went to just two things: higher pay for CEOs and kickbacks for their investors on Wall  I am not sure why White House adviser Gary Cohn seemed so surprised the other day when so few CEOs who were before him said that they used the tax cuts to invest in American jobs. He asked for a show of hands. Only a couple raised their hands. Does anyone actually believe things will be different this time? Of course not.  How do we know? It is because, unlike my Republican friends in Congress, corporations cannot lie to their shareholders about what they plan to do with $1 trillion in tax cuts. Their CEOs are openly admitting this windfall will go straight to Wall That is why I have been pushing for changes to this tax bill that would take away these big corporate tax cuts if workers don't see bigger paychecks. Of course, that is not what Republicans have in mind.  This tax plan has nothing to do with helping hard-working families get ahead in New Jersey and across It is not about helping folks who have good jobs but still live paycheck to paycheck. It is about one thing--cutting taxes permanently for big corporations that are raking in record profits and just straight-out refusing to pay their workers decent wages. It is about cutting taxes for trust fund kids who were born on third base and think they hit a triple. It is about paving the way for massive cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and Social It is about bankrupting States of the resources they need to invest in education, in infrastructure, in public health, and in creating the growth for opportunity for all.  These are the backward priorities of this legislation--tax cuts for big corporations and wealthy campaign donors that are paid for by taking bigger cuts out of workers' paychecks and saddling our grandchildren, like my granddaughter, Evangelina, with $2 trillion in debt.  The only people who will come out on top from this legislation are those who are already sitting at the very top. So much for draining the swamp. This is about as mucky as it gets. I hope my colleagues come to their senses and put the brakes on this terrible tax bill.  We can have tax reform--tax reform that is bipartisan, tax reform that can be permanent, tax reform that creates stability, tax reform that creates growth not just for companies but growth for American workers' wages, and that creates a better economy for all. This deal is a bad deal for the American people, and they deserve much better.  I yield the floor.

1645,topic-id,1336,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today painfully aware of the many reasons to oppose this reckless, wasteful Republican tax plan. It is a shame because I still believe we need smart tax reform that puts working families and small businesses first and that prepares America to compete in the 21st century, but that is not what we will be voting on this week.  We are voting on the Trump tax plan this week--a plan Republicans hope to ram through the Senate with a simple majority vote, 51 votes. With 51 votes, Republicans will raise taxes on millions of middle-class families and those working to join the middle class. With 51 votes, Republicans will hand huge tax cuts to big corporations with no strings attached and no guarantees that workers will see higher wages. With 51 votes, they will take healthcare coverage away from 13 million Americans and hike premiums for everyone else. With 51 votes, they will saddle our children and our grandchildren--like my new grandchild--with another $1.5 trillion in debt.  Now, any one of these reasons is reason enough to oppose the Trump tax plan, but, for me, as the senior Senator from New Jersey--a State of nearly 9 million people, a State with the eighth most productive economy in America--I cannot and will not support a tax bill that reads like one giant hit job on New Jersey's middle class.  Just how bad is the Trump tax plan for New Jersey? Well, take the House version--which is a bill so awful that 11 out of 12 Members of Congress from New Jersey voted against it, many of them Republicans--take that plan and make it worse in the The Senate bill is worse because it totally eliminates the State and local tax deduction, otherwise known as the SALT deduction.  Even President Trump's external economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, recently said ending the SALT deduction will hurt ``a lot of different people,'' and a lot of these people who will get hurt live in States like New  In 2015 alone, nearly 1.8 million New Jersey households deducted a combined $17 billion in State and local taxes from their Federal tax bills, and over 1.5 million New Jersey homeowners with sky-high property taxes deducted nearly $15 billion that same year. These taxpayers aren't high rollers. They are middle-class families who had to work hard to achieve the American dream. In fact, tax data tells us that 83 percent of New Jerseyans who claim the State and local tax deduction make under $200,000 a year, and about half of those make under $100,000 a year. So the families who get hurt live in every corner of our State--from Ocean County, where it will cost taxpayers $1.3 billion, to Burlington County, where it will cost taxpayers $1.37 billion, to Passaic County, where it will cost taxpayers $1.16 billion in deductions. That is wrong. It is just plain wrong to ask these hard-working families--folks who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth, who had to work hard for every dollar they have, who had to fight their way into the middle class--it is wrong to ask them to pay more just so big corporations pay less, and do so permanently, and those born to multimillion-dollar inheritances pay nothing at all.  Ending the State and local tax deduction will literally force New Jersey families to pay taxes twice on the same money, and rubbing salt in their wounds is the fact that Republicans let corporations keep on deducting their State and local taxes on top of the huge tax cuts lavished on them by the Trump tax plan.  If protecting the State and local tax deduction is so important for big corporations that make billions of dollars a year, surely my Republican colleagues can imagine how important it is for a middle-class family in a State like New Jersey to keep it.  Quite frankly, I am sick and tired of Congress treating States like New Jersey as America's piggy bank. My constituents already pay too much in taxes. New Jerseyans can't afford to subsidize the rest of America more than we already do. Yet Republicans now want to dig even deeper into the wallets of New Jersey's middle class with the Trump tax plan. To borrow an old phrase as you come into New Jersey from the Lower Trenton Bridge: ``What New Jersey makes, the GOP takes.''  Some have speculated that this tax bill was designed to punish Americans who live in so-called blue Certainly, I don't know, but I wouldn't put it past an administration as cynical as this one to punish States that voted against Trump in the 2016 election, but ultimately this isn't about red States or blue It is time we start calling these States what they really are. These aren't blue They are America's blue-chip They are America's innovation States, America's economic powerhouse  States like New Jersey are home to millions of makers, not takers, and we are proud of it, but our success didn't happen overnight. It didn't happen by accident. New Jersey's success is predicated on our priorities and our investments. New Jersey is a donor State precisely because we invest in public schools and higher education so New Jerseyans continue driving innovation in fields like biotechnology, agriculture, and medicine.  New Jersey is a donor State precisely because we invest in mass transit and infrastructure so workers can commute to high-paying jobs, whether in New York City or Philadelphia or in the financial district in places like Jersey City and Hoboken, and family and friends in nearby States can easily travel to the Jersey  New Jersey is a donor State precisely because we invest in public health and law enforcement because we are stronger when we have safe communities and a healthy workforce. In fact, the Fraternal Order of Police says ending the State and local tax deduction will hurt States' ability to ``recruit the men and women that keep us safe.'' That is their quote.  In short, New Jersey is a donor We see the States ranked by their deduction, their per capita income, their education rank. There is a correlation. It is a donor State because we believe in opening the doors of opportunity to as many people as possible. That is how a small State like New Jersey continues to punch above its weight economically to the benefit of all Americans and especially the Americans who live in less productive States that are more reliant on Federal spending.  For more than a century, the State and local tax deduction has encouraged[[Page S7387]]States to invest in education and infrastructure and opportunity for all. It is ironic that Republicans, who talk so much about supporting the States, want to single out those like New Jersey, Virginia, and Massachusetts that invest in the middle class. That is why Senator Cantwell and I will be introducing an amendment to protect the State and local property tax deduction, and I hope a majority of our colleagues see the value in that.  For as long as I can remember, I heard my colleagues on the Republican side talk about protecting--not punishing--success. No matter how you slice it, ending, limiting, or capping State and local tax deduction is a massive tax on the success of States like New  The Trump tax plan will raise taxes on millions of middle-class families across America, not in a few years, not in a decade--immediately.  I refuse to support a tax bill that enriches the few at the expense of the many, that saddles our children with trillions of debt, that sets the stage for Republican cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security because when that debt rises, the next thing we will hear is we have to deal with the entitlements--but not entitlements given to corporations permanently--and that punishes the success of millions of hard-working, middle-class families in States like New That is not something I am willing to do.

228,topic-id,444,"Mr.President, I thank my senior colleague from Oregon for his leadership in this debate on these important tax provisions. There is so much at stake here for the future of our society as we have been debating what we see as one provision after another that is designed to make the richest Americans richer while increasing the taxes on some 87 million middle-class Then, we get this nice, little list. Republicans have given the lobbyists a list of 30 special interest provisions, circulated it, and said: This is what we are going to put in our managers' amendment for all of you.  My colleague from South Carolina was speaking a moment ago about one that hasn't even been filed--life insurance provisions. What is that? Maybe my colleague would like to come to the floor and explain it and explain why this is being circulated to lobbyists, to the swamp, instead of to the Members of the U.Thirty of these provisions--who knows what all is in this. Isn't there any form of transparency or integrity left in this Chamber in terms of legislative debate? Have the American people had a chance to see this list? It is online now. The few who might be listening in might be able to see these titles, but this is not the way to do business in the U.This is not the way to do the people's business. This is the way to do the swamp's business.  What happened to clearing the swamp? What happened to that? How is it that the richest Americans are making out like bandits rather than the middle class doing well under this bill? Why is that? Why are there billions of dollars going to the richest Americans by eliminating the alternative minimum tax? Why are there hundreds of billions of dollars going in other provisions, including changing the upper limit tax brackets, including the passthroughs for affluent, highly successful LLCs? How about that?  What is this list, and why haven't the American people seen all of the details about it? This type of chicanery is inappropriate. Take and give the list to the Members of the Senate, not to K This close partnership between the Republican majority and K Street, filling them in, doing those special favors, and not even filling in the body here so we can have a conversation about each of these items, this is absolutely a horrific way to do business.

273,topic-id,808,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from I would like him to know that I will only take about 5 minutes because I want to make sure my colleagues can speak during this period.  I am rising now to ask the senior Senator from Texas to come and explain his amendment that has been incorporated in the package. This, I believe, earlier was his amendment 1715, and we are hearing that 1712 was included as well. This is something that might be characterized as the Wall Street welfare amendment. We are not sure exactly how it works. We are not sure exactly how much it costs. But that is not the point. If you are going to stick something into the underlying bill to benefit very powerful groups like Apollo and Carlisle and Blackstone, you don't just airdrop it in at the last second, this provision for the most powerful. Come to the floor, lay out the details, and defend your amendment and why it should be included in this bill.  Our basic understanding is that it enables publicly traded partnerships to be able to have their funds pass through so there is no corporate tax since they benefit from a lower rate for those passthroughs. But we have only had a few seconds to look at it. What does it really do? What does it really cost? I ask the Senator to come to the floor and explain all of the details. The American people have a right to know what you are sticking in this bill. Explain your Wall Street welfare amendment and why we should support it or not.[[Page S7686]]  We have $4 trillion going to the richest Four trillion? We keep hearing about a $1.5 trillion deficit. Oh, yes, but there is lot more here, so let's just see what it is.  There is the reduction in the corporate tax rate, which we all know goes to the richest Americans who hold all the stocks. That is $1.3 trillion.  We have repeal of the alternative minimum tax. That is $770 billion.  We have the passthrough for high-end LLCs--not for low-end LLCs but for high-end LLCs--$362 billion.  We have three provisions for multinationals, a deduction for foreign dividends, a deduction for foreign intangibles, and the transfers for intellectual properties, totaling $313 billion.  We have an elimination of the estate tax to benefit the richest 0.2 percent. Out of a total of 1,000 people in America, the richest two--that is the equivalent. That 0.2 percent would get $83 billion.  Then we have a change in the tax brackets, which added another over $1 trillion there. And probably most of that--we have been trying to get a breakout. We can't even get a breakout of where this will go because it is being rushed through.  If we take those provisions and add them up, it is $4 trillion. I am just taking the big ones off the list of all of the details.  Little public exposure. Why is this being done in a few hours here, just after the Thanksgiving holiday, before Christmas? Because my Republican colleagues are sticking it to the American people, and they don't want you to know.  So, again, an example--out of this list of 30 amendments that are being stuffed in at the last second that no one has had the ability to analyze--30 amendments--let's have the senior Senator from Texas come to the floor and defend his Wall Street welfare amendment that he is sticking in here for the most powerful publicly traded partnerships. That is just one of 30.  So I am calling for transparency. I am calling this process for what it is, and that is using the argument that you are doing something for the middle class in order to cover up these trillions of dollars going to the very richest. Let's see how misplaced this is.  In the next year, 9 million taxpayers together at the bottom would get about 50 cents a day in tax relief--two quarters. That is what you do for the 90 million taxpayers who are most in need in America, two quarters a day. What does this bill do for those who earn more than $1 million? It gives them over $1,000 a week. So $1,000 a week for the rich and mighty; two thin quarters a day for the folks at the bottom.  It even gets worse than that. By the end of the tax period, what are those people earning less than $50,000 doing? They are paying $23 billion into the Federal Treasury, but what are those who are earning more than $1 million doing? They are taking out $5 billion. So the poor are paying in while the rich are taking out. You call this middle-class tax relief? I call this a tax scam.  The PRESIDING The time has expired.

We saw a healthcare debate where my colleagues across the aisle wanted to rip healthcare from 20 to 30 million hard-working Americans in order to deliver tax benefits to the very richest among us. Fortunately, we were able to stop that.  We have heard conversation here on the floor about the arbitration fairness regulation, which said that nobody should be forced into an arbitration when the other side gets to hire the judge, gets to promise the judge future business, and gets to determine the outcome of the decision. Yet my colleagues across the aisle voted for the powerful to be able to have this fixed system to cheat the consumers of  Then most recently we had this question on the Consumer Financial Protection The people of the United States love the fact that we finally have an organization that fights for them in fairness and financial deals so that predatory lending would be brought to a halt. But my colleagues on the other side of this spectrum said: Let's support the appointment of someone to run this who wants to tear down that organization so there will no longer be the protection for people.  Time and time again, within just a few weeks, my colleagues across the aisle have said: We are for the powerful to crush the people. Well, we are fighting for the people, and now we are fighting for the people on this horrendous tax legislation.  I have come to the floor to be with my colleague from Minnesota to point out some of the worst provisions of this bill, and I turn to her for her opening comments.

The Republicans, in this bill, are standing for the unfair double taxation of It is absolutely wrong, and it is a big deal.  The average deduction in Oregon among those who use the SALT deduction is about $12,000. That is a very significant factor. That means their taxes are going to go up.

1203,topic-id,314,"Mr.President, yet another terrible provision in this bill is the dynasty loophole.  Now, in a bill that the Republicans are saying is targeted at the middle class, why would you give $269 billion to the richest 0.2 percent of Americans? Envision a room with 1,000 people in it, pick out the 2 richest people, and give them $269 billion. That is what this bill does.  Now, this dynasty loophole is a way for the richest Americans to bypass ever paying capital gains, as they pass their wealth from one generation to the next. It is an enormous tax dodge, but if you or I sell a property while we are alive, we have to pay capital gains on it. The rich don't need to sell property over the course of their lives; they can simply hold it to the end of their life and pass it on to the next generation, never paying capital gains, and the next generation gets it marked up to market rate so that can never be recovered.  What we are talking about here is a principle that the early American Founders really detested. They had seen in Europe that very rich families could pass on wealth from one generation to the next and could control power in the country. That was the vision of government by and for the powerful, accentuated by the passage of vast wealth from one generation to the next. The Americans said: We want a different form of government, one which empowers decisions to make every family thrive; give them a chance, every family, to succeed.  That is the vision of ``We the People,'' and that is the opposite of this dynasty loophole.  I dare a single Republican to come to this floor and explain how giving $269 billion to the richest 0.2 percent of Americans has anything to do with helping the middle class.

1295,topic-id,1169,"Mr.President, I am rising to engage in the conversation about getting the Dream Act passed. I thank my good friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, for his passion and for his unrelenting commitment to protecting our American He has been on this floor day after day, month after month, advocating that we have to address this situation in which individuals came to the United States as small children; they have grown up here, they speak English, and they have been totally immersed in making our community stronger, our States stronger, our Nation stronger. We need to make sure[[Page S7857]]that we treat them fairly, with respect, and that we ensure that we are able to benefit from their presence here, just as they benefit from being here in the United There are 800,000 Dreamers across our country. I know they all very much appreciate his leadership.  The young men and women who came out of the shadows to be part of the DACA Program--Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals--were made a promise that they would be all right if they did so; that their information would not be used then to deport them. So they took a gamble that the United States would stand by the commitment it was making to them, and now they are wondering what happened because their futures are dangling by a thread. The program has been abandoned by the President, and if it is not replaced by legislation done right here in this room, they basically will be subject to being deported to places where they don't speak the language, they don't understand the culture--they are unfamiliar with it--and they don't have any network. They are really kind of stateless individuals who are in a very tough condition.  One person like this from Salem, OR, is Diana Banda In 1993, Diana, who is shown here in this picture I have in the Chamber, came to this country from Mexico as a 3-year-old toddler. She has lived her entire life since then, here in  Growing up in America, Diana dreamed of becoming a first responder, so much so that during her high school years, she volunteered for Red Cross and for her community emergency response team, but that dream was thrown into doubt during her senior year when she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. She has fought that cancer, and she has beat that cancer. She graduated from high school more determined than ever to pursue her vision of how she could contribute to the community, and she has contributed. She enrolled and put herself through the firefighting and paramedic program at her local community college, and now she has made a career for herself as an emergency medical technician, an Every day, she is working literally to save lives, and we are threatening to kick her out of the country--the only country she has ever known.

I know nothing outside the      United Whatever punishment I must pay I am willing to      do. All I ask is for a chance. Better yet I beg for a chance      to prove that I am not a criminal, that I have much to offer      this beautiful place.  That is, in her words, her vision, her desire to be able to fully participate in our society.  Just recently, over Thanksgiving, I led a delegation to Burma has had horrific circumstances occur because they have a population of Muslims called the Rohingya, and the Rohingya have been in Burma for generations. Many of them came 200 years ago, and they came because they were imported for labor. They have farmed the rice paddies, they have fished in their boats off the coast, but they have never really been accepted by Burma recognized in their 1982 law 135 minorities, but they didn't recognize the Rohingya because the adjacent Rakhine minority is in kind of a hostile relationship with them. They have always been treated as second-class citizens, so much so that in the middle of Rakhine State, there are about 120,000 people living in camps. They are not allowed to leave the camps. They are not allowed to fully participate in society. They are not given citizenship rights. In northern Rakhine State, in that area, the military went in and burned some 300 villages, engaged in systematic rape, proceeded to shoot people as they fled their villages, and now 600,000 people have gone into  The reason I raise this is not a parallel situation, but there is, at its core, a similar issue, and that issue is whether a nation thrives by entertaining the situation of having a stateless population. Burma had a stateless population that it did not recognize, did not allow to be fully engaged. They weren't even second-class citizens because they weren't allowed citizenship.  Well, we have now a tremendous population of young folks who have grown up in They are culturally Many of them had no idea they were born abroad, and they are ready to be full participants if we will let them. Won't we be so much better off to enable them to rise to their full potential, to make their full contribution, to have a full measure of participation in our society?

What a fantastic reservoir of talent, ability, energy, and passion waiting to be fully contributed to being part of the United States of  While we delay, these 800,000 young members of our communities are in limbo.

These students provide research and teaching services as work to offset tuition. I mean, we are talking about assistants in the dorms, teaching assistants for undergraduate courses, researchers in laboratories--all who contribute to universities for quite modest stipends and tuition credits to avoid going further into debt and to support themselves while completing their master's degrees and Ph.D.'s.  Taxing this so-called income would impose a profoundly negative impact on education. Schools across the country could lose half their current graduate students, and it would diminish the number of students who would even consider graduate school in the future.  Mr.Speaker, what is to become of the vital research and development in the fields of medicine and engineering and agriculture and information technology--things that have led to innovation and invention, things that have truly made America great--with this tax provision?

I also want to thank my fellow Senators from Oklahoma, Mr.Inhofe and Mr.Lankford, for their great work in getting this passed in the  As the sponsor of H.42, the House companion bill to 1266, I urge my colleagues to support and vote in favor of today's bill.  Nearly a year ago, we debated this bill on the floor and saw it passed by voice vote. I look forward to another strong response from the House in sending this bill to the President's desk and it becoming law.  This bill simply authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs to contract with nonprofit organizations that accredit healthcare organizations in order to investigate VA medical centers.  This bill would allow the VA to get a second opinion from outside of the agency in order to get the best information and provide the best care for our veterans. Just like how patients sometimes need to get a second opinion on their diagnosis, the VA should not be above bringing in a second opinion.  Our veterans deserve care equal to the finest civilian hospitals, so let's bring more transparency to the VA by allowing them to invite the people who evaluate those private hospitals to take a look at the VA and make recommendations when problems arise.  This is a commonsense bill that will help improve the care for our veterans, and I hope all will support it.  Mr.Speaker, I urge passage of this bill.

394,topic-id,166,"Mr.President, I strongly oppose this motion to strike. This is our opportunity to provide jobs, to create revenues and resources, and to protect an environment that as Alaskans we know how to protect. We are seeking with this energy title to develop 2,000 acres out of 19.3 million acres, one ten-thousandths of all of ANWR, and we are seeking to do it with a smaller, limited footprint, using the technologies that have become available over the decades that we have been seeking to advance these opportunities--opportunities for Alaska, opportunities for the  I would implore colleagues. For 40 years now we have been looking for the opportunity to best protect our long-term energy and national security. This is our chance.  The pending amendment 1717 would cause the underlying legislation to exceed the Energy and Natural Resources Committee's section 302(a) allocation of new budget authority or outlays.

1198,topic-id,2621,"Mr.President, I appreciate the fact that I am able to follow my colleague from South Carolina, who has, I think, described and encapsulated in pretty simple terms this proposal before us.  This tax proposal is good for the country. It is good for American families. It is good for Alaskan families and South Carolina families. I am pleased to be able to join my colleagues this afternoon in support of the reconciliation legislation that we have pending before us.  I happen to believe that the tax reform title will help our families keep more of their hard-earned dollars. I think it will make American businesses more competitive. I am also proud to be the author of the energy title contained within this measure that works to strengthen our long-term energy security. I think it is important that we recognize the magnitude of the moment. Once in a generation we have an opportunity to really take a hard look at our economy, the role that Congress can play in encouraging new growth, and then take the action that we need to get the economy back on track.  Our historic tax reform effort will grow Alaska and the Nation's economy. When you look at it from the broader view--from a thousand-foot view--the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is pro-economy, and it is pro-growth. It is a pro-jobs proposal that reduces taxes and puts dollars in the pockets of hard-working Americans at every income level.  Think about all that it does in terms of boosting the economy to create jobs--jobs that feed our families and that help put our kids through college, jobs that allow you to save for the unexpected events, to be able to retire with peace of mind, and the flexibility to be the great innovators that we are in this country.  What we see in this proposal are meaningful developments in the tax code to provide substantive relief to Americans across the economic spectrum.  In Alaska, if you take a family of four with two kids, earning $50,000, that uses the standard deduction, they are going to see a tax decrease of $1,400. If the same family earns about $75,000, that tax liability would be reduced by $2,000. The child tax credit benefit that we see from doubling or nearly doubling that tax credit is from $1,000 to $2,000--$1,000 of which is refundable. It also expands the eligibility of children under 18, providing significant assistance to the 22 million Americans who use the child tax credit.  In terms of simplifying the tax code, how often do we hear our constituents say: Just make it simpler for us? By making it a simpler, fairer tax treatment for individuals in every income bracket, again, this is a proposal that delivers.  Most Americans take advantage of the standard deduction, and this act doubles the standard deduction, resulting in a $12,000 deduction for single filers, and $24,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly.  I focus a lot on the families in We don't happen to have a lot of large corporations, but when you look to the benefits contained within this proposal and the impact they will have on our larger businesses and our corporations, they are significant. Recognizing the steps that we are taking to lower the corporate rates to allow us to be more competitive, not only in this country, but globally, all we need to do is really to look to what we are seeing already with the uptick in businesses and how we can be doing more to help further incent that.  I think we recognize that lower corporate tax rates will allow our businesses to compete against our foreign competitors and make the investments in American operations. It will bring the jobs--the economic growth that has alluded us for so many years.  In Alaska, it is over 99 percent. Actually, 99.6 percent of our businesses are small businesses. They are taxed at the individual rate. So the discussion that we have had with regard to allowing owners of passthrough small businesses to be able to deduct an additional percent of their business income from their taxes is a significant benefit for our entrepreneurs, and one I certainly endorse.  Some of the other provisions that help our businesses are these: the 100 percent immediate full business expensing for the next five years and the expansion of the Section 179 small business expensing. These incentivize the kind of foundational investments that implement long-term plans. They help to expand operations and encourage[[Page S7539]]businesses to take that risk that is needed when we are talking about creating lasting economic growth.  The bill also helps our smaller businesses protect what they built. When someone passes on, they have the ability to be able to pass it to that next generation. What we have done with the doubling of the exemption for the estate tax is important. There has been a lot of discussion about the benefits that is seen with this particular provision for our farmers. In Alaska, we don't have a big agriculture section of our State, but we view our fishermen, really, as the farmers or the ranchers of the sea--truly small businessmen. When you think about the investment that a fishing family makes in a vessel, in the gear, in the permits, in the quota, you can have a significant investment totaling millions of dollars--$7 or $8 million. It is about a million dollars when you think about the quota and the permits there. So we are recognizing how we are able to provide just a little bit of relief to those smaller families. I don't think they would consider themselves millionaires in the sense of having that disposable income, but being able to pass on that hard work that you have built as a small family operator in a fishing business is important, and it is significant.  The bottom line is that this is a proposal that does work. It does work for Alaska families. It does work for our families. It gets dollars into their pockets and relief to our families, and it will help to restore competition in the global marketplace and, certainly, for job creators and also in the confidence that now is the time to invest in  I thank the members of the Finance Committee and the good work done by Chairman Hatch for the work they have done on tax reform.  I would also like to thank the members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee who worked with me to report the second title of this legislation and to report it on a bipartisan basis.  We have very straightforward text. It is just six pages in total, which is pretty impressive in this day and age, but this small package offers a tremendous opportunity for Alaska, for the Gulf Coast, and really for all of our  Within this title, we authorize responsible energy development in the 1002 area. This covers 1.57 million acres of land in the non-wilderness portion of ANWR in the northeastern corner of the We require the program to be managed in a manner similar to the environmentally protective framework that is used for other Federal lands on Alaska's North It also provides for two lease sales to be conducted over the next 10 years.  In terms of how the revenues are shared, we split the revenues from development evenly between the Federal Government and the State of We have limited surface development to just 2,000 Federal acres within the 1002 area. This is just one ten-thousandth of all of Again, we are talking about a very limited surface development to just 2,000 Federal acres within the 1002 area.  Many have raised concerns, asking, what about the environmental process? Do you sidestep that? Not at all. We have not preempted the environmental review process. We have not limited the consultation process with Alaska Natives in any way. All the relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders will apply under our language.  I think it is important to recognize that this is not something that just kind of appeared. Our title is the result of a regular order process here in the It will include a regular order environmental process, with laws like NEPA fully applied after we pass it. So we have a regular order process before as well as after.  We also strengthened our bipartisan title in committee during our regular order markup by adding a bipartisan amendment that was sponsored by Senators Cassidy, Strange, and Their provision will increase revenue sharing in the Gulf Coast to be used for priorities like coastal restoration and hurricane protection. I think, as we have seen, given the hurricanes they have endured in the gulf region this year, there is certainly need for this critical investment.  The 1002 area in the northeast corner of Alaska is a long way from the Gulf Coast, but it will bring substantial benefits to every part of our With this provision, we will generate substantial revenues for long-term deficit reduction--well over $100 billion over the life of the fields. I think it is important to keep it in context. We are not just talking about the short term within this 10-year window but what will come our way over the life of the field in terms of revenues to the country.  We are going to create thousands of jobs, not just in Alaska but really all over the country. We will reduce our foreign oil dependence. This is important because we are projected to remain a net importer long into the future. In States like California, our foreign dependence has actually deepened as we have seen Alaska's oil production decline. So this means jobs and revenues for them as well.  Of course, you cannot talk about energy security without recognizing the benefits to our country's national security and what this yields.  We are also taking a major step to make energy more affordable. The fact is, the world is using more oil, not less. Our prices are rising. OPEC would like to keep it that way, regardless of the consequences for Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency, among others, is warning of a looming shortfall in global supply. We have seen the price spikes and the disorders that result when we fail to respond and to be prepared.  I think we recognize that these are all significant benefits--jobs, revenues, national security, affordability--but we should be equally confident that this will not come at the expense of our environment simply because we have the technologies, the new developments that really have worked to dramatically reduce the footprint of development--smaller than ever. The size of development pads on Alaska's North Slope has decreased by roughly 80 percent since we began operations in the 1970s. New technologies have expanded the subsurface reach of the new rigs by more than 4,000 percent.  Folks have seen the various charts that we have had here on the floor that show just how far we are able to reach below the surface from one single well. If you were to drill down from below the Capitol here, expanded-reach technology can take you all the way out to the National Harbor, just to kind of put things in context. So the technologies allow us to have a much smaller footprint.  Many exploration wells are now being built using ice roads and ice pads that melt when the spring thaw comes, leaving no impact to the tundra.  Making sure that we are being environmentally conscious at every turn is what we do and is a priority for us in  We hear the baseless claims of destruction and devastation, but the reality is that is not our experience in That is not how we do business. We need less land to access more resources than ever before. That is the reality in Alaska today. Alaskans understand this, and that is why there are so many of us who so strongly support this development--our entire congressional delegation, our Independent Governor, our Democratic Lieutenant Governor, our Alaska Natives who live on the North Slope, including in Kaktovik, which is actually in the 1002 area.  Some people say this is an area that is untouched and unspoiled. Well, you need to talk to people who live in Kaktovik who fly in on the airstrip there, whose children attend the school, who work in the clinic. These are people who also support the development.  The Voice of the Arctic Inupiat, the North Slope Borough, dozens of our State legislators, and hundreds of Alaskans have called and written in support of this effort. That is no surprise because 70 percent of Alaskans support responsible energy development in the non-wilderness 1002 area. They are joined by many national stakeholders. We have the U.Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, Americans for Prosperity, Securing America's Future Energy, North America's Building Trades, the Laborers' International Union of North America, and the International Union of Operating Engineers, just to name a few.  There are some who worry about the potential impacts of development in the 1002 area, and I would be the first[[Page S7540]]to agree that the environment and local wildlife will always be a concern, always be a priority. That is why we did not waive NEPA or any other environmental laws. That is why the consultation requirements with our Alaska Native people still apply. That is why surface development will cover up to, but no more, than 2,000 Federal acres.  The fact is, we will not sacrifice wildlife or the environment for the sake of development, but we also recognize that is not a choice we face. This is not an either/or proposition. This has not been the experience in Prudhoe Bay, where we have seen the Central Arctic caribou herd grow more than sevenfold since development began, and it comes because we are taking care of our lands as we seek to develop.  If we are allowed to move forward with development, we will do it right. We will take care of our lands. We will take care of our wildlife. We will take care of our people.  I wouldn't support development if I were not convinced that it can be done safely and responsibly. I was born in I know I am the first Senator serving who was born in Alaska, actually in the territory of It will always be my home. My husband and I have raised our boys there, and we hope they lead a long and a healthy life in this amazing and beautiful place. We know there is no one who cares more about our place, these spaces, than those who call it home. We love this place, and we will not risk its future for the sake of development. But, again, we know that is not the case here. We know that is not the trade-off. We know this is not an either/or proposition.  The 1002 area was created by congressional compromise decades ago, and we always knew that its future would require another compromise. Today, we have it before us. We are not asking to develop all of the 1002 area. We are asking instead for 2,000 Federal acres--about one ten-thousandth of all of We have waited nearly 40 years for the right technologies to come along so that the footprint of development is small enough to ensure that the environment is protected going forward.  I encourage Members to recognize the tremendous opportunity we have before us. It is clear from my words today and those leading up to it that I support this legislation, and I would encourage every Member to follow suit.  I thank the  I yield the floor.

Subject: Eastern Interior Resource Management     Lisa Murkowski,     U.      This is a response to your letter requesting our opinion      whether the Eastern Interior Resource Management Plan      (Eastern Interior Plan), issued on December 30, 2016 by the      Bureau of Land Management (BLM) of the Department of the      Interior, is a rule under the Congressional Review Act (CRA).      The Eastern Interior Plan is comprised of the Resource      Management Plans (RMP) for four areas in Alaska: the Draanjik      Planning Area, the Fortymile Planning Area, the Steese      Planning Area, and the White Mountains Planning You      also asked us to decide whether these four underlying RMPs      are rules for CRA purposes. For the reasons discussed below,      we conclude that the Eastern Interior Plan and the four RMP's      are rules under                               BACKGROUND                  The Resource Management Plan Process       The Eastern Interior Plan was prepared in accordance with      the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA).      The FLPMA, as amended, requires the Bureau of Land Management      (BLM) to ``develop, maintain, and, when appropriate, revise      land use plans which provide by tracts or areas for the use      of the public lands'' Plans are to ``use and observe the      principles of multiple use and sustained yield[.]'' FLPMA      defines ``multiple use'' to encompass uses such as      ``recreation, range, timber, minerals, watershed, wildlife      and fish, and natural scenic, scientific and historical      values[.]'' Multiple use management requires balancing      various competing uses of land.       All future resource management authorizations and actions,      and subsequent more detailed or specific planning, must      conform to the approved resource management plan. BLM may      amend or revise plans to account for, among other things, new      information or changes in circumstances. FLPMA requires BLM      to promulgate and follow certain procedures set forth in      regulation for the development, amendment, and revision of      forest plans. The decision to adopt a land use plan and the      rationale for making that decision are made public in a      Record of Decision issued pursuant to the National      Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).       Below is a brief description of some of the land use and      other decisions discussed in each of the four Resource      Management Plans (RMP) contained in the Eastern Interior      Plan:                     White Mountains Planning Area       The White Mountains National Recreation Area comprises over      1 million acres, and had an earlier RMP established in 1986.      After analyzing five different alternatives, BLM chose a plan      that recommends opening 4,000 acres to new locatable mineral      entry and mineral leasing by revocation of public land      orders, and identifies lands that are suitable for      acquisition, disposal, or retention. The entire area is      limited to off-highway vehicles, with snowmobiles permitted      in winter months. The plan defers travel management planning      to a future rulemaking process to be completed within 5      years.                          Steese Planning Area       This planning area comprises about 1.3 million acres, and      its RMP replaces an earlier plan approved in 1986. The BLM      again considered five alternative plans, and the selected      option would designate that 98 percent of the planning area      remain closed to mineral leasing and mineral location. A      limited off-highway vehicles area designation would be in      place for the entire planning area, and a more detailed      transportation management plan would be developed within the      next 5 years. The Steese Special Recreation Management Area      is designated under the Plan, and two Research Natural Areas      remain in place.                        Fortymile Planning Area       The Fortymile Planning Area comprises nearly 1.9 million      acres of land, and the RMP replaces an earlier planning      effort approved in 1980. The area includes a Wild and Scenic      River designated by statute. Five alternative plans were      considered by BLM, and the plan chosen would recommend that      40 percent of the area remain closed to mineral leasing      and mineral location, and recommends a new Area of      Critical Environmental A limited off-highway      vehicles designation would apply to the entire planning      area.                         Draanjik Planning Area       This planning area, formerly known as the Upper Black River      Area, comprises about 2.4 million acres. There was no prior      planning document for this region. After studying five      alternative plans, BLM decided, among other things, to      designate the Salmon Fork River as an Area of Critical      Environmental Concern to protect anadromous fish habitat,      bald eagle nesting, and rare plant habitats. The RMP also      recommended that 77 percent of the land be closed to mineral      leasing and mineral location (previously no mineral leasing      or mining claims were allowed). Certain lands near the town      of Circle, Alaska, would be available for disposal through      exchange and would have limited access to off-highway      vehicles; no off-highway vehicles access was designated prior      to this planning process.                        Congressional Review Act       The CRA, codified at 5 U.S.801-808 (2012), establishes a      process for congressional review of agency rules and special      expedited procedures whereby the Congress may pass a joint      resolution of disapproval to overturn a rule. Congressional      review is assisted by the Act's requirement that all federal      agencies submit each rule to both Houses of Congress and to      the Comptroller General before it can take effect. The report      must contain a copy of the rule, ``a concise general      statement relating to the rule,'' and the rule's proposed      effective date. In addition, the agency must submit to the      Comptroller General a complete copy of the cost-benefit      analysis of the rule, if any, and information concerning the      agency's actions relevant to specific procedural rulemaking      requirements set forth in various statutes and executive      orders governing the regulatory process. The agencies      (Interior and BLM) did not send a report on the Eastern      Interior Plan to Congress or the Comptroller                                ANALYSIS       On October 23, 2017, we issued an opinion on whether the      2016 Amendment to the Tongass National Forest Land and      Resource Management Plan (2016 Tongass Amendment), approved      on December 9, 2016, is a rule under In our Tongass      opinion, we analyzed the 2016 Tongass Amendment in light of      CRA's definition of a rule, found that it fit within that      definition, and concluded that it was a rule for CRA      purposes. As explained below, we reach the same conclusion      with regard to the Eastern Interior Plan and each of the four      RMPs it contains.       The first step in analyzing whether the Eastern Interior      Plan is a rule is to look at[[Page S7331]]     how CRA defines a rule. CRA adopts the definition of a rule      in section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),      with three exceptions. The APA defines a rule, in relevant      part, as ``the whole or a part of an agency statement of      general or particular applicability and future effect      designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy      or describing the organization, procedure, or practice      requirements of an agency.'' Thus a rule has three key      components: it must (1) be an agency statement, (2) have      future effect, and (3) be designed to either implement,      interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describe the      agency's organization, procedure, or practice requirements.       First, since the Eastern Interior Plan was issued by BLM, a      federal agency, the first part of the definition is met.      Second, the Eastern Interior Plan clearly states that it      ``provide[s] overall direction for management of all      resources on BLM-managed lands'' within the four planning      areas it includes. In three of those areas, it replaces      plans implemented 30 or more years ago; and in the fourth      area it establishes an initial Management Plan for an area      that previously had no approved plan. All four RMPs make      recommendations and designate future uses of their      respective areas. Therefore, the Plan has future effect      and the second part of the definition is also met.       Third, the agency statement must be designed to implement,      interpret, or prescribe law or policy. Each of the four RMPs      prescribes policies for future use of the areas they cover,      such as where mining or off-highway vehicles are permitted;      and two of the RMPs identify Areas of Critical Environmental      Each of the RMPs implements the provisions of FLPMA      and other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.      Implementation required extensive consultation with parties      that have interests in that region through notice and public      comment; public hearings; and then an opportunity for the      Governor of Alaska to provide final comments. Therefore, the      third part of the definition is also met.       As noted above, CRA provides that three types of rules are      not subject to its requirements. The three exceptions are      for: (1) rules of particular applicability; (2) rules      relating to agency management or personnel; and (3) rules of      agency organization, procedure, or practice that do not      substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency      parties. We conclude that these exceptions do not apply.       First, as we determined in our recent Tongass decision, a      resource management plan is a rule of general applicability,      since it governs all natural resource management activities,      all projects approved to take place, and all persons or      entities that engage in uses permitted by those projects.      Second, the Eastern Regional Plan does not relate to agency      management or personnel, since it is concerned with      management of uses of the areas it governs by the public      rather than management of BLM itself or its personnel.      Additionally, as we also concluded in the Tongass decision,      when a resource management plan has a substantial effect on      non-agency parties, it cannot be considered to be a rule of      agency organization, procedure or practice. Because the      Eastern Interior Plan designates uses by non-agency parties      that may take place in the four areas it governs, it is not a      rule of agency organization, procedure or practice.                               CONCLUSION       The Eastern Interior Resource Management Plan and the four      RMPs it contains are rules subject to the requirements of the            If you have any questions about this opinion, please      contact Robert Cramer, Associate General Counsel, at (202)      512-7227.

247,topic-id,1357,"Thank you very much, Mr. I was paying attention to my social media feed, and I have seen that Senators on the Republican side are starting to announce which way they are voting. I saw that Corker is a no and Collins is a yes. I don't know what they are a no or a yes on. How can you declare which way you are going to vote on a bill that you haven't read, on a bill that your constituents haven't seen?  Senator Wyden just piled up what looked to be about 6 inches' worth of text in front of the Senate floor. There is no possible way that any Member of this body has read all of that. There is no way that in the time between when it is released to Senators and when we vote, anyone--even from the very close States--is going to be able to get back to their constituents and ask them what they think about this piece of legislation. I guess I would say I have never seen anything like it, but we just went through it earlier this year when we were given about an hour to look at a complete reform of one-sixth of the American economy, the healthcare system.  We are now being asked to vote this evening on a multitrillion-dollar reform of our Tax Code, and not a single U.Senator will have read it. There is no way you will have read it. I just saw how big it is. Maybe Republicans have read it because they have seen it in these secret negotiations, but I can guarantee you that Senate Democrats will not have read this because we have been kept out of the loop on all of these negotiations designed to get to 50 votes--not to 60 votes, not to 70 votes, not a consensus product that can get Republican and Democratic support.  I got here in 2007 when Democrats took control of the House and the I remember during those 2 years all sorts of consternation from Republicans about how bills were being rushed through the process. In reaction to that, when Republicans took back control of the House, they instituted something called a 72-hour rule that said that we couldn't vote on a piece of legislation unless Members have been able to see it for 72 hours. We need a 72-minute rule. I don't think we are going to be able to look at this legislation for more than 72 minutes--a multitrillion-dollar reform of the U.Tax Code--before we are asked to vote on it.  Senator Wyden and others have been waving around this list of lobbyist asked-for amendments that fill up an entire page. We are not going to get 72 minutes to look at this, never mind have a single conversation with our constituents. It is dark out. The bill is going to be introduced on a Friday night. We are going to vote on it overnight. This is supposed to be the world's greatest deliberative body. It is not supposed to work like this.  It is not a middle-class tax cut. I am not going to deny that there are some people in the middle class who are going to get their taxes lowered by this bill, but the middle-class tax cuts here are temporary and they are very selective. They are selective in a way that very peculiarly seems to discriminate against Democratic So the States that are represented by Democrats don't get as big a tax cut out of this because it has been crafted in a way that hurts States like mine that utilize the State and local tax deductions more than other States, those that happen to be represented by  It is not a middle-class tax cut because the middle-class tax cuts are temporary. They go away after 7 years. The corporate tax cuts, the inheritance tax cuts for billionaires, are permanent. Those go through the full 10-year timeframe. But middle-class families don't get permanence. After 7 years, 6 out of 10 middle-class families will have their taxes go up, not down.  That 7-year timeframe is an important one because by repealing the individual mandate, premiums go up by 10 percent a year. Republicans have been screaming about premiums going up, and they decided intentionally to put a provision in this bill that will guarantee premiums will continue to go up at 10 percent per year. Guess what happens at year 7. Year 7 is when that 10 percent increase year-by-year compounds such that premiums will double. So in year 7--this is a great deal if you are a middle-class taxpayer--your tax cut to the extent it exists in this bill disappears and your healthcare premium is doubled.  What it is, is a big tax cut for the wealthy. I am stealing Senator Bennet's chart, but he did it very well. We have 572,000 taxpayers--the richest 500,000 Americans--getting $34 billion in tax cuts, and then we have 90 million taxpayers who are making under $50,000 a year getting $14 billion in tax cuts.  I get it. If you are going to structure a tax cut that covers everybody, naturally people who make more are going to get more. But why does it make sense to borrow $34 billion to help the wealthiest 500,000 Americans? This[[Page S7679]]doesn't even count the inheritance tax, which is going to help an even smaller percentage of those people even more.  Come on, this idea that you could deficit-finance a tax cut for the rich and it will just trickle down and magically result in economic growth--that is just not true. It is fiction. We have decades of economic experience to tell us that when we cut taxes for the rich, it does not magically result in enough economic growth to make up for the deficit, especially deficits that are going to be in the neighborhood of $2 trillion. You might as well claim that unicorns are real. You want to believe that Tupac is still alive, go for it--that is just as plausible as deficit-financed tax cuts for the rich resulting in enough economic growth to wipe out the deficit. It is fiction. It is a fantasy from the beginning.  I think we should take our time, read the bill, and have a real conversation about what we are about to do. If our goal is to provide a middle-class tax cut, we could do a much better job if we worked together. This is not a middle-class tax cut for everybody, and after 7 years, the majority of people in the middle class lose that tax cut.  There is no reason to borrow this much money for the richest 500,000 As a Senator with two young kids, I just don't know why you would ask my kids and so many others to pay back the loans necessary to deliver this tax cut, especially when it isn't going to magically result in the kind of economic growth that trickle-down economists have claimed for years and years.  It is not impossible to get a bipartisan tax bill. I know my Republican friends claim, as they did on healthcare, that there is no good will on the Democratic side to try to craft a bipartisan proposal. The tragedy is that they didn't even try. There was no attempt to try to find common ground here, just as there was no attempt to try to find common ground on healthcare until the bill failed. I credit Senator Alexander and Senator Murray for trying to find that common ground after the healthcare bill failed, but the order switched--try to find common ground first, and if that fails, do it in a partisan fashion, instead of doing it in a partisan fashion, and when that fails, trying to find common ground.  This is a really bad deal, a really bad piece of legislation for my constituents--I think, because I will not have read it by the time I am forced to vote on it, and neither will any of the other 99 Members of this body.

147,topic-id,817,"Mr.President, I come to the floor this afternoon to speak on behalf of myself, along with Senator Wyden, about the incredible healthcare impacts that this tax bill will have on families.  It is astonishing just how far my Republican colleagues are willing to run from the truth in order to jam this terrible tax bill through  They said it was going to lower taxes for the middle class. Well, it will not.  They claim it is going to create jobs. Experts tell us the exact opposite.  They are once again telling families to place their faith on tired trickle-down economic theories, and we have seen how that works. It doesn't.  Unfortunately, I could go on, but I did come to the floor this afternoon to clear up any remaining confusion about one particular claim that Senate Republicans are making in order to justify handing more tax breaks to massive corporations and the wealthy.  The Senate Republican tax bill includes a truly devastating healthcare change that is going to raise families' premiums, cause millions of people to lose their coverage, and create even more chaos and instability in our healthcare markets. People have rejected every single Republican attempt this year to undermine their healthcare, so it is worth asking, why are they doing it again? Why are Republicans doing it in this bill? The answer is simple. Republicans wanted to spend the savings from taking away millions of people's healthcare on tax cuts for those at the top.  Taking healthcare away from families to pay for big corporations' tax breaks is bad enough; what makes it even worse is how they are trying to deny what they are doing.  Senate Republicans are claiming that if they pass the bipartisan bill that Chairman Alexander and I agreed on, all the damage from the healthcare sabotage in their tax bill will somehow go away. They couldn't be more wrong. Our bill, the Alexander-Murray bill, was designed to shore up the existing healthcare system and deal with the problems that President Trump and Republicans already created, not to solve the new problems in this awful Republican tax bill. And just yesterday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office confirmed that. Here is what they said will happen regardless of whether Alexander-Murray becomes law as well: Premiums will go up 10 percent each year, 13 million people will lose coverage, and markets will be even more unstable, which experts have said will cause some of our communities to lose their coverage options.  There has been some discussion on whether passing something called reinsurance, which is a program designed to help with the cost of enrolling the sickest patients, might mitigate the serious damage this Republican tax bill would do. The answer is no there as well. This policy is good policy on its own, but it will not stop the premium increases, and it will not stop the coverage losses and the chaos this Republican tax bill will cause.  The Republicans are doing everything they can to avoid the facts, but that doesn't make them go away. While hiding behind these bipartisan[[Page S7658]]bills might seem like a good talking point in Washington, DC, political cover doesn't pay families' medical bills or give them their coverage back. It does not help people with preexisting conditions who may get priced out of the market. It doesn't help people in communities where markets are already unstable thanks to President Trump's year of sabotage, meaning insurers are ready to exit if things get worse.  One more point. Over the last year of roller coasters on healthcare, there is one thing we could count on; that is, President Trump and the Republican leaders making empty promises. Republicans who are comfortable voting for this awful tax bill because of promises they got from President Trump--who called his own TrumpCare bill ``mean'' when it suited him--and Republican leaders who have written check after check they couldn't cash on healthcare are placing a bet that is more than risky. In fact, this bet is so risky, it requires House Republicans voting in favor of supporting ObamaCare changes they have already said they oppose. If you have spent 5 minutes in this Congress, you should know that getting House Republicans to support ObamaCare is as tough a sell as it gets.  The truth is, if Republicans are serious about not undermining families' healthcare, there is a very easy way for them to actually do that. They can step back from the brink right now and work with Democrats on healthcare and taxes in ways that actually help, not hurt, the people we are supposed to be here to serve. They are far down the road, I understand, but it is not too late. They can turn around. It is not too late to do the right thing. That is what we are asking.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1965,topic-id,715,"Madam President, the American people have gotten a lot of lip service over the past 10 months. Remember draining the swamp and fighting for the forgotten families? The President apparently forgot them when he filled the Cabinet with a who's who of Wall How about every single American having better, cheaper healthcare? That was, of course, before Republicans tried to kick millions of people off of their coverage, increase costs for millions more, and gut protections for people with preexisting conditions.  You would think it would be tough to top all of that, but here we are watching as Republicans, led by President Trump, twist themselves into knots trying to convince hard-working families that the GOP tax plan is anything but a high-priced giveaway to millionaires, billionaires, and the biggest corporations. It is a high-priced giveaway paid for by--you guessed it--the middle class and those who can least afford it. This is so wrong, and I am glad, finally, the phones across the Capitol are today lighting up with constituents demanding to know how anyone promising to represent them could possibly put their name on this terrible, partisan, fast-tracked bill because they see the same nonpartisan reports we all do. They know expert after expert has confirmed what we all know: The Republican tax plan will hurt millions of everyday Americans, including those who are already falling behind in an economy that tilts further and further in favor of the wealthiest few. They know the Republican tax plan takes money out of their pockets. They know it guts their healthcare by spiking premiums and leaving millions and millions of[[Page S7373]]Americans without the coverage they need. They know it papers over our Nation's paid family leave problem, instead giving corporations a massive giveaway and leaving families who need to care for loved ones in the lurch. They know it adds trillions of dollars to the national debt, setting up, once again, the perfect foil for Republicans to then come after Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and other middle-class priorities when the bill comes due.  In case that wasn't enough, the Senate Republican tax bill adds a backdoor attempt to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling for oil, just for good measure. Republicans are even trying to pay for tax cuts for those at the top by sabotaging families' healthcare in this bill in a way that would spike premiums, cause 13 million people to lose their coverage, and creates more chaos in the healthcare system.  I know they are claiming the bipartisan bill I reached with Chairman Alexander can somehow fix this if it is signed into law and that other bipartisan legislation to help States cover the costs of enrolling very sick patients might help, too, but let me make very clear, that is very wrong. This is the classic example of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole and would be cold comfort to the people across the country who will struggle even more to get the care they need while at the same time watching massive corporations get more tax breaks they don't need.  If anyone was still under any illusion that Republicans were concerned about the middle class or fiscal responsibility or even regular order, that ends here and now. This is shameful and wrong. I have to say, it is not too late. I say this to my Republican colleagues, let's move right now to the bipartisan work we know our constituents actually want and expect. Let's return to a process that allows a true debate about our values and priorities as a nation. Let's talk about ways to help our workers and grow the economy from the middle out, such as access to high-quality childcare and pre-K for all of our working families; providing meaningful paid family and medical leave for every American; making college more affordable; investing in retirement security for our workers; supporting our veterans; and making healthcare higher quality, more affordable, and more accessible.

669,topic-id,329,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.3731. This bill would raise the cap on overtime pay for Secret Service agents through next year.  These agents pursue the unique dual role of the Secret Service, which consists of protective and investigative functions. Secret Service agents are most commonly known for their role in protecting the President, Vice President, their families, and other dignitaries. Their duties, however, also involve rotations into units that investigate threats against our financial system, certain types of identity theft, and related cybercrimes.  This bill before us today is before us because the demands on these agents have increased significantly under the Trump administration. President Trump seems to travel to properties in Florida, New Jersey, and Virginia almost every weekend, and the number of individuals in the Trump administration under Secret Service protection has exceeded 40, in comparison to just over 30 under the Obama administration. Protective overtime hours for special agents are 15 to 20 percent higher than those during the last non-Presidential campaign year.  Because of the increased workload, many Secret Service personnel will hit the statutory pay cap this year, and next. This bill would raise the cap through calendar year 2018. This change is necessary to allow Secret Service agents to be compensated for the extraordinary rigors and time demands placed upon them as they work diligently to fulfill their critical mission. The adjustment is necessary for the retention of well-trained agents and the recruitment of new ones.  I also note that the bill would require GAO to conduct a study of the Secret Service's implementation of recommendations concerning training and personnel made 3 years ago by the Secret Service Mission Congress will benefit from receiving a progress report on this effort.  The various provisions of this bill will help make the Secret Service a more effective agency in pursuing its dual mission.

H.3317 would increase the maximum penalty from 5 years to 15 years for female genital mutilation to appropriately punish those who commit this horrible crime.  FGM, female genital mutilation, is internationally recognized as a violation of the human rights of girls and young women. It is currently a crime in 26 States, including New York, in addition to the prohibition in the Federal criminal code.  Around the world, at least five girls are mutilated in this way every single hour. An estimated 100 million girls and 140 million women worldwide are living with the consequences of genital mutilation.  Despite the fact that female genital mutilation has been banned in the United States since 1996, people continue to engage in this abusive practice. Recently, the first prosecution[[Page H9639]]was initiated under the Federal statute. A doctor in Michigan was charged with performing female genital mutilation on two girls who had been brought across State lines for this purpose.  Those who commit these horrendous crimes should be held accountable for their actions. I support increasing the maximum penalty under Federal law from 5 to 15 years in order to reflect the severity of these injuries and their long-lasting consequences and, perhaps, to better deter these crimes.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness This bill would take a number of steps to help protect the mental well-being of those who take extraordinary steps to protect all of us.  The Office of Community Oriented Policing Services at the Department of Justice reports that law enforcement has an occupational fatality rate three to five times higher than the national average for the working population. Officers respond to horrible situations that are dangerous, stressful, and sometimes life-threatening.  In addition to protecting law enforcement officers from the physical hazards associated with doing their daily jobs, we must also do more to protect them from the mental and emotional difficulties resulting from their work. That is why I support this bill, which would initiate several efforts to help the mental wellness of our law enforcement officers.  The bill calls for the collaboration of the Justice Department, the Defense Department, and the Department of Veterans Affairs to determine which mental health practices and services from the military agencies may be adopted to help civilian law enforcement.  The bill would expand the allowable uses of existing Justice Department grants to include establishment of[[Page H9453]]mental health and wellness programs within State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies.  The bill would direct the Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services to develop educational materials for mental health providers about the culture of law enforcement agencies.

622,topic-id,474,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Pallone and Mr.Shimkus for their hard work.  Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of the Environmental Protection Agency's brownfields program, H.3017, a highly successful program by all accounts.  In the past two Congresses, the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment has evaluated the program[[Page H9545]]in multiple hearings. What we have learned each time is that the program continues operating, as it has since its creation, very efficiently and successfully.  Data provided by the EPA shows that, since its inception, the brownfields program has leveraged more than 122,800 jobs and over $23.6 billion in cleanup and redevelopment funding. For every dollar of brownfields funding--Federal funding--more than 16 other public and private dollars are leveraged on a national level, and more than eight jobs are leveraged for every $100,000 of EPA brownfields funds expended.  It is undeniable that this program is working as it should and that communities across the Nation are benefiting from the investment of the Federal dollars in this program.  The changes made to the program in this bill before the House today will improve it and increase the flexibility with which communities will be able to utilize the program.  Although I support the bill, I am puzzled by this body's reluctance to increase the funding for a very successful program for the brownfields. This program's successes have been continually hindered by insufficient funds, as you have heard from other speakers.  By the EPA's own estimates, over the past 5 years, funding deficiencies have caused 1,676 viable proposals to go unfunded. These sites are not only sitting idle and unproductive, but we are missing out on the return on the investment that these sites could realize. In fact, had these proposals received funding, it is estimated those grants would have leveraged approximately 54,680 jobs and over $10.3 billion in public and private financing.  This begs the question: Why aren't we investing more in the redevelopment of brownfields space?  If this is the success rate of an underfunded program, imagine the potential economic impact and potential for job creation that could come from fully funding the program.  Nevertheless, the program received bipartisan support, and I am pleased to support the legislation to reauthorize the program and improve its success.  I also plan to continue working on the issue of ensuring that local governments maintain their existing obligation to exercise care in preventing potential exposure of our citizens to hazardous substances found on brownfields sites.                              {time}  1500  In reconciling the differences between H.3017 and H.1758--the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure's reported brownfields reauthorization bill--a provision in H.1758 requiring communities to maintain an appropriate level of care in association with the liability protections was dropped from the bill.  I will continue to push for the restoration of this protection, and will continue to move through Again, I support the program.

Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the League of California Cities, the California Department of Finance, the California State Treasurer, and the San Gabriel Valley Economic Partnership in opposition to H.1.         League of California Cities, CSAC, CALED, CSBA,            California Association of Realtors,                                                 November 9, 2017.     For Immediate Coalition of Local Governments, Economic Development Leaders, Schools   and Realtors Urge California Congressional Delegation to Reject Tax         Reforms that Harm Taxpayers, Homeowners and the Economy California Would be one of the States to Lose the Most from Proposed                                 Reforms       Sacramento.--The associations representing California's      local governments, economic development leaders, schools and      realtors urge the California congressional delegation to      protect the State and Local Tax deduction and a key economic      development tool at risk under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in      its current form.       The SALT deduction makes the cost of living more affordable      in states like Eliminating the deduction for      state and local income taxes and capping the local property      tax deduction at $10,000 would hurt hard-working California      families and only add to the housing affordability crisis in      the state by eliminating a key incentive for homeownership.      In 2015, 6.1 million California taxpayers claimed the SALT      deduction with the average deduction at around $18,000.       The SALT deduction has been an integral component of the      federal tax code since its creation in 1913 and was one of      the six deductions allowed under the original tax code.      Eliminating or capping federal deductibility for state and      local property, sales and income taxes would represent double      taxation and would upset the carefully balanced fiscal      federalism that has existed since the permanent creation of      the federal income tax over 100 years ago.       Tax-exempt Private Activity Bonds (PABs) are an important      tool for state and local governments to help finance major      public projects, including transportation and water      infrastructure, affordable housing construction, schools--all      of which are essential for job growth, healthy economies,      safe communities and the nation's economy Eliminating PABs'      tax-exempt status would drive up the costs of borrowing for      these projects by 25-25 percent and be a disincentive to      spurring private sector investment in our communities.       Given the impact on California families and our economy, we      respectfully urge the California congressional delegation to      oppose eliminating or capping the SALT deduction or removing      the exemption on PABs as part of any tax reform proposal.                     Quotes from coalition leaders       Carolyn Coleman, Executive Director, League of California      Cities: ``Hard working California tax payers and our      communities would be harmed by the current proposal. We hope      that California's congressional delegation hears this message      and takes swift action to reject any proposals that would      cause people to pay taxes on their income twice, would      destabilize key incentives for homeownership and increase      borrowing costs for state and local governments to finance      projects that benefit our communities.       Matt Cate, Executive Director, California State Association      of Counties: ``California Counties are increasingly concerned      with several provisions in the House tax reform package. The      narrowing of the SALT deduction alone would impact county      resources and their ability to meet the service needs of the      public. The additional changes to infrastructure financing      tools, including the taxable status of Private Activity Bonds      (PABs) and the ability to advance refund municipal bonds,      will fundamentally harm the way counties do business on      behalf of our residents.''       Gurbax Sahota, President and CEO, California Association      for Local Economic Development: ``The current tax proposal      eliminates Private Activity Bonds--eliminating an important      economic development financing tool California uses to fund      manufacturing expansion, health care facilities, affordable      housing, schools, nonprofits, and other economic development      projects. Combined with a repeal of advance refunding bonds,      this will absolutely impact our ability to attract investment      to future projects like these, as well as our ability to      create and retain jobs in these areas. These provisions are      bad for California and our residents.''       Vernon Billy, CEO and Executive Director, California      School Boards Association: ``We urge the California      delegation to act on behalf of the taxpayers in California      who would be hurt by the elimination of the SALT deduction,      including the talented school employees who work in our      schools educating and training students. Eliminating the      deduction has the same impact as raising property, income and      sales taxes in every congressional district in our state. By      effectively raising property taxes, the deduction also makes      local school bonds more expensive, complicating our efforts      to build and repair schools and provide students with the      resources needed for a high-quality 21st century education.''       Steve White, President, California Association of REALTORS:      ``The move by Congress to eliminate state and local tax      deductions essentially levies a double tax on California,      this and other attacks on real estate tax incentives removes      the tax benefits for people to buy homes and raises taxes on      hundreds of thousands of Homeownership has and      continues to be the best way for families to grow wealth and      increase the middle class. Congress should look at ways to      incentivize and increase homeownership rates, not increase      taxes on families wanting to buy a home.                                  ____                                            Department of Finance,                                       Office of the Director,                                 Sacramento, CA, November 9, 2017.     California Congressional Delegation,     Washington,       Dear Members of the California Congressional Delegation: As      the Governor's chief fiscal advisor, I write to express the      Administration's significant concerns with several provisions      currently contained in H.1 measure now under consideration      before the Ways and Means       Removing the state and local tax (SALT) deductions while      capping the property tax deduction at $10,000--Over 6 million      California tax returns--one of every three--claim SALT      deductions, including millions of middle-income households      that may not benefit from the increased standard deduction.      While allowing up to a $10,000 deduction on property taxes      provides some offset, only one-fourth of the state and local      tax deduction consists of property taxes paid. The average      deduction for state and local income taxes alone is nearly      $16,000 per return, while state and local property taxes      average less than $6,000 per return.       Reducing the cap on the mortgage interest deduction to      $500,000 ($250,000 single)--This change will increase the      cost of homeownership for many middle-class      Given the high cost of housing in the state, mortgages for      many mid-level homes are significantly above these caps,      particularly the $250,000 cap for single filers. More than 4      million California tax returns claim the mortgage interest      deduction at an average of over $12,000 per return.[[Page H9417]]       Elimination of the interest exclusion for Private Activity      Bonds (PABs)--This will remove an important tool used by the      Low Income Housing Tax Credit program to construct affordable      housing, which was used to fund nearly 20,000 affordable      housing units in 2016.       The state's Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank      (iBank) has issued Private Activity Bonds in support of      museums, schools, performing arts centers, charitable      organizations and research institutes throughout the state.      Elimination of Private Activity Bonds would greatly increase      borrowing costs for such borrowers resulting in the delay;      downsizing or outright abandonment of these socially      beneficial projects and the people and jobs who depend on      them.       Further, this would hurt California veterans by ending bond      issuances that help around 1,000 veterans buy a home every      year. This program has been around since at least World War      It serves veterans that would not otherwise qualify for      private financing, while maintaining foreclosure rates of      less than 0.25 percent.       Repeal of Casualty Loss Deduction--Last month's devastating      wildfires in northern California have alone caused billions      of dollars in losses, with more than 10,000 homes damage and      over 4,700 more destroyed. For this and other disasters to      come, it is important to maintain the casualty loss deduction      as a way of providing relief to the victims of casualty      losses both large and small. The repeal of the casualty loss      deduction starting in 2018 under H.1 is an unnecessary      step that will only compound the difficulty for the many      thousands of Californians who either are or will be      struggling to recover from devastating losses.       Negative impacts on Education--Multiple provisions now in      H.1 negatively impact the cost of education for both      students and educators, including the elimination of the      student loan interest deduction, imposing a new tax on      tuition waivers, elimination or reduction of various tax      credits, and a new tax on net investment income of private      colleges and universities if their endowments exceed $250,000      per full-time student. In total, all of the changes to      education provisions will raise taxes on Americans by over      $60 billion over ten years, which indicates a negative impact      on California of at least $7 billion.       Unfavorable treatment of children and families--The new      $300 Family Flexibility Credit for the tax filer, their      spouse, and for non-child dependents is temporary and expires      in 2023. While it provides a tax benefit for many low-income      families in the first four years, its expiration leads to      those same families having much smaller net tax cuts or      overall tax increases in 2023 and beyond. In addition, unlike      the current dependent exemptions it is intended to replace,      there is no indexing of the Child Tax Credit, which leads to      its positive impact eroding over time.       Also, requiring a Social Security number for the refundable      portion of the child tax credit punishes working undocumented      immigrants in California who file their tax returns using a      Taxpayer Identification More than $3.4 billion in      federal refundable child tax credits were claimed by      Californians in 2015, and a portion of those would have been      undocumented immigrants filing with a Taxpayer Identification      Number       Overall tax cuts for the wealthy--Lower tax rates on      business income will disproportionately benefit higher-income      individuals who are more likely to have income from limited      liability companies, S corporations, or partnerships.      Further, the repeal of the estate tax will disproportionately      benefit the wealthy. The estate tax would be fully repealed      for deaths after December 31, 2023 and there would be no      change to the basis step-up rule that currently revalues      appreciated capital assets at market value at the time of      death. As a result, wealthy people would be able to simply      hold on to assets until they die, pass the assets on to their      heirs, and all the increase in the value of the asset during      the wealthy person's life will not be taxed. Removing the tax      on inherited wealth without also repealing the basis step-up      rule leads to increasing inequality. The Joint Committee on      Taxation analysis shows that for 2027, the highest-income      Americans--less than three-tenths of one percent of      taxpayers--will realize almost one-third of the total      benefits.       Prioritizes corporations over individuals--The net benefits      of H.1 are weighted heavily towards corporations, with the      significant cut in the corporate tax rate coupled with the      removal of relatively few corporate tax breaks. Instead, many      deductions and tax credits taken by lower-and middle income      households are either reduced or eliminated. A November 3      Joint Committee on Taxation analysis indicates that more than      half of the tax cut goes to corporations while about one-     third goes to businesses that pass through income to      individuals.       Massive expansion of the deficit by at least $1.7 trillion      over ten years--Deficit-financed tax cuts are not likely to      lead to significant growth effects because the negative      economic effects of the debt would crowd out investment.      Further, fiscal stimulus at this point in the business      cycle--with the economy at full employment, corporate profit      margins at all-time highs, and corporate cash balances at      all-time highs--is unlikely to lead to significant growth      above what would have occurred in the absence of these      changes.

Re Tax Reform and the Low-Income Housing Tax     Grace Napolitano,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Napolitano: Last week you received a letter from      me and other prominent signatories respectfully urging you to      preserve the 4 percent Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (4      percent Housing Credit) and Private Activity Bond Program      (Bond Program). The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, introduced in the      House of Representatives on November 2, proposes the      elimination of the Bond Program and the effective elimination      of the 4 percent Housing       I reiterate the vital role these programs play in building      and preserving affordable housing throughout the nation, but      especially in California where, as you know, we struggle with      a housing crisis that is quickly metastasizing into a      humanitarian and public health catastrophe. Today, the      state's housing shortage stands at one and a half million      units and is growing by an alarming 60,000 units each year.      The 4 percent Housing Credit and Bond Program are the large      sources of funding for affordable housing in California, with      $2.2 billion worth of 4 percent housing credits last year and      more than $6 billion of private activity tax exempt bond      funding for multifamily and single-family housing. Together,      they created or preserved more than 20,000 affordable homes      in 2016, nearly all of which were for low-income households,      including veterans, seniors, persons with disabilities, and      persons experiencing homelessness.       The purpose of this letter is to highlight the projects in      your district that have received funding from these programs      over the last four years. Attached is a spreadsheet with a      list of the projects. Any projects listed in red have pending      applications, and these projects could be brought to a halt      by a sudden cessation of the programs.       As the list of projects shows, this is not an abstract      issue, or one that impacts only one region or a small number      of It is broad-based and affects constituents      like yours and those in congressional districts across the      state. We all have seen the tangible benefits of these vital      programs; now we must come together to save them.       I know you will agree with me that we cannot allow even      more Californians to be driven into homelessness. That is why      I strongly urge you to reject the elimination of the Bond      Program and the 4 percent Housing           Sincerely,                                                      John Chiang,     California State                                  ____                                                San Gabriel Valley                                         Economic Partnership,                                  Irwindale, CA, November 8, 2017.     Re Concerns with the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act          of 2017 (H.1).     Grace Napolitano,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Congresswoman Napolitano: On behalf of the San Gabriel      Valley Economic Partnership, I wish to express concerns with      several provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (H.     1). While the Partnership has long supported federal tax      reform to encourage economic growth and provide tax relief      for middle-class and working families, the elimination of      several key deductions will have a negative effect here in      the San Gabriel       The elimination of the Private Activity Bonds (PABs) tax      exemption will hit municipal governments and non-profit      organizations especially hard and would have ripple effects      across the healthcare and housing sectors. Many non-profit      organizations rely on local governments as partners to issue      PABs to obtain cheaper financing for a variety of endeavors      like the construction of affordable housing, education      programs, and elder care. Although recently state legislation      will provide more funding for affordable housing, PABs are      the finance backbone for these types of housing projects.      PABs funded 20,000 affordable housing units in California      last year; it is estimated the federal deduction alone is      worth $2.2 billion in projects throughout the state. Were the      exemption to be eliminated for PABs, the result would likely      be a 15-20 percent reduction in the overall size of the U.     municipal bond market.       Additionally, the limitation of the state and local tax      deduction (SALT) and the reduction in the mortgage interest      deduction will hurt first time home buyers in the San Gabriel      Valley as well as Californians in other expensive housing      markets in the state, costing them several thousand dollars a      year that they could have saved under the existing      deductions. One-fifth of all American taxpayers claim the      state and local tax deduction. Retaining this deduction is an      important way to allow Americans to keep more of their      income.       The Partnership is supportive of revising the federal      business tax code which has grown outdated and overly      burdensome for American companies competing abroad.[[Page H9418]]     Lowering the corporate rate from 35 percent to 20 percent,      allowing the repatriation of foreign-made profits, and      removing incentives to locate offshore are all positive steps      in improving the tax climate for American business. But these      positive changes are too costly if the major deductions      discussed above are eliminated to pay for these changes. We      ask that you work with your colleagues in Congress to keep      these deductions intact.       Sincerely,                                                      Jeff Allred,     President &                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-16-pt1-PgH9416.txt,1602,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONTINUED,2017,16,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

820,topic-id,640,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, this could be a long few days if they can't agree on a motion to go to conference. That is not exactly the most heightened controversy we have.  Mr.Speaker, I want to stand in support of the Democratic motion to instruct conferees on the Ryan-McConnell tax package and in strong opposition to the Republican tax plan.  Behind me is a replica of the national debt clock. This clock was just reconfigured. New features have been added just in time for the Republicans to acknowledge that they are about to add $1 trillion to this national debt clock, which they tortured Democratic Presidents on for years about the debt.  So let me provide you with some historical perspective. In January of 2001, when Bill Clinton said good-bye, we were looking at a $5.4 trillion surplus, four straight balanced budgets, and record economic growth. The CBO said that the surplus might even go beyond $5.6 trillion.  But what really happened during that period of time?  After the Bush administration left, we were staring at $6.1 trillion worth of debt.  So what happened?  In 2001, the Republican Party cut taxes by $1.3 trillion and said it was all about economic growth. Then they came back in 2003 and said: Well, the growth hasn't been substantial enough, so we are going to cut taxes by another $1 trillion, $2.3 trillion of tax cuts, and a repatriation tax holiday where the money is returned at 5.25 percent on the promise of economic growth and job creation; none of which happened.  So where are we tonight?  We are back to the same old pattern and playbook that they continue to utilize. They promised job growth. In a meeting with the President recently, he said he didn't understand why we couldn't have job growth of 4, 5, or 6 percent. I don't know an economist who thinks we are going to have 6 percent economic growth, but they use that as the linchpin, the excuse for a tax cut that is going to add $1 trillion to the budget deficits, all based on the following economic assumption: maybe.  Maybe we will have growth that will help us to pay down the debt. All of the mainstream economists say maybe a return of one-third on the tax cuts in terms of revenue. Joint Committee on Taxation, The Wharton School, the Tax Policy Center, moodys.com, they all say the same thing: None of this is going to happen.  So we are also back to a familiar argument that they hear, and I think you should pay some attention to this for the moment.  They will say things repeatedly like: It is the people's money. The people know what to do with it.  Well, let me say this as well tonight: It is the people's veterans hospitals; one million new veterans after Iraq and Afghanistan who are going to be in need of long-term care. That is the people's responsibility.  In addition, 10,000 baby boomers retire every single day in Social Security is part of their retirement system, even as it averages about $15,000 for American citizens.  We are going to live longer, and we herald that achievement regularly, but it is also going to mean more Alzheimer's and more dementia that families are going to have to reconcile, and they are going to come back and say at the right moment: Oh, because there is less revenue, we are going to have to have cuts in social spending.  So they are going to say at the right moment: Oh, we are going to have to now change the way we calculate Medicare and Social  This is a missed opportunity above everything else. Everybody agrees on what is wrong with the Tax  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

I hope tonight, as the Republicans confer, they can tell us where they are actually conferring because, between the paste and the bubble gum, they keep putting on a new dimension to their proposal.  This should be a debate that included both parties. Before I reserve my time, for the moment, I want to say this: We had a chance to really do something big.

855,topic-id,612,"Mr.Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, we have heard this discussion back and forth tonight about tax relief for the middle class; and we have heard the other side say that you are going to get $1,189 for a family of four, I think, making $59,000 a year.  But what they don't say is that they are going to take away the State and local tax deduction; they are going to take away the ability of children to deduct interest payments on student debt; that they are going to shave back the mortgage interest deduction; get rid of the historic tax credit; that they are going to get rid of new markets tax credits.  And here is the best one of all: as champions of the middle class they are, they are going to repeal the estate tax.  The gentleman from Pennsylvania, who is my friend, said that we need to stop talking about wealth.[[Page H9611]]  Well, how about approaching it this way? We are wealthy and we are not going to take it anymore, because that is essentially what this argument is about.  When you look at the distribution tables as to who gets what in this tax proposal, the concentration of wealth at the very top is highlighted time and again.  When we talk about tax relief for the middle class, when we examine what this is about to do to California, to New York, to Massachusetts, and to Connecticut, to name, but a few of the States that are going to pay a penalty for this tax plan--  And I dispute fully what the chairman said about the Obama years. Fourteen million jobs were created during the Obama years. Twenty-three million jobs were created during the Clinton years. The day that George Bush left, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month in That is the reality.  When you look at economic growth during those years, the 2 percent that we look at was not enough. But it has now been almost 13 years when middle class people have not had a pay raise and, time and again, we have heard the preposterous argument--and, boy, did it get us into trouble--that tax cuts pay for themselves.  You cannot find a mainstream economist that will say that tax cuts pay for themselves.  Now you hear the repeated argument that, if we cut taxes and we add dynamic scoring, based upon what might occur, or maybe, or if, then we are told that this is going to alleviate slow productivity and slow growth in America, all based upon the premise of tax cuts.  You know what we should be doing tonight, Mr.Speaker?  We should be talking about investing in human capital. We should be talking about the 6 million jobs that go unanswered in America every single day. We should be talking about community colleges. We should be talking about the idea of apprenticeship programs and, yes, investing in vocational education. We should be also talking about, finally, what to do about the 2 million people in America who have opiate addictions and don't go to work every day. We should be concerned about the labor participation rate in  Instead, the answer always becomes the Holy Grail of Republican economics; cut taxes for the people at the very top, and plead the case that what you are really doing is for people in the middle class.  The alternative minimum tax is devoted to people at the top, and the idea of repealing the estate tax for so few people in America is outrageous.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

1464,topic-id,551,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, this is a historic moment, but, most importantly, it is a missed opportunity.  Mr.Speaker, we are taking the proposal of the Republican Party today and the financial architecture of our revenue system, based on their request, to the casino.  Their argument is premised on one thing today, and one thing only. But what about maybe not?  This could have been done between the two parties, as we requested and wanted to do.  In 1986, 450 witnesses offered testimony on tax reform, thirty hearings were held, and the Secretary of the Treasury attended most of them. The two parties found commonality in reaching an accord that was well received by the American people.  What we are being asked to do here today is to raise taxes on 36 million middle class The previous speaker, my friend from California, a quarter of the households in his district claim the State and local tax deduction, with an average of $10,000 per family. $10,000. So they are going to tell you today that they are giving you this and they are giving you that.  Take a look at the distribution tables. That is the most certain opportunity for people to examine precisely what is in this legislation.  A gentleman earlier this morning was heralding Alzheimer's month. They give Alzheimer's a tax during Alzheimer's month. For those who stay together with loved ones for as long as they can, they need that deduction that is so important to keeping that family together.  This is the same old, same old. In 2001, tax cuts of $1.3 trillion all premised on maybe we will have economic growth.  Remember the argument that tax cuts pay for themselves?  Well, they, today, call it dynamic scoring. Now we are being asked again to premise the argument on maybe there will be enough growth to generate some return on revenue.  In 2003, another $1.3 trillion in terms of a tax cut was offered with no or slow economic growth.  And the granddaddy of them all, in 2005, how about repatriation?  Foreign earnings were brought back at 5\1/4\ percent, all based upon the idea that there was going to be widespread broad-based hiring.[[Page H9382]]  What did we discover in the aftermath of that?  Almost 20,000 layoffs in the weeks after it. The money was used for stock buybacks and dividends with no employment gains across the country.  They keep telling us: Well, you are going to get 3 percent, 4 percent, 5 percent, and the President says 6 percent growth.  I want to find that economist who says we are going to get 6 percent growth.  Most projections are that we are being asked here today to participate in the following, because this is the context of the argument this morning: They are borrowing $2.3 trillion over 10 years for the purpose of giving a tax cut to people at the very top of our economic system.  We should be investing in human capital, community colleges, vocational education, internship programs, and aligning the American people with the skill sets that are necessary, as the Department of Labor reported this week, for the 6 million jobs that are available. That is the most gainful way to do long-term investment.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

2050,topic-id,678,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, as we wind down this debate on tax reform or, what we should really call it, tax cut, I think that we should tabulate this as a missed opportunity. This could have[[Page H9406]]been done between the two parties. Instead, much of this was constructed without any Democratic input.  Reminder: In 1986, the historic Tax Reform Act included President Reagan and Speaker O'Neill, Chairman Rostenkowski, Dick Gephardt, and Bill In this instance here, 32 years later, not one hearing was held on this tax bill that is about to be voted on in the next 45 minutes.  The significance of that is that there was never any back-and-forth, and in 1986, expert testimony was sought from 450 witnesses. We had not one witness who commented on the legislation.  It has been advertised as a middle class tax cut. Wait until you get the bill. How can you say that this is a middle class tax cut and compare that to repeal of the estate tax?  How many middle class people in America pay the estate tax?  That is how many people pay the estate tax. No middle class American pays the estate tax. There is no such thing as a death tax, in addition to which a middle class tax cut is described as doing away with the alternative minimum tax. 4.5 million families pay an alternative minimum tax in That is it.  I fixed the problem years ago for the middle class, and 27 million people stopped paying So now we are down to people at the very top.  So how are we paying for this? Or how are they paying for it, better, because they are not going to get much help on this side?  Well, they decided that that teacher who used to have $250, that they could deduct on their income taxes, that is going to be abolished.  So if you have Alzheimer's and you exceed the 10 percent number in terms of cost in your healthcare for caring for that loved one at home who is sick or has dementia, that is how they are going to pay for the tax cut. They are going to take that away.  State and local property taxes, they are going to take that away--the deduction. They are going to pare back the mortgage interest tax deduction. All of this advertised on the basis of a middle class tax cut?  People at the bottom end are not going to get much from this tax cut. I want to take you back again, as I have repeatedly, because I have cast three great votes in this House during my 29 years: against the Iraq war, and there weren't many of us; against the cuts in 2001; and against the tax system in 2003; all advertised as progrowth economics.  There was no economic growth in the tax cuts of 2001, which totaled, by the way, $1.3 trillion. For people who said at the time, ``everybody gets a tax cut,'' they were correct. Then you looked at the distribution tables to see what people got at the top and then what people got at the bottom. Then we came back in 2003 and cut another trillion dollars in taxes--advertises progrowth economics--zippo growth occurred.  Then, by the way, the granddaddy of them all: How about repatriation. Repatriation, bringing back those earnings to the United States for investment in job growth, at, by the way, 5\1/4\ was the tax burden they carried, all based on job growth. It was for stock buybacks, dividends, and layoffs.  We had a chance here to do something historic. We had a chance here in this debate and discussion because there is a genuine affability on that committee. We had this opportunity to take the Tax Code and transform it for the gig economy in the modern age. We didn't do that, though. Four days we had to examine this tax proposal with no hearings. Not one chance for a Democratic amendment to proceed.  I reserve the balance of my time.

2051,topic-id,404,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself 2\1/2\ minutes.  Mr.Speaker, let me acknowledge the support of the Democratic staff that are here as well: Kara Getz, Karen McAfee, Aruna Kalyanam, Peg McGlinch, Deva Kyle, Ji Prichard, and Suzanne They did a magnificent job as well, and we are much dependent on the good staff work, particularly, on the Ways and Means  Mr.Speaker, I spoke earlier of the missed opportunity that we have here. We have a real problem in America with labor participation rates. Six million job go unanswered every day now in America, 18,000 precision manufacturing jobs in New England, and 1 million tech jobs, because skill sets don't align with the job opportunities that are out there.  Two million Americans sit home with opioid addictions who should be in the workforce. This was a chance to invest in human capital as well, to invest in our community colleges, to invest in apprenticeship programs. Yes, the other challenge that we have in America is, clearly, to invest in vocational education for many of the jobs that are available.  Instead, we pushed that off to the side and decided that, once again, if we just had tax cuts, all of these challenges and problems would go away.  The idea of investing in the human side of American opportunity is then[[Page H9407]]people do what we would like them to do in terms of home buying, raising families, caring for neighborhoods, and practicing the art form of citizenship.  Once again, what we are witnessing today--and we need to be alarmed about it--is the greater and greater conservation of wealth in Now, I understand it is complicated. It has to do much with technology and globalization, but it is also about the gig economy, and we, today, reward capital more than we reward labor.  When we get done, if they are successful on the other side, we are going to further concentrate wealth amongst those few families in We serve here in the House of Representatives, not in the House of This is not about peerage, where you are entitled to a seat in this House of That is what is wrong.

138,topic-id,278,"Madam President, the matter that is before the Senate is the motion I have offered. It simply is, in this tax bill, the corporate rate is reduced from 35 percent down to 20 percent, and that is permanent, but the modest, middle-class tax breaks are not permanent, and in 7 or 8 years they cease to exist. They sunset. So, in this tax bill, you want to give permanent, huge corporate cuts, from 35 down to 20. By the way, if the American corporation is doing business overseas, it is basically a zero tax rate, which is an incentive to go overseas, send jobs overseas. American jobs are lost while giving those huge corporate breaks at the same time it is giving modest breaks to the very people who need the tax cuts; that is, hard-working American families, the middle class. Then, oh, by the way, in 7 or 8 years, vamoose, it is gone, no tax break. It goes back up. It is a tax increase. That is simply not fair.  So this little motion simply says go back to the Finance Committee and correct this inequity. Go back to the Finance Committee, make the middle-class tax cuts permanent, and then get the Finance Committee to offset those with revenue from someplace. Do you know where that someplace should be? It ought to be the huge corporate tax cuts. That is where the revenue ought to be taken back from to give that revenue or tax cuts to the middle class. It is a simple issue of fairness.

283,topic-id,486,"Mr.President, this is, in effect, a massive transfer of wealth under the guise of tax reform and under repeating the statement: It will help the middle class. You can repeat a statement, but that doesn't mean it is true. You have to look at what the facts are. I think you have heard a number of the speeches that will refute this--that it is not middle-class tax relief. It certainly isn't when a lot of those so-called tax cuts for the middle class will evaporate; they will cease to exist after 7 or 8 years.  Let's take another part of this tax bill, the child tax credit. We are going to have a couple of amendments out of here on the floor tonight. We are going to have one that is going to increase the tax credit substantially, like $3,000 per child. When you compare that to the current existing Republican bill, they have a tax credit that, in fact, if you have more than three children, if you have a large family, you are going to be penalized. That is what the facts are.  Let's see how the votes come later this evening on two amendments. One is a Democratic amendment, and one is a Republican amendment. As to the child tax credit, let's see what the majority of our friends who are trying to ram this through in the dead of night do. Let's see what happens, because, clearly, their tax bill does not do enough.  This Senator has long supported increasing the child tax credit, including cosponsoring Senator Brown's amendment to increase the credit and make it easier for those who are in a low-income situation to claim that credit. I am going to continue to support increases for this tax credit for the middle class, as long as it is done in a fiscally responsible and thoughtful way. It doesn't make any difference who is proposing it. Let's see how the votes come out here on these two amendments.  Unfortunately, the bill that is before us does it backward because it actually increases those who have a number of children. We should be doing the opposite. I hope that we will find a way to drastically change this bill. Instead of limiting the child tax credit, let's go in and make the corporate income tax not at 20 percent but at 22 percent or 25 percent in order to fund the child tax credit to help those on the bottom line of the economic ladder.  We should be coming together in a bipartisan manner to flip the priorities in this bill and to significantly increase the child tax credit. Obviously, that is what the American people want, but that is not the bill of goods that you are getting sold here tonight. By saying something is something, that doesn't make it so. It is what the facts are.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-12-01-pt1-PgS7655-2.txt,859,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,1,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1239,topic-id,314,"Mr.President, I intend to call up my motion to commit the bill to the Finance Committee, which is at the desk, and it is supported by Senator  Mr.President, while we are working out the consent, the tax bill before us is not for the middle class. As a matter of fact, this is a big cut for corporations. This is not a cut for you. It is not a cut for hard-working families. It is so lopsided as a cut to big corporations.  The fact is that it is not for the middle class. We need to be frank. The truth is that the bill treats the corporations much better than regular people. For example, over a 10-year period, if you make $75,000 or less, you will be hurt by this bill. If you are a small business owner and your taxes are a passthrough at the individual rate, your taxes are going to be much higher than large, multinational corporations. If you buy your health insurance in the individual market, there is a good chance that you are going to lose access to affordable health insurance. These are the facts, and it is just plain and simple.  Sure, there are tax cuts for some of the middle class, but those tax cuts go away after 8 years. In 2026, they are gone. By contrast, the tax cuts for big corporations are made permanent, and that is simply not treating people fairly.  So what I am suggesting is that we send this bill to the Finance Committee to work out a bipartisan compromise on how to make middle-class tax cuts permanent. There were 17 of us that stood up in the press gallery yesterday and said we are for a bipartisan compromise. I would hope a majority of my colleagues would support that, and I ask for your support.

1458,topic-id,1022,"Madam President, one cannot say it much better than the Senator from Massachusetts has said it. Everyone has come to expect a free and open internet--one that does not charge more for certain content and charge less for favorite content. It is supposed to be free. It is supposed to be open. It should be balanced. Hopefully, since it seems that the Pai regime is, in fact, going down this road, there will be immediate lawsuits that will be very time-consuming. At the end of the day, sometime in the future, there may be an opportunity for a legislative solution, but it has to be a balanced solution that protects the right of the public to a free and open internet.                      Puerto Rico Recovery Effort  Madam President, I want to discuss another issue.  What do you think it would be like to be in your home for 3 months without electricity when all of your home appliances and all of your daily routines have been built around the fact that electricity has provided the power to run your home in the way that you would expect?  Do you know that half of the people of Puerto Rico, 3 months after Hurricane Maria, still do not have electricity? Is it any wonder that 160,000 people--our fellow citizens from Puerto Rico--have now chosen to get on an airplane and go to the State of Florida? Is it any stretch of the imagination that there will not be hundreds of thousands more? They see a land that was devastated by a category 4 hurricane--that verged on a category 5--and that covered the entire island, with remote parts of the island having been completely cut off for 2\1/2\ weeks from transportation to get there, except by air, like the town of Utuado, which is up in the mountains, that I visited shortly after the hurricane.  Is it any wonder that people like them are now being very creative and very inventive? There are neighbors helping neighbors. They are all coming together. But they have been without electricity for such a long period of time that the opportunities for jobs are drying up, businesses cannot open, and commerce has slowed. With a $250 plane ticket, in 2 hours they can be in Florida, and, indeed, that is what has happened--160,000, as of now, just to How many have gone to New York and to other States? We do not have that calculation, but we expect several hundred thousand more to go.  For all who come here, the island of Puerto Rico is their home. They want to return, but is there going to be a quick resumption of business? In its contracting through the U.Army Corps of Engineers, is FEMA going to get the electricity back up? Are there[[Page S7326]]going to be jobs? Are we going to change the tax law so that Puerto Rico does, in fact, have the incentives that it used to have in the past that had taken pharmaceutical companies there and rum companies there? A lot of those tax incentives have gone away, and we ought to be considering that in this tax bill. We ought to be considering the long-term cost that it is going to take to help restore the island. Until that is done, what do you think people have done? This is exactly what they have done, and they are going to continue to come.  As a result, we have a different problem in a State in which so many of their families already live and where they have been living with relatives. Now it is time for them to be able to have their own families and their own places to live. Yet we do not have the provisions in order to give them the financial support to be able to afford housing. Suppose 300,000 Puerto Ricans go to Florida alone. Do they have the money? Are they able to get jobs right away so that they will have the money for housing? That is why we are going to have to have financial incentives.  That is why, in a bill that was filed last week by this Senator, along with several others, there is a provision--if we can pass this legislation--for HUD, or the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to have the financial wherewithal to then supply housing needs, many times through subsidized housing, in the case of an incident like this hurricane, in which an emergency has occurred and has caused a huge dislocation of people to another  Since it is going to be hard to get legislation like this passed in a timely fashion and the need is desperate right now and since the last supplemental emergency appropriation for all of the hurricanes did not include the housing part for the ones who are going to Florida, in the meantime, in this next supplemental that will come just before Christmas--emergency supplemental funding--we will need to provide that.  Then the question will be this: Where, for example, in Central Florida--in the Orlando metro area--will they actually be able to find housing that will be available without their having to drive hundreds of miles to find housing that will be affordable, even with additional assistance? The people who can work this problem out are in the local governments. They are the ones who know best the situation.  As we get ready before Christmas for a final appropriations bill with emergency supplemental funding because of all of the hurricanes, which, indeed, will come--it will just be the next installment of many installments to come in the new year--let us remember that housing is going to be critical for a huge number of people who have been dislocated and have to strike out and find new lives, new jobs, and new places to call home, which clearly means that they will have to have places to call home, and those are places to live--housing.

1638,topic-id,1357,"Mr.President, I am here to discuss the tax bill, what we have done before, and what we have now in front of us. That is not what the American people want. It is what large corporations want--large, multinational corporations that get their corporate tax rate cut from 35 to 20 percent. It is what the well-to-do want. That is what is before us.  Now, let me explain. Anyone who says that this bill is all for the middle class is not giving the full story. What they are not telling you is that the tax cuts for the middle class expire in 7 or 8 years. That is not what is being told.  Folks are not telling you that this bill will put small businesses at a competitive disadvantage, making it easier for large, multinational corporations to crush local small businesses. I say this as a Senator from Florida, since small business is the economic backbone of our State, not the large multinational corporations.  What people are not telling you is that this bill will cause healthcare premiums to go up by 10 percent and will force 13 million people to lose their health insurance, and that is according to an independent analysis by CBO, the Congressional Budget  Folks are not telling you that this bill will send thousands of jobs--American jobs--overseas. It is not a jobs bill; it is a bill that is going to send jobs overseas because the tax rate for income produced overseas for large, multinational corporations is going to be less than the tax rate for those same corporations producing the income in This is exactly what is in the bill.[[Page S7382]]  They are not telling you all the other ways that CBO says this bill will hurt ordinary For example, beginning in 2019, CBO says anyone making under $30,000 a year will take a hit from this bill if it becomes law. Then, in 2021, anyone making under $40,000 will start to feel the pinch. Finally, in 2027, anyone making under $75,000 is actually going get a tax increase. That is what folks are not telling you, but that is what is in print in the bill. All the while, the big, multinational corporations and those at the economic top will continue to reap the benefits of tax cuts.  This is not fooling; this is what the bill says. Once folks find out what is in this bill, there is going to be a day of reckoning. The question is, When are they going to find out? Are they going to wait until they see that everybody--in about 7 years--earning under $75,000 is actually getting a tax increase? What the bill needs is balance.  This Senator is a member of the Finance We tried to add balance in the committee, but our Republican colleagues insisted on voting down every Democratic amendment that was brought up, only making changes on the margin to say that they had gone through regular order. An amendment of this Senator's to increase the child tax credit was voted down, 14 to 12.  In the meantime, the real bill is being written in secret by one party, with a new iteration to change it coming out almost every other day. I wish I were kidding. In fact, it came out the week before On Monday, we started marking it up. A new version came out on A new version came out on Then, in the markup on Thursday before Thanksgiving week, lo and behold, there was a new version with a so-called managers' amendment. The bill starts changing colors, with each new version trying to top the last in what it is doing to the middle class.  This isn't the way we should be doing the people's business. We ought to be coming together to find a way to negotiate a tax bill that works for most Americans, not pit red States against blue States or make it harder for cities to invest in infrastructure. We shouldn't have a tax bill that makes healthcare less affordable and takes healthcare away from 13 million people and, on top of all of this, that increases the national debt by almost $1.5 trillion on top of the $20 trillion of national debt.  What the American people want is for us to work together, to work on bipartisan compromise, but what we have is the opposite of that. The American people want the best way to ensure a good outcome for the widest majority of I daresay, if we put a tax bill on this floor in a bipartisan way, it would end up having 70 to 80 votes out of 100 Senators in a big, resounding, bipartisan vote, but that is not the course that has been chosen.  I want to give one other example. Some Senators are being told that the health insurance part of this bill ends up raising rates by 10 percent and taking health insurance away from 13 million They are saying that in a series of bills that this Senator has worked on in a bipartisan fashion, some of them being initiated in a bipartisan way out of the HELP Committee by Senator Alexander and Senator Murray--some are saying that those bills, including a bill that this Senator has cosponsored with Senator Collins to establish a reinsurance fund--and in some States, the use of it has lowered premiums by 20 percent--some say that all of those fixes to the Affordable Care Act will completely overshadow and take away the health insurance premiums that this tax bill has that CBO has said will raise premiums 10 percent.  That argument has been made why some Republican Senators should vote for this tax bill, but, in fact, the Congressional Budget Office came out today with a letter saying that that is not true, that the rates on what is being done in this tax bill on health insurance will still go up 10 percent almost every year for the next 10 years. That is not this Senator saying that; that is in a letter of November 29 by the Congressional Budget  So how we ought to do it is the same way the last major tax bill was passed. It was way back in 1986. It was when Ronald Reagan was President and the Speaker of the House was Tip O'They were two old Irishmen who used to fight like the dickens. But they had a personal friendship. They had a personal relationship. They could cut through all the political differences. When it was time to get things done, they could come to a bipartisan consensus. In 1986, they found a way to do it, and the middle class was the one that benefited.  We know it can be done. It has been done before. This isn't 1986; this is 2017. Things have changed. It has gotten a lot more partisan around here. It has gotten a lot more ideologically rigid. But when you are doing major tax bills that affect one-sixth of the American economy, isn't it time to revert to what we did back in 1986 when we came together in bipartisan consensus? As long as there is a will, there is a way. And in the midst of this extreme, toxic atmosphere of high partisanship, what I hope is that we might find the will to cut through that and say: Indeed, there is a way, and it is a bipartisan way. We just need willing partners on both sides.  I pray that will occur between now and Christmas before we do something we are going to regret, so that we can do something for the American economy and so that we can do something for the American people, that they finally say: This is the way I want our public servants to act. I want them to act in consensus building in a bipartisan or a nonpartisan way. I hope that will be our Christmas present.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

We have been trying to make the case that, indeed, we do this in a bipartisan way instead of being jammed through in a partisan way.

But we are going to send another hurricane to Puerto Rico if we pass this bill because of the provisions that are so punitive to Puerto Rico in this tax bill.  In this tax bill, there is a 20-percent penalty on businesses doing business in Puerto It is just unbelievable, a 20-percent penalty on companies that invest in Puerto Rico, causing one of the daily newspapers on the island, El Nuevo Dia, to state that 250,000 jobs would leave the island just as a result of that provision. That is not something we want to do to Puerto We want to help Puerto  Unfortunately, that is not all. The bill eliminates the section 199 manufacturing deduction for Puerto Rico, specifically in the law to encourage manufacturing in that island Commonwealth, a territory of our fellow U.citizens.  The bill also eliminates the rum cover, which is how they get a rebate for paying those excise taxes on the production of Puerto Rican and U.Virgin Islands rum. It is a means of offsetting the cost of economic development in those two territories, Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin  This bill further fails to put Puerto Rico residents on an equal footing with those on the mainland by giving them the same treatment on the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit.  First, the bill is so out of balance, to begin with. But then, when you get down to the specifics in so many of the items--now, in this particular item affecting Puerto Rico--this is not what we want to do.

2115,topic-id,520,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.3115, the land exchange between PolyMet Mining Corporation and the Superior National Forest of the U.Forest  Let me begin by saying that what the exchange involves is PolyMet giving up approximately 6,550 acres of forestland that is surrounded by old mining sites, with no public access. In return, they are giving us 6,690 acres, or an additional 40 acres, which is a wonderfully good deal for the taxpayers and the concerns of the environment, if people just look at the exchange.  At the end of the day, the taxpayers get more land and more value--$425,000, to be exact. There is no cost to the taxpayers. The public gets more access to the land. They get more lakeshore property, more timberland, more wild rice land, and more wetlands.  If approved and if the PolyMet Mining project should ultimately go forward--by the way, it has received the highest marks that any mining project has ever received from the EPA, after almost 12 years of review--the simple truth is that this is a good bill for the public.  Let me say it is important to note that there are some things that this bill does not do. I need to say that because there is some terrible misinformation floating around out there.  Number one, it does not authorize a mining project. Let's make that very clear.  Number two, it does not interfere with the State and Federal environmental review processes, procedures, and permitting process.  Most importantly, the preponderance of the information coming into my office is concern for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, and rightfully so. I was an original sponsor of that legislation back in the day before I took my little 32-year hiatus. There is no more precious, pristine area in this country--perhaps, the world--that needs to be protected.  Let me show you something. For those of you who weren't paying attention in science class, there is the Continental The water north of that flows north and water to the south of that flows south.  This project is south of the Continental Divide, so there is physically no way possible, short of a nuclear bomb or getting hit by a planet or something, that that water can flow into and in any way harm or damage the Boundary  To be specific, right here, there already is a 60-year-old mining project, Northshore They have been mining there 60 years.  And by the way, there is sulfur in that soil, as well. It has never caused any damage to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area  This is a good bill for the environment, good for jobs, and it is good for the community. In no way can it harm or damage the Boundary Waters or I wouldn't be standing here today advocating for its purchase.  I urge my colleagues to adopt this important piece of legislation. I remind them that it has good bipartisan support from our Minnesota Senators and the Governor, bipartisan support from our congressional delegation, chambers of commerce, and the trade unions.  It is a good bill, and I urge its adoption.                              {time}  1700  ",CREC-2017-11-28-pt1-PgH9445.txt,867,EXECUTIVE CALENDER--Continued,2017,28,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a 30-year celebration for the First Baptist Church in Rock Hill, South It is also celebrating a pastor that has stood the test of time. He has done amazing things at this church.  Let me tell you what has occurred over the past 30 years.  The church relocated in April 2004 to an 84,000-square-foot facility. It was 52 acres of land. Mr.Speaker, I can tell you, when the First Baptist Church made that move, the land out there was a forest. You didn't see the shopping centers, you didn't see the fast food, you didn't see the service stations and the clothing stores that are there now. They took a chance on faith.  I remember when the board took that vote, it wasn't a simple majority. They had to have an 80 percent-plus in agreement of the board to locate there. If that is not democracy, I don't know what is.  The budget was $490,000. It increased $2,637,800.  They have had over 1,500 baptisms.  They sponsored the first African-American congregation for membership in the York Baptist Association in 1994.  They sponsored a second African-American congregation for membership in the York Baptist Association in 2017.  Let me tell you about Pastor  Pastor Hogg was born on January 14, 1958. He was born in Roxana, He was baptized and ordained in the First Baptist Church of Whitesburg, He has been pastor of the Bethel Baptist He has been pastor of the Colson Baptist He has been the summer missionary at the First Baptist And he has been the bus minister at the First Baptist Church in  Some of the honors and offices that he has devoted his time and talent to have been the South Carolina Baptist Convention, where he was president from 1993 to 1994. He was president of the Pastor's He was chairman of the United Christian Baccalaureate Planning He was on the Billy Graham Carolinas Crusade Executive He was a charter member of the city of Rock Hill No Room for Racism  Some of the new things he has started while at First Baptist Church in Rock Hill were the contemporary worship service, deaf ministry, women and men's ministries, television broadcasts of morning worship services, live streaming of worship services, Sunbeams Day School, and conducted eight capital fund campaigns.  Mr.Speaker, I could go on and on, but these 30 years are something to remember. It is something that ought to be a milestone for the church--and it is. If anybody has stood the test of time, it has been Steve Hogg and the First Baptist Church, and I commend the congregation.

I spent 40 years of my career developing land and actually buying manufactured housing, which makes it possible for families who cannot afford a stick-built home, in many cases, to be able to buy a manufactured house. I have seen firsthand the critical role that manufactured housing plays in the development of local communities and the ability for a family to buy their first home.  As we have seen far too often, regulatory overreach by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has impeded and stopped, in many cases, the ability for consumers to receive financing for manufactured housing, and has placed unnecessary requirements on retailers. This legislation addresses this overreach by making commonsense reforms to increase the availability and financing for manufactured housing, while maintaining important protections for consumers.

Mr.Chairman, you can call this bill whatever you want, but it is not a reform bill. It creates a problem in order to get rid of it.  Mr.Chairman, 0.18 percent is all of the employees who get dismissed. The sponsor must want more. Instead of taking that as an indication of the competency and of the excellence of Federal employees--under 1 percent, only 0.18--there must be more to be[[Page H9552]]fired than that. The data shows the opposite.  The Federal workforce has consistently been understood to be the best qualified public employees in the country however you look at them, particularly with their education and with their efforts.  The first reason the sponsor gives for this bill is that managers ``simply lose track of time and are unaware of the 1-year deadline approaching.''  Whose competency should we be checking? Not the employees, surely. Management should be doing its job. They are paid big Federal bucks precisely for that.  But they are paid to do something else. They are paid to observe. They are not observing if they are not even looking for the 1-year deadline wherein they could fire an employee.  They are supposed to assist employees during that first year. They are supposed to help correct employees during that first year.  What are they doing during that first year losing track of it? Who bears the burden is the employee who may be perfectly competent but wasn't receiving the assistance or the oversight to which she was entitled.  We are moving without information that would help us understand if there is a problem. What is the reason for not calling witnesses to find out if there is a problem? Because if there is, then we ought to do something about it.  We do know this: 36 percent of all the employees dismissed are dismissed in that first year. That would seem to indicate that maybe management is doing its job.  Today's young workforce is always looking for better opportunities. Pass this bill, and you chase away the best and the brightest from even applying to work for the American people.

1903,topic-id,277,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the chair and ranking member of the committee for bringing this bill forward at a time of national crisis in the workplace on sexual harassment.  When I chaired the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which was 15 years after the statute had been passed, sexual harassment had not even been defined as a form of workplace discrimination. We held hearings and so defined it, and the Supreme Court thereafter affirmed the EEOC guidelines.  Congress, nevertheless, exempted itself until 30 years later when in 1995--prompted by a controversy involving Members of the Congress--brought Congress under 13 major civil rights and labor laws. But mysteriously--and I still can't understand why--Congress exempted itself from the easiest provision, the provision we bring forward today for posting and training. I will never understand that failure, but we are trying to move forward today.  There are other needed provisions, and I have introduced a bill to bring the comprehensive provisions that we now require of the legislative branch or the private sector forward, and I thank the Committee on House Administration for continuing to work on these issues, too.  Congress failed in 1964. Congress failed again in 1995. Now, in 2017, it is impossible to justify exempting congressional offices and Members of Congress from the comprehensive provisions Congress now requires of private employers and Federal agencies. We will never be respected until we are brought under the same laws as everybody else.  Congressional staff deserve the same civil and antidiscrimination protections afforded to other Federal employees. It is important that powerful figures who play an outsized role here in Congress be brought to the same level as other employers.

1463,topic-id,459,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Mr.Speaker, for years, the middle class has been saddled with a broken Tax Code and low wages. Small businesses have been crushed by overly complicated rules and a higher tax burden than corporations.  As a result, America has suffered from a self-inflicted uncompetitive Tax Code, lagging behind the rest of the world both in economic growth and job creation. Companies have fled for lower tax jurisdictions and more competitive business environments.  Since the 1986 Tax Reform Act was passed, Washington has continued to make the Tax Code longer and more complicated, adding special interest loopholes and industry-specific carve-outs back into the Code year after year.  This has allowed the Tax Code to dictate business decisions instead of letting businesses dictate business decisions.  For the first time in 31 years, we are wiping the Tax Code clean and replacing it with one that is fair and simpler for everyone.  For the better part of my career, I have advocated for a cash-flow tax system that would allow small businesses to expense 100 percent of their costs immediately. H.1 contains an expensing provision that would give businesses the tremendous opportunity to reinvest, allowing them to grow their businesses and create jobs.  The impacts for the American economy would be huge. Small businesses across rural California, from the small family-owned farm to the neighborhood restaurant and any other entrepreneur, deserve a type of tax system that allows them to create jobs and be able to compete on an equal footing globally.

Mr.Speaker, that is always what the left says about the However, you will also hear a lot of talk about people who itemize and SALT deductions and how those are somehow increasing taxes on the middle class.  The reality of this, Mr.Speaker, is these deductions go to millionaires and billionaires. So for my friends on the left, you can't have it both ways. You can't claim that Republicans are giving tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires when you are attempting to keep the very tax cuts called SALT, State and local tax deductions, that go to millionaires and billionaires.  Mr.Speaker, in closing, I want to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Brady and all my colleagues on the Ways and Means For years, we have been working on this legislation, but this is a historic moment.

604,topic-id,549,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, EPA's brownfields program has changed the way contaminated property is perceived, addressed, and managed. I was proud to work with the late Republican Congressman Paul Gillmor in creating the brownfields program back in 2002, and I am proud to be here once again today as we bring up a bipartisan reauthorization of this law.  I want to thank our Environment Subcommittee, Chairman Shimkus, Ranking Member Tonko, our full committee chairman, Mr.Walden, for all their work in getting us to this point today, and, also, my colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure  By almost any metric, the brownfields program has been a remarkable success. Since the program's inception, more than 27,000 contaminated sites have been assessed or remediated, allowing communities to create new developments.  Removing public health hazards by cleaning up contaminated sites is incredibly important for the surrounding communities. With financial help from the Federal Government, communities can clean up contaminated sites and prepare them for development for parks, commerce, housing, or a number of other uses that can benefit a local community.  The EPA has found that cleaning up underutilized or abandoned brownfields properties reduces health risks, decreases pollution, and reduces storm water runoff. But this is not just a program that provides environmental benefits. It is a job creator that primes the pump for local investment and development. All told, the brownfields program has leveraged over $45 billion in investments surrounding these sites and almost 130,000 jobs, which is a stunning return on the Federal Government's modest investment in the program.  Simply put, it provides tremendous value to the Federal Government and a boost to the economy in local communities. The brownfields program has been an incredibly important tool for protecting public health and spurring economic growth in New Jersey and throughout the country.  The original authorization for the program expired in 2006, and while Congress has continued to appropriate resources for the program, funding has declined. Last year, there was a question as to whether the President would request any funding for this important program.  So it is important that we reauthorize the brownfields program. I stress the need for continued funding. H.3017 is a bipartisan bill that reauthorizes the program until 2022, at $200 million annually, and reinstates a $50 million annual authorization for grants to assist States and Native American And it makes important reforms to improve the flexibility of the brownfields program: authorizing multipurpose grants; raising the limits for grants per site; and removing some funding caps in current law.  Mr.Speaker, the bill also allows EPA to reserve as much as $1.5 million in brownfields funding each year to assist small communities, Tribes, and rural or disadvantaged areas. Grants could be used for training, research, and technical assistance. Additionally, H.3017 would require the EPA to consider the potential for renewable energy production when ranking applications for brownfields grants to incentivize green energy projects.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is a compromise. I would have liked to include more funding for this important program, but I believe this bill will improve the program and bolster the Federal Government in cleaning up these sites, and I support the bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, we had joint jurisdiction over this legislation, and, for the most part, this is a good product.  I was actually the ranking member on the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee 16 years ago when the initial brownfields legislation passed and later became law. We expected that the targeted reforms and Federal grant funds in the initial law would spur redevelopment of blighted areas and be of great benefit, and we were right. It has a proven record of success, assisting States and communities in redevelopment of abandoned or underutilized properties, leveraging Federal seed money with State, local, and private dollars, and creating jobs.  Now, here is an example.  In 2013, the city of Eugene, Oregon, got a $680,000 brownfield site assessment grant to improve the environment and spur economic development. The city used this funding for the assessment of 15 specific properties and for the development of a local redevelopment plan.  One of the results of this work is that the Ninkasi Brewery--as co-chair of the House Craft Brewers Caucus, I had to bring beer into the discussion--now sits on the site of a former Eugene brownfield. In a decade, they have 100 employees, and it is sold right here in Washington, D.C., today.  This year, Eugene was selected for an additional $500,000 in brownfield site assessments. I am hoping that they can replicate the success they had with their earlier grant from the Federal  I am pleased that we are considering this bill to extend the program through 2022. It will increase the funding limit from $200 to $500 per grant, authorize EPA to award multipurpose brownfields grants for projects consisting of multiple elements, and make nonprofit entities eligible for mediation assessment grants under the program. It will also allow local governments to apply for site assessment grants for properties acquired prior to the creation of the program.                              {time}  1445  Unfortunately, it falls short in two areas. The final version of this legislation that passed committee contained a provision ensuring that State and local governments that acquire brownfields properties continue to take steps to protect people from coming into contact with contamination on the property. In fact, I have a letter here from the Conference of Mayors where they say they would agree if there were two clauses: that they did not cause or contribute to the contamination and exercises due care with regard to any known contamination at the site.  Unfortunately, this bill strikes out the words ``due care,'' and with the liability exemption, there is the possibility that properties would be acquired that are dangerous for entry that wouldn't be properly fenced or secured because of removing the ``due care.'' I don't know why that had to come out, since the Conference of Mayors had supported it.  Second, nearly every stakeholder that testified before our committee stated that the current level of funding for the program is well below need, so we should be increasing the authorized and appropriated levels. Again, unfortunately, the bill under consideration today only reauthorizes flat funding levels for the program, which is, I think, a missed opportunity.  I hope, as we move forward and resolve any differences with the Senate, that we can make improvements in these areas.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me time.

Mr.Speaker, I would like to close by talking about how important this program has been to our Nation and, in particular, to my home State, since it was created back in 2002.  New Jersey has too many of these types of contaminated sites, and we need Federal help to clean them up and redevelop them.  For example, a former Dupont property on the waterfront in Carteret is being redeveloped to be a ferry terminal to carry commuters to New York That site is a great example of how a redeveloped brownfields site can be beneficial for the community.  Asbury Park, another town in my district, received two substantial Federal brownfields grants last year. One of those grants is being used to assess eight contaminated sites and prepare two cleanup plans. The other grant is going to assessing and redeveloping sites around the train station and the downtown area that were contaminated with petroleum.  Just this week, I visited another brownfields site being redeveloped in my district, the Woodbridge Waterfront When completed, the waterfront park will include approximately 30 acres of restored wetlands, walking trails, a boardwalk overlooking the wetlands, and a viewing platform on the Raritan So Federal funds through the brownfields program help make these projects happen.

The bill exacerbates dramatic and historic health inequality, wealth inequality. Adding $1.5 trillion to our national debt, as this bill does, without benefiting the middle and working class is legislative malpractice.  So while Republicans tout this as a middle class tax cut, some taxpayers at every income level will pay more on this bill. A middle-aged married couple with no children earning $80,900 a year who itemize could end up paying $4,330 more in 2018. Many of my constituents will see a big tax increase after losing the full State and local tax deduction. That is absurd.

One is a letter from the National Fraternal Order of Police, representing 330,000 police officers in this country coming out against this bill because it will affect their members in a very, very terrible way. The other is an article in The New York Times today: ``Republican Tax Plans Put Corporations Over People.''                                                National Fraternal                                              Order of Police,                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.Senate,     Washington,     Charles Schumer,     Minority Leader, U.Senate,     Washington,       Dear Mr.Speaker, Senator McConnell, Representative Pelosi      and Senator Schumer: I am writing on behalf of the members of      the Fraternal Order of Police to urge you to protect the      State and local tax (SALT) deduction in the current tax code.      Our members put their lives and safety at risk to protect our      homes, schools and communities. Their salaries and the      equipment they use are paid for by State and local taxes on      property, sales and income. These funds are then invested in      our law enforcement agencies and the men and women serving in      law enforcement.       The FOP is very concerned that the partial or total      elimination of the SALT deductions will endanger the ability      of our State and local governments to fund these agencies and      recruit the men and women we need to keep us safe. In      addition, our members are also citizens of these communities      who work and pay these State and local taxes. The elimination      of the SALT deductions, in whole or in part, will be deeply      harmful to them and their families, effectively raising their      taxes as much as $6,300 according to recent studies. The SALT      deduction has been part of the tax code since it was      originally drafted in 1913. Our members would certainly      oppose any effort of the Federal government to tax their      income twice by eliminating the SALT deduction.       On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal      Order of Police, I urge Congress to preserve the SALT      deductions, to reject any effort to eliminate, in whole or in      part, these deductions and oppose the final bill if these      deductions are included. I thank you in advance for your      consideration of our views. Please feel free to contact me or      my Senior Advisor Jim Pasco if I can provide any additional      information on this important issue.       Sincerely,                                                 Chuck Canterbury,     National                                  ____                [From the New York Times, 16, 2017]           Republican Tax Plans Put Corporations Over People                          (By Jim Tankersley)       Washington.--There are tough choices at the heart of the      Republican tax bills speeding through Congress, and they make      clear what the party values most in economic policy right      now: deep and lasting tax cuts for corporations.       The bill set to pass the House on Thursday chooses to take      from high-tax Democratic states, particularly California and      New York, and give to lower-tax Republican states that      President Trump carried in 2016, particularly Florida and      It allows for tax increases on millions of families      several years from now, if a future Congress does not      intervene, but not for similar increases on corporations.       The version of the bill moving through the Senate Finance      Committee chooses to give peace of mind to corporate      executives planning their long-term investments. That comes      at the expense of added anxiety for individual taxpayers,      particularly those in the middle class, who could face stiff      tax increases on 1, 2026.       A consistent conservative philosophy underpins all those      decisions. So does a very large bet--economically and      politically--on the power of business tax cuts to deliver      rapid wage growth to United States workers.       There is also the appearance, to liberal critics in      particular, of Republicans seeking to reward their prized      constituencies first, while leaving others to bear the      consequences if their most optimistic scenarios do not play      out.       The tax plans have evolved rapidly since House leaders      first introduced their bill at the beginning of the month.      Amendments in the Ways and Means Committee restored some      cherished tax breaks that had been targeted for elimination,      including those for adoptive parents, and expanded the bill's      tax breaks for owners of businesses that are not organized as      traditional corporations.       The Senate bill differed from the House version when it was      introduced last week, and broke further away on Tuesday      night, with a package of amendments that included repealing      the Affordable Care Act's mandate that most individuals buy      health insurance. To comply with procedural rules that would      allow Republicans to pass the bill on a party-line vote in      the Senate, the amendment also set an expiration date--     25, 2025--on all the individual tax cuts in the legislation.       The plans also differ on their treatment of state and local      tax deductions. The Senate would kill them entirely. The      House would maintain them only for property taxes and cap the      deduction at $10,000 a year. Economists generally say that      those tax breaks are inefficient. But eliminating them, in      the context of the House bill, would add up to a large      geographic transfer of income, according to research by Carl      Davis, the research director of the Institute on Taxation and      Economic Policy in       The House bill would raise personal taxes on Californians      and New Yorkers by a combined $16 billion in 2027, Mr.Davis      found, while cutting personal taxes on Texans and Floridians      by more than $30 billion in total.       His analysis finds only one state that Mr.Trump carried in      2016 --Utah--would receive lower personal tax benefits under      the bill than would be expected, given its share of national      income, compared with 11 states won by his Democratic rival,      Hillary The average Clinton state would receive 82      percent of its expected benefits, by share of national      income, under the plan. The average Trump state would receive      181 percent.       ``It's not unusual for a tax bill to have varying impacts      in different parts of the country,'' Mr.Davis said. ``But      the degree to which this bill makes winners and losers out of      different states is remarkable.''       Curtailing state and local deductions helps finance a core      feature of both the House and Senate bills, which happens to      be one of the few provisions Mr.Trump has called      nonnegotiable in tax discussions: cutting the corporate      income tax to a flat 20 percent rate, down from a top rate of      35 percent today. Republicans have kept those cuts permanent,      even as the Senate applied an expiration date to the      individual cuts and to a key tax credit for families in the      House bill. The Senate bill also sets an expiration date on      breaks for so-called pass-through businesses, whose owners      pay taxes on profits through the tax code for individuals.       In Washington, Republicans have stressed that cutting      corporate taxes will supercharge economic growth,      accelerating job creation and raising wages in the process.      By that theory, making such cuts permanent is essential.       The gamble is apparent. Polls show that voters want      corporations to pay higher, not lower, taxes and that they      doubt corporate rate cuts will show up in their own      paychecks, as the White House has claimed. Perhaps not      coincidentally, Republican leaders have pitched their bills      largely as middle-class tax cuts, stressing the benefits for      the typical American family during television appearances and      news conferences.       ``The policy expects that the corporate tax cuts will do      the most for growth,'' said Lanhee Chen, a research fellow      at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, who was the      policy director for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in      2012. ``On the other hand, they're the hardest to explain.''       It is an especially tricky explanation in the context of      the requests Republicans are making of individual taxpayers,      particularly the middle class, to trust that any benefits      they see from the bills will not vanish over a decade. The      Senate bill is scheduled to deliver an individual tax      increases on 137 million tax filers in 2027 if Congress does      not intervene first, according to calculations by Ernie      Tedeschi, an economist at Evercore Liberals warn the      shock would be huge for low- and middle-income families.       Republicans are ``making a choice as to which elements of      their plan are permanent,'' said Jacob Leibenluft, a senior      adviser at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a      former economic aide under President Barack Obama, ``and I      think it's worth starting with taking them at face value.''       Canceling those looming increases would further add to the      federal budget deficit, if the move is not paired with      spending cuts. Middle-class families planning ahead can      imagine two possible consequences from that decision: Either      an immediate increase in their taxes eight years from now, or      an explosion in federal budget deficits, which could      necessitate spending cuts to safety net programs like Social      Security and       ``The bill reflects talking out of both sides of your mouth      at the same time--neither of[[Page H9390]]     which is leading to good policy,'' said Maya MacGuineas, the      president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal       Republican leaders in both chambers have said that they      will not allow individual tax breaks to expire--and that      their corporate cuts will yield enough growth and additional      tax revenue to pay for themselves, or at least come close.

I have consistently fought for new equipment and advanced technology to provide physical protection for law enforcement when they are on duty. However, we must also ensure law enforcement has the resources and support and training to address mental health issues as well.  The stresses on law enforcement have continued to grow in recent years. This can have a big impact on officers' physical and mental well-being; that is why officer mental wellness needs to be a priority from the day of hire to the day of retire. We know too many officers struggle with depression, suicidal thoughts, post-traumatic stress disorder.

Mr.Speaker, I suspect I might be one of the few Members of Congress whose first house was a manufactured house. Not only that, but I represent a district where 50 percent of the homes are manufactured housing.  I think that it is important that we kind of separate the two discussions. If the CFPB were looking at the abuses and going after the abusers that I have heard talked about from the other side, there might not be a discussion today, but that is not what the CFPB did.  What the CFPB did is say that all balloon notes are bad. I can't find any bank, from the East Coast to the West Coast, that will come into New Mexico and lend $33,000 for a used mobile home and put it on a 30-year note. You can tear up a mobile home within days.  So balloon notes are simply made in order for people to come in and check. They didn't use them to maybe put bad adjustments and higher interest rates or anything. They just want to be able to look.  So they generally put these loans on a 5-year basis. At the end of 5 years, if everything is good, we continue to roll it. We don't start from scratch. We don't charge you prejudicial interest.  But all balloon notes were made illegal by the They were declared to be prejudicial in their nature when they weren't.

What happens in New Mexico, somebody will buy a trailer house, a manufactured home. They will live in it, pay for it, buy another one, and over their lifetime accumulate 10 or 15. Then, when they retire, they begin to sell one at a time.  If you sell more than one or two, the CFPB said: You are now a broker-dealer, and we are not going to let you operate unless you become licensed. So it shut off much of the access of just one seller selling to another.  We brought the CFPB in. We brought Kelly Cochran, about 5 years ago, to[[Page H9580]]walk through these and say: Please, we understand what you are trying to do. No one wants to be protecting those who are violating consumer rights, but just get it within its lane.  Kelly Cochran was there for almost an hour and admitted that she was not aware of the many things brought up that were on-the-ground problems. They never changed them. Mr.Cordray continued to assert that he had solved all the problems, when he had never solved any of the problems.  Most of the banks in New Mexico--and I live right on the Texas line--in that region of Texas and New Mexico, just quit offering to finance manufactured housing. That meant the people who needed it the most had no access to credit.  We discussed these items in the open hearings many times with the CFPB Director, Mr.Cordray, and it just seemed like they could never get focused on those.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

853,topic-id,1518,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding; and I thank him, and the Democratic members of the Ways and Means Committee, for being committed to the truth: to the facts.  To hear the distinguished chairman of the committee say what he said about the budget is almost ludicrous, almost laughable, if it weren't so serious, in terms of the impact that it has on America's future. He knows that, in the last 4, and maybe even 5, years of the Clinton administration, the budget was in balance or in surplus--the operational budget--and it was on a path to reducing the national debt, until President Bush came in, gave tax cuts to the high end, a giveaway to the pharmaceutical industry with the Medicare part D legislation, and three unpaid for wars.  That is what the experts will tell you increased the deficit that was on a path of the national debt going down. It was a swing, Mr.Speaker, of $11 trillion: to date, the biggest swing in history.  When President Obama came into office, he was inheriting a deficit--I am not talking about the national debt; I am just talking about the annual deficit--of $1.4 billion. When he left office, it was about a third of that.  So don't try to mislead the American people. We owe them the truth. We owe them facts. That is why what is happening tonight in this body is so important: the violence that the Republicans are doing with their legislation on the economy of our country, robbing from our children's future to reward the wealthiest people and biggest corporations in  Mr.Speaker, I rise tonight to ask my colleagues a simple question: Who do we represent when we come to this floor?  The American people, overwhelmingly, oppose the GOP tax scam--they see it as that--and they are making their voices heard.  The American people are calling the Republican Congress to abandon the House and Senate bills, which pillage the middle class and pad the pockets of big CEOs and GOP donors.  The American people want us to start over and, actually, put the middle class first.  We should be working in a bipartisan way in order to do that, so that it will not only be right, but that it will be sustainable, and that there will be some certainty in our economy that this is a path forward that has bipartisan support.  But have the Republicans in the people's House listened to the American people? No.[[Page H9610]]  Last month, House Republicans voted to raise taxes. In this House, House Republicans voted to raise taxes on 36 million middle class American families: stripping deductions from students and teachers, children and seniors, and homeowners and workers. They kept saying they were going to work it out with the  Last week, in the dead of night, Senate Republicans voted to raise taxes on 78 million middle class families, while also spiking health premiums, and exploding the ranks of the health uninsured.  Tonight, heading into this conference on the House and Senate bills, Republicans have sent an unmistakable message to middle class America: Pick your poison. Because, with either bill, middle class families lose; the American people lose.  According to an analysis by The Washington Post, the GOP tax scam is ``probably the most regressive tax cut in the past 50 years. . . . It is hard to find a tax plan that has done less for the middle class.''  That is what we talked about. Who are we here to represent? Why are they doing this?  Well, they are doing this to give a tax cut to the top 1 percent. Sixty-two percent of the benefits of the Senate bill go to the top 1 percent in our country.  Is that fair, to give nearly $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to corporate America, while heaping other benefits on them to make it easier for them to send jobs overseas. Why? Well, some of their people have told us why.  Congressman Chris Collins said: My donors are basically saying, ``Get it done or don't ever call me again.''  Senator Lindsey Graham has said the ``financial contributions will stop,'' if the tax scam fails. ``Scam'' is my added word.  The Director of National Economic Council, Gary Cohn, has said: ``The most excited group out there are the big CEOs, about our tax plan.''  This is interesting to see the Freedom Caucus, which I thought was a values-based caucus, committed to reducing the national debt: a debt that is being added to here that we may never recover from.  What happened to the Freedom Caucus? Weren't they supposed to be deficit hawks? Has that become an endangered species? It has become extinct. It does not exist on the Republican side, but it does exist on the Democratic side.                              {time}  2015  We intend to fight this robbing of the future of increasing the deficit into the trillions of dollars by fighting this bill to the end.  Where are all the Republicans who promised to reduce the deficit?  Where are our Republican colleagues who insist that we have no funds to spare for the healthcare of our children, the education of our young people, the job-creating infrastructure of the 21st century unless we find offsets?  Yet $1.5 trillion to corporate America, un-offset; tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country, un-offset.  That means children have to pay for their healthcare with their immunizations. It is absolutely appalling. It isn't a statement of values in any way.  Today, quietly, the Republicans--and some of them are admitting it with glee--are sharpening their knives for Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Recognizing how they are increasing, they are soaring the national debt, now they have to find some ways to pay for it, so they are coming after Medicare, Medicaid, and Social The understanding of some is that it is only a question of whether they do it this year or a following year after the election.  Well, I think you are in a lose-lose situation. I think you lose with your donors if you don't pass this bill, but you are going to lose with the American people if you do.  Democrats believe that people deserve better. We deserve bipartisanship in how we put this together so it is sustainable. We are offering a better deal, better jobs, better wages, and a better future.  The American people deserve real, bipartisan, permanent tax reform that puts the middle class first.  The truth is that our colleagues either choose to ignore or do not understand the gravity of the situation. As they say in ``The Music Man,'' this is a terrible assault on the middle class. So tonight, with the Democrats' motion to instruct conferees, we want the Republicans to show where they stand.  Will Republicans vote ``yes'' to protect the vital State and local tax deduction that enables people to live in a safe place? Or will they vote to double-tax middle class families, drive down home values, and endangering key funding for firefighters, law enforcement, and schools?  Will Republicans vote to protect the healthcare of those with preexisting conditions?  No, no, no, no, no.  Or will they vote to spike families' premiums and add 13 million more Americans to the ranks of the uninsured if this bill goes through?  I have said that this, with stiff competition by some of the other things they have put forth, is the worst bill in the history of the United States  Now, how can I make that claim?  Well, because it involves more money, hurts more people, increases the deficit by so much more. And just because everything is bigger in our country, the consequences of this bill, a multitrillion-dollar economy being addressed by a bill that had no hearings, no expert testimony, just with the speed of light, as Jamie Raskin says, the speed of light, in the dark of night, here we are.  Who else thinks this is not a good idea?  This is what the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has said: `` . . . this proposal appears to be the first Federal income tax modification in American history that will raise income taxes on the working poor while simultaneously providing a large tax cut to the wealthy. This is simply unconscionable.''  I believe them.  Let us remember the words of Augustine: ``A State which is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves.'' He said that 17 centuries ago.  When His Holiness Pope Benedict wrote about this in his first encyclical, God is Love, he went on to say: Sometimes you have to work hard to determine what justice is. But in doing so, you must beware of the dazzling blindness of money and power.  Apparently, you did not heed that.  Let us look honestly at the GOP tax scam before us. No justice.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on the motion to instruct conferees, to at least inject some element of fairness and common sense into this destruction, and then to reject this terrible bill.

1886,topic-id,769,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.Brady) for his leadership, and I thank Chairman Harper for his as well. I thank them for bringing this legislation to the floor.  Here it is, November 29, 2017, an historic day in the history of the Congress, a watershed moment in our Congress' history because it is a day in which we will take the opportunity to make change. This body is taking a constructive first step to protect all Members of our legislative community from harassment and discrimination in the workplace. This vote is vital to upholding the integrity of the U. We are grateful for the tremendous leadership of Congresswoman Jackie I have observed her leadership on this subject for a very long time. She has a lifetime commitment to exposing and ending the scourge of sexual harassment. I thank her for that leadership.  I want to also acknowledge my own daughter, Christine Pelosi, who is the chair of the Women's Caucus of the California Democratic She is a former prosecutor in San Francisco and prosecuted these cases, and she has been a strong, strong advocate for protecting people in the workplace and has had some level of success with that.  So here we are at this watershed moment in the nationwide fight against sexual harassment and discrimination. Brave women in every corner of the country and in every industry are making their voices heard. As Members of Congress, we have a moral duty to show real, effective leadership to foster a climate of respect and dignity in the workplace, with absolutely zero tolerance for harassment, discrimination, or abuse. Anything less is unacceptable.  Requiring the Members and the staff to take training, while valuable--and we must have it--must be only a first step. We must make sure that that training is very effective as well. But the next step for Congress to take is to pass the ME TOO Congress Act, introduced by Congresswoman Speier, to create greater transparency and accountability in the broken reporting and settlements system.  Taxpayer money should not have been spent to build a culture of silence and complicity around workplace harassment. We must make a judgment about how that was used. This bill, the ME TOO Congress Act, will reform the shameful secret settlements policy that has persisted. It will ensure that survivors who wish to share their stories publicly can come forward, and they can come forward to the Ethics  We want to create a culture that says to everyone who comes to work here: This will be hospitable for you. We want it to be a culture that is a model to the  In addition to that, Mr.Speaker, this moment is a moment of truth for It is disappointing and disturbing that some in the Capitol have not served with the dignity and respect required of this office. It is very hard to accept that people we admire in public life and here in Congress have crossed the line and broken the public trust and violated the dignity and respect of those who have worked for or with them.  But zero tolerance means consequences for everyone. No matter your contribution to our country, you do not get a pass to harass or discriminate. No matter how great the legacy, it is not a license to harass or abuse.  To the victims of harassment and abuse: We hear you, and we believe you. We are here for you.  Where there is harassment, women and men must have support to come forward. We have a duty, again, to address their concerns and provide them needed resources.  We don't want to lose the leadership or service of any patriot who comes to work in or around We cannot let harassment or discrimination destroy their safety or drive them out of public office. We cannot tell young[[Page H9493]]women or men who aspire to serve in this historic body that they must put up with harassment and abuse.  Mr.Speaker, I want to just close by again thanking Congresswoman Jackie Speier for her leadership and thanking Chairman Harper, Mr.Brady, and all who are concerned.  It is utterly unconscionable that courageous survivors who seek to end the nightmare of sexual harassment are also dealt the injustice of having their voices silenced. During this watershed moment, we must seize the moment and take real, lasting action. The eyes of the country are on us. We cannot fail them or any prospective victims.

2059,topic-id,3514,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and thank him for his superb leadership as the top Democrat on the Ways and Means I commend him, and all of our fellow Democrats on the committee, for standing up for the middle class in our country and fighting for the truth and what is in this bill.  Mr.Speaker, this vote today is a defining moment for our country. Our votes today will decide the future of the American middle class and those who aspire to it, the future of our children and our grandchildren, and the future of the United States of America as the land of opportunity.  Today, Republicans have brought forth a bill that is pillaging the middle class to pad the pockets of the wealthiest and hand tax breaks to corporations shipping jobs out of America and drastically increasing the national debt.  The bill Republicans have brought to the floor today is not tax reform. It is not even a tax cut. It is a tax scam. So many people have written in about it who are affected by it, and I will submit all of that for the Record, but I do want to say that this is not only a defining moment, it is a moment of truth.  With straight faces and with the speed of light--I have to give them credit; they raced this thing through in the dark of night--they are trying to sell a bill of goods to the middle class that this is in their interest, that this is a middle-income tax cut.  According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, Republicans are raising taxes on 36 million middle class families.  I associate myself with the very wonderful comments of our distinguished House Democratic whip, Mr.Hoyer, especially at the end when he said: ``Look to your souls, not to your polls.''  I want to speak to Pope Benedict, his encyclical, God is love. It was his first encyclical as pope, and in that encyclical, Pope Benedict quoted the wisdom of  Seventeen centuries ago, Augustine said: ``A state which is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves.''  Benedict went on to say: ``The state must inevitably face the question of how justice can be achieved here and now.'' And he cautioned against the ``danger of certain ethical blindness caused by the dazzling effect of power and special interests.''  Interesting, in light of the fact that when this bill is brought forward, the[[Page H9409]]Director of the National Economic Council, Gary Cohn, said: ``The most excited group out there are the big CEOs, about our tax plan.''  Is that about justice?  Congressman Chris Collins said: ``My donors are basically saying, get it done or don't ever call me again.''  Senator Lindsey Graham said: ``The financial contributions will stop'' if this tax scam fails.  Well, he didn't say scam. I am saying scam. That is my word.  Back to the Pope and the Catholic bishops. The U.Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote: `` . . . this proposal appears to be the first Federal income tax modification in American history that will raise income taxes on the working poor while simultaneously providing a large tax cut to the wealthy.''  The U.Conference of Catholic Bishops went on to say: ``This is simply unconscionable.''  We always begin our session with prayer, and many of us attend mass on the weekend, on But we cannot pray and think that that gives us a lesson to prey on people the rest of the week; and that is what this bill does. It preys on the middle class and those aspiring to it. It pillages and loots the middle class. It is a shameful piece of legislation, and the Republicans should know better.  They say it is going to get better in the Oh my gosh. In the Senate, as Mr.Hoyer pointed out, unanimously, the Senate Finance Committee rejected this proposal already. Was it 26-0? Whatever the number was, the zero loomed large.  But getting back to values, because that is what we are here to do, and what we do in our budget, which the tax bill is a part of. It is supposed to be a statement of values.  In his study of civilization, the great British historian, Arnold Toynbee, found that, at the beginning of a hopeful country, the political leadership formed a creative minority that inspired and led the flowering of civilization. But in some nations, leaders became a dominant minority of ``exploiters, focused on their own wealth and power.  Arnold Toynbee, welcome to the Republican side of the aisle and  These competing mindsets, he went on, between the dominant minority of exploiters versus the creative minority that inspired and led the flowering of civilization, these competing mindsets and motivations create schisms in the body social and schisms in the soul of the body politic.  And lo and behold, the Republican Party has written a bill, nearly half of the benefits go to the top 1 percent--top 1 percent in our country--and 80 percent of the benefits go to the top 2 percent. This is a defining moment, but it is also a moment of truth  How can the Republicans, with a straight face, say to the middle class: Well, we are doubling this or doubling that? Give with one hand, take with another.  And to hear them cheer, hear them cheer for the provision in here about the estate tax?  Listen to this. You tell me if you think this is fair.  1,800 families in America--not your family farmer. Everybody is taken care of in what we have done already with the estate tax.  In this bill, 1,800 of the wealthiest families, the filers in our country, will, in the life of the bill, get the break of $172 billion; 1,800 families. This is for 1,800 families.  And you know what? The Republicans cheered that; 1,800 families are going to get $172 billion.  They cheer the fact that up to $1.5 trillion in tax cuts goes to corporate America, while, at the same time, giving them another tax break to send jobs overseas; at the same time, absolving them of any responsibility when it comes to State and local taxes; while insisting that individuals lose the State and local tax deduction, but corporations do not.  And listen to all of it. Were they cheering when they are saying to a teacher--hear their cheering when they say to a teacher: You may bring supplies to your school because your school and classes need that? God bless you for that. But we are taking away the tax deduction that goes with that.  What? Is that something to cheer about?  They are saying to students who get a $2,500 tax deduction on interest on student loans: Forget about that. Even though it may make the difference between your attending college or not, forget about that. We are too busy giving a tax cut to the 1,800 wealthiest families in America so they can get $172 billion in tax breaks over the next 10 years.  They are saying to families, whether they have a child with a disability, a senior with Alzheimer's, and everything in between: If you have extraordinary medical expenses, and, since 1944, you have been able to deduct them, no more. No more, because we have got to give it to the high end. So take that away.  Do you have any idea what that means to America's working families, and what it means for them if they have Alzheimer's?  We had one person come to our event in San Francisco last week from Barbara Lee's district. She said there was over $170,000 in costs for her because her husband has Alzheimer's. The tax deduction enabled them to survive. She said: I can't even imagine the cruelty that decided that this should happen in this tax bill.  So understand what this means in people's lives, and tell the truth about it. Tell the truth about it.  Republicans want you to believe that their trickle-down tax break for the rich will pay for itself. Never has happened.  As Bruce Bartlett, architect of Jack Kemp's supply-side economics said, ``It is not true,'' that this trickle-down economics pays for itself. ``It is not true. It is nonsense.'' And he went on to say it was ``BS,'' in the full extent of those words.  This tax scam won't create jobs. It won't raise wages. It will only fill the coffers of the donors and the fat cats. The GOP tax scam will add trillions to the debt and stick our children with a bill that you cannot pay off.  And none of us will probably be around by the time the full impact of the hemorrhaging of the debt in the second 10 years of this bill will require big tax increases. Look to the Kansas example.  As I like to say to the Caucus, Mr.Speaker, maybe I have to use my mother-of-five voice to be heard. But as a mother of five and a grandmother of nine, we are supposed to be thinking about our children and their futures, and our grandchildren and their futures.  God willing, one day some of you will have grandchildren. I always ask the question: Do they breathe air? Do they drink water?  Why are you messing that up in other areas of our policymaking here?  But getting back to this. The tax scam won't create jobs. It won't raise wages. As I said: It will only fill the coffers of donors and the fat cats.  This GOP tax scam will add trillions to the debt. Oh where, oh where are the deficit hawks? Have you become extinct? Is there not one among you who understands what this does to the national debt?  And with all due respect to your leader, for him to put at our doorstep the debt, when it was a creation--President Bush went into office on a path from President Clinton of deficit reduction. The last five Clinton budgets were in balance or in surplus. President Bush turned that around by repealing pay-as-you-go. Tax cuts for the wealthy didn't trickle down. Two unpaid-for wars, giveaways to PHARMA, the pharmaceutical industry, taking us to a place--remember September of 2008, when we were in the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression?  But anyway, back to here. As Republicans know, our Republican friends have already shown us their playbook. In this bill, corporations will get a cut of $1.5 trillion--the same $1.5 trillion that Republicans plan to slash from Medicare and Medicaid in the GOP budget.  In their bones, the American people know they are getting a raw deal under the Republican bill before us. You know it. You know why you are here. You know what you are doing.  Democrats believe the American people deserve better, a better deal, better jobs, better wages, better future. We want to create good-paying jobs, raise workers' wages, lower the cost of living for families, give Americans the tools[[Page H9410]]they need to succeed in the 21st century. But you can't do that if you have a budget that does not invest in that future and is hampered by the cuts.                              {time}  1315  Let's go back to the drawing board. Let's write a bipartisan bill that raises wages, creates jobs, promotes growth, and reduces the deficit. To get to that place, we want to go to the table in a bipartisan way. What are you afraid of? In a bipartisan way, let's put together a tax bill that is good for the American people instead of one that does violence to the American  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``no'' and to demand a better bill for America's working families.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the U.Conference of Catholic Bishops' fabulous statement about this tax bill.                                       United States Conference of                                             Catholic Bishops,                                 Washington, DC, November 9, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: Decisions about taxation involve      fundamental concerns of ``justice and equity'', with the goal      of taxes and public spending ``becoming an instrument of      development and solidarity'' (Mater et Magistra, 132;      Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church, no. 355). On      October 27, the USCCB offered six moral principles to guide      debate on tax reform, centered on care for the poor and      concern for families. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017      contains many fundamental structural flaws that must be      corrected. As currently written, the proposal is      unacceptable.       Care for the Doubling the standard deduction will      help some of those in poverty to avoid tax liability, and      this is a positive good contained in the bill. However, as      written, this proposal appears to be the first federal income      tax modification in American history that will raise income      taxes on the working poor while simultaneously providing a      large tax cut to the wealthy. This is simply unconscionable.      The nonpartisan congressional Joint Committee on Taxation      (JCT) indicates that by 2023 this tax plan will raise taxes      on average tax payers making between $20,000 and $40,000 per      year. Taxes for this group will be raised again in 2025, and      again in 2027. Taxes will also increase on average taxpayers      earning between $10,000 and $20,000 in 2025. The federal      poverty line is $12,228 for one person, and $24,339 for a      two-parent family with two children. Nearly one in three      Americans live in a family with income below 200% of the      poverty line. Meanwhile, average taxpayers who make over $1      million experience dramatic tax cuts for the same periods. No      tax reform proposal is acceptable that increases taxes for      those living in poverty to help pay for benefits to wealthy      citizens.       Several other tax provisions that assist the working poor      and others who may struggle economically are also eliminated,      including:       the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which incentivizes hiring      of the disabled, veterans, those who have been unemployed for      long periods, and individuals receiving federal poverty-     related assistance;       the tax deductions to reduce the burdens of tuition and      student loans;       the income tax credit to persons who retire on disability;       the deduction for state and local income and sales taxes,      which may impact people in higher tax states;       the tax deduction for employee business expenses; and       tax incentives to employers and employees to help with      moving expenses for a new job.       Strengthening Society, in Pope Francis' words, is      in ``debt'' to the family. The family is the most important      institution in society because education, formation, and care      for the human person, especially children, take place more in      the family than anywhere else. Expanded access to schools of      choice is a positive step in this legislation, and we would      encourage Congress to go even further by empowering more      parents in directing their child's education. We also      appreciate that the legislation recognizes unborn children as      eligible beneficiaries for parents' 529 education savings      account contributions.       However, this tax plan places new and unreasonable burdens      on families, especially those who welcome life or experience      serious hardships:       It removes the adoption tax credit which provides important      and life-affirming assistance for families to adopt children      desperately in need of love and support.       The plan also repeals the exclusion for adoption assistance      programs, which allows a family to exclude money paid by an      employer for adoption costs up to the amount of the adoption      tax credit as an alternative. This exclusion also allows      those who adopt a child with special needs to receive the      full value of the exclusion regardless of actual adoption      costs.       Eliminating the credit and exclusion sends the wrong      message about our national priorities, which ought to protect      life, strengthen families, and affirm the value of every      human being. The savings to society from children finding      loving homes is well beyond any revenue lost due to the      credit and exclusion.       It eliminates the personal exemption. Even with the      doubling of the standard deduction, some larger families will      pay more, including many two-parent families with more than      three children, and single-parent families with more than one      child. It is laudable that the child tax credit has been      expanded and removes the marriage penalty. However, the      modest increase in the credit does not fully compensate for      the elimination of the personal exemption for some larger      families. Moreover, because the child tax credit only remains      refundable up to $1,000, lower income families will get no      additional benefits from the child tax credit, while      suffering the full loss of the personal exemption.       It eliminates the out-of-pocket medical expenses deduction      for families facing serious or chronic illness.       It eliminates tax incentives to employers to provide      dependent care assistance or child care. The family      flexibility credit, at $300 per taxpayer, is some help, but      is set to expire after five years and does not offset the      greater losses.       It eliminates the qualified tuition reduction for children      of teachers, which will raise taxes on educational      institutions and disrupt family arrangements.       It repeals mortgage tax credit certificates, which are only      available for first-time home buyers under certain income      thresholds.       Other aspects of the plan also have consequences for      families. By creating stricter rules around parents' social      security numbers, the plan makes it more difficult for      immigrant taxpayers to receive the Child Tax Credit or the      Earned Income Tax Credit for their families, or to receive      assistance in seeking advancement through education.       Progressivity of the Tax Pope John XXIII wrote      that a progressive tax code is required by ``justice and      equity.'' The ``Unified Framework,'' upon which this tax plan      was based, promised that any new tax code would be ``at      least'' as progressive as the present code. This plan breaks      that promise. It raises taxes on the working poor, while      simultaneously providing large tax breaks to high-income      taxpayers. It also repeals the estate tax (which applies to      the estates of single people valued at more than $5.5 million      and married couples valued greater than $11 million), and      eliminates the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) which was      designed to prevent high-income earners from avoiding tax      liability through loopholes. In the years that the working      poor suffer a tax increase under this bill, millionaires and      billionaires will see significant tax decreases. This must be      fixed. Those who stand to benefit the most from proposed tax      policies ought to be the ones to bear most of the risk      associated with them, rather than those who are struggling      and in need.       Adequate Revenue for the Common Good and Avoiding Future      Cuts to Poverty The state has a legitimate role in      promoting the common good, and a legitimate interest in      collecting taxes to do so. This tax plan, by design, will      result in a nearly $1.5 trillion deficit over ten years. Even      with the potential benefits of economic growth from      individual and corporate tax cuts--which cannot be      guaranteed--the poor should not be the ones to finance these      changes. Undoubtedly, the deficit will be used as an argument      to further restrict or end programs that help those in need,      programs which are investments to help pull struggling      families out of poverty. Repeal of the AMT and estate tax      alone comprise a good portion of the deficit that is built      into the plan. Rather than exploring even modest reductions      to these dramatic cuts for the wealthiest, the bill raises      taxes on the vulnerable and creates a strong incentive to cut      the social safety net.       Incentive for Charitable Giving and Doubling      the standard deduction will bring tax relief to many people.      However, for those who give to charity, it will make the      charitable deduction increasingly a benefit only available to      high income families. An ``above-the-line'' deduction would      incentivize and assist charitable giving at all income      levels, and increase the amounts people can give. It would      also guard against a multi-billion-dollar decrease in      charitable giving that this plan would otherwise cause,      shrinking civil society and cutting income to nonprofits that      help the poor, just as government aid to the poor is      jeopardized, as noted above. By and large, money given to      charity helps those in need. The tax code should encourage      voluntary association, mutual aid, and a culture of giving,      helping rather than hurting groups that will be asked to do      more for the poor in the days ahead. Similarly, this plan      will lower the value of affordable housing and community      revitalization incentives. Public-private partnerships that      benefit the poor and the greater community should not be      discouraged.       Because tax policy is far-reaching, Congress must provide      ample time for Americans to discuss the complexities of these      reforms and fully understand their effects. The current      timetable does not provide adequate time for that discussion.      In many ways, this legislation is unacceptable in its present      form and requires amendment. It must be changed for the sake      of families--the bedrock of our country--and for those      struggling on the peripheries of society who have a claim on      our national conscience.

1168,topic-id,2726,"Mr.President, as an outsider to this process in this body, when we get to a major issue like this, I really become very troubled. What we are trying to do today is historic. What we have been trying to do all year--this process has been under debate all year--is historic. I agree with my colleagues across the aisle, but I am going to use another word, a six-letter word, that I believe characterizes it the best.  We absolutely have a debt crisis. There is no doubt about it. In the year 2000, the last year under President Clinton, this country had a $6 trillion Federal U.debt. At the end of George Bush's Presidency, we had a $10 trillion debt. Now, at the end of President Obama's administration--we added $10 trillion to the debt, such that today we end up with $20 trillion of debt on about a $19 to $20 trillion economy. Now, Mr.President, there are countries under World Bank fiscal watch that have stronger balance sheets than we do today.  My concern is this. It is that both sides fight each other over this issue depending on who is in the White House and who has the majority in this body. The American people are fed up with it.  But I have to say that this bill, what we are talking about doing today, is a con on the American people. Let's talk about what a con is.  Over the last 100 years, we have had three political supermajorities. That is where one party or the other has a 60-vote majority in this body, where they can do basically what they want. Sixty times they have had that--I am sorry. We have had three of those in the last 100 years, all The first gave us the New Deal; the second, the Great Society; and the third, Dodd-Frank and  Now, I am just a simple business guy, Mr.I have run small businesses. I started working on an hourly wage. I worked my way through college. I ended up running a pretty big company. So my point here is that I can lay at the feet of those three supermajorities most of the responsibility for this financial catastrophe we have in the United It is a full-blown crisis. It didn't just start this year. The annual deficit--they talk about deficits. I talk about debt. That is what we owe the rest of the world.  This year, this President, President Trump, inherited a budget that this year will produce a $666 billion shortfall between revenues and expenses. Yet we will collect a record sum of tax this year, the highest in our history. Last year we collected the most we have ever collected. The year before that, the most. So this has not been a problem of raising taxes, Mr.Our problem is very simple: The[[Page S7531]]size of our Federal Government has exploded.  In the year 2000, the last year under Bill Clinton, the size of this Federal Government was $2.4 trillion. The size of our government last year--under two administrations, one Republican, one Democratic--it was almost $4 trillion. That cannot continue. Yet, since 2009, because of sequestration and the Budget Control Act, the size of our discretionary spending has declined from $1.5 trillion a year to $1.1 trillion a year, and $250 billion of that cutback has been on the back of our U.military at the very time when we face more threats and the world is more dangerous than at any time during my lifetime.  So I am here today to talk about the con of all cons, and it is the fact that the Great Society and all those sweeping programs--tens of trillions of dollars behind the world poverty--have failed. Today, the poverty rate in the United States is exactly the same as it was in the late sixties when that was signed into law.  Mr.President, doing nothing--the proposal to do nothing is the con of all cons. The con that bigger government has the solution for the American people has been proven over and over again to fail.  Look at Both sides are now agreeing that it has failed. Now what we do about it is the issue. The Veterans' Administration was a cesspool of performance. Obama's $1 trillion stimulus package back in 2010 and 2011 gave us nothing in terms of economic development.  As a matter of fact, the con of all cons is that we are coming out of the slowest, lowest economic growth in the United States history--230 years. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are bankrupt. The U.Postal Service is another bastion of success. Amtrak is bankrupt.  I think the greatest thing that we have to do today is get past all that. There are no innocent parties up here. Both sides are guilty when it comes to the $20 trillion problem. The $20 trillion is a manifestation of Washington's unwillingness to get its fiscal house in order and do what every other American has to do; that is, to live within their means.  Doing nothing is simply not an option.  In the last 8 years under President Obama, we borrowed as a Federal Government 35 percent of everything we spent. What that means is that every dime we spent on our military, on our Veterans' Administration, and on all domestic discretionary programs is borrowed because every dime of the $3.5 trillion that we got in last year was spent on mandatory expenses.  Doing nothing is not an option.  When President Trump took office, though, he said that job one was to grow the economy. Why? Why is growing the economy important? Well, growing the economy is important because it is one of the several steps you have to employ to get at this debt crisis. Yes, there are going to be some tax cuts for individuals--we will get to that in a second--but primarily this is to be a stimulative package to get the economy growing.  There are three pieces to it. One, lower the corporate tax rate. I am sorry, anybody can debate this and win. We have to become competitive with the rest of the world. In Asia, the corporate tax rate is 18 percent. In Europe, it is in the low twenties. Getting to 20 percent in a dynamic situation where everybody is going down, like the UK--which next year will go to 17 percent, Mr.President--this is the least we can do. Getting our passthroughs to have parity is also critical. But we have to first roll back Federal regulations. That is the first piece.  The second piece is, we have to then push out our energy potential. We just talked about a few of those. The Keystone Pipeline this year, the Clean Power Plan, and ANWR are all moving along.  But the three pieces of this--lowering the corporate tax rate, eliminating the repatriation tax, and then a tax cut for working Americans--will actually get this economy going.  The other side says: Well, wait a minute. You are going to add $1.5 trillion to the debt.  I look at it as an investment. As we just heard from my good friend from Pennsylvania, four-tenths of 1 percent will more than pay for that. Well, let's look at history. History says that over the last 100 years, 3.5 percent is our average on But more important than that, in the last seven decades that we have enjoyed this economic growth in America, only one decade have we had lower growth than 2.5 percent and that was one decade where we had 2.3 percent. At 2.3 percent, we more than pay for what we are talking about now. My projection is that we will do a lot better than this, and there are many other people out there, including noted economists, who say the same thing.  Remember, we have $7 trillion not at work in this economy today because of fiscal policy, not monetary policy. At the very time that the Fed added $4.5 trillion to the balance sheet--the largest in history--we got 1.9 percent GDP growth over the last 8 years. Mr.President, you can only look at one place--and that is fiscal policy--that would generate that kind of anemic growth in our history. So what I am looking at right now is freeing up that $7 trillion, and this tax package is one of several steps we need to employ that will begin to unleash that capital power.  We have several trillion dollars on the bank balance sheets of smaller and regional banks. We have a couple trillion dollars on the balance sheets of the Russell 1000 because of uncertainty coming out of And we have almost $3 trillion overseas in unrepatriated U.profits because of our archaic repatriation tax.  Changing this Tax Code is not only necessary, the rest of the world needs us to do this.  I will say this: Under President Trump's leadership and driving force, I believe things are already beginning to happen, and that is why we see reflections in the bond market and the stock market that reflect a moving economy. This economy wants to move. I have watched consumer confidence my entire career.  Right now, this is what is happening: So far this year, 2 million jobs have been created. Some 860 rules and regulations have been reversed, and most of these are onerous things that are sucking the very life out of this free enterprise system. Illegal border crossings are down 60 percent. Five hundred people--we voted 97 to 2 in this body, in the U.Senate, where people say nothing is happening--in a bipartisan vote, we voted 97 to 2 to allow the head of the Veterans' Administration to deal with it like any other entity in the country; that is, to be able to fire people for performance. Since that time, over 500 people have been removed from the Veterans' Administration because of lack of performance. Neil Gorsuch was confirmed to the Supreme Consumer confidence is at a 16-year high.  Things are moving, but this body is still gridlocked, and that is what we have to break through. What we have here is a historic opportunity to change the direction of our country. This is why I ran for the Senate--to be a part of trying to add some influence into a future direction for our children and grandchildren.  Mr.President, do you realize that our children--this next generation is the first generation in the history of our country that faces a lower economic prospect than their predecessors? That is unacceptable. We are the richest country in the history of the world. We have the most dynamic worker base in the history of the world. We have a growing economy again. This is not necessary.  So these changes that we are talking about--and I have heard all the rhetoric today, even just in the last hour: Oh, this is all going to the rich. This is all going to those mean old greedy corporations, and by the way, nothing is going to the little guy. Well, let's talk about the reality.  A family of four--this is a real-world example--earning a median income of $73,000, in this bill, will get a 60-percent tax cut. A single mom with one child, making $41,000 a year--which is a median individual income--will get a 75-percent tax cut. I don't consider those rich. I don't consider those big corporations. Those are individual examples of what this tax bill is intended to do.  But more than that, for 6 million people who pay taxes today, under this bill, next year, their tax rate will go to zero. Six million Americans will find[[Page S7532]]that they will not be paying Federal income tax next year. But the person who gets the biggest benefit from this entire plan is that person who gets a job. That is not the half of it.  Our 35 percent nominal tax rate, the top rate for corporations, is the most onerous penalty on the American worker that has been perpetrated by politicians in Washington over the last 50 years by both Republicans and This is insanity. The other side talks about insanity. When the rest of the world is almost at half of what our corporate rate is, how in the world are we going to defend foreign companies from coming and buying U.companies, and using the tax arbitrage to pay for it? That is what is happening now. We can end that.  This repatriation tax will free up almost $3 trillion. This is extremely stimulative in the market. It will improve capital again. I believe that on the back of an aggressive trade policy, we will get exports growing again.  There is no good reason not to be for this bill today. All the false accusations from the other side are simply just not true. Yes, there is an investment here, but every time I bought a piece of equipment in business, I had to pay for it. I paid for it upfront, and I got a benefit from it. It is called a return on investment. That is exactly what this is. For the American worker and the American people, this is an investment, and I expect a return on investment from which they will benefit.  This Tax Code is so archaic that it is embarrassing to talk about. I will not even get into it because it is 2.4 million words. It is so ridiculous. One of the intents here is to simplify that for the average taxpayer. I believe we have accomplished that.  There are clear problems with this current plan--with this Tax Code and its problems today--and this plan takes clear steps to address those. It is an investment in our future. It is a rejection of the idea that 1.9 percent is the new norm.  The other side, a few years ago, tried to convince us that was the case. If we do nothing from today forward with the current budget under which we are operating--which is the last budget President Obama left with us--we are both guilty. This is not a partisan comment. But if nothing is done, $11 trillion will be added to a $20 trillion debt. That is unacceptable. That is not an option. It is not possible.  This issue is bigger than partisan politics. It is bigger than self-interest. It is bigger than anyone in this body. This is about our children and our grandchildren. This new tax direction will allow workers to compete again on a level playing field with the rest of the world and win.  Not only is our economic security at risk, but I believe our national security is definitely in danger because of this debt. Both sides are commenting on that today. Don't take my word for it. Almost 200 outside groups have come out in support of this bill. That is historic in its own right, when you do something that is this big, to have that many people support it. I believe that what both sides of the aisle need to do is to back up and look at what is best for the American people long term.  There are two ideologies at war here. One side believes we need to give more money to the Federal Government, have more big programs like the Veterans' Administration, the Postal Service, and all those things, instead of putting it back in people's pockets and investing in our economy.  This is a historic moment of opportunity for us this week to change the Tax Code and finally to help American families and businesses compete with the competitors around the world. This standard of living that we have taken for granted for 70 years is the greatest expansion of economic exercise in the history of humankind. We can turn this around, but only by getting back to the fundamentals of economic opportunity for everybody--fiscal responsibility, limited government, and individual liberty.  I believe we will do it. I believe the American people want us to do it. This President's agenda will work. He comes from the business world. I come from the business world. That is what this is about. We have an understanding of what it takes to compete globally, and that is what this bill does, finally, for the American workers.  I yield the floor.

466,topic-id,918,"Mr.Speaker, I understand that real tax reform is absolutely necessary. In 2013, the Harvard Business School published a report that identified the most important Federal priorities to promote American growth and competitiveness.  Two of the eight priorities were tax related. First, to simplify the corporate Tax Code with lower statutory rates and fewer loopholes; and second, to reform the taxation of foreign profits so we don't disadvantage American businesses and workers.  Many Democrats would work with the majority to achieve these progrowth tax reforms. That is how it worked so well in 1986 under President Reagan and Speaker O' But we should not, and we don't need to, balloon the Federal debt to achieve these goals. That is exactly why Republican proposals in the House and the Senate are so harmful for our country.  We know that national debt itself is antigrowth. That is why the same Harvard study that advocated tax reform also prioritized a stable Federal budget. Public debt crowds out private investment. CBO estimates that every dollar in deficit crowds out 33 cents in private investment.  Debt gives us less flexibility to deal with emergencies. Debt increases the risk of another financial crisis, because when investors lose confidence in the government's ability to pay back borrowed funds, interest rates can spike. As interest takes up more of the budget, less is available for other programs, including roads, bridges, scientific discovery, and our national defense.  When Congress passed the Bush tax cuts, national debt was at a level equal to 32 percent of the U.economy. Today, it is 77 percent of These bills will put our national debt on track to be larger than our national economy.  We can point fingers at each other about how we got here, but if we are trying to get out of the hole, first we need to stop digging. We will not grow our way out of this hole.  According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, no estimate that accounts for the economic impact of higher debt has found that the bill would raise the growth rate by more than a quarter of the Republicans' declared 0.4 percent growth target.  In a survey at the University of Chicago, known for its conservative economic theory, 37 of 38 economists agree that the GOP tax bills in Congress would cause U.debt to increase substantially faster than the economy.  At the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, which the President himself trumpets as his alma mater, teaming with smart people, their dynamic scoring model found that the House bill would lose between $1 trillion and $1.7 trillion over a decade in revenue after accounting for growth.  What in the world has happened to the Grand Old Party and fiscal responsibility? How will we pay for infrastructure now? Will we really risk destabilizing the dollar, the world's economic currency? Will we ask China to lend us money so that we can defend ourselves from North Korea?  I have heard my Republican colleagues say again and again how important it is to pay for spending, to get our fiscal house in order, to get our national debt under control.  I asked one colleague why he had run for Congress in the first place, and he told me he was so concerned about loading his kids up with all this borrowing, that he had to do something. His eyes filled with tears as he talked about his children. Yet he and many like him voted in a rush to add at least $1.5 trillion to the debt without a road or a Navy ship or one scientific grant to show for it.  Nobody seriously contends that this is wonderful policy resulting from serious deliberation through regular order. It is not. The only reason for this effort, and this is out of the mouths of the legislators themselves, is that there is political pressure from interest groups and donors to get something done. That is the definition of putting party before country. That is exactly what people hate about Congress.[[Page H9520]]  This is not what your constituents really want. They don't want their tax breaks to expire while corporate breaks don't. They don't want students to suffer from even more debt. They don't want to lose their healthcare because of the premium spikes we know are going to be coming. They don't want their housing to be more expensive, even, than it is today, and they don't want to face automatic Medicare cuts forced by congressional spending limits.  If you are worried about the blowback from not doing something or taking the extra time to get it right, wait until you see the reaction when people realize what is really in this bill after it has already been passed.  We can do real tax reform without jeopardizing our children's future. Make the corporate rate 25 percent instead of 20 percent like the Business Roundtable and Mitt Romney both once suggested. That saves $600 billion.  If you must lift the exemption for the estate tax, I wouldn't, but don't eliminate it. That saves $50 billion.  Maintain the alternative minimum tax for high-earning families, but index it over time so it doesn't catch the middle class.  Work with Democrats to find ways to limit tax expenditures, but save the burden for those who can afford it.  If my Republican colleagues will commit to doing that, I will commit to working with you, and I will honestly and publicly thank you for putting country before politics.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-30-pt1-PgH9519-4.txt,2113,1730,2017,30,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1156,topic-id,618,"Mr.President, today we are debating legislation that will dramatically reshape the American economy. It was written, and continues to be rewritten, in secret by only one party.  It didn't have to be this way. Done right, this process could have had broad bipartisan support. We could have passed tax legislation that is fair, simpler, and fiscally responsible. We could have passed tax legislation that is truly focused on middle-class families and raising their wages. Instead, we have a bill that fails dramatically on every single one of these principles.  This bill fails in so many different ways that I think it is helpful for us to talk about each myth that is being told. First, let's dispense with the myth that this is a middle-class tax cut. The bill makes dramatic, permanent cuts to corporate taxes while making very small, temporary changes to the taxes middle-class families pay. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, for many working families, the tax changes are less than $100 per year or, more simply put, about $2 a week. That is not a middle-class tax cut. That is a myth.  The second myth we hear is that corporate tax cuts in the bill will trickle down and raise wages for average workers. If that were true, we would probably hear some of the CEOs delivering the good news to their hard-working employees, but it is not. It is not true. It is a myth. We know this because the CEOs themselves are telling us what they will do. Yes, they are actually telling us--and it isn't raising wages. They have been clear. They are going to use the money this bill gives them to buy back shares of their own company's stock, and they are going to increase payments to wealthy shareholders.  CEOs are telling the White House this directly. At a November 14 CEO gathering, Gary Cohn, the White House's top economic adviser, was in a room full of executives that were asked what they would do with the money from the tax cuts. Would they put it back into their business? Would they grow their business? Would they increase wages? Only a couple of hands went up in a very large room.  Their hands weren't up because they have no reason to lie. Their intentions have always been clear. They are going to take the money this tax bill hands them and reward their executives and their wealthy shareholders.  Again, we know this is going to happen because CEOs are telling us--and the bill keeps getting worse. We are hearing this myth that these tax cuts will pay for themselves. Well, they will not. After years of telling the American public how important it is to address the debt and deficit, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are now going to pass a bill that dramatically increases deficits.  Nonpartisan analysis shows that this bill will inject $1.5 trillion of new debt--debt my Republican colleagues should be prepared to accept as their own creation if this bill passes--and $1.5 trillion in new debt for our children is not fiscally conservative, it is fiscally irresponsible.  It didn't need to be this way. We could work together to build a tax code that lets working families in Michigan keep more of their hard-earned money, levels the playing field for our small businesses, and keeps good jobs in the United Michiganders and all Americans deserve a tax code that is fair, simpler, and more responsible, not more multinational corporate giveaways and massive new debt.  This bill clearly fails on all of these points, and I urge my colleagues to vote no.  I yield the floor.

1399,topic-id,910,"Mr.President, I rise today to make a simple request of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. When it comes to the tax legislation that Republican colleagues are rushing through Congress, please stop, slow down, and let's start over together.  We need real tax reform with clear policy goals that will make our Nation more competitive, not a partisan attempt to pass something--anything--that can get 51 Republican votes in the Our shared policy goals should be making the Tax Code fairer, simpler, and fiscally responsible. If we can achieve these goals, that would be real tax reform.  If we worked together, we could take long overdue steps and build a tax code that lets working families in Michigan and across the country keep more of their hard-earned money, levels the playing field for our small businesses, and keeps good jobs here at home in the United Fairer, simpler, responsible--those are three key points making a tax code that works. If we don't start over, I am afraid the current tax legislation will fail on all three accounts.  First, this tax legislation is not fair. It dramatically moves toward benefiting the wealthiest people in this Nation, with only a little sliver of the benefits going to working-class families.  The Republican tax bill was clearly written to cut rates for CEOs and large corporations and treats the middle class like an afterthought. I would argue that working Americans who are struggling with stagnant wages--while the cost of prescription drugs, college, and housing continue to rise--need tax cuts that are built around them.  Instead, we are looking at a Republican tax plan that repeals the alternative minimum tax--a fail-safe designed specifically to make sure that wealthy Americans cannot deduct their way to paying nothing in taxes. From what little we have seen of President Trump's tax returns, we know that the AMT--the alternative minimum tax--is the only reason he paid income taxes at all. The Republican bill will eliminate the AMT, and President Trump and folks like him will receive a huge windfall and may not have to pay any taxes at all--zero.  Wall Street loves this bill, too, because hedge funds will continue to be taxed at lower rates than small businesses in our local communities. This means many hedge fund managers making millions of dollars will have a lower tax rate than an office assistant working at their firm. Simply put, this proposal fails on the test of making the Tax Code fairer.  I also believe this effort fails on the test of making the code simpler. For small business owners back in Michigan, they want to spend their time doing what they know best, which is running their business, not spending days or weeks trying to figure out the taxes they owe. But, as many of my colleagues in the Finance Committee have pointed out throughout this week, the provisions for a small business passthrough serve only to make a complicated tax code even more complicated--yes, even more complicated.  Expert analysis says that the passthrough provisions will require years of rulemakings and thousands of pages of additional rules and regulations. As a small business owner, unless your hobby is studying the Internal Revenue Code, this bill is going to make your life a whole lot more difficult.  Finally, on the last test, the test of whether or not this bill is responsible, this proposal fails miserably. Writing responsible tax legislation means making hard choices--closing loopholes and balancing out the pros and cons of any action.  Congress has the responsibility to take seriously the threat of a growing national debt, and we have to think about this when changing our Tax But instead of working to reduce our debt, which we are passing on to our children and grandchildren, this proposal actually adds more than $1 trillion to our deficit. And it would be even more expensive, but in a haphazard attempt to limit the cost, the majority has put forward a bill where hundreds of millions of dollars of provisions that middle-class families could use to reduce their taxes expire at random times over the next few years.  When you add it all up and factor in the additional interest costs to carry this new debt, you have a proposal that adds over $2 trillion to the Federal debt, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal It is wildly irresponsible to pile on this debt to finance a tax break for the wealthiest people in this country, but it doesn't have to be that way.  Tax reform can be bipartisan. The goal of tax reform must be fairer, simpler, and responsible. This isn't just idealism or wishful thinking. We have seen it happen before. When Ronald Reagan worked with Congress to pass tax reform in 1986, the bill received 97 votes in the U.Senate--yes, 97 votes. That is the sort of bipartisan approach we need, and we need to start working on that now.  Michiganders--and all Americans--deserve a tax code that is fairer, simpler, and more responsible, not more multinational corporate giveaways and more debt.  I will not stop fighting for hard-working American families and small businesses who deserve to see more take-home pay, and I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join me.[[Page S7282]]  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1823,topic-id,821,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize cofounder of the Capuchin Soup Kitchen and member of the Capuchin Franciscan Order of Saint Joseph, Father Solanus Father Casey is the third American-born to be honored with the distinction of Blessed from the Roman Catholic Church, the final step before sainthood.  Born as Bernard Francis Casey on November 25, 1870, Father Casey was raised on a farm in Oak Grove, WI, along the banks of the Mississippi River, with his parents and 15 siblings. At an early age, Father Casey learned diligence, obedience, and piety from his parents, who honored their Irish Catholic faith above all else. At the age of 12, Father Casey attended Saint Patrick Church in Hudson, WI, and felt the call to the priesthood during the lessons for his first Holy  After working as a logger, prison guard, and streetcar operator, Father[[Page S7333]]Casey decided to pursue a lifetime of service and entered Saint Francis Seminary in Milwaukee, The next 8 years were a difficult journey toward priesthood for Father Casey as he struggled academically. The seminary officials believed that Father Casey did not have the proper skills to be a priest and suggested he join a religious order: Franciscans, Dominicans, or After praying before a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Father Casey heard the Blessed Mother tell him to ``Go to Detroit,'' home to the In 1897, Father Casey was invested as Capuchin Novice Francis Solanus, named after Saint Francis Solanus of the 17th century. The name seemed fitting as both Father Casey and Saint Francis Solanus loved to play the violin.  After being ordained as a simplex priest in 1904, Father Casey began his ministry in the State of New York, serving three different parishes: Sacred Heart Parish, Our Lady of Sorrow Parish, and Our Lady of Angels While in New York, Father Casey held numerous positions within the church, including porter. He embraced the task of doorkeeper, welcoming and praying with all visitors and offering simple and candid comfort. Father Casey held weekly services for the sick and quickly became known for his compassion towards all who suffered. He embodied the ultimate spirit of public service by giving 100 percent of himself to the poor, the hungry, and the unloved.  In 1924, Father Casey was appointed to the Saint Bonaventure Monastery in the city of Detroit as a porter, providing soup for the hungry, kind words for the troubled, and a healing touch for the ill. For over 20 years, he brought comfort and hope to people of all religions, earning the recognition as ``The Doorkeeper.'' During the Great Depression, Father Casey helped establish the Capuchin Soup Kitchen in the city of Detroit, which prepared large sandwiches and warm cups of coffee for the hungry and unemployed. Today the Capuchin Soup Kitchen is recognized as one of the most well-known food pantries in the region, serving over 60,000 meals and distributing roughly 250,000 pounds of food a month. During World War II, Father Casey also provided advice and prayers for many families throughout southeast Michigan whose sons and daughters were honorably serving our Although Father Casey was ordained as a simplex priest, people across the State of Michigan waited in lines in order to speak with him and receive his blessings. Father Casey never fully retired, but rather spent the last decade of his life serving the sick and troubled at Saint Felix Friary in Huntington, IN, until his death in 1957.  In 1995, Father Casey received the title of Venerable from the Roman Catholic Church in recognition of his virtuous life. Father Casey exemplified the theological virtues of the Roman Catholic Church: charity, faith, and hope. On May 4, 2017, Pope Francis announced that Father Casey would be elevated to the status of Blessed, recognizing his widespread reputation of holiness and intercessory prayer. According to the Roman Catholic Church, a Panamanian woman on a pilgrimage was healed from a genetic skin condition almost instantly, with no scientific explanation, after visiting the tomb of Father Solanus Casey at Saint Bonaventure Monastery in the city of Detroit in 2012. In order to receive the title of Blessed, the Roman Catholic Church investigates reports of exceptional favors received, acclaimed as miraculous or unexplainable. The beatification of Father Casey is the greatest testament to his commitment to those in need and a significant step toward sainthood.  I cannot express enough the impact Father Solanus Casey had on communities across the State of The road to sainthood is paved with love and service for Father He was a beloved Capuchin friar in the city of Detroit credited with miraculous cures and valued for his compassionate counsel. Throughout his life of tireless service, he encouraged countless individuals in the metropolitan Detroit region to address issues of poverty and hunger. I am confident his legacy will continue to inspire others to open the door and be a porter to anyone who knocks.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-27-pt1-PgS7332-4.txt,2113,CONDEMNING ETHNIC CLEANSING OF ROHINGYA AND CALLING FOR AN END TO,2017,27,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

635,topic-id,458,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this very important bill.  Mr.Speaker, Maine is vacationland. We have a population in Maine of only 1.3 million people, but every year we have about 40 million visitors to our great  We have thousands of sparkling, clean lakes and ponds, hundreds of miles of swift-running rivers, and we have 3,600 miles of stunningly beautiful coastline. I have never, ever, met anybody who has vacationed in Maine who did not leave without a smile. It is just a great place to live and bring up kids.  Now, the tourist industry employs about 150,000 people directly in the State of Maine, and it is critical that we have a pristine environment in Maine to further this industry.  Mr.Speaker, during the past 40 years, sadly, most of our paper mills, our textile mills, and our shoe factories in the great State of Maine have closed and, in many cases, they have left behind contaminated brownfields contaminated with heavy metals and chemicals.  Now, those of us who have been blessed with children know how critically important their health is. My mother is 89 and had a great career as a nurse, and we grew up in our house with taking care of others. I raised my son as a single parent, taking care of my son. I understand how much easier it is to stay healthy and be healthy if you are in a clean environment.  Mr.Speaker, that is why H.3017 is so important. It makes sure that we provide funding to clean up polluted contaminated brownfields industrial sites.  Mr.Speaker, since 1994, hundreds of brownfields across this great country have been cleaned up. When they are cleaned up, they are often repurposed into athletic fields, schools, and hospitals. This, at the same time, strengthens our local communities because they are put back, in many cases, on the property tax rolls, if they are a private sector development.  In the town of Millinocket, right smack in the middle of my district, Miller's Department Store is an old building, decaying and full of mold, and it is being benefited from a grant from this brownfields program.  The T.Dick property in Gardiner, in central Maine, used to be a steel fabricator. It is now contaminated with heavy metals and is experiencing a new life because of this program.  Mr.Speaker, cleaning up our environment to help our kids stay safe and healthy should not ever be a partisan issue. This is as bipartisan as you could possibly find. That is why, Mr.Speaker, I am encouraging Republicans and Democrats alike to vote ``yes'' on H.3017. Let's do something common sense, provide the funding to clean up these brownfields sites and repurpose this land for the betterment of our families.

Mr.Speaker, I am thrilled to stand up and support H.1699, Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act, and I salute Congressman Andy Barr from Kentucky to bring this forward.  Maine, Mr.Speaker, has some of the highest homeownership rates in the country. We love our homes in I represent the rural part of our State, and in our State, Mr.Speaker, we have times of the year where the weather is pretty tough.  If you are building a home that is not manufactured in a warehouse, sometimes you literally cannot build that home because of the weather, the snow, and the cold, and what have you.

229,topic-id,661,"Mr.President, this is a big day because we are about to provide tax relief to millions of people in Ohio and around the country--middle-class tax cuts, doubling the standard deduction, doubling the child tax credit, lower rates for people in every bracket. In my home State of Ohio, we have the opportunity to see people who are making $50,000 a year, with two kids, see a 26-percent tax cut. That is important.  My colleague just talked about his concern about some of the provisions that are before us. I will say, these have all been filed. That doesn't always happen around here, and it should. These have all been filed, and people can go on rpc.senate.gov. These were made public. Nothing is on this list that hasn't been filed publicly.  Just looking at it, the biggest one that my colleague talked about as being something to help rich people is the deduction for property taxes. It is capped at $10,000. There is a deduction for allowing people to deduct their property taxes, which is incredibly important for middle-class families around the country. Some people on the other side want to go much further and provide much larger deductions and make those for State and local taxes.  By the way, their proposal would go primarily to upper income people, the proposal they have. That benefit goes primarily to those who are making higher incomes. How is it paid? It is a $10,000 deduction for property tax. It is paid for by exactly the provision my colleague from Oregon just complained about because he said he wanted to be sure people had to pay an alternative minimum tax, and that alternative minimum tax is being used to pay for this middle-class tax cut we are talking about. Anyway, that is the biggest item by far.  The second biggest item is for the passthrough companies. These are the smaller businesses in America, and it is to try to have some more parity between the passthrough companies and the so-called C corporations. Again, that is something that is really important to small businesses in my home State of Ohio and around the country.  I encourage him to take a look. All of these have been filed. He can look at them now or he can go online, as any citizen can, and take a look at these things. I would say that at the end of the day, I know we had a difference of opinion on whether there should be tax cuts, but we think tax relief is appropriate right now. We think the middle-class families who have not seen an increase in their wages, not just for the last few years but the last couple of decades, need a little help. Their expenses have not gone down. They have gone up. Wages have been flat. That middle-class squeeze is addressed through these tax cuts--on average, about $2,375 for an Ohio median-income family. That is important.  People who are working paycheck to paycheck will find this to be incredibly important. Maybe they can put a little more money aside for retirement. Maybe it can help with their healthcare costs, which have gone up[[Page S7676]]dramatically as wages have been flat. Maybe they can help people be able to buy a car or to make a car payment if they already have a car. These are real tax cuts. They are going to help middle-class families. Again, I hope my colleagues will look at some of these changes, like the $10,000 deduction for property taxes paid for with the alternative minimum tax changes and help us be able to make this legislation even more generous for folks in the middle class, as they say they are for.  With that, I would like to ask my colleague from South Carolina, who has been very involved in the child tax credit, ensuring we have a reduction of the brackets, if he would have a few comments on those.

243,topic-id,865,"Mr.President, I wish I could convince my friend from Michigan--and she is my friend--about the $4,000 per family that would come from the pro-growth policies here, many of which she supports. She wants her businesses to be competitive, and they are not now. It is an outrage that our companies have to use a tax code that puts the workers in those companies in a disadvantageous position every day. It is not just about inversions, and it is not just about companies getting taken over.  By the way, last year, three times as many American companies were taken over by foreign companies as the other way around. Over the last 13 years, 4,700 companies became foreign companies that would today be U.companies if this tax bill had been in place. I mean, it is happening. They are taking their jobs and investments with them when they go overseas.  We have to fix that problem. It has been bipartisan. There has never been a partisan issue about that. That is where a lot of that $4,000 comes from. It comes from the fact that you are going to have more investment and therefore higher productivity, and workers are going to have a chance to see higher wages.  The Congressional Budget Office did a study in which they showed that 70 percent of the benefit of lowering the business rate goes to workers in terms of higher wages and higher benefits. Others say it is less than that. Others say it is more than that. Kevin Hassett, who is the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, says that it is more than that. But that is where the $4,000 comes from. I hope it is a lot more than that, but it is on top of the middle-class tax cuts that are very direct.[[Page S7678]]  In other words, that is not just saying that we are going to have a better economy, which I believe we will--and I strongly believe we can improve a broken tax code, as I think everybody does, to make it better for American workers--but beyond that, you have the immediate tax relief, and that is what we have been talking about.  This is the doubling of the standard deduction, the doubling of the child tax credit, the lowering of the tax rates.  My friend from Pennsylvania just talked about the fact that 20 percent of the people between $50,000 and $75,000--I am not sure where his data was coming from, but let's take it as true--have a small tax cut or a tax increase, and 17 percent between $75,000 and $100,000 are in that category. That means 80 percent of the people in that category have a big tax cut, in the one category, and 83 percent in the other category have a big tax cut. So, yes, a small tax cut--I don't know how many have a small tax cut and how many have a tax increase, but the vast majority of middle-class families, according to what my colleague from Pennsylvania just said, are going to get a big tax cut. I don't know what is wrong with that. That is $2,375, on average, for a median-income family in  By the way, economists say that it not only creates the opportunity for people to have a little better family budget through the direct tax cuts but also, of course, more jobs.  Here is something interesting. Over the past couple of days, a letter came in from 137 economists--many of them nationally known--who support this legislation. This is what they say: Economic growth will accelerate if this legislation passes, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and a better standard of living for the American people. They say that there will be significantly more resources coming into the Federal Government because of this, because of the growth. They think that there will be $1 trillion more revenue coming in because of this, because of the growth. They also think that there will be additional jobs--the Tax Foundation says 1 million new jobs.  So, yes, I do believe it will be $4,000 per family, but on top of that, I believe that they are going to have a very direct benefit. I know they will because the statistics are there--my colleague from Pennsylvania just acknowledged it--that the vast majority of middle-class families are going to see a substantial tax cut.  Let me give you a number. For a family with two kids, making $50,000 a year, it is a 36-percent tax cut, on average. That matters. That helps people who are trying to make ends meet. It is real both in terms of the direct tax cuts and in terms of the economic growth and the higher wages that are going to come with that, and that is so important to all of the families we represent.  We have had a good discussion here. I see that my colleague from Connecticut is here and would like to speak, and others, I am sure, are going to want to speak.

253,topic-id,2202,"Mr.President, again, we have had some interesting dialogue back and forth. Earlier, my colleague from Connecticut was talking about how this isn't real middle-class tax relief, and then he lamented the fact that because of the arcane budget rules we have around here, after 10 years, all these great tax cuts expire. So you kind of have it both ways there, and I don't think you can do that, which is that there aren't real tax cuts but then, when they expire, it is the greatest shame because they are great tax cuts.  Here is the reality. There are significant tax cuts here for the middle class. This legislation doubles the standard deduction. Probably about two-thirds of the people I am talking to tonight already take the standard deduction. Now we will have about 95 percent of people who will take it, and everyone who takes it will be able to, instead of getting $12,000 a family, get $24,000 a family, greatly expanding that. By the way, there is a zero tax bracket, meaning people who don't have any income tax liability. That means a lot to people I represent who are living paycheck to paycheck, having a tough time making ends meet.  Also, as a result of this, and the other tax relief, about 3 million Americans who now pay income tax are going to fall off the tax rolls. They are no longer going to have income tax liability. That is really meaningful to people. It also doubles the child tax credit. We talked a little bit about that today. It also increases the refundability a little. But importantly, it helps to ensure that families have the ability to help make ends meet when they are trying to raise kids--the most important thing you can do--and it lowers tax rates. That combination means that you have the kind of tax relief we are talking about.  So a family who makes $50,000 a year and has two kids gets a 36-percent tax cut. A family who makes $85,000 a year and has two kids gets a 20-percent tax cut. If you make $165,000 a year and have two kids, you get an 8-percent tax cut. So the benefit is focused more on those who are at the lower end of the economic scale, and I think that is appropriate.  So it is middle-class tax relief, but here is how it works. As to the share of Federal taxes paid in 2019, which is a year after this is implemented--it starts right away, by the way, so middle-class families are going to get that relief right away--the current is in the red, and then our proposal is in the blue.  So if you make zero to $20,000, it is very unlikely that you have income tax liability, but some families do and the average is 0.1 percent. If you make $20,000 to $50,000 a year, your share of the Federal taxes goes down in our bill from 4.3 percent to 4.1 percent. If you make $50,000 to $100,000 a year, your share of the Federal taxes goes from 16.9 percent to 16.7 percent. If you make $100,000 or above, your share goes not down but up, from 78.7 percent to 78.9 percent. The top percent of wage earners in this country, the top 10 percent, pay approximately 70 percent of the income taxes right now. After our bill is passed and implemented, they will pay more than 70 percent. So it is a progressive tax cut in the sense that the benefit is focused more on middle-class families who really need the help. That is what the legislation does.  Then, in addition to that, in responding to my colleagues who were talking whether there is any economic growth that comes from this, yes, there is a lot of economic growth because the current code is so bad. It is broken. My colleague from Oregon, who is the ranking member, agrees with that. He has a different solution as to how you get there, but he has been a leader on tax reform for that very reason. The current code is actually putting our workers at a disadvantage, making our families have to go through a great complicated process even to file their taxes. More than half of taxpayers now have to use a tax preparer. That is terrible.  So this legislation does also provide economic growth by taking that Tax Code, which has this perverse effect of actually telling U.companies that it is better that they have workers overseas and take their investment overseas or even become a foreign company--the 4,700 companies that are foreign companies today became foreign companies over the last 13 years because we didn't have this Tax Code in place. That is based on an Ernst & Young study. I encourage folks to take a look at it. It basically makes the point that because of a broken Tax Code, it is advantageous for U.companies to take their jobs and investment overseas. That makes no sense.  Foreign companies can pay a premium for U.companies because of our Tax We have the highest business tax rate in the industrialized world, and we have an international system that encourages people to go overseas and keep their money overseas. That is crazy. This proposal changes all of that. It says: Let's get our rate down below the average of the other industrialized countries, and then let's have an international system that actually encourages them to bring the money back and create more jobs here.  In fact, Mr.President, I will say something else. I know you are interested in this. It also encourages foreign investment in this country, because if you are a foreign auto company--and you have a bunch in your State of Tennessee--and your decision is that am I going to invest in Japan, where they might be headquartered, or am I going to invest in China, where they might have a factory, or am I going to invest in Germany, where they might a factory, or am I going to invest in the United States of America and maybe in Tennessee, this bill will make it more advantageous for them to make their investment here and to create the jobs here because of the lower tax rate and because of the expensing when they go out to buy new equipment and technology to make their workers more productive.  So this is going to help American companies a lot to be able to compete globally. It levels the playing field, which is very important. It has been bipartisan up to now--very bipartisan. We had a working group on this, among five bipartisan working groups that were established 2 years ago, that studied this issue. We came up with the solution that you have to get the rate below the average and you have to go through the kind of system we are talking about. It was totally bipartisan. Democrats and Republicans alike agreed to it because it just makes so much sense for the American worker. They are the ones getting the short end of the stick right now. They are the ones who are told: You go out there and compete, but do it with one hand tied behind your back.  We need to give them the tools to be able to succeed, and that is what this legislation does. Yes, that is going to result in middle-class families getting benefits well beyond, in my view, the direct tax cuts we talked about earlier because it is going to enable them to be able to get the higher wages and the better jobs, and that is why some economists have said it is $4,000 a family. Some have said it is more. Many Democrats think it is less. But there will be a benefit to these families. Remember, these companies we are talking about, the C corporations, they employ more than half of the American private workforce. They are competing every day in these global marketplaces. We want them to win. We want our workers to win because we want them to be able to have those higher wages and better benefits.  We have spent 2 decades with relatively weak economic growth and,[[Page S7681]]therefore, relatively flat wages. In fact, on an inflation-adjusted basis, if you look back over the last 15 years, there hasn't been any wage growth. There have been higher expenses, especially healthcare, and those healthcare costs and tuition costs for those who want to send their kids to school, or other costs--food and energy--have all gone up. Wages have been flat. That is a middle-class squeeze, and that is what this middle-class tax relief helps to address. Importantly, that is what this pro-growth part helps to address because you are going to see higher wages, and you are going to see better benefits if you give this kind of tax relief to the American worker because you are going to see more investment, you are going to see more productivity that comes from that, and you are going to see higher wages.  I believe that, but what I believe isn't as important as what others believe. So 137 economists, many of these are nationally known economists, have looked at the pro-growth parts of this legislation--the parts I am talking about that make us competitive again--and they have said that economic growth will accelerate if this legislation passes, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and a better standard of living for the American people. They say there will be a million new jobs in this country just because of this. I think that is really important, as important as the tax cuts are for the middle class--and they are important. Again, those tax cuts primarily go to folks who are in the middle class and that is appropriate. Equally important to me is to get this economy moving in a way that people can have the opportunity to get those higher wages and better benefits.  The Congressional Budget Office did a study. It showed that 70 percent of the benefit of getting that corporate tax rate down is going to go to workers in terms of salaries and benefits. Some say it is less than that. Some say it is more than that. Kevin Hassett, who is the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, says it is more than that. The point is that it is going to help these workers, and it is about time that we help them.  There has been a lot of discussion about the process here tonight, and I understand the frustration. As a Member of the Senate, sometimes I feel that frustration as well. But I will say that this legislation, H.1, which is the vast majority of the papers that were held up a moment ago--this is the legislation that came out of committee; it is the vast majority of the pages--has been on this website called budget.senate.gov and has been public since Saturday, November 26. So it has been out there awhile for Members to look at.  Every single one of these amendments that are part of the manager's amendment that was talked about tonight has been publicly filed, and I think that is good. We required that Members have to file an amendment and make it public. People can go on rpc.senate.gov and see all of those amendments, and I think that is appropriate.  I would hope that, as we go through this process tonight and we talk about this legislation, we can express our differences, which we will, but that we can also stick to the facts, which is that this does provide middle-class tax cuts. Again, as to those who have said earlier that there are no real tax cuts, but then when it expires in 10 years say: Well, gosh, these big tax cuts are gone, you can't have it both ways. There are tax cuts. Maybe people think there should be different kinds of tax cuts, but they are there.  Second, there is the economic growth element of this, which to me is so important. We are not going to be able to have a growing economy and have opportunity and, frankly, be in a position as a country to be able to address some of our broader problems unless we have the growth and the optimism that comes with that, and that is why I think the economic growth parts of this are equally important. Again, that has been bipartisan in the past, and I hope it can be bipartisan in the future. I hope we will be able, as a Senate tonight, to pass this legislation and then continue to work on these issues, not just in terms of tax reform but making our economy and our workers more competitive because that, in the end, is going to be the ability to give people the chance for themselves and their kids and grandkids to have a better life.

258,topic-id,203,"Good news--you will be glad to hear those tax cuts continue. If your family is making $50,000, two kids, you will see a 36-percent tax cut. If you are making $165,000 a year, two[[Page S7682]]kids, you will get less of a percent--an 8-percent tax cut. That is all included in the legislation.  The big change, as we talked about earlier--and I know you have it in front of you--is that there is now this deduction for property taxes. It is a $10,000 cap on that deduction. As you know, if you look at the entire SALT, which are the State and local taxes and property taxes, about 50 percent of that benefit goes to families making over $200,000 a year. In this one, the property taxes capped at $10,000 will be much more targeted to the middle class.  I think it is fair to say to my colleague from Oregon that he will see more middle-class tax relief from that, and that will be something that will help middle-class families.  There is no change in terms of those tax cuts because those brackets--the reduction of the tax rates, doubling of the standard deduction, the doubling of the child credit--are all in the legislation.

The act provides an exception from the base erosion anti-abuse tax for services. The act limits the exception to the ``total services cost with no markup.'' As a practical matter, companies account for amounts paid or accrued for services in a variety of ways. I would like to clarify that, if in a transaction a company used one account for services cost with no markup and another account for any additional amounts paid or accrued, that the first account would be subject to the exception under the bill.  The act also excludes an amount paid or incurred for services if those services meet the requirements for the services cost method under Internal Revenue Code section 482, excluding the requirement that the services not contribute significantly to fundamental risks of business success or failure.  Is it the intent that, for this purpose, that the business judgment rule under current law and regulations will not prevent an amount from being excluded under the act?

765,topic-id,827,"Madam President, today I am proud to stand here for the[[Page S7815]]recognition of the 50-year anniversary of a great organization in Ohio--It is in Columbus, OH, and was formerly known as Alvis It was founded in Columbus, OH, with a broad mission of helping people in the community through human service programs to promote prosperous lives, with a focus on an individual's potential and not their past.  Over the years, I have had the privilege of working closely with Alvis as they have become a model for reentry programs and treatment service programs with a focus on meeting individual goals--a customized approach--building a successful future, and implementing fundamental change for families and for our communities.  Since its opening in 1967, Alvis has grown from a single 15-bed home helping 60 men a year to an organization of 13 locations throughout Columbus, Chillicothe, Dayton, Lima, and It now serves more than 8,000 people annually. This agency has helped provide support and hope to thousands of individuals who are returning to their communities after having spent time in the criminal justice system, as well as offering recovery and developmental disability services that encourage health, growth, and independent citizenship.  Alvis has been the recipient of Federal grants authorized by the Second Chance Act for their work in reentry. As the author of the Second Chance Act when I was in the House of Representatives, I have had the opportunity and the privilege to go to Alvis facilities and to see firsthand the good work that is being done using that legislation. I am proud to have worked with my friend and the corporate president and CEO of Alvis, Denise Robinson, to assist Alvis as it delivers services to Ohioans to turn their lives around so that people can indeed fulfill their God-given potential in life, and they have had a lot of successes.  Alvis recently opened its 14th location, the Alvis Pages Recovery and Treatment Center, in April of this year on the South Side of Columbus to help provide access to treatment and recovery. Alvis continues to lead in its mission to turn lives around 180 degrees.  In my work with regard to the opioid crisis in Ohio, we have looked to this treatment center and looked to the model that they provide other treatment centers to turn those lives around.  I am confident that Alvis will continue these next 50 years to offer these same comprehensive services for overcoming the challenges of transitioning out of the correctional system, treating substance abuse, mental health, trauma, and promoting dependence and accountability for those with developmental disabilities.  I applaud the outstanding commitment of Alvis, its staff, and all those who have been involved in reaching this milestone and making these first 50 years such a success in the lives of so many people.  Madam President, I would also like to speak today about a nomination that is before the Senate right now. Today we will have the first vote on Kirstjen Nielsen, the administration's nominee to be the next Secretary of Homeland I want to talk about why I believe she must be confirmed.  I had the privilege of introducing Kirstjen Nielsen during her nomination hearing in the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs In that committee, she received broad bipartisan support, and I hope the Senate can now come together in a bipartisan fashion to confirm her as Secretary so she can get on with the critical work of leading the Department of Homeland  I am delighted we are having a cloture vote today--I wish it had been a few weeks ago--and I am looking for a vote to confirm her later this week. I would encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to look carefully at this nomination because we need her there, and it would be great if we had a strong bipartisan vote to send her there. I think she is ready to hit the ground running on day one. I say this because she knows the She knows what the challenges are, and she knows how to address them.

Right now, our workers are competing with one hand tied behind their back. All of this is going to generate more economic growth. It is going to come from more investment, more productivity.  In fact, the number that the Joint Committee on Taxation put out today, although it is significantly lower than other numbers, is over $400 billion in more revenue coming in.

This is 137 economists who say that actually it is going to be more than twice as much as Joint Tax says. There are other studies that the Senator from South Dakota talked about that indicate there will be even more economic growth.

1191,topic-id,924,"That is one part of the debate: How much economic growth is going to come out of these tax reforms that we are putting forward? We know there will be a lot; the question is, How much? But this is all based on a Congressional Budget Office estimate of growth over the next 10 years, the GDP growth, the economic growth. So we are sort of in a straitjacket. Although we believe this tax reform proposal will help in terms of that growth, we have to go by this number of 1.9 percent. So 1.9 percent is anemic growth. That is sad. If we can't do better than 1.9 percent, we have real problems in this country, and that is over the next 10 years, projected.  As the Senator has said, it is kind of interesting that they are projecting 1.9 percent and others are projecting higher numbers. In the context of us having just finished a quarter that was 3.3 percent--it was adjusted yesterday to 3.3 percent--and then the quarter before, the second quarter of this year, was 3[[Page S7536]]percent. So 3 percent, 3.3 percent over the last two quarters, yet they say 1.9 percent. There is a private forecast that indicates there will be between 3 and 4 percent growth next year. The average, as Senator Thune said, even with a lot of things happening, such as a recession and hurricanes and other natural disasters, is 2.5 percent or more. So this is not normal. In other words, this is a relatively low rate.  I know we can do better. I don't say, as some do, that this is somehow the new normal. We have to do better. If we don't do better, we can't begin to get wages back up again, which have been flat really for the last couple of decades when you take inflation into account. We know we can do better. That is why this tax bill is so important, to give the economy that shot in the arm.  But let's assume for a minute that it will be only 1.9 percent--dismal growth. Let's assume this tax proposal passes. Let's assume we get the benefit of the increased revenue from that.  By the way, what we say in the tax proposal is that about $1.4 trillion to $1.5 trillion of tax relief will be part of this, and that is out of $44 trillion over the next 10 years. That will provide a little bit of a tax relief because we know the growth will come from that. So let's assume that this is true. Let's assume you use the right policy baseline, assuming that we are going to continue with the current extenders, which we always do. We end up--stick with me here--with about a $533 billion deficit over the next 10 years if we assume this really low rate of growth.  If you assume that instead of 1.9 percent, we go not to 3 percent, not to 2.5 percent, not even to 2.4, 2.3, 2.2, but let's just say 2.1 percent growth--again, very conservative, and I sure hope we will do better, and I believe we will--but let's assume it is 2.1 percent. That will generate enough revenue, because it is up to $270 billion per every 0.1 percent, to have this tax reform proposal actually result in money going back into the Treasury--in other words, reducing the deficit.  So I think this is very fiscally responsible. I think it is very conservative. I think 2.1 percent growth is not something that is at all out of bounds. In fact, I think it is going to be far higher than that based on the growth we have already had recently and the growth that has been projected by outside forecasters.  So I would just say to folks who are hearing that this is somehow blowing a hole in the deficit, I think it is the opposite. I think it is going to actually result in more money going into the Federal Treasury to get the deficit down.  Let me say something else. This is a debate we can have, but we have to deal with the growth side if we are going to get the deficit under control, there is no question about it, not just the spending side. We have to get it under control. But even to do the important work we have to do on a bipartisan basis with restrained growth, it is much more likely that we will do it when we have higher growth. If it is 1.9 percent, we are not going to get there.  So let's get some pro-growth tax reform. Let's get the economy moving. Let's give people the sense that we can tackle these problems. Let's do something about the debt and deficit. We can do that by very meager growth--2.1 percent versus 1.9 percent--and actually take money that is currently in the economy at 1.9 percent--not moving much. Let's get it moving more. Let's create more economic activity. Let's do that to get that growth rate up a little bit through this tax reform, and then let's actually begin to reduce that debt and deficit.  I just wanted to make that point. When we hear that this is somehow fiscally irresponsible--I think it is very responsible fiscally, very conservative. I think we will do better than the numbers we have seen here of 1.9 percent growth. Certainly just 2.1 percent growth actually reduces the deficit, and I think that ought to be brought into the debate.

1609,topic-id,3117,"Mr.President, tonight I want to talk about the opportunity we have before us in the Senate, and that is for tax reform that can truly help our economy and help the middle-class families we represent. It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity.  The last time we reformed our Tax Code in any substantial way was 31 years ago. Ronald Reagan was President and Pete Rose was still playing for the Cincinnati That is how long ago it was. In 1986, tax reform gave our economy a much needed shot in the arm, and it led to more jobs and higher wages in the 1980s and 1990s. Now, 31 years later, after a decade of disappointing growth and flat wages, we need that shot in the arm again.  We need a tax code that better reflects the needs of today's workers, today's families, and our 21st century economy. There is bipartisan agreement that the Tax Code is broken--hopelessly broken--and it is up to Congress to fix it. No one else can.  Through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act now before us, we have a chance in the Congress to create a better economy and a better future. We have to get this done for the people we represent. It starts with tax cuts for the middle class. While the economy has seen some improvement recently, and I saw some good numbers today for last quarter's growth, the people I represent, hard-working Ohioans, and people across the country are not feeling these benefits of a growing economy. For more than a decade now, expenses have increased, including healthcare costs, which have increased the highest, at a time when wages have been flat. When you take inflation into account, wages have stayed relatively flat for almost two decades. That increase in expenses and flat wages is the middle-class squeeze, and people are feeling it.  For years, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been calling for middle-class tax cuts to help ease this burden. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will actually deliver. The proposal helps us in a lot of ways but three main ways.  First, there is a doubling of the standard deduction. This is a doubling[[Page S7500]]for families from $12,000 to $24,000. That means, for a lot of families in America, the first $24,000 is a zero tax bracket. Two-thirds of Ohioans already, by the way, use the standard deduction. The estimate is, now that we are doubling it, over 90 percent of Ohioans will use that standard deduction. That helps to keep the tax bill down but also is a tremendous simplification of our Tax  Second is the doubling of the child tax credit. That is in this legislation. The American dream starts with the American family, and parents shouldn't have to reconsider starting a family because of the financial burden that comes with it. This doubling of the child tax credit will help working families afford childcare and will help strengthen middle-class family budgets all across the country. By the way, it includes increasing the refundability of that tax credit for taxpayers who don't have any income tax liability.  Third, of course, is lowering tax rates. There are tax rates that are lowered all across the board for middle-class families. The independent Tax Foundation estimates that the tax cuts in this proposal will save an Ohio family at the median income level 2,375 bucks a year. That almost $2,400 a year is a big deal. A lot of the people I represent and others represent here in this Chamber are living paycheck to paycheck, and this matters. More money staying in the pockets of working families to make that car payment, to pay for healthcare, maybe put a little money aside for retirement, is a big deal.  We also know from the Tax Foundation that the lower rates in this plan will benefit families across middle-class income brackets. For example, a family with two kids making $50,000 a year will see a 36-percent tax break, a 36-percent reduction in their tax liability. For a family with two kids making about $85,000 a year, there is a 20-percent reduction in their tax liability. And for a family with two kids making about $165,000 a year, there is an 8-percent reduction in their tax liability. So there is tax relief across the board, but the biggest proportional tax cut goes to the folks who need it the most.  This chart shows this. For people who are in these income categories--$20,000 to $50,000, $50,000 to $100,00, $100,000 and above--right now paying 4.3 percent in taxes from $20,000 to $50,000, under this proposal, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Tax Foundation, it goes down to 4.1 percent. So the burden is reduced for people at the lower end. From $50,000 to $100,000, the burden is also lower, from 16.9 percent to 16.7 percent. For those people with $100,000 and above, the burden right now is about 78.7 percent. The top 10 percent of wage earners pay about 70 percent of the taxes. That actually goes up from 78.7 to 78.9.  So this notion that we have heard today that somehow these middle-class tax cuts are not proportionally helping those at the lower end is simply not true. This is the data. Go on jct.gov--Joint Committee on Taxation--and look for yourself. Go on the Tax Foundation site, and you can look at your family income, look at your situation, and determine how doubling the standard deduction, doubling the child tax credit, and reducing tax rates will benefit you. The biggest proportional tax cuts, again, go to people who need it the most.  In total, by the way, when these tax cuts are implemented, it is estimated that approximately 3 million Americans who are currently paying taxes will no longer be paying income taxes. They will be off the rolls altogether. That is tax cuts for middle-class families, for families who need it the most.  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have suggested that our plan will hurt families with incomes below $30,000 because there is a Joint Committee on Taxation report that, because of arcane budget rules, counts repealing the individual mandate as a tax hike. This is an interesting perspective, but I reject it because I don't think stopping the ObamaCare individual mandate and people choosing not to buy health insurance and therefore not having both the cost of the Affordable Care Act and the ObamaCare tax credits that come with that healthcare is a tax hike. In other words, what they are saying is that because somebody doesn't choose to buy healthcare partly because it is too expensive and therefore doesn't get the tax credits that come with that, that somehow that is a tax hike. That doesn't make sense to me, and I don't think it makes sense to most  What the Joint Committee on Taxation did say repeatedly at our committee markup 2 weeks ago is that when you don't consider this issue--again, choosing not to buy healthcare insurance a hike--that our plan does give every single income group, including those under $30,000, a tax cut. As noted earlier, the biggest percentage tax cuts goes to those with lower incomes, and that is appropriate. Those are the folks who need it the most.  What we do know is that right now the individual mandate is an onerous tax by itself. The Supreme Court has called it a tax. It is a tax on people that disproportionately affects lower to middle-class In fact, 80 percent of the individual mandate falls on folks making less than $50,000 a year and their families. In Ohio, by the way, that figure is about 83 percent. Eighty-three percent of that individual mandate tax falls on people in households that make less than $50,000 a year.  Getting rid of this penalty removes the financial burden unfairly affecting those working families, and then we use the savings from that, that the Congressional Budget Office says we get from this, to increase the child tax credit and to reduce tax rates on the middle class. That is one reason we have better middle-class tax cuts in our bill.  Providing immediate relief to the family budget is incredibly important, but beyond that, the tax reforms on the business side will make American workers and companies more competitive, create more jobs and better wages, and that, to me, is just as important in terms of helping middle-class families in my home State of Why? Because when you reform the business tax code to make it competitive, the benefit goes to workers and working-class families all over this country.  The United States now has the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. One study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that workers bear 70 percent of the burden of our corporate tax rate being so high. Others say it is less than that, and others say it is more than that, but all say that workers benefit. If we lower that rate below the average of the other industrialized countries, our workers will benefit through higher wages and better benefits. And by the way, that benefits middle-class families well beyond these direct tax cuts we were talking about earlier.  A recent study by Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, said that if we had had the tax rate that we have in this proposal--a 20-percent tax rate--on these businesses, if we had had that in place since 2004, there would be 4,700 more U.companies today. Let me repeat that. They are saying that 4,700 companies that were American companies have become foreign companies because of our Tax Code, and if we had put in place these changes back 13 years ago, those companies would still be American companies, hiring more American workers, and investing more money here.  We did some research on this, some investigation in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations over the past few years, and we determined that, in fact, when companies are taken over by a foreign company because of our Tax Code or when U.companies choose to go overseas and invert because of our Tax Code, what happens? We lose jobs, and we lose investment here in this country. It matters, and it matters a lot to the communities where those employees are lost and where those businesses have left. The 20-percent tax rate is going to mean more jobs and more investment coming right here to this country instead of going overseas.  It is also true that there will be more foreign investment here. Companies are now trying to decide whether they are going to invest in America or whether they are going to invest in some other country with a lower tax rate, and with the expensing we have in this bill, to be able to write down new investments they are making, it is going to encourage them to make an investment here in the United States[[Page S7501]]rather than in other countries. That will increase jobs too.  By the way, the Tax Foundation estimates that because of the new investment and the higher productivity that comes with it because of this tax reform proposal, we will create nearly 1 million new Americans jobs and more than 35,000 jobs alone in my home State of  In addition to providing relief for middle-class families and making business rates more competitive for American companies and workers, this tax reform does a lot to level the playing field internationally. This is very important. Right now, American workers are forced to compete with one hand tied behind their back because of our Tax A broken tax code is something that must be fixed because it is irresponsible to tell the American people: You have to get out there and compete, but guess what--your foreign competitor has a big advantage over you.  It is crazy that Congress has allowed this opportunity to go by for so many years. The situation where companies are actually encouraged to move overseas and keep their profits overseas makes no sense. Right now, it is estimated there is between $2.5 trillion and $3 trillion of earnings trapped overseas because of this outdated Tax Think about that. That money can come back here and be invested here in plants and jobs and equipment. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act says to those companies: We want your money back here. We want you to invest in The result will lift the economic condition of our entire country.  This week, 137 of the country's leading economists wrote an open letter to Congress in support of this tax reform bill. These former heads of government agencies, leaders of economic policy groups, and leading academics said, quite simply:       Economic growth will accelerate if the Tax Cuts and Jobs      Act passes, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and a better      standard of living for the American people.  That is by 137 economists in an open letter. I encourage you to take a look at it online. These are people who understand what the impact of the policy we make here is going to be on decisions that are being made all around the country.  We can debate the exact growth amount that will result from this bill, and we will have a spirited debate on that this week, but we all have to agree that this will help to grow the economy if we are following basic economic theory.  By the way, their letter also states that ``$1 trillion in new tax revenue for the federal government can be generated by four-tenths of a percentage in GDP growth.'' In other words, what they are saying is that if there is just a slight increase in economic growth because of this tax reform bill, compared to the number we have to use here, that this will result in actual new revenue coming in to the government to pay down the debt. I am convinced that is going to happen for a very simple reason. We have to use a very low number on economic growth. Under our rules, we have to use a CBO--Congressional Budget Office--number of 1.9 percent economic growth over the next 10 years. By the way, the average over the past 30 years has been 2.5 percent. We just learned today that the average last quarter was 3.3 percent. The average the quarter before that, the second quarter, was 3.1 percent.  This tax reform proposal will help to actually increase economic growth, but even if you don't believe that, 1.9 percent economic growth is unacceptable. We cannot accept that as a country. We can and must do better than that. We will do better than that, and this tax reform proposal will be one reason. So I am convinced that the four-tenth's increase--up to 2.3 percent--is still very conservative and that we will be able to do better than that, as we have over the past 30 years, as we have traditionally in this country.  When you hear my colleagues on the other side talk about this bill being bad for the deficit, I think you ought to think about that. This means that they are resigning themselves to 1.9 percent economic growth. That, to me, is not acceptable for our country, and I don't think that is what we will see.  Of the $44 trillion in new revenue estimated to be coming in over the next 10 years, yes, out of that amount, we are suggesting $1.5 trillion be a tax cut relative to that, again, very low economic growth of 1.9 percent.  About a third of that, by the way, is by simply using what we should use, which is the right policy baseline, so you end up with about $1 trillion in tax relief. And again, over 10 years, with $44 trillion coming in and with what the economists are saying about it generating more revenue through economic growth, I am convinced we are going to do better than that 1.9 percent.  I believe the pro-growth changes in this bill will help drive economic growth in ways that help every American family. We are in a position now, if we pass this bill, to be able to help all the people who are now looking at a tough time making ends meet--it is difficult for a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck--but it will also help to grow the economy generally.  Businesses and organizations all around the country are supporting this legislation because they believe it is going to help American families. We have about 120 groups already as of yesterday who are supporting us: the National Federation of Independent Business, which is the group that represents most of the small businesses in America; the Family Business Council, which represents a lot of small businesses that will benefit greatly from the changes we have not just with the corporation rate but also with how we deal with companies that are considered to be passthrough companies, the smaller companies. The National Retail Federation is strongly in support of this bill. The Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council supports this reform plan and the opportunities it has to create more economic growth for small businesses, to let them be more competitive.  You can look at some of the groups here, some of the roughly 120 groups that are supporting this legislation. Why? Because they know it is going to help. Big businesses will benefit and be more competitive; therefore their workers can compete. Through these pro-growth policies, small businesses are going to be able to grow and be more entrepreneurial, to come up with more innovations and expand employment.  We can estimate the savings for the middle-class family in every tax bracket, as I said, but what can't be measured as easily is the economic boost this is going to have for everybody. We are giving families freedom to spend more of their own money the way they see fit. We are putting faith in the American entrepreneurs and businesses to compete in a global market. We are bringing back some of that money that is locked up overseas. We are creating a fairer tax system that encourages jobs and investment here in this country rather than overseas. That is all good stuff.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is made in America and it is made for We need to come together now as a Congress--and I hope we will get support from the other side of the aisle as well--to pass this once-in-a-generation legislation to benefit our country.

457,topic-id,3446,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Cicilline for his strong leadership for the people of Rhode Island and his dedication to the middle class of America, which is besieged and under attack today in Washington, D.You know, the former Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin, came and said that this is the worst piece of tax legislation he had seen ever in the history of the United States of  Now, the good news is that the American people have taken a look, and they don't like it. By more than 2-1, the American people in public opinion polls are rejecting this plan. The Quinnipiac poll found that American voters are rejecting the plan by more than 2-1, with 52 percent disapproving and only 25 percent approving. Every day, the more people find out about it, the more that they hate the guts of this bill and what is inside of the tax plan.  We are in a situation of ``beat the clock'' now. Can we get the information out to the people, Mr.Speaker, about what is in this bill before it is rammed through the United States Congress?  So let's start with this: 82 million middle class households are going to see their taxes go up over the next decade. They are going to completely obliterate the State and local tax deduction, which States like mine, Maryland, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, Illinois, are going to be killed by, because if you make investments in your educational infrastructure, if you make investments in the transportation infrastructure, now they want to abolish the State and local tax deduction and make you pay twice for the same money that you have earned, while driving pressure down on the States to eliminate investment in the people who live in the States.[[Page H9565]]  Well, so they are going to raise taxes on millions of middle class families. Why? So they can slash taxes for the wealthiest corporations and the wealthiest people in the country. They want to slash the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent at a time of record corporate profits in  They say that everybody is going to get wage increases by that. But we have already got record corporate profits, and we have seen wage growth be stagnant under the policies that are being propounded by the GOP in  If you want to increase people's wages, increase the minimum wage. Have some courage. Have some honesty. Let's increase the minimum wage. Let's give America a raise. That will work, not just showering billions of dollars more on the richest people in the country.  By the way, it is not just the richest people in the country. One-third of corporate ownership in America goes to foreign investors. That is right. So if we decide to give $1\1/2\ trillion to investors in America with a corporate tax break, one-third of that money is going to leave America immediately and go to China or Saudi Arabia or wherever the rich corporate investors are.  The purpose of this bill isn't even just to enrich the wealthiest people in It is to enrich the wealthiest people on Earth because the money is going to be flying overseas as soon as we institute this corporate tax cut.  Then they build up record deficits: $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion in deficits on the House and Senate plans--which are twiddle dumb and twiddle dumber--$1.5 trillion to $2 trillion that the children, the grandchildren, and the great-grandchildren of the middle class are going to be paying back for decades so there can be a party on Wall Street; so there can be a party among the 1 percent; so Donald Trump's family, according to The New York Times, can collect up to $1 billion in tax relief.  How are they doing it?  Well, for example, they want to abolish the estate tax, which right now applies only to two of the richest 1,000 families in You take 1,000 families, only two of them are even paying the estate tax because it applies only to the wealthiest people in the country. They want to abolish that; totally in contradiction to the design of the Founders of America who did not want to see the transmission of millions, much less hundreds of millions, much less billions of dollars from one generation to the next because they understood that the intergenerational transmission of that kind of wealth is a threat to democracy.  At a certain point, people have enough houses, they have enough yachts, they have enough helicopters.  And now what do they want to buy?  They want to buy a governorship. They want to buy a Senate seat. They want to buy a whole institution like the House of Representatives or the U. That is not democracy, and the Founders knew it. That is plutocracy.  So the radical economic inequality, which they want to cement into place with this tax bill, is a direct threat to the Democratic values of country, the Democratic values of the Founders of  They want to eliminate the student loan interest deduction and lifetime learning credits, a direct assault on middle class upward mobility. They want to make it much more expensive for young people to go to college and then to pay their loans back.  They want to eliminate the medical expense deduction, which millions of families have used in order to take care of a loved one who has a serious long-term illness or is in long-term care. They just want to get rid of the medical expense deduction. You should read the letters and the emails that I am getting from families that are saying: ``This will bankrupt us.''  Right now, under the medical expense deduction, if you are spending more than 10 percent of your income on medical expenses, you can start to deduct it. They want to get rid of that.  Oh, guess who else that hits as collateral damage in the war against the middle class.  Families with children with special needs. Right now, families with children with special needs can go to a private school and they can deduct the tuition and expenses of that education as part of the medical expense deduction.  Well, the GOP wants to get rid of that, too, because I suppose life is just not hard enough on families in America who have kids with autism or kids with muscular dystrophy or kids who face any other manner of physical or neurological or mental or emotional problems.  We should be on the side of the families who are struggling with special needs children. We should be on their side. We should be on the side of the State and local governments that are trying heroically to address it. Instead, this legislation will pull the rug out from beneath families with special needs.  They want to impose dramatic new limits on the mortgage interest deduction, which, again, has been essential for the middle class to be able to partake of homeownership, which has been so much a part of building the middle class in our country.  Now, because the public is rebelling against this terrible tax plan the way the public rebelled against their terrible ACA repeal plan, which would have stripped 30 million Americans of their healthcare--by the way, the Senate plan now has smuggled into it a provision which would go back to the discredited ACA repeal plan by trying to throw millions of people off of their healthcare by overturning the individual mandate.  Well, the public has figured this out, and, here, in Washington, it is a race against the clock.  Will the tidal wave of public opinion reach Washington in time to stop them from passing a special interest tax scam, which appeals only to the top 1 percent of the country? Or will they be able to get it through in time?  But I appeal to my colleagues across the aisle, I beseech them, and I beg them to revisit the whole thing. This is not how we accomplish successful tax policy in the United States of  We did it in 1986. The Democrats and Republicans came together to do it.  You know how we did it?  With more than 2\1/2\ years of hearings, discussions, policy debates, town hall meetings all over We invited the best ideas to come from all sides, and it passed overwhelmingly in the House of It passed overwhelmingly in the U.The tax reform proposal, at the end, had been vetted and debated so much, everybody had contributed to it, it was so uncontroversial that it passed the House on a voice vote overwhelmingly, maybe unanimously. Nobody even asked for a rollcall vote. The Senate passed its version by a near unanimous vote of 97-3.  You see, that is how you do real tax reform. You bring the parties together to do it. There were more than 250 witnesses who appeared in the House Ways and Means Committee, who appeared before the Senate Finance Sure, there were some knockdown, drag-out fights; sure, the Democrats and Republicans were fighting like cats and dogs, but we were committed to coming up with a consensus product that would work for America, and we did it.  What we are seeing in Washington today is the exact opposite. The determination is to pass a completely partisan piece of legislation at all costs, with a very narrow majority running over the minority completely, and it is not going to work because America is a democracy. Taxation is the way that we support our government; the projects that we develop together. In taxation of all fields, we need to make sure that we are getting the best ideas from all sides. You can't ram it through and you can't crush the opposition.  What we are going to end up with--if they do manage to power this through with every manner of a backroom deal and a sweetheart contract and special interest strings attached, if they do manage to get it through, what you are going to have is a plan that is going to bankrupt the middle class the way that Donald Trump bankrupted four or five businesses.  The difference is that if you bankrupt a hotel, if you bankrupt a casino, if you bankrupt a corporation, well, there were laws that allow you to get back on your feet, and Donald Trump used them handsomely. He got back on his feet through the bankruptcy laws.  But what happens if you bankrupt the middle class of America? What happens if you bankrupt the government of the United States?[[Page H9566]]  This is irresponsible. This is not responsible governance that is taking place, to be advancing a plan that a recent Secretary of the Treasury has called the worst tax plan ever ventured forth in the history of the United States of  We asked the majority in the House and the Senate to pull the plug on this terrible assault on the middle class, pull the plug on the tax scam, and let's go back to the hearing rooms and let's have some real hearings, let's have experts come in and let's look at how to relieve the tax burden on hardworking middle class taxpayers, relieve the tax burden on families that have special needs children, relieve the tax burden on people struggling to go to college and graduate school.  Why don't we try to bolster and strengthen the charitable sector and colleges and universities and schools across the land instead of trying to undermine them in order to occasion a dramatic shift of income in wealth up the ladder in the country?  Let's get back to work together, because if you are able to muscle this plan through the House and the Senate using every trick in the book except for negotiation and compromise and cooperation, it will be a disaster for the American people.  It will come back not only to haunt the political careers of people who assented to it and participated in it, but it will come back to haunt the entire country because the deficits and the debt will be out of control. We know that from every nonpartisan budget estimate and economist that has looked at it, every single one across the spectrum. Even the ones who are using the GOP's preferred method of dynamic scoring are saying it is going to be hell in terms of deficits and in terms of the debt.  So we are going to end up having to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social That is what they are going to target next.  Whatever happened to the budget hawks? Are they an extinct species now? They are certainly an endangered species. Or have they just become budget ostriches?                              {time}  1800  They are hiding their heads in the sand while this highway robbery takes place in the Halls of Then they will come back next year, and they will say: Oh, look at these terrible deficits; we have got to cut Social Security; we have got to cut Medicare; we have got to cut  Now, suddenly, we are reborn as budget hawks again. We are born-again budget hawks. We can expect that to happen.  In the meantime, economic inequality in the country will continue to deepen and spread, and economic desperation will spread. We don't need to do this, Mr.Speaker, we do not need to do this. We are at a time of record corporate profits; record corporate prosperity. Wall Street has never been riding higher than it is now.  Why do we need to cut corporate taxes from 35 to 20 percent? Why do we need to start exporting more jobs abroad by instituting this new territoriality principle for taxes? A very fancy name that they assigned to it, do you know what it means? It means that if a business person is going to set up a factory on Main Street America with 1,000 jobs, they are going to pay full taxes on their business; but if they set it up in Hong Kong, or Singapore, or Mexico, or Switzerland, or the Cayman Islands, they are going to pay zero on it because it is not made in the United That is in this bill.  Now, they say they are going to recapture some of the money if it gets really obscene, but why should we have that principle at all now? In fact, the law today is compromised enough. It says that if they relocate their businesses abroad, they don't pay taxes until the profits are repatriated--until the profits come back. Now, all of it is on paper. The companies haven't really moved anyplace. That is dubious enough as it is.  They want to make the current system worse. They want to say that if you set up your business abroad, if you ship it overseas, either really or on paper--like to the Cayman Islands, or something like that--you escape taxation completely. Maybe we will be able to recapture a little bit of it later through some accounting tricks, but basically this is a massive invitation to corporate America to outsource jobs overseas--to ship our jobs overseas.  Now, I know the President of the United States is not much of a policy wonk. I am not sure if they have apprised him of this provision yet.  Mr.Speaker, I hope someone who is in touch with the President of the United States gets in touch with him and tells him that his campaign promise to put America first--promise to put American jobs first--and the tax plan that he is about to append his name to, if this actually happens, will be responsible for outsourcing and offshoring millions of American jobs, and profits, and taxes. That is built into this legislation, with a lot of other nasty surprises that surface every single day, as we try to figure out what is happening on this speeding train of the tax plan.  This process has nothing to do with representative democracy; it has nothing to do with integrity in the work of the people's representatives.  So, we ask our colleagues: Let's take a breather. The American people don't like what they see. They are rejecting it by more than 2 to 1 in all of the polls.  I have spoken to my colleagues across the aisle, who are getting very nervous about their emails, and their letters, and their calls right now, just like they got very nervous about the ACA repeal--which seemed like a great idea, until they had a majority in Congress--and then they realized that they were going to throw millions of people to the streets.  Now it is a question of whether or not you want to outsource and offshore millions of jobs, whether you want to drive a $1.5 trillion or $2 trillion hole in the American deficit and in our economy, and whether you want to, basically, loot the middle class for the purposes of a big payday on Wall Street, and among foreign investors from Hong Kong to Saudi Arabia?  Well, that is the question. That is the choice that faces America this week, Mr.That is what we are looking at. And who are we as a people? And do we have some sense--some semblance even--of community such that the GOP would want to try to get even 10 votes or 15 votes from the Democrats? All of the Democrats are opposing it.  Fortunately, 13 Republicans have crossed the aisle to say that they cannot stomach what they are seeing in this bill. We understand that there may be more coming this week, who are saying that they simply cannot tolerate what is taking place with this legislation.  But, as always, Mr.Speaker, this is a democracy that we are aspiring to be, not a plutocracy, not a theocracy, not a family government, not a royal government, but a democracy, which means that we place all of our faith and hope in the people to speak up, to talk to their representatives, to get in touch with them, and to ask them to read the fine print, so that we are not voting for a tax scam, instead of a tax bill.  All of the American people have a responsibility to get in touch with their legislators, Mr.Speaker, to ask: What is in the bill, and how is it going to affect us and the more than 80 million middle class families, who are going to end up seeing a tax hike over the next decade? And how is it going to affect people who take the State and local tax deduction and people who use the medical expense deduction for their families? And how is it going to affect people who have graduated from college and now are struggling to buy a house, or to get an apartment, or to move out of their parents' basement? And how is it going to affect them when the deduction for college student loan interest is abolished?  We need to slow down. We need to examine the priorities and the values that are built into this bill and see whether they actually square with the values, the beliefs, the priorities of the American people, and the needs of the American people.  We think this legislation is way off, Mr.We ask the GOP majority to consider the unanimous opposition of the democratic block in Congress; we ask them to consider the public opinion polls, which show the American people rejecting the details of this bill by more than 2 to 1; and we ask[[Page H9567]]them to start over. Let's do it the way Congress did it back in 1986, when Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan got together, and the Democrats and Republicans talked about it, fought about it, and debated it. But they came up with a plan that, in the end, the vast majority of Congress and the vast majority of the people could support.  Let's not walk the plank for the 1 percent here. We know that there are some tiny interests in America that want to see this pass. Let's not walk the plank in Congress for a bill that reflects the interests of only the tiniest group of people. Let's do the job imagined by that great Republican President, who served in this body, proudly, from Illinois, in the House of Representatives: Abraham Lincoln, who spoke of ``government of the people, by the people, for the people.'' That is the part of that great triad that we will be betraying if we pass this bill, because it is not for the people, it is for the 1 percent.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-30-pt1-PgH9563-6.txt,1E+14,TAX CUTS AND MORE JOBS FOR MONTANANS,2017,30,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

829,topic-id,516,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, before I get into my speech this evening, I just want to take a moment.  I just heard a colleague on the other side of the aisle call me, essentially, a master of deceit. This country is sick and tired of this type of divisive rhetoric. I am here to tell you that it is time to put the American people first.  I understand that we sit sometimes in this Chamber in the biggest political theater in the United States of America, but at some point in time I have got to say enough is enough.  To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I would ask us and the American people back home to look at the legislation that we have done in the committee.  The bottom line, in the House bill, hardworking taxpayers in my district are going to see $1,600 of their hard-earned dollars remain in their pocket with the government not taking that money away from them.  There are differences between the House bill and the Senate bill. I think there are legitimate parts to the Senate bill we should consider in this conference committee that we are going to entertain here very shortly. They are things like the medical expense deduction, things like, potentially, the historic tax credit. But that is how legislation is drafted. We have a body in the Senate, we have a body in the House, and we come together to put the best product forward for the American people.  I will tell you, as I have heard from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if reducing taxes is not a part of economic growth, then you disagree with every Governor in the United States of America, because every Governor's economic development plan across this country, what does it do?  You see the commercials as you travel around this country: Come to New York State; we are open for business because we have lowered our taxes for opportunities and growth. I see it in I see it in I see it in  So what we have done with the proposal in the House is exactly that. We have focused relief on hardworking taxpayers, and we have lowered the tax burden overall so that people can invest in their businesses, invest in their families, and grow the economy, which, at the end of the day, do you know what that means for an American person?  It means more money for them, but, most importantly, it means a job--a job not only to make money, but it is good for the soul. It is good for the heart. It brings you pride in knowing that you did an honest day's work to get an honest day's amount of pay. That is what growth is about. It is not about numbers. It is about people and opportunity.  I ask my colleagues, join us in rejecting this motion to instruct, and let's get to the business of the people and finish the job once and for all.                              {time}  1930  ",CREC-2017-12-04-pt1-PgH9602-6.txt,1982,2015,2017,4,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1024,topic-id,689,"Mr.President, I would like to make a few remarks to honor a great  Sean Stackley served as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition from July 28, 2008, to August 3, 2017. He also served as the Acting Secretary of the Navy from January 20 to August 3, 2017. By virtue of the length of his Navy service, Secretary Stackley has become the longest serving Assistant Secretary of the Navy in history. Until Sean's service, Franklin Delano Roosevelt held the record for the longest serving Assistant Secretary of the Navy, but Sean has eclipsed that record by almost 2 years.  I first came to know Secretary Stackley as a staff member of the Senate Armed Services Committee from 2005 until the time he was sworn in as Assistant Secretary of the Before that, Sean graduated from the Naval Academy in 1979 and served on Active Duty in the Navy until 2005, when he retired after having been program manager for the LPD-17  It would be hard to find a more dedicated public servant who brought so much to the table and continued to give his best even after he could justifiably have moved on to an easier job. There was hardly any area of building the Navy of the future where Secretary Stackley's good judgment and broad experience has not improved the outcome. During his tenure, he was responsible for placing 90 ships, nearly 1,700 aircraft, and over 20,000 weapons under contract. He was a staunch advocate for making every dollar count and worked to employ competitive techniques on every contract where possible. He championed multiyear contracts on mature programs, including the Arleigh Burke class destroyer, Virginia class attack submarine, MV-22 tiltrotor, and the F/A-18 Super Hornet Programs which collectively saved the taxpayer over $6 billion. He drove direct competition on many programs, including the Presidential helicopter, air and missile defense radar, ship-to-shore connector, and amphibious combat vehicle. He also introduced many creative forms of competition, including combining two different ship classes in one solicitation and introducing competition on the Aegis weapon system for the first time in 40 years.  Secretary Stackley's creativity in acquisition contributed to ensuring a strong industrial base. He promoted open architecture standards for all Navy programs to provide competitive opportunities for large, medium, and small businesses. He ensured the Department synchronized contract awards on major weapons programs so that industry could be more efficient by combining commodity and subvendor buys. He also challenged the Department's purchases of contractor services which saved the Department over $2 billion. He was also an advocate for small business and proactively assigned every deputy program manager to be the small business advocate in every program office.  Secretary Stackley did not shy away from difficult problems. He commissioned an end-to-end review of CVN-78 program to keep the ship under the congressional cost cap. He was a champion for the Navy's cybersafe efforts. He implemented a settlement for the A-12 litigation, the longest running government contract case in history, by working diligently with General Dynamics and Boeing to find a win-win solution for the government and the contractors. He was always mindful of the warfighter ensuring the Urgent Needs Process was agile and responsive. He recognized the strength of working with our international partners and forged strong ties on a myriad of programs, including the Joint Strike Fighter and Columbia class submarine.  Secretary Stackley was a staunch advocate for the acquisition workforce. He successfully argued for tools and funding that would provide necessary training and certification for the workforce. In addition, he was passionate about promoting diversity. His dedication to the workforce was most evident during the Washington Navy Yard shooting and the days and weeks that followed where he was most concerned with the well-being of the individuals impacted.  I am very sorry to see Secretary Stackley leave government service, but he has more than earned time to pursue other goals. However, I am confident that his legacy will continue with the strong team that he built and nurtured.  With that, I want to wish Sean and his wife, Terri, ``fair winds and following seas.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-05-pt1-PgS7842.txt,1982,BIG DAY FOR AMERICA,2017,5,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1403,topic-id,2153,"Mr.President, it is our responsibility to ensure that future generations will have greater opportunity and greater security than we inherited from our parents and our forebears. To accomplish this, we must put aside political expedience and take a sober look at the health of our national economy and our ability to keep our commitments at home and around the world. With this in mind, I rise to urge my colleagues to reject the partisan and fiscally irresponsible Republican tax proposals in the so-called Tax Cuts and Jobs When we strip away the rosy, but false, economic projections and ideologically motived economic theories the Republicans have been using to hype this bill, it is clear this bill trades away our nation's long-term economic health and the well-being of working Americans, the poor, the sick, and the old in order to benefit the wealthy. Moreover, this bill will take us trillions of dollars deeper into debt at a time when the costs of 16 years of debt-financed wars continue to mount. Republicans owe it to our country and to future generations who will be stuck with the multi-trillion-dollar cost of this bill to go back to the drawing board and produce a balanced and permanent bipartisan path forward on our Nation's broken Tax  It does not take an economist to see that the Republican tax bill is a historic $1.5 trillion transfer of wealth from poor and working Americans to the very wealthiest among us, but a few of its glaring injustices are worth mentioning. According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, it gives over twice as much tax relief to millionaires as it does to Americans making under $50,000. Just 5,000 of the wealthiest American families will receive hundreds of billions of dollars over a decade in the form of estate tax breaks at a time when income and wealth inequality in this country are at historic highs. This transfer of wealth through estate tax repeal alone requires us to go back to the drawing board. On the other hand, the bill[[Page S7284]]raises taxes on 19.4 million households earning under $200,000 by as much as $500. Forty-six percent of households making under $100,000 and 50 percent of households making under $75,000 will either see their taxes go up over the next decade or see no change at all, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. While tax cuts for big corporations are made permanent, the Republican bill plans to claw back what little it gives to everyone else after a few years, setting up even bigger tax hikes for the middle class down the line. This does not even begin to cover the return of TrumpCare that has been added to this bill, which would take healthcare coverage away from 13 million Americans and drive up costs substantially for the poor, the sick, and the elderly.  This bill is a bad investment and, frankly, it is one we can ill afford. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model provided by the University of Pennsylvania, the bill will reduce Federal revenue by as much as $1.7 trillion and increase our national debt by $2 trillion in the 10-year budget window. By 2040, this becomes $3.6 trillion in lost Federal revenue and up to $6.9 trillion in debt. We would take on all this debt for an estimated 0.4 to 0.9 percent boost in For $1.5 trillion, we could make needed repairs to our streets and highways across America--creating tens of thousands of jobs in the process. We could pay off every American's credit card or student loan, or lift every American above the poverty line for years. Instead, this bill would put yet another massive charge on America's credit card that will not create jobs, will not trickle down, and most certainly will not pay for itself. We still have a $5.6 trillion in deficits and interest payments from the Bush tax cuts to prove it. With over $20 trillion in national debt, it is long past time to stop experimenting with people's lives and livelihoods to prove yet again there are no merits to supply-side economics. America has pressing needs and very real bills coming due.  Mr.President, I would like to spend the remaining time of my remarks addressing something about which we have heard far too little in this debate, and that is the impact on our national economic health of the unavoidable and compounding cost of 16 years of military conflict paid for almost entirely through debt. For the first time in our history, the United States reduced revenue--in the form of the Bush tax cuts--rather than the usual pay-as-you-go approach to financing the post-9/11 wars. While we debate potentially adding trillions of dollars to the debt for an ill-conceived tax bill, the costs of war are coming due.  According to calculations in the thorough report by the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute at Brown University, ``[e]ven if the U.stopped spending on war at the end of this fiscal year, interest costs alone on borrowing to pay for the wars will continue to grow apace . . . [f]uture interest costs for overseas contingency operations spending alone are projected to add more than $1 trillion to the national debt by 2023. By 2056, a conservative estimate is that the interest costs will be about $8 trillion, unless the U.changes the way it pays for the wars.''  In a sense, what we are doing is mortgaging the future of our children and grandchildren as we continue to add debt, and this is unavoidable debt in so many cases. We know we cannot immediately stop our engagement in countries throughout the world--in Afghanistan, in the Middle East and other areas. And, frankly, we are facing tremendous challenges in the Korean The approximate combined President's budget request for the Departments of Defense, State, and USAID for fiscal year 2018 is $14 billion for Iraq and Syria, and $48.9 billion for  Furthermore, these costs do not account for much needed maintenance and modernization of our military assets. For example, modernizing, operating, and sustaining our nuclear triad--which includes submarines, bombers, and ICBMs--is projected to cost $1.2 trillion in 2017 dollars over the next 30 years. We are debating taking $1.5 trillion and giving it to the wealthiest Americans when we know that we need an additional $1.2 trillion over 30 years to secure the safety of the United States and the civility of the world through nuclear deterrence. This begs the very simple question: If we want to borrow $1.5 trillion, why don't we invest it in a cost we know will come due--protecting our country and the world through the renovation and reinvigoration of our nuclear triad.  The Navy recently validated a requirement for 355 ships. This would require the Navy to purchase around 329 new ships over 30 years--an average cost of $102 billion per year through 2047, which is 13 percent more than the $90 billion needed to build and operate the current 254-ship fleet envisioned in the Navy's 2017 plan. Once again, we are committing ourselves to billions of dollars of costs to our Navy shipbuilding program while we are entertaining a 1.5 or more trillion-dollar tax giveaway to the wealthiest We know these costs are coming due, but we are fooling ourselves into thinking we can continue spending on credit forever.  We can expect even greater costs if our military increases end strength, as so many on both sides of the aisle are proposing. This is because of high operational tempo, which is not likely to diminish. For every additional 10,000 servicemembers, it costs roughly $1.8 billion per year for pay and benefits, and to train and equip these personnel. If the Army grows to 580,000 personnel, it will cost an additional $18 billion per year, but we are taking that money, and we are giving it in tax cuts, the prominent amount of which is going to the wealthiest We are not investing it now in increasing our military forces. If the Air Force grows by 30,000 personnel, it will cost an additional $6 billion per year. If the Marine Corps grows by 20,000 personnel, it will cost an additional $3.6 billion per year. If you talk to the Commandant or Chief of Staff of the Air Force, they will tell you they have to increase the size of their force because of the operational tempo. Indeed, if you talk to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, he will tell you they are in a desperate situation maintaining sufficient pilots to fly our aircraft. So we could be buying hundreds of new F-35 aircraft at a significant cost and watch them parked because we can't afford the flight crews to fly them and to maintain them. We know these costs are coming, and we are ignoring them until they come due. We are ignoring them now for the benefit of these tax cuts.  If we do not chart a responsible path forward on economic policy, we will leave all these costs to the next generation, to the detriment of our children, our national security, and our position of world leadership. Frankly, it might not be even that long before serious issues materialize. Once the markets determine that $1.5 trillion is just a small fraction of what we still must pay to protect ourselves; to continue our commitment in Afghanistan, to continue to support allies across the globe, markets may learn very quickly that the deficit is beginning to devour us. The markets will react, as they have in the past. So we could see a serious problem long before even our children confront these debts.  That is why earlier today former Secretaries of Defense Leon Panetta, Chuck Hagel, and Ash Carter sent a letter to congressional leadership and the House and Senate Armed Services Committee leadership that warned us that the fiscal irresponsibility of the Republican tax proposal will contribute to a growing budget crisis. The letter urges Congress to instead address the sequester that threatens to ``hollow out'' our military's ability to sustain the commitments of its global missions.  Mr.President, tax policies have real consequences. We can debate the value of one tax proposal over another, but that is not the debate before us. The simple facts are that this tax bill will give breaks to the people who need them the least, take money from working Americans, leave millions of Americans sicker and worse off, and further strain our ability to keep America safe from growing and changing threats across the globe. It also threatens expenditures on healthcare, education, infrastructure, and other vital domestic needs as the debt balloons due to this bill's unaffordable tax breaks for corporate titans. This is not what we owe the next generation. It is not even what we owe our children today. I urge my colleagues across the aisle to consider our Nation's future and join us in opposing this legislation.[[Page S7285]]  Like so many here, I was here in 2001 when President George Bush proposed his tax cuts, which I opposed, and assured us that our economy would grow, that jobs would multiply, that we would be fine. Let me remind my colleagues that he said this after we had made the tough decisions in the Clinton Administration that led to a projected surplus in the billions of dollars. The mantra from many people at the time was, let's give the money back to the American people.  We don't have a surplus today. We have a significant deficit. It will grow with this bill because this bill says that we are going to increase it by $1.5 trillion at a minimum, and it will not be just $1.5 trillion.  I suggest that, unless we abandon our commitments to the men and women of our Armed Forces, unless we decide to disengage from the deterrent that we must have to defend the Nation from a nuclear Armageddon, unless we decide to leave Afghanistan--after the President announced that no longer are we basing our decisions on time but on conditions--there will continue to be trillions and trillions of dollars of unavoidable costs that should be included in this debate.  This is not the time to take trillions of dollars and give a disproportionate share to the wealthiest This is the time for us to work together, to provide the resources for our military, to provide investments for our people, and to deal with the issue of inequality between the wealthiest 1 percent and everybody else. None of that is accomplished by this bill. In fact, this bill will complicate, compound, and make even more difficult the problems we face in defending the Nation and giving people a chance at having better futures.  I yield the floor.

1409,topic-id,1039,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization  After several months of negotiations, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have arrived at a completed conference agreement. Earlier today, we passed the NDAA for the 56th consecutive year.  Let me highlight some of the important issues that we addressed in this agreement. This conference agreement authorizes a total of $692 billion, which includes $626.4 billion in base budget funding for the Department of Defense and certain security activities of the Department of Energy and $65.8 billion in overseas contingency operations, or OCO, funding.  Of course, we could not have done it without the cooperation of all the members of the committee, including the Presiding Officer, and I thank him for his contribution and his service.  This includes the administration's $5.9 billion budget amendment we received earlier this month, which seeks an additional $4.7 billion in base budget funding to bolster missile defense and to repair two Navy ships after recent collisions, as well as $1.2 billion in OCO funding for operations in Afghanistan and for additional capabilities in the Central Command area of operations.[[Page S7289]]  The conference agreement includes significant increases in additional resources aimed at restoring full spectrum readiness, as soon as possible, across the military services. Specifically, operation and maintenance funding, widely known as the lifeblood readiness, was increased by $1.16 billion for the Army, $277.9 million for the Navy, $82.3 million for the Marine Corps, and $1 billion for the U.Air  This conference agreement supports the topline of $700 billion for national defense, or 050, activities, which is roughly $150 billion over the Budget Control Act cap. If the cap is not adjusted and if this amount is fully funded by the appropriators, then we would trigger the harmful across-the-board cuts of sequestration, just at the time when we are trying to restore readiness.  I want to be clear. I agree that the DOD needs additional resources. But we must address the caps for both defense and nondefense activities.  I remind my colleagues that under the Budget Control Act, or BCA, national defense activities include certain programs at the FBI and the Coast Guard, while nondefense activities include the State Department, veterans' care, Customs and Border Protection, and the We need to look at our Nation's needs holistically, and we must remain vigilant over the amount of money the DOD can effectively utilize. We have to look at national security, and that includes both sides and both caps  With regard to our overseas operations, the conference report authorizes the entirety of the funding request for our efforts in Afghanistan, including $1.7 billion to invest in critical aviation capabilities, such as close air support platforms and modernized rotary wing assets, and to continue to sustain and train the existing fleet.  The report also authorizes 3,500 special immigrant visas to continue to uphold our commitments to the many brave Afghans who have provided critical support to the U.mission in In this regard, let me thank Chairman McCain and Senator Shaheen, without whose efforts this provision would not have been included, I believe, in the final conference.  The conference report continues robust support for our counterterrorism efforts against ISIS, al-Qaida, and the other violent extremist groups, including approximately $1.8 billion for the Train and Equip Programs in Iraq and It also fully funds the Department's budget request for U.Special Operations  With this bill, we will enhance public transparency and congressional oversight of military operations and the policies that underpin them. Most notably, it requires a public articulation of the legal and policy frameworks governing the use of military force outside of declared war zones, as well as additional reporting on civilian casualty incidents and DOD efforts to prevent them.  The conference report includes a requirement for the Secretary of Defense to appoint a senior official in the Department to lead an effort to harness and integrate all of the Department's capabilities to confront and defeat the kind of strategic influence operations that Russia has conducted against us and our allies over the last 2 years. It is vital that the Defense Department integrate its cyber capabilities with its information warfare experts to provide capabilities and options in time for next year's election cycle in the United States and to support our allies in Europe against Russian operations directed against them.  Additionally, the conference report includes a requirement for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State to develop and report to Congress on a comprehensive, whole-of-government strategy to counter the Russian malign influence threat. Such a detailed strategy must include measures to defend against and deter Russian activities related to national security, including hybrid warfare, cyber attacks, and information operations.  The 2018 NDAA also authorizes the Secretary of Defense to establish the Indo-Asia-Pacific Stability Initiative, which will be used to improve our posture in the Asia-Pacific region and provide additional resources to increase partner capacity and multilateral exercises in the region.  The Chief of Naval Operations' Force Structure Assessment from last winter identified a goal of 355 ships, including 66 attack submarines. This bill makes a good downpayment on that goal by adding five ships to the budget, including one DDG-51 destroyer, two littoral combat ships, one LX(R) amphibious ship, and one expeditionary sea base.  Perhaps not as dramatic, but no less important, is the addition of $698 million in the budget request to allow the Navy to begin expanding the submarine industrial base. Achieving the CNO's force structure goal will require adding 18 attack submarines to the previous force structure goal of 48 boats.  This will be no small challenge since retirement of older submarines will exceed deliveries of new submarines. During the 10-year period of 1991 to 2000, we ordered only four attack submarines--Connecticut, Jimmy Carter, Virginia, and Texas--so we have to do some catching up.  Providing the resources for the Navy to expand the submarine industrial base in an orderly fashion will be a critical element of efficiency and a critical element in building up our fleet.  The conference fully supports the budget requests for the modernization of the triad and its nuclear command and control to ensure we can deter existential threats to our homeland.

1964,topic-id,1849,"Madam President, two weeks ago, I urged my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to reject the partisan and fiscally irresponsible Republican tax proposal in the so-called Tax Cuts and Jobs I asked them to remember that, when it comes to our responsibility to plan for the nation's long-term economic future, we are here to create opportunity and security for future generations--not to serve the short-term interests of partisan politics. Today, I regret to say that the process surrounding the Republican tax bill has only become more rushed, more partisan, more bitter, and less transparent. My Republican colleagues wrote this bill behind closed doors, held no serious hearings or debate, and even now are planning to make substantial changes to the final bill that we will vote on before we have even had the benefit of a comprehensive, nonpartisan score of its cost.  We all know better than to believe that this irresponsible process will lead to a responsible or sustainable outcome. Therefore, because it is clear that this bill is an unprecedented giveaway to wealthy corporations and individuals at the expense of poor, sick, elderly, and middle-class Americans, and because it will drive our Nation trillions of dollars further into debt, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this bill and to work with both sides of the aisle to craft tax reform that will help--rather than burden--future generations and the middle class.  The only future generations that this bill appears to take into account are the children and grandchildren of the wealthiest families in the United States, including President Trump's family and the families of the wealthiest Cabinet ever assembled by any According to the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, half of all households, and two-thirds of households making between $54,700 and $93,200 would see their taxes go up under the current Republican bill. Individuals who struggle to get by because of sickness or the unavailability of well-paying job opportunities would lose tax exemptions and advantages that have helped them stay afloat. Many Americans who have played by the rules and persevered through our long recovery from the great recession will open their paychecks to see a little more taken out every month, but not for their benefit. On the other hand, for the 5,000 American families with fortunes in the millions of dollars or more, the Republican plan to repeal or drastically curtail the estate tax could, on its own, funnel hundreds of billions of dollars to those few who need it the very least.  The mere idea that we would raise taxes on poor and working Americans to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest American estates epitomizes how this Republican tax bill is wholly at odds with our values. The trillions of dollars this bill will add to our deficit will almost certainly lead to deep cuts in earned benefits like Social Security and Medicare, as well as our national defense. Indeed, major cuts to defense historically follow deficit-increasing tax cuts, and this is almost precisely why we have an estate tax in the first place.  Our Nation first enacted estate taxes in order to pay for military conflicts without driving the Nation deeply into debt. Starting in 1797, and continuing through the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, and World War I, the United States used temporary estate taxes to offset the costs of war. Congress kept the estate tax after World War I as a means of balancing the Federal budget and countering the growth of massive wealth inequality. Because of this foresight, the estate tax was a critical source of revenue that softened the blow of the Great Depression and supported the war effort in World War  Prior Congresses saw it as their responsibility to pay America's bills at home and abroad. They did not leave years of war on America's line of credit, nor did they expect the poor and working classes to pay while the[[Page S7372]]wealthiest took a tax cut. There were certainly times when running a deficit was necessary, and even economically wise, but because of this pay-as-you-go principle, no American generation has faced what we do now: 16 years of deficit-financed military conflict with no end in sight, compounded by the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy that never paid for themselves, despite repeated Republican promises. Before we give the wealthiest Americans another tax cut at the expense of our children and our children's children, we need at least an idea of how we are going to handle trillions of dollars in compounding war debt--not to mention the trillions more we must spend to maintain and modernize our military--and address our basic domestic needs that have gone unnoticed and underfunded for so long.  That is why I plan to file a motion on this bill that would send this bill back to the Finance Committee to reinstate the estate tax at current levels and place all the revenue generated by it into a trust fund. Those funds, which amount to hundreds of billions of dollars over a decade, will be devoted evenly between maintaining the readiness of our Armed Forces and addressing the opioid epidemic here at home. This motion not only restores original intent of the estate tax as a tool for combating deficits in times of war but also makes a much needed down-payment on our long-stalled domestic agenda.  But the bill's elimination of the estate tax is just one of its many harmful provisions. The bill sabotages our healthcare system by repealing the individual mandate, which could easily throw 13 million Americans off their health insurance and increase premiums for millions of others. Yet again, the 130 million Americans with preexisting conditions must fear that their premiums will skyrocket or that they will be left with no options at all.  And the poor and the sick may find even fewer options after this bill forces $25 billion in cuts into Medicare in 2018 alone because of the massive deficits it will produce. Do not tell me this will pay for itself with growth. I have served in this body long enough to know that trickle-down economics doesn't work, and I take the word of the scores of economists who say, in no uncertain terms, that this bill will balloon the debt and will not create enough growth to offset it. Even major companies like Cisco, Pfizer, and Coca-Cola say they will use the gains from these massive corporate tax cuts to pay shareholders, rather than create jobs or raise wages for the middle class. We are making decisions here that will guide the largest economy in the world. We simply cannot roll the dice on a plan of this scale and hope for the best.  It remains my sincere hope that my Republican colleagues will see the error of their ways and choose to work with Democrats on tax reform that is bipartisan, reasonable, and in keeping with our responsibility to leave this Nation better than we found it. We can and should address other domestic priorities in dire need like our Nation's infrastructure, the economic security of children and seniors, and programs that create and sustain employment for the middle class. I and my colleagues are ready and willing to work in good faith on tax reform, but we cannot begin that work until we abandon the kind of recklessness and partisanship that led to this Republican tax bill.  Once again, we are all here, and we are all committed to defending our Nation, but this bill will make it virtually impossible to do what we know we must do. There are unavoidable costs in our national security that are not even counted in this bill. My fellow members of the Armed Services Committee and I have committed to making needed increases to the size of our military forces. It costs roughly an additional $1.8 billion per year for every 10,000 servicemembers. Where will we get that money when we are going $1.8 trillion in debt to provide tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? We want a 355-ship There have been some estimates that doing that will require at least an additional $1 trillion a year. Where are we going to get that when we have already given $1.5 trillion to the wealthiest Americans? We have to modernize our nuclear triad, our submarines, our land-based missiles, and our aircraft. There are estimates that this will cost about $400 billion per year in costs. Where are we getting that, since we have given the money--$1.5 trillion--to the wealthiest Americans? We have overseas operations in Over a 10-year period, roughly $10 billion must be repaid. We pay about $1 billion a year there. For Syria, that is $13 billion. If we stay there for 10 years--and that seems to be the present policy--that is $130 billion. We pay $50 billion a year to support the Afghan operation. We are going to stay there, apparently, under the current procedure--not based on time but conditions--for another 10 years. Add that up, and that is about $640 billion over the next 10 years, just to maintain the situation in those three countries.  These are not costs we can ignore. If we did, we would--at the very least--be turning our backs on the policies announced by this President and this Congress--and by my Republican colleagues in particular. But where is this money coming from? We don't have the situation we had in 2001 when President George Bush proposed his tax cuts. We don't have an expected $5 trillion surplus. We already have a multitrillion-dollar deficit over 10 years, and we are adding to that deficit. We know we have to maintain the military expenditures.  Anyone who is voting for this bill is essentially saying: I will talk a good story about supporting national security, but when it comes down to the money, it is going to go to the wealthiest Americans, to things like the estate tax cut. It is going to go to the wealthiest Americans who are paying the alternative minimum tax. The money we need for security will not be there unless we borrow it from future generations--to fund the things we know we already have to fund to defend  This is absolutely irresponsible, and, as a result, I would hope we could regain our senses, sit down, and deal, on a bipartisan basis, with tax reform that could help all of us and could indeed even begin, after 16 years, to put real money into our national defense rather than borrowing it from future generations. Again, this bill is not only economically unwise because it will not generate growth, but it is also irresponsible because it will put us in a position where we will be choosing, very shortly--in the next several years--whether we are going to cut defense or whether we are going to cut Social Security or whether we are going to cut everything because the deficit is growing so large. I don't think we should put ourselves in that position.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

On the business side, the harsh reality is that America has become an uncompetitive place to do business. With the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world, it should not be a surprise that businesses are relocating to countries with better business climates. Fortunately, by bringing our rate down to 20 percent, we can make America one of the most competitive countries in the world to do business.  It is hard for U.companies to compete against companies based in Canada, where the Federal income tax rate is 15 percent, Ireland at 12.5 percent, or even the U.K., which will be 17 percent by 2020. Businesses set their prices to be competitive. The U.has to set its business rate to compete, as well.  The high corporate tax rate is not just a Wall Street problem; it is a Main Street problem. Business entities do not pay taxes; people do.  The burden of the corporate tax rate falls on three categories of people: shareholders, customers, and employees. Corporations do not pay taxes; we do.  This bill helps companies compete, hire more people, and give them a more competitive wage.

1588,topic-id,301,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce the Blackrock Land Exchange Act of 2017.  The legislation supports a mutually beneficial effort between the Bureau of Land Management and the J.Simplot Company in Idaho that began over 20 years ago. Simplot proposed an exchange of their privately owned land with superior natural resources and recreational opportunities for a similar sized parcel of BLM land adjacent to a Simplot phosphate processing facility. This facility adds significant value to the Pocatello, Idaho area as a large employer that sustains over 350 jobs with an over $55 million annual economic impact.  In 2007, BLM issued a Final Decision Record on the Environmental Assessment concluding the exchange would have no significant environmental impact, which was reaffirmed in 2009 by the Department of Interior Board of Land However, the exchange has been held up since 2011 due to the District Court for Idaho ruling that BLM needed to prepare a full Environmental Impact Statement including detailed future use to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.  This raises the possibility of a dangerous precedent for future land conveyances, as the exchange itself does not authorize further activities. Future use of the proposed adjacent land by the phosphate facility would still be subject to NEPA with opportunity for public comment. Halting the Blackrock Land Exchange for this reason could largely increase the scope, length, and cost of the NEPA process.  This bill will allow for this exchange in Idaho that has support from--State and local government as well as various land users.

447,topic-id,1161,"Mr.President, today I want to honor the life and work of a man whose inventions--most notably, the large round hay baler--literally changed the landscape of Wesley Fisher Buchele, a native Kansan and professor emeritus of agricultural engineering at Iowa State University, died September 13, 2017, at a hospice in Ames, He was age 97.  Wes and his twin brother Luther were born in a Kansas farmhouse near Cedar Vale, KS, on March 18, 1920, to Charles and Bessie (Fisher) Wesley and Luther were the youngest of seven Buchele brothers.  Growing up on a Kansas farm in the 1920s and 1930s was hard work. Economic depression in rural America started early in the 1920s and worsened when the Great Depression hit the entire country in 1929. When Wes was 11, his father, Charles Buchele, died, leaving Wes's mother and the Buchele brothers to run the family farm. Wes and Luther and several other brothers were still in school.  The Bucheles ran a raw milk farm. Among other jobs, Wes delivered fresh milk early in the morning on his way to school, which sometimes made him late to school. When the principal found out why Wes was late, he essentially gave Wes permission to be late if needed, saying that Wes had made more money for his family that morning than the principal would make all week.  All the brothers worked to fill their father's shoes, driven by the fear of losing the family farm because of a $5,000 mortgage, roughly $60,000 in today's money. They succeeded. At the close of the Depression, the Buchele farm was the only one in their valley stil1 in the same family's hands as at the beginning of the  At age 15, Wes was running a four-man threshing crew, when ``it was 105 deg.F in the shade--and there was no shade!'' The Buchele brothers bought a used tractor and ran it 24 hours a day, doing contract field work. One night, Wes pulled a night shift on that tractor, and while plowing, he woke up as the tractor powered through a fence.  The experiences of the sweaty, dirty, grueling work of threshing grain and baling hay led him to a lifelong interest in making the lives of farmers easier and safer.  After graduating from Cedar Vale High School, Wes enrolled at Kansas State College where he earned bachelor of Science degree in agricultural engineering. While at Kansas State, Wes met Mary They were married at Mary's hometown of Minneapolis, KS, on June 12, 1945.  At K-State, Wes enlisted in the Reserve Officers Training Corps, As second lieutenant in the U.Army, Wes was on a troop ship sailing toward Japan for the anticipated invasion when Japan announced its surrender after atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Wes was part of the demilitarizing force on the island of Hokkaido and the northern part of the island of Honshu, After World War II, Wes served in the Army Reserve for 20 years, retiring as a major.  After leaving Active Army Duty, Wes worked as an engineer for several years for John Deere in Waterloo, He then left John Deere to do graduate work at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, where he earned his master's degree agricultural and mechanical engineering. He and Mary then moved to Ames, IA, where he earned his Ph.in agricultural engineering and soil physics at Iowa State  After earning his Ph.D., Wes taught at Michigan State University in East Lansing, MI, before returning to Iowa State University in 1963 to join its faculty.  As noted by his son, Steven Buchele, after the move back to Ames, ``Dad never worked another day of his life. For Dad, it was all fun and interesting and ISU encouraged his imagination and he loved teaching and inventing things. It wasn't work, and he earned the name `Wild Wes.' ''  He also earned the name ``Blood and Guts Buchele'' for how he championed the cause of farm machinery safety. In class, he showed hundreds of slides of people who had lost arms or legs, hands or feet to a PTO shaft or a grain auger or what a farmer looked like after being sprayed with anhydrous ammonia. One student said that he never looked at farming the same way after seeing Wes's slides.  At Iowa State, Wes's creativity blossomed. He published hundreds of technical articles, aided greatly by the able editing of his wife, He was awarded 23 patents, the two most notable being the large round baler and the axial-flow threshing cylinder for combines. Almost all combines sold today are rotary combines that employ a variation of the axial-flow threshing cylinder.  Wes also designed blade guards for rotary lawn mowers, a tandem tractor--a precursor to the four-wheel drive tractor--and devices for harvesting crops like strawberries, alfalfa, and marigolds. He developed a ridge-till farming system that, in addition to saving farmers time and fuel, also helped the environment by conserving topsoil and soil moisture. It was a precursor to today's ``No-till farming.''  Wes loved teaching and mentoring the hundreds of graduate students who came from all over the world specifically to study with him. Upon graduation, they then went into industry or back to their home countries, helping further improve agricultural practices throughout the world.  Wes published three books: ``The Grain Harvesters'' with Graeme Quick, in 1978; ``Just Call Us Luck'' with twin brother, Luther, about their childhood in Kansas, in 2008; and ``Who Really Invented the Cotton Gin'' with William Mayfield in 2016. He also wrote many other unpublished books, including a volume two to the Grain Harvesters, and hundreds of short stories.  Leading up to and after retirement in 1989, Mary and Wes traveled the world, teaching in China before and after Tiananmen Square, in Ghana, Australia, Tanzania, Nigeria, and the  After the death of his wife, Mary, in 2000, Wes wou1d visit, his four children and their spouses--Rod and his wife, Mary Lou, Marybeth, Sheron and her husband, Curtis, and Steven and his wife, Suzanne, his eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren, staying for 6 weeks to 2 months, depending on ``the list.'' ``When Dad arrived, he would ask for `the list,' a list of things that needed fixing around the house, promising to stay only as long as there were things to do on that list. Then he would move on to the next child's family--and a new list,'' said Steve  On Labor Day 2017, Wes decided to mow the backyard of the home in Ames he shared with his daughter, As he used a rope to lower the lawn mower down a slope to finish mowing,[[Page S7559]]he had a major stroke. Nine days later, he died, after hundreds of friends and family came to hospice to say good-bye.  Wes Buchele lived a long, full, productive life with energy and verve. He had, indeed, fulfilled his calling to help make the lives of farmers easier and safer, and our country and our world are better for that.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-30-pt1-PgS7558-2.txt,968,MINNESOTA'S ECONOMIC RIGHTS IN THE SUPERIOR NATIONAL FOREST ACT,2017,30,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1152,topic-id,1927,"Mr.President, if I have time at the end of my remarks, I would like to yield to the distinguished Senator from I will try to be prompt.  Soon, this Senate will take a historic vote that will impact every These votes do not come very often. The last was decades ago. I think we all understand--or at least most of us understand--how critical tax reform is. All of us in the Senate, on both sides of the aisle, are familiar with the burdens and the complexity and the lack of competitiveness associated with our current tax system.  It is abundantly clear that this complexity and our antiquated corporate tax system acts as a brake on our economy. It is equally clear that in recent years our economic growth rate--our gross domestic product--has been stuck at a historic low level of 1.9 percent or less.  There are many opinions as to why our economy has been so stagnant, causing American job loss, unemployment, and more reliance on government programs. I want to underscore what the people of Kansas have told me repeatedly as to why, at least in part, this has happened. Small business owners, manufacturers, our community bankers, other lending institutions, individual workers laid off or workers hanging on paycheck to paycheck, and virtually everybody in rural America--farmers, ranchers, and growers--at every townhall meeting have told me that the 1 issue of concern is the crushing weight of Federal regulation.  That was summed up by one Western Kansas rancher who said: ``Pat, I feel ruled, not governed.''  But we are unwinding right now this regulatory overkill. Today we are making government a partner, not a regulatory adversary. How on Earth did we reach this sad state of affairs? Well, there are many factors--administrative policies that seem to mimic or compare to the European Union monetary policy, government agendas, and central control. But with this tax bill that can change, and it will change if only we recognize and take this important opportunity--an opportunity that many Members in this body have never had to truly make a difference. This time we can.  Can America get back to a place to make history and, once again, to experience the power of the American dream?  I am confident that we can. We have before us now a comprehensive plan to address these issues, cleaning up and modernizing the Tax Code to help generate more growth in our economy. The bill before the Senate does exactly that, providing meaningful tax relief for families, small businesses, farmers, ranchers, and growers. I am especially pleased with the rates and bracket structure the legislation would put into place on the individual side.  We have done a good job pushing these rate reductions down to lower and middle-income families. This would provide a net tax cut for families in Kansas of about $2,500 and over 10,000 new jobs.  As many have pointed out today, we accomplish this by reducing individual tax rates, raising the standard deduction, and increasing the child credits in the Tax  Let's be clear, these are consensus, bipartisan ideas and proposals that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have, in the past, at least--now not now, because of the legislative standoff we have been going through--regularly proposed and supported.  Let me also comment on concerns raised by some of my colleagues that we simply cannot afford this bill and that it will worsen the country's financial condition.  In putting this bill together, we have used very modest economic growth estimates, below the historic post-World War II norm of 3 percent. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office is currently projecting 1.9 percent growth over the next 10 years, and we learned today that the Joint Committee on Taxation says the Senate bill will create only modest economic growth.  Now, notwithstanding the fact that I have never seen a CBO or Joint Taxation Committee projection that has been really accurate, I think these estimates are far too low. It is hard to believe. It is simply unacceptable.  I refuse to accept that we cannot return to a more robust economic growth. I think we will achieve better growth rates, and observe that we are well on our way. Recent economic activity bears this out.  The economy is now growing at a solid pace with low unemployment and low inflation. Real GDP growth during the first two quarters of the year averaged 2.1 percent at an annual rate, and since January, the unemployment rate fell 0.6 percentage points to 4.2 percent in That is the lowest rate in about 16 years. Overall growth is poised to average about 3 percent over the second half of this year--3 percent in the second half of this year.  While these are positive trends, my colleagues, we can do more. We need even stronger growth. Stronger growth leads to higher living standards, less dependence on governmental support, and a lower need for spending on entitlement and other programs.  How do we get there? We have a tax bill--a tax bill to maximize growth, to create jobs, and to increase wages. This is not what we have just heard from many on the other side--trickle-down economics or any other name that they want to call this. This is commonsense economics, which I have yet to see be refuted by any mainstream economist.  Increase the supply of capital in the economy, and you expand the productivity of the economy. This result is more business investment, leading to worker productivity gains--workers who can then earn more, increase their after-tax income, and, in the end, raise their living standards.  I want to turn to an essential sector of our national economy--agriculture, those who are responsible for feeding America in a troubled and hungry world. I am very pleased that the bill reflects the importance of production agriculture to our economy. It is important to keep in mind that few other sectors of the economy face the multiple uncertainties of production agriculture. We are talking about weather, storms, fires, volatility in our global commodity prices, trade disputes, and transportation issues, and the list goes on.  When we pass this bill, the agriculture industry will have a number of provisions in the Tax Code that recognize the uncertainty and the volatile nature of the income and expense associated with agriculture operations.  These provisions--and we are talking about 34, 35 of them at last count--include accounting rules that allow farmers to manage their income and expenses.  For example, in the year when our commodity prices are low--and, yes, this year they are low--they can account for costs in a way that keeps them in operation.  There are also specific inventory rules to help manage costs associated with the livestock and dairy operations and to handle items needed for other basic operations, such as fertilizer and also crop treatments. There are unique rules for timber operations.  Now, if you want to get down into specifics and just how far we drill down to be of help to agriculture, even baby chickens have their own inventory rule--which, by the way, differs from the rules for ostriches and emus. I would imagine nobody would even think of drilling down to that extend.  There are rules set for how to handle damaged stocks and livestock disasters. They are certainly important as of today. I can tell you that these disaster rules provided a critical boost to ranchers in my State, enabling them to begin to recover from the devastating prairie fires in Western Kansas earlier this year.  Turning to the new provisions in the bill, we have developed it with agriculture in mind. I would be remiss here not to mention the strong input and advice I have received on these matters from Senator Grassley, Senator Thune, Senator Scott, and my other colleagues who also share a strong interest in the agriculture economy.  The bill, for example, liberalizes the depreciation rules for agriculture operations, giving farmers and ranchers 5-[[Page S7525]]year property depreciation, and permitting full expensing of plant and equipment purchases.  The bill would greatly improve the ability of the agricultural community to use the cash method of accounting, which provides complexity in managing cash flow, which is essential to providing certainty in operations.  There are significant provisions in the legislation that establish a new income tax rate for passthrough organizations. This is a very important issue for the agricultural community. The majority of farms and ranchers are set up as passthroughs, and most of the income earned by farmers flow through these structures.  The bill also includes new rules for farmer cooperatives, which are a very important part of production agriculture. We work very hard to ensure that the benefits of cooperative farming are held whole in this tax reform plan.  The bill also doubles the exemptions for the estate and gift taxes up to $22 million per couple. I know this sounds like a lot to some of my colleagues, but for landowning, cash-constrained farmers, they can hit this exemption amount quickly, especially in my State of Even when they do not, many farmers and ranchers spend thousands of dollars a year on lawyers and accountants' fees to plan for the best way to pass their life's work on to their children--something very special in rural and smalltown  While I will continue to press for a permanent repeal of the death tax, for now, let's modify it so we reduce its damaging reach.  Finally, and above all, the legislation will provide farmers and ranchers with certainty during a very difficult time that we are going through, certainty that they will be not taxed out of business on a down year, certainty that they will have cash available to fund their own operations, certainty that their hard-earned income, farm, or ranch will not have to be sold off just because someone has died, certainty that the Federal Government recognizes their irreplaceable role in meeting the challenges of a very fractured and hungry world.  I am very pleased, to say the least, that the Senate bill keeps the ag tax provisions but will also help our farmers by creating a much more pro-growth tax system, lowering their tax burden and simplifying the tax provisions relating to the ag sector.  We have an opportunity to experience a renaissance in our American economy. It seems to me that for too long we have had a sort of copycat kind of economic policy based on the European We are talking about a lot of government control. We are talking about more taxes. We are talking about a lot of things that simply have enabled us to tread water.  I know we are in a difficult time in the Senate with regard to partisan differences. It reminds me a little bit of a country western song that obviously my staff would hope that I would not mention, but it was: ``The bridge washed out, I can't swim, and my baby's on the other side.''  Well, the bridge is not washed out, and the tax bill is on the other side, along with an American renaissance that will make America enjoy even more economic growth and get us back to that historic 3-percent growth rate and even more. That bridge is open.  I urge my colleagues to consider it as we go forward in this debate. Hopefully, we have the votes. Then, if we have the votes--and I think we do--hopefully, some of my colleagues across the aisle will join us.  I yield the floor.

859,topic-id,466,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, and I compliment both our chairman and our ranking member for how they have ensured that our committee remains a bulwark of support for human rights throughout the world.  It has been 16 years since 3,000 Americans were slaughtered before our eyes by a global terrorist movement, using Islam as an excuse for the cowardly murder of innocent people, people of every faith who were butchered in order to terrorize the rest of us in the world into submission to their fanaticism.  Crucial to our ability to defeat this evil force has been our commitment to[[Page H9645]]ensure that the battle did not evolve into a war between Islam itself and the rest of us, which would then, of course, pit Muslims against all Christians as well as people of other faiths.  George Bush, President of the United States, reached out at that moment after 9/11 to ensure that the plot by these radical terrorists did not succeed in polarizing the world as such. Our greatest success has been preventing that polarization that would have put all the people of the world against Islam and all Muslims against all the rest of the people of the world.  That battle to make sure that does not happen must continue. It is essential to keep open the ties with those people in the Muslim world who are appalled by the terror and brutality of these fanatics who commit such monstrous crimes.  It is vital for our own security that we aggressively condemn terrorism and human rights abuses when it is against Muslim people. The Muslim people are the victims, and they need to know that we are on their side, just as we expect good Muslim people to be on our side when we confront this terrorism in the world. We did that, of course, when the Serbian Christians were killing, ethnically cleansing, Muslim people in  Today we reaffirm to the Muslim people of the world and to ourselves that we loudly proclaim that we are condemning the slaughter of the Rohingya people who reside in the southern states of If these attacks by the Burmese military continue, we must follow this strong condemnation today with sanctions.  In the meantime, not one bullet or weapon should ever be made available to the Burmese military. And, in the meantime, the Burmese military officers and the government officials who are engaged in this particular policy of genocide against the Rohingya people must know they will be held accountable for their crimes against the Rohingyas, because it is not a crime just against Rohingyas, it is a crime against humanity.

824,topic-id,420,"Mr.Speaker, I direct the membership's attention to an argument the ranking member made a couple of minutes ago where he criticized repatriation efforts in the past. He is right; they underperformed.  Why did they underperform?  They were a holiday. It was temporary. So we learned from that. I wasn't around when it happened, but we have learned from that, Mr.Speaker, and we are saying let's not do that again. Let's have a permanent policy that unlocks American dollars that are locked out overseas right now. Most folks think it is between $3 trillion and $4 trillion that can come back home.  Where does that come back home?  It will come to the Sixth Congressional District of It will go to It will go to It will go to all of these places to be reinvested.  Why?  This is a dynamic, vibrant economy that can become better. This is an attractive place. We just need to make it better.  The other argument that he made, essentially, is: Look, is this really going to create growth?  He is right to point out that not all tax cuts are created equal as it relates to growth. The whole purpose, though,[[Page H9605]]is not simply growth. It is also tax relief.  I have got a constituency that got jammed by Democrats in the Illinois General Assembly this year with a massive tax hike on the middle-income folks in They need relief. So part of this is to offer relief.  The way that we have approached this is to say let's create this as it relates to the investment and expensing. If you look at the Tax Foundation and the nonpartisan work that they have done, they will tell you, that investment that we are making--that is, throwing away depreciation schedules and telling small businesses, if you invest, you can write it all off in year one--that creates activity.  So, we ought to shed and shun this motion to instruct and, instead, let's work through the normal conference process.  Mr.Speaker, in closing, let me give you one quick anecdote. A manufacturer in my district told me this. They are planning to invest $30 million in their manufacturing plant. Next year, if we do this bill, they are not going to invest $30 million in that facility; they are going to invest $50 million.  That is one company in one cul-de-sac in one subdivision in suburban If you ripple that throughout the entire economy, great things happen.

When Washington bureaucrats sought to implement Dodd-Frank, they put forward rules that led some manufactured housing retailers and sellers to be considered loan originators. They also expanded the ``high-cost loan'' definition and swept many manufactured housing loans into that category.

299,topic-id,2575,"Mr.President, as most of my colleagues know by now, we have been working for I believe about a year and a half--certainly throughout this tax reform process--to address the issue of the child tax credit in an effort to increase it. I am grateful that in this process, we have been able to increase the child tax credit to $2,000. That will help a lot of people.  I have been asked by some people: Why isn't that enough? Why aren't you happy with that? The answer is that the people we most want to help are not going to be able to fully use it, and here is why. For them, for people who are making $30,000 or $40,000 or $50,000--you are a construction worker; you are a teacher; you are a firefighter; you are a welder; you are a bus driver--the backbone of America's workers--their main tax liability is their payroll tax. Unless you allow the tax credit to apply fully not just to their income tax--many of whom don't have a high income tax liability but a payroll tax--they are not going to enjoy the full benefit. The result is kind of absurd if you do one without the other. The result is, if you make $500,000 a year and you have enough kids, you can use the whole credit, but if you don't make that much money--if you make, say, $25,000 a year--you won't get nearly as much of the credit even though you have paid the taxes. It kind of doesn't make any sense, right?  We are trying to help people with the cost of raising children by allowing them to keep more of their own money. It is the people who make less who need it the most, and when you only do half of it, which is the $2,000 increase, you only get it half right. So it is good, and there are people who are going to be helped by that, but we could have helped so much more.  The bill we have today, which is before us here and will be before us in a few minutes when there is a substitute provided, cuts the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. A reduction in the corporate tax rate is something that I strongly support because I think it makes America more competitive and, in the process, is going to help a lot of these same people whom[[Page S7690]]we are trying to help. I know that sounds countercyclical, but it does because when these corporations are able to save money in taxes, many of them will use some of that money to create new jobs and hire more people. That money--some of it will be reinvested and perhaps even flow toward workers in the form of higher wages over time.  These are positive things, so I am not against a reduction of the corporate tax rate. In fact, I ran for President, for the Senate, and for reelection to the Senate on the promise of reducing the corporate tax rate to 25 percent. So 20 percent goes well beyond that. However, in order to be able to pass something that pays for it, because you have to--and people don't know this back home, so I will just kind of explain it--this bill allows us roughly about $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years of spending over revenue. Now, we think that the growth in the economy is going to more than offset that, but for purposes of the rules of the Senate, it has to be within those parameters.  In order for us to offer an amendment that provides an increase in the child tax credit at a rate that we want to do it--about $86.9 billion--we have to find $86.9 billion somewhere in order to be able to do it. Initially, instead of cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20, we proposed cutting it from 35 to 22. It is still a massive cut. It is still well below the international average of 23. It still puts us in third place among the seven largest economies in the world. But that was met with significant resistance.  We have always said that we would be open to an additional way or a different way of doing it, so today when the substitute amendment is offered, we are going to offer an amendment, Senator Lee and Instead of 22 percent, it is going to propose that we reduce the corporate tax from 35 to 20.94 percent. Basically, instead of a 15-percent reduction, it will be a 14.06-percent reduction, OK? The difference between what is in the bill and what we are proposing is less than 1 percentage point of reduction in the corporate tax rate--0.94 percent. With less than that 1 percent difference, we can make a huge difference in the lives of millions of Americans making between $20,000 and $50,000, as an example. That would generate about $87.4 billion, and we could use $86.9 billion of it to allow working families with children to keep more of their own money to pay for the costs of raising their children. I will remind you of who these people are. These are teachers, firefighters, welders, construction workers, truck drivers--the working class.  We didn't even have to do that, to be frank. From last night to today, the leadership and those working on this--and they have worked very hard--found an additional approximately $260 billion to cut even more taxes for businesses. I have no problem with that. I want America to be super competitive. But somehow, through some political jiujitsu or some sort of magical formula, $260 billion appeared to provide even further cuts, and that is fine. I just wish that some of that jiujitsu and political magic had been employed on behalf of the millions of Americans making between $20,000, $50,000, and $60,000 a year because they need our help.  What has been the opposition to this? Frankly, some of it is untrue. Some of it is offensive. Some of the opposition I have heard is that the people who would benefit from this tax cut don't pay taxes. They don't pay income tax or a lot of income tax, but they pay tax. If at 5 o'clock today you left your job as a construction worker and you received your paycheck, they took money out of your paycheck. When they take $200 out of your paycheck, it doesn't matter if it says FICA or if it says income tax withholding; it is $200. It is the same money, and you have $200 less of it. That is a tax. Anytime the government takes your money, it is a tax.  I have had people tell me, including people in the administration, that they don't pay taxes. I have had people say that they don't generate economic growth, which is, in my mind, 1, not true, and 2, the wrong way to think about it. You see, our economy should be working for our people, not our people for our economy, and when you talk that way, you have it wrong.  I also disagree that they don't generate growth because when you make $50,000, you spend every penny that you make. I know these people. I live in West Miami, FL, and West Miami is a small, little city. It is three-quarters of a square mile. I have lived there since 1985. The average income is $38,000 a year. If you make $38,000 a year, you spend every penny, especially if you are raising children.  I do not care how much people tell you to put some money aside and save it for the future; you cannot because everything costs more and there are unexpected costs. You bought brandnew shoes in September for school, and by November they either have a hole or they no longer fit. You bought them a backpack in August for back-to-school, and by November or December, it has a hole in it or something broken and you have to pay for it. Costs constantly come up that you haven't anticipated.  Where do they spend this money? In our economy. So, yes, maybe they don't generate as much growth as a Fortune 500 company, but they have to spend every penny of it, so they do generate growth.  I have even heard terms used like ``It is a black hole'' and ``It is welfare.'' It is not welfare; it is their money. I heard one newspaper editorial say that it is anti-work. How could a tax credit that you can't get unless you are working be anti-work? I will tell you what is anti-work: a package of benefits from the government that you get--which is worth more than this tax credit--that you are eligible for if you don't work.  I want you to tell the worker at a Head Start facility--think about this. You are a teacher at a Head Start pre-K, and you make too much money for your children to go to Head Start, but you don't make enough to be able to afford child care for your own kids. That is happening all over this country, and somehow there are black holes that we can't even find $86.9 billion to help them just a little bit more.  The second argument we have heard is that we can't cut the corporate tax rate because it is going to hurt growth. You are telling me that if we have a corporate tax rate that goes from 35 percent to 20.94 percent, that is going to hurt growth. Twenty percent is the most phenomenal thing we have ever done for growth, but if you add 0.94 percent to that, it is a catastrophe. We are going to lose thousands of jobs. Come on--especially when you add that to the fact that they are going to be able to immediately expense their investments, when you add that to the fact that they are going to repatriate money abroad to the United States with the lower tax rates. When you add all the things that we have done, argue all you want, but don't please don't tell me that 0.94 percent is going to somehow lead to less economic growth because it is just not true.  We are going to have a vote later today. I don't know how many votes they are going to make us have in order to pass this; there are all kinds of procedural things that happen here. But I can tell you that this is about a lot more than just tax reform. We have a big problem that perhaps this tax reform debate has revealed; that is, the only way forward in this country is one that is pro-worker and pro-growth, and you cannot have one without the other. I can tell you that in this country today, there are millions and millions of people who have been hurt by the new economy. The new economy is great. There is nothing we can do to turn it back. The future is here, and you cannot go back to the past.  We should embrace the new economy. It has created extraordinary wealth for people who are innovators or people who have the right careers or right jobs. I don't begrudge it. I am glad that it is happening. But when you have a new economy, just as when we had the Industrial Revolution, there are some people who are going to be hurt and we have to help them in that transition because if we don't help them, we are going to break the social compact that holds our Nation together. I am not claiming that the child tax credit will solve that problem by itself. I am telling you that if we aren't even willing to do another $86 billion of allowing people to keep their own money--not even willing to do something as small as this--we are not willing to do anything for working people in this country, and that is a big problem. That is[[Page S7691]]an enormous challenge for our These people have felt neglected and disrespected for a long time.  I want to be very careful, but I want to be clear about what I am saying. The political debate in America today is either all about helping the very poor--and I support the safety net. I don't think free enterprise works without a safety net. It should be there to help people who cannot help themselves, to help people stand back up on their feet and try again. The political debate is also all about helping the business community, and I support that because we need vibrant economic growth to create jobs and opportunity.  But what about everyone else? What about the people who make $50,000 a year? They make too much money for CHIP, for pre-K paid for them by the government through Head Start, for ObamaCare subsidies, too much for government benefits, but they don't make nearly enough to afford the cost of living. What about them? What is in it for them?  Yes, there is going to be economic growth and there are going to be wage increases, but not for everyone, not in this new economy in which the haves and have-nots are largely divided between those who have the right skills and right degrees and those who do not, and that has gone unaddressed for a very long time. I am telling you, if we do not address it, we leave our Nation vulnerable to two dangerous political extremes--radical socialism on the left and ethnic nationalism on the right--and neither of them are true to the American principles that created the greatest Nation on  Again, I am not here to tell you that the child tax credit solves that problem. I am here to tell you that if we can't even do that, it is evidence of our unwillingness to do beyond it the tasks that need to be done. We have a major challenge in this All we are asking for and all I implore my colleagues to vote for--I know that for people on the other side of the aisle, this doesn't go far enough. I understand it; I do. I know you want to get to a higher number; I know you want it to apply to more people. I promise you, I did too. I wanted it to be $2,500. I am trying to figure out in this constitutional Republic, which cannot be a zero-sum game, how we can make things better if we do not make them perfect.  And on the other side of the aisle, I implore my colleagues to believe that this is not a black hole, and this is not welfare. These are the teachers, firefighters, neighbors, and friends who are struggling because everything costs so much more. Why can't we just help them keep a little bit more of their own money? Really, is a 20.94 percent corporate tax rate going to hurt growth, especially if it will help us provide a little bit more assistance for the people who, today, desperately need our help?  I hope I can earn the support of as many of my colleagues as possible. It won't make this bill perfect. It doesn't go far enough for some, but it will make it better.  I yield the floor.

1226,topic-id,989,"Mr.President, just for clarification for the Senator from Vermont, I didn't speak to a group of people from Wall I spoke at a POLITICO breakfast--POLITICO magazine, newspaper, whatever it is. I didn't know it had anything to do with Wall  The second point that I would raise on this topic is, this is not a debate on Social Security or Medicaid--which I am happy to have. It is an important program. I think if you are 50 years of age or older and near retirement or in retirement, there are not going to be any changes to that program. I think if you are 46 or 36 or 26, you should be worried that there won't be Social Security or Medicaid if it continues on its current track. That is an important debate, and I hope we will have it.  But I want to talk today about something different, and that is the child tax credit. Yesterday, Senator Lee and I announced a plan that would expand it and make it fully refundable against payroll tax to help working families across this country, and it has been the subject of pretty significant criticism from some, including--the Senator from Vermont would be interested in hearing this--the Wall Street Journal, which editorialized against it today. So I want to address some of those criticisms because I think many of them are just not valid. They are all invalid, but a couple are actually disrespectful to American workers.  Here is the first one that is not valid: We have already expanded the child tax credit to $2,000, and that is enough.  Well, it is not enough, and here is why. Most families who make between $20,000 and $50,000 don't really benefit from that expansion. They don't make a lot of money, so they don't owe a lot in income tax, which is what the additional expansion in the child tax credit applies against. Since most of the $2,000 child credit applies only to income tax and their primary liability is payroll tax, they get nowhere near the $2,000 benefit.  The cost of raising a child is not any cheaper for a family making $40,000 than it is for a family making $200,000, and I would argue the family making $40,000 needs the credit more than the family making $200,000. Yet somehow we have a provision in which the family making more gets more for their children than the family making less. That makes no sense.  The second thing I heard today--and I hadn't heard this one before--is that this is actually a negative tax; that people aren't just getting their taxes phased out, they are actually getting money on top of it. That is false because our plan is limited to your tax liability. You can't get any more credit than what you paid in taxes. If you owe $1,200 in taxes, the most your credit can be is $1,200. It can't be above and beyond your tax liability.  The third one I have heard from a number of people is that this is welfare. This one is false. To call the child tax credit welfare is downright disrespectful to the American worker. Who are the people who would benefit from this? Let me tell you who they are: truckdrivers making $36,000 a year, welders making $39,000 a year, construction workers making $43,000 a year, firefighters making $48,000 a year. These are not freeloaders. This is not welfare. This is their money. These are people who are working and make too much to get welfare from the government, but they aren't paid enough to afford many things in life. This would be, for example, about 8.5 million working families who make between $20,000 and $50,000--if this graph lines up--of an average cut of $800, which is not a lot of money, but it is $800 more than what they have now if we were to expand it in this way.  I alluded to the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal that I generally agree with on most topics. They have never liked this child tax credit debate or idea. They claimed this provision is anti-work. That isn't just false, it is ridiculous. You can't get the child credit[[Page S7544]]if you are not working. You can't apply it against payroll tax unless you have payroll taxes off your paycheck. How can a tax credit that you can only get if you are working be anti-work? That is not just false, it is ridiculous.  The fifth argument is about the corporate rate. Our corporate rate is 35 percent. We proposed to cut it to 22 percent. Somehow, unless it is 20 percent, it is going to be a catastrophe for the American economy. That wasn't the case a few years ago. I campaigned for President and for U.Senate on a 25-percent corporate tax rate, and everybody said that would lead to growth.  In 2014, Americans for Tax Reform, the group led by Grover Norquist, called for a 25-percent rate. It said a corporate income tax rate from 35 to 25 is badly needed. It moves the U.rate closer to the developed nation average, and it would help with growth. The Senate Finance Committee international tax bipartisan working group called for 25 percent. The Heritage Foundation in 2010 called for 25 percent. The National Association of Manufacturers in 2014 called for 25 percent. Speaker Ryan's Path to Prosperity 2013 budget called for 25 percent. The Alliance for Competitive Taxation called for 25 percent. I am saying 22 percent.  By the way, this argument ignores all the other things that are in place--immediate expense, repatriation, all sorts of other things. It is not just the 13-percent tax cut or 15-percent tax cut, it is all the other things that come with it. By the way, if there is a better way to pay for what we are trying to do, we are open to it.

1230,topic-id,911,"That has been the gold standard for a significant period of time. That is what I campaigned on. That is a promise I made, and I want it to be even lower than that, at 22 percent. By the way, if there is a better way to pay for what I am trying to do here, I am open to that.  I want to make two more points of criticism. We already have too many people not paying income tax. This would create even more. In essence, it narrows the base. First of all, to the extent this credit takes people off the tax rolls at all, it isn't forever. It is until their children turn 17.  The second argument--and I actually agree with this--is what we are doing here is going to make us more competitive in the world, and that is going to lead to economic growth. That is not just going to create more jobs, it is going to create pay. We have been told by the White House economists, by the Finance Committee, by multiple different experts that we can expect to see real wage growth, on average, up to $4,000.  If you are going to be raising wages, then you are going to have people graduating to higher tax brackets or into the income tax range. In essence, what the people who make this argument are saying is, for purposes of economic growth and revenue, this is going to be dynamic, and it is going to grow the economy. I agree with that, but for purposes of the child tax credit, a bunch of people are not going to get pay raises. They are going to get stuck where they are today, and they will never pay income tax.  It can't be both. It is either one or the other. I believe it is growth. I believe there are people making $50,000 now that one day may make $55,000 or $60,000 and continue to move up. By the way, once their kids turn 17, the credit goes away.  The last argument, that it is not pro-growth, it is not stimulative. I know economists struggle to quantify it. I believe it is stimulus. Do you know what teaches me that? Not an economist or some book I read, real life teaches me this. Here is why. If you make $50,000 or $40,000 a year, and you get $800 back in your taxes, do you know what you are going do with that money? You are not going to put it under your mattress or in a coffee can and bury it in your backyard. You are going to spend that money. You are going to buy your kids clothes, shoes, and Christmas gifts. You may even be able to spend an extra day on vacation. You are going to spend it at the very businesses and into the very economy we are going to try to grow.  People making $50,000 a year consume almost all of the money they make. They are going to spend it on their children, but they are also going to spend it into the economy. If you believe that leaving more money in the hands of businesses leads to growth--and I do. I also believe that leaving more money in the hands of families leads to economic activity, and that is a positive thing.  The reason I am so passionate about it is--and I will close with this--I think one of the things we have been missing for too long is the working men and women of this country who have been hurt badly by the economic restructuring that we are going through--automation, outsourcing, and all sorts of changes in the American economy.  I think about my parents who worked in the service sector. Thirty years ago, as a waitress, as a bartender, and as a maid, my parents were able to afford to own a home. You know for a fact that at least in Miami, FL, today, a bartender and a maid will struggle to own a home, not to mention afford the things that people need to afford living there.  We need to do something to help people because they are being left behind. This new economy is great for a lot of people with the right degrees and the right industry, with the right skills. We are leaving millions of people stuck, and no one fights for them because they don't have a lobbyist, they don't have a trade association, and they don't have a newspaper that editorializes for them. We need to fight for them too. Leaving them a little bit more of their money that they earned by working is not too much to ask. We need a pro-growth and a pro-worker tax reform, and that is what we endeavor to do.  I hope I can get, when the time comes to offer that amendment, the support of as many of you as possible. This will not make life perfect, but for hard-working families, firefighters, and construction workers, whatever little more we can let them keep is more than what they have now, and it is going to make their lives and their children's lives better than it is today. Ultimately, isn't that what we are here to do?  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING Who yields time?  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.

There are a lot of good things in this tax bill, but we need to make it better. We can make it more pro-growth and more pro-worker. Senator Lee from Utah and I have a plan that helps us move in that direction. I will describe it briefly, and I want him to have the opportunity to weigh in on this as well.[[Page S7388]]  On the pro-growth side, it is about becoming more globally competitive, and we do so by lowering the current corporate tax rate. The current corporate tax rate in the United States is 35 percent; we would reduce that to 22 percent. Now, the current bill has it at 20, but 22 percent is just as competitive as 20. Here is why. Just like the current bill, it would be lower than the global average rate of 23 percent. Just like the current bill, it would move us from last place to third place among the G7 countries. So it is just as pro-growth. It makes us just as competitive, but it allows us to do the pro-worker reform that we desperately need.  Here is what it allows us to do. It allows us to change the child tax credit in the current bill to help working families even more. 1, it would make it fully refundable up to the amount you pay in payroll tax. 2, it would eliminate the marriage penalty, meaning you pay more in taxes if you are a married couple than you do if you are an individual. 3, it would index the tax credit to chained CPI, which basically means that as inflation grows and the cost of living goes up, the credit doesn't lose its value because it doesn't go up.  The one thing I want to emphasize is, Who does this help? I have had some people in the past and even today ask: Why are you doing this? This is like welfare.  I find that offensive. I find it offensive not because I am offended by people who need the help and are in the safety net program because they have come upon difficult times but because the people we are trying to help are not on government assistance. They are workers. You have to work to get this credit. In essence, the credit applies against their tax liability, be it payroll tax or income tax. A lot of people who are working don't make enough money to be paying a lot of income tax, but they pay up to 15.3 percent of what they make in payroll tax. It is their primary tax liability, and if you don't allow the credit to apply toward that, you are not helping them.  Who are they? Who are the kinds of people we are talking about? In essence, who are these workers? Well, this chart tells you who they are. They are the waitresses making about $20,000 a year. They are not fully benefiting from this credit right now. If we do it the way Senator Lee and I are talking about doing it, they would. They are the home health aides. They are the office clerks. They are the welders making $35,000 a year. They are the truckdrivers. They are the nurses. They are the firefighters making $48,000 a year. These are working people, the backbone of our country, the ones who have been left behind for over three decades because no one fights for them. They have been ignored and disrespected in our public policy, and they are not accounted for in this bill. They are raising families, our future taxpayers. It costs money to raise a family. The more children you have, the more expensive it is. Our Tax Code should recognize that, and we make a reasonable proposal in that regard.  Now I would like to turn to Senator Lee and ask him to expound on the importance of this for America's workers and why, if we are truly going to have a pro-worker reform, the expansion of the child tax credit and applying it toward the payroll tax the way we have described is essential.

1817,topic-id,1996,"Mr.President, I know we are scheduled for a vote in a few minutes. We will have plenty of time to talk about this in the days to come.  I think one of the core things that I hope tax reform will be about is empowering the American worker. By ``the American worker,'' I mean the people whom they don't make Netflix series about and we don't see movies about too often anymore. There was a time when the American worker was a hero in our country. People looked up to the American worker and idealized them. Today, obviously, entertainment focuses on other professions. There is nothing wrong with that, but we have forgotten about their hard work and the millions and millions of Americans across this country who truly remain the backbone of our economy and our  There are hard-working men and women who are struggling to get by, not because they are not working hard but because everything costs more--something you quickly find out as your family begins to grow. That is why I have spent so much time talking about the child tax credit. A lot of people confuse that with the childcare credit, which is important as well.  The child tax credit takes into account the reality that raising children is an expense. It is a blessing, but it costs money. At the end of the day, it doesn't always matter only how much you make; it also matters how much you spend. And when you are raising children and raising a family, the costs are often out of your control, and they increase substantially every single year. So perhaps the best way to illustrate to my colleagues the impact that tax reform has on working families is to talk about real people and their real lives--how much money they make and what tax reform would mean for them.  I want to start with a real family, a particular family my staff has been communicating with; that is, the Starling family, Richard and Emily, a very young family from Jacksonville, They have a 2-year-old daughter, and they are expecting their second child in Richard is a pastor, and he works part time at He makes about $25,000 a year. His wife Emily stays home and cares for their daughter while he is at work.  Because of their income, the Senate tax bill's nonrefundable child tax credit increase would actually be worth very little to them. A lot of people have said to me: Well, we have increased it to $2,000. Isn't that great? It is. But what it means that people don't understand is, if the majority--if all the taxes you pay are payroll taxes, it doesn't help a lot.  I, frankly, get offended when I hear people say: These are Americans who don't pay taxes. They do pay taxes--not income tax, but they pay payroll taxes. They take it out of your check every month. Trust me, it is a tax. It is less money than what was supposed to be there after the tax.  So the tax credit, while we increased it to $2,000--and that is great for a lot of people--it does nothing for them. The total effect is only about $115 for the family. That is how much they will be saving in their taxes from the current year--$115.  But here is where it gets worse. The Senate bill--which I am largely supportive of, but I just want to tell my colleagues what the numbers are so we can see where the changes need to be--the Senate bill would actually increase taxes in March when they have a child. You say: How can that be? Well, for some families in their income range, the nonrefundable increase for the child tax credit is less valuable than the current lost personal exemption. So we take away the personal exemption and we put in this additional child tax credit, but it is nonrefundable. They can't get to that tax credit because they are not paying income taxes, and the result is that if they make $26,000 instead of $25,000, the Senate bill would actually take away $15 from their per-child tax cut.  So these families work hard and pay their taxes, they raise children, they are contributing an extraordinary amount to our country, and they need our help more than ever before.  There are a couple other examples, and I will go to the first chart. Let's take for example a tire changer and a preschool teacher with two children in Gainesville, FL--the home of the university in Florida, the finest learning institution in the Southeast--an editorial thing, but it is a matter of fact. But I digress. Let me get back to chart 1 and talk about this family.  The husband, as I said, works at a local auto shop as a tire changer. His wife is a preschool teacher. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with these two jobs, their combined income would be $28,300. Because the increase to the child tax credit is nonrefundable--the extra money we put in--this family wouldn't nearly have enough income tax liability to take advantage of the full credit. So the bill as it is currently written gives them a tax cut of $200--about $50 per person.  But what if we did what Senator Lee and I are proposing, which is to make the child tax credit fully refundable, even against payroll tax. Well, then their tax cut would not be $200, it would be $1,570. Trust me when I tell you that for a family making $28,000 a year, a $1,500 pay increase in real cash matters. It matters. It doesn't solve all of their problems, but it helps.  Here is another one. Take this example. The husband is a private in the Army National Guard, and his wife is a waitress at a local restaurant. They have three children. He is on Active Duty at Camp Blanding in Starke, She works full time. They have a combined income of $33,832, according to the National Guard base pay.  Because the increase, again, is nonrefundable in the child tax credit, they don't have enough income to take full advantage of the tax credit. The bill as currently written cuts their taxes by $388. The proposal that Senator Lee and I have outlined would cut their taxes by $2,100. So a $2,100 pay increase for this working family in cash will matter. It will matter. It doesn't solve all of their problems but, trust me, $2,100 for this family, more than what they have today, will help them a lot, and it rewards the work they are doing.  What about a single mother. Let's say she is a childcare worker. She has one child and is living in Miami, FL, where I live. She works full time. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median wage for that job is $14,800 a year. She gets a tax cut under the current bill of about $100. If we do what Senator Lee and I are talking about doing, she will get a $1,000 tax cut. I am not telling you that $1,000 solves all of her problems, but a $1,000 pay increase for a single mother making $14,800 a year will matter.  How about a loading dock worker and a cashier in Northwest Florida after having two kids. Here is what we point to: a glaring blind spot in the way this is structured. Again, for many working families, because the child tax credit is nonrefundable, it will actually be less valuable to parents than the dependent exemption and the existing child credits are under current law today. I think[[Page S7351]]this is the opposite of pro-family policy.  Let's look at this example. He works as a freight mover at a lumber warehouse, and she works as a cashier. They both work and live full time in Live Oak, Their average combined income is about $28,650. Under the current Tax Code, the way the law is today, if they have two kids, their tax cut would be $2,776. That is what they would save. Under the current bill, their tax cut would be $2,656. So, in essence, under the way the bill is structured now, they would be getting $120 less--or keeping $120 less--than what they would under the law today, for a family making $28,000 a year.  We can fix it, because under the proposal Senator Lee and I will have, they are going to see a tax cut of $4,000 for having that additional child. That is $1,200 greater than the current law. That is a raise of $1,300 more than would happen under the bill as it is currently structured.  I don't think this is an intended consequence. But this is a working family. They work. They pay payroll tax. They make $28,000, $29,000 a year. Trust me when I tell you this money will matter. It won't solve all of their problems, but it will help. It is a pay raise.  Last but not least, I live in West Miami, I have lived there since 1985. It is a working-class neighborhood. According to the census, the average family income in West Miami, where I live, is $38,000--let's say $39,000. That doesn't mean that West Miami is poor. I know the people there. They work hard. They pay their taxes. They raise their children well. They go to work 5 days a week for 8 or 9 hours a day, sometimes on the weekends. But because it is a working-class town, the nonrefundable increase we put in for the child tax credit doesn't do much.  As an example, based on the census data for West Miami, for that ZIP Code that I live in, more than 2,500 children in this ZIP Code--meaning more than half of the total number of children living in that area--would be receiving less than the full credit than they would otherwise be eligible for. Why? Because for their parents, their primary tax liability is the payroll tax. And you cannot help working families with a tax cut if you do not allow the cut to apply to the payroll tax. It is as simple as that.  We have to do that. If we want to help people in this country, if we really want to help them have a little bit more in their pocket, then let's implement the proposal that Senator Lee and I have put forward.  By the way, I hear these economists and other people say: Well, it won't do anything for growth.  You really don't understand how working Americans live. Someone who makes $38,000 a year or $35,000 a year basically spends every penny they make. They have to. If you make $38,000 a year, with two kids, you are spending every penny you make and then probably having to put the extra on your credit card, unfortunately. This proposal will drive consumer spending. It will allow them to pay for some things they can't buy now. These kids outgrow their shoes so fast. The bookbags don't make it through a year. There are so many things we could be helping families with, and our tax reforms should do that.  Everybody in this town has a trade association, has a lobbyist, has newspapers that write about them. Who writes about them? Who writes about these working Americans--working Americans, not people asking for anything from the government. They go to work. They work hard. They work every day. Who fights for them? Who talks about them? Who represents them? That is supposed to be us.  If we are serious about representing them, then let's prove it. Let's amend this bill and change it so we can give working Americans the raise they deserve, and that they need, to strengthen our country and strengthen our families.  I yield the floor.

Mr.Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.3317, the Stopping Abusive Female Exploitation Act, or the SAFE  This legislation increases the criminal penalty for female genitalia mutilation of a minor from a maximum of 5 years to a maximum of 15 years. It also encourages States to adopt laws to require certain professionals who work with children to report suspected mutilation cases.  Female genitalia mutilation, or FGM, is internationally recognized as a human rights violation for girls and women. It is an extreme form of abuse against women and girls, often causing serious and permanent health complications, including shock and death.  Across at least 30 countries, more than 200 million girls and women alive today have been subjected to FGM and more than 3 million girls are estimated to be at risk every year of being subjected to this procedure even though it is outlawed in 42 countries.  Congress first passed legislation making this horrific practice illegal in 1996. The Federal Prohibition of Female Genitalia Mutilation Act made it illegal to perform FGM on girls younger than 18 years of age in the United  In 2013, Congress passed another law, the Transport for Female Genital Mutilation Act, which amended the 1996 legislation and made it a crime to knowingly transport a girl out of the United States for the purpose of FGM, yet the practice still continues. According to some estimates, the number of girls who have undergone FGM has tripled over the past 2 decades.  In 2017, after 20 years on the books, the first charges were filed under the FGM statute against a doctor in Michigan who performed this disfiguring assault on two 7-year-olds.  By increasing the criminal exposure for this crime, we send a message that our country will not tolerate the mutilation of our young girls and women and we will do what we can to prevent that.

1502,topic-id,1544,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.1, or better known as the GOP tax scam.  This bill provides tax cuts for corporations and multimillionaires at the expense of hardworking middle class families. Massive corporate tax cuts do not guarantee job growth or higher wages. The only thing guaranteed is the $2.3 trillion that this scam adds to the deficit.  Democrats are serious about passing comprehensive tax reform that is fair and that puts a little more money in the pockets of working This fiasco of a bill is not fair.  Corporations get a massive 15 percent tax cut, but what do working families get? They get nickeled and dimed.  Despite student loan debts surpassing $1 trillion, this bill eliminates the student loan interest deduction, which only allows those earning $80,000 or less to claim it in the first place, squarely hurting middle class Americans who are trying to pay off debt, save for a home, or buy a new car.  Teachers will no longer be able to deduct expenses for school supplies that they purchase with their own money for their classrooms, yet corporations are able to deduct the cost of those same supplies that they purchase.  Seniors and people with chronic illnesses would no longer be able to deduct some of the cost of their treatment. At a time when many families are feeling the pressures of affording care for their children and their aging parents, this bill takes money right out of their pockets.  Under this bill, 29 million households would lose their property tax deduction. Eighty percent of middle class homeowners would lose, compared with just 13 percent of high-income earners. Does that sound fair?  Finally, the elimination of the State and local income tax deduction disproportionately impacts middle-income families, especially those in California, whose residents would see an overall net tax increase of $12.1 billion.  The Tax Code is a reflection of our values. The Republicans have clearly chosen who they serve--the wealthy and corporations--but I am concerned about the 36 million Americans who will see a tax increase, teachers and their students, and people with preexisting conditions.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this disaster of a bill.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record two letters in opposition to this bill, one from SEIU and one from the AFL-                                                        SEIU,                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 2017.     Kevin Brady,     Chairman, House Committee on Ways & Means,     Washington,     Richard Neal,     Ranking Member, House Committee on Ways & Means, Washington,                Dear Chairman Brady, Ranking Member Neal, and Members of      the House Committee on Ways & Means: On behalf of the two      million members of the Service Employees International Union      (``SEIU''), I write to strongly oppose H.1, the      misleadingly named ``Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.'' H.1 would      double down on the same failed trickle down policies that      have hurt working families for decades. Once again, major      legislation is being drafted behind closed doors, out of the      view of the American people and without any input from      Democratic members of       It is unconscionable that elected representatives would      mark-up and jam through a bill that significantly affects the      financial security of their constituents without appropriate      time for non-partisan analysis and for all Americans to      properly understand the real impacts on their everyday lives.      There is no need to rush legislation of this magnitude      through Congress due to artificial political timelines.      Instead, there should be an open process by which all      stakeholders including working people and not just corporate      lobbyists are able to provide input.       Although this bill pretends to benefit the middle class,      the tax cuts proposed under this bill would go overwhelmingly      to high-income households and large corporations. And this      bill would actually raise taxes for some low- and moderate-     income households, while making it harder for states to fund      healthcare, education, infrastructure and other investments.      History has shown us that these types of tax breaks never      `trickle down' to working people and will result in cuts to      healthcare, education and other programs our communities      depend on. If passed, this legislation would give      millionaires and corporations a reason to celebrate but would      hurt working Americans who are trying put food on the table,      start their first businesses, send their children to college,      or save for their retirement and buy homes.       For these reasons, SEIU urges you to oppose H.1 and      instead, work in a bi-partisan[[Page H9401]]     and transparent manner on policies that will improve the      lives of working families. If you have any questions, please      contact John           Sincerely,                                                        John Gray,     Legislative                                  ____                                                      AFL-CIO,                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I urge you      to oppose the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.1). H.1 is not a      ``jobs bill,'' it is a job killer that gives huge tax breaks      to companies that outsource jobs. It is also the poster child      for the failed ``trickle-down'' economic theory that has      never worked and has repeatedly stuck working people with the      tab for tax giveaways for millionaires, big corporations, and      Wall       The Republican leadership wants to pay for these giveaways      with drastic cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, education, and other      programs that working people depend on. The price tag of H.     1 is $1.5 trillion over 10 years, while the budget resolution      includes $5 trillion in budget cuts, including $1.5 trillion      from Medicaid and       H.R 1 would waste trillions of dollars on tax breaks for      people who do not need them. According to the Joint Committee      on Taxation (JCT), 45% of the tax benefits would ultimately      go to households making over $500,000 per year; 38% of the      tax benefits would go to households making over $1 million;      and the top 1% one percent would get an average annual tax      cut of $64,720. By contrast, households making between      $20,000 and $40,000 would actually pay more in taxes.       H.1 would hurt working people in many ways. It would      eliminate the deduction for state and local income and sales      taxes, punishing states that make the kind of investments      that create good jobs and starving communities of the funding      they need for education, infrastructure, and other essential      public services. H.1 would repeal deductions for student      loan interest, tuition expenses, and tuition assistance and      end tax credits for students to cover college expenses,      making it harder for students and their families to afford      higher education at a time when tuition prices are at an all-     time high. Under this bill, corporations could still deduct      their payments to lawyers to fight unions, but union members      could no longer deduct union dues and educators could no      longer deduct their out-of-pocket expenses.       On the corporate side, H.1 would give a giant tax cut to      big corporations that outsource jobs. Under this bill, a      business that creates jobs on Main Street USA would pay U.     taxes on its profits at a rate of 20%, while a big      corporation that outsources those same jobs to Ireland or      Switzerland would pay no U.taxes on the profits it earns      from outsourcing. Currently, the United States taxes all      profits of U.corporations, whether earned in the United      States or in a foreign country, at the same rate of 35%      (though a corporation that earns profits in a foreign country      does not have to pay U.taxes on those earnings until it      repatriates them to the United States). H.1 changes this      system so a U.corporation never pays any U.income taxes      on the profits it earns from active operations in a foreign      country (as opposed to domestic profits that the company      disguises as foreign profits through the use of accounting      gimmicks). Reducing the U.tax rate on offshore profits      from 35% to 0%--basically a subsidy to companies that      outsource jobs--would cost $208 billion over 10 years. Even      worse, the bill would encourage foreign countries that want      to attract offshore investment to lower their corporate tax      rate. The more foreign countries lower their corporate tax      rates to attract offshore investment, the bigger the tax      subsidy for offshoring this bill will provide. The GOP tax      bill creates a powerful incentive for big companies to      outsource jobs, and it is an incentive that will grow over      time.       With regard to past profits, the Institute on Taxation and      Economic Policy (ITEP) estimates that H.1 would give      multinational corporations a tax windfall of $529 billion,      allowing them to get away with paying just $223 billion of      the $752 billion they owe on accumulated offshore earnings.      There is no economic case for discounted tax rates on profits      already earned. The last time we gave companies a break on      the profits they booked offshore, they used that money for      executive bonuses and dividends. They did not use the money      for creating new jobs, raises for workers, or investments in      new factories or equipment. The top 15 companies to take      advantage of the so-called ``tax holiday'' in 2004 laid off      20,000 workers in the subsequent two years. There is no      reason to believe this time will be different. JPMorgan says,      ``We expect little economic effect from firms repatriating      funds to the U.S.''       The AFL-CIO urges you to oppose the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act      (H.1), which gives huge tax breaks to companies that      outsource jobs and makes working people pay the price for tax      giveaways to millionaires, big corporations, and Wall           Sincerely,                                                   William Samuel,                          Director, Government Affairs  ",CREC-2017-11-16-pt1-PgH9381-2.txt,1757,PRESERVING ACCESS TO MANUFACTURED HOUSING ACT OF 2017,2017,16,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
149,topic-id,611,"Mr.President, it is no secret that I am strongly opposed to this disastrous, unfair, and destructive piece of legislation that we are debating today that will give massive tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our country, to the most profitable corporations, and to billionaire campaign contributors.  What really concerns me is that we are debating, as everybody acknowledges, a very complicated and confusing piece of legislation that is over 500 pages long. Here we are a few hours before we are going to be voting on this legislation, and nobody has seen it. Nobody even knows what is in this legislation. It is probably being written as we speak right now. That is not a very effective or intelligent way to deal with legislation that impacts every American and trillions of dollars.  One of the concerns I have as we look at this bill is that there are provisions in it that nobody really understands in terms of whom it impacts and whom it benefits. As one example, buried in this legislation, on page 503, section 14504, is a paragraph entitled ``Modification to Source Rules Involving Possessions.'' That is the title of that section. What does that mean? As best we can understand, it means that if you are a hedge fund manager who is a resident[[Page S7659]]of the Virgin Islands, you will be able to get a major tax break on capital gains and a 90-percent reduction in tax liability on your income.  It has been estimated that corporations and the wealthy are avoiding over $100 billion each and every year by stashing their cash in the Caribbean and other offshore tax havens. It appears that this provision will make a bad situation even worse. In adding insult to injury, it appears that this provision may help only a handful of wealthy hedge fund managers who have claimed residency in the Virgin It has been estimated that this provision alone--one provision in a 500-plus page bill--will cost over $600 million in lost revenue in the next decade--$600 million in lost revenue when we have a $20 trillion debt and 40 million people who are living in poverty.  Now, I see no Republican Senators on the floor, but I am sure that staff is watching this discussion. I have a question that I would like to discuss with Senator Wyden but, more importantly, with some of our Republican colleagues.  What I would like to ask my Republican colleagues is whether there has been a hearing on the need to provide tax breaks to wealthy hedge fund managers who have established residency in the  I would say to my friend from Oregon that there are a lot of problems facing our country--a declining middle class, 40 million people living in poverty, 28 million people having no health insurance. I am not aware that one of the great crises facing this country is the need to provide tax breaks to wealthy hedge fund managers who have established residency in the It may be one of those great national crises that I have missed, but I don't quite perceive it as being an issue that the American people seem to be deeply concerned about.  I hope that my Republican colleagues--maybe Senator Hatch or others--will come to the floor and tell us who this provision benefits. Are we talking about one hedge fund manager? Are we talking about two? Are we talking about three hedge fund managers who are going to divvy up some $600 million in tax breaks over the next decade?  I ask my colleague from Oregon, who is the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, his thoughts on the issue.

The top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, and 62 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent. The Republicans' solution is to make this grotesque inequality even worse by giving 62 percent of the tax benefits to the top 1 percent.  I want to get back to this one point. I suspect that when you rush a bill of this magnitude through the U.Senate when there have been virtually no hearings, no experts, no real ability to have significant debate and discussion at the committee level, what you are going to find the day after this bill is passed are absolutely outrageous provisions.  I suspect--I don't know, and I would like my Republican colleagues to help us here; I cannot verify because we don't have the information--that on page 503, section 14504, there is a provision that will provide $600 million in tax breaks over a 10-year period that will end up in the pockets of a handful of Wall Street hedge fund managers.

The Federal Treasury is being looted tonight. As we speak, there are lobbyists all over Capitol Hill, writing down in handwriting, amendments to this bill to give hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in tax breaks to large corporations. As we speak, they are probably still writing those amendments.  Meanwhile, this Senate, this Republican-led Senate has been unable to reauthorize the CHIP program, the health insurance program for low-income children. They didn't have enough time to do that. We have been unable to reauthorize the Community Health Center Program, providing 27 million people with health insurance. We don't have the time to do that. But tonight we are presumably going to pass legislation when, at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, 62 percent of the tax benefits go to the top 1 percent, and 10 years from now, millions and millions of middle-class Americans will be paying more in taxes.  I have not the slightest doubt, as I have said before, that after the Republicans pass this huge tax giveaway to the wealthy and large corporations, they will be back on the floor of the Senate, and when they come back, they will say: Oh, my goodness, the deficit is too high. We have to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education, and nutritional programs. In other words, in order to give tax breaks to billionaires and to launch profitable corporations, they are going to cut programs for the elderly, the children, the working families of this country, and the poor. This legislation will go down in history as one of the worst, most unfair pieces of legislation ever passed.  I say to my Republican colleagues, as you saw on November 7, the American people are catching on. They are demanding a government that does not simply work for corporate lobbyists but works for the middle class. They are demanding a tax system that says to the wealthy and large corporations: You are going to start paying your fair share of taxes, and, no, we are not going to cut Social Security; we are going to expand Social We are not going to cut Medicare; we are going to move to a ``Medicare for all'' healthcare system. The American people are catching on.  While Republicans may get away with this act of looting tonight, history is not on their side.

356,topic-id,132,"Thank you.  Madam President, tonight is chapter 1 of the Republican Party Koch brothers plan.  Tonight, the Republicans provide $1 trillion in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country and to the largest corporations, while raising the deficit by over $1.4 trillion.  Part 2 of their plan--probably coming in a few months--will be to call for massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid in order to pay for their tax breaks to the rich. For those of us who don't want to cut these vitally important programs that the American people have paid for, this amendment establishes a 67-vote threshold to make those cuts.  If you don't want to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to give tax breaks to millionaires, support this amendment.

Based on      information provided by the Department of the Interior (DOI),      the Energy Information Administration (EIA), and individuals      working in the oil and gas industry, CBO estimates that      implementing the legislation would increase net offsetting      receipts, which are treated as reductions in direct spending,      by about $1.1 billion over the 2018-2027 period.       Because enacting the legislation would affect direct      spending pay-as-you-go procedures apply. Enacting the      legislation would not affect revenues.       CBO estimates that enacting legislation would not increase      net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four      consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028.       The legislation contains no intergovernmental or private-     sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform      Act (UMRA).                ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT       The estimated budgetary impact of the legislation is shown      in the following table. The costs of this legislation fall      within budget functions 300 (natural resources and      environment) and 800 (general government).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                            By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--                                       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                         2018    2019    2020    2021     2022      2023      2024      2025      2026      2027    2018-2022  2018-2027--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             DECREASES IN DIRECT SPENDING aEstimated Budget Authority............       0       0       0       0      -725         *         *      -366        -1        -1       -725     -1,092Estimated Outlays.....................       0       0       0       0      -725         *         *      -366        -1        -1       -725     -1,092--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Components may not sum to totals because of rounding; * = between -$500,000 and zero.a CBO estimates that implementing the legislation also would cost about $10 million over the 2018-2022 period, assuming the availability of appropriated  funds, for environmental reviews and the administrative costs of conducting the lease sales.                           BASIS OF ESTIMATE       For this estimate, CBO assumes that the legislation will be      enacted near the end of 2017 and that the funds necessary to      implement the legislation would be available.     Description of the Legislation       The legislation would direct the Secretary of the Interior      to implement an oil and gas leasing program for lands located      within the coastal plain of ANWR, which includes about 1.5      million acres of federal land on the northeast coast of      Under current law, activities related to oil and gas      leasing in ANWR are prohibited.       The legislation would require the Secretary to hold two      lease sales over a seven-year period following enactment and      to offer at least 400,000 acres of land in ANWR for lease at      each sale. Any lease sales in ANWR would be carried out in      accordance with procedures used to conduct oil and gas      leasing within the National Petroleum Reserve in For      each lease awarded, lessees would pay the federal government      bonus bids to acquire the leases, annual rent to retain the      leases, and royalties based on the value of any oil or gas      production from the leases. The legislation would establish a      16.67 percent royalty on oil and gas produced in (Under      current law, the federal government charges royalties of 12.5      percent for oil and gas produced onshore and 18.75 percent      for oil and gas produced in the Outer Continental Shelf.)      Finally, under the legislation, Alaska would receive one-half      of the gross proceeds generated from the leasing program.     Spending Subject to Appropriation       CBO estimates that implementing the legislation would cost      $10 million over the 2018.2022 period for environmental      reviews and administrative costs associated with the leasing      program subject to the availability of appropriated funds.      Based on information provided by the Government      Accountability Office, we estimate that completing the      environmental reviews required under the National      Environmental Policy Act would cost $2 million. In addition,      CBO estimates that other implementation costs would total      between $1 million and $2 million per year over that period.     Direct Spending       CBO estimates that implementing the legislation would      increase net offsetting receipts by about $1.1 billion over      the 2018-2027 period.       Bonus CBO estimates that gross proceeds from bonus      bids paid for the right to develop leases in ANWR would total      $2.2 billion over the 2018-2027 period. That estimate is      based on historical information about oil and gas leasing in      the United States and on information from DOI, EIA, and      individuals working in the oil and gas industry about factors      that affect the amounts that companies are willing to pay to      acquire oil and gas leases. In addition, CBO relied on      estimates prepared by the United States Geological Survey of      the amount of oil that might be produced from the coastal      plain of As specified in the legislation, one-half of      all receipts from leases in ANWR would be paid to Alaska,      leaving net federal receipts totaling $1.1 billion over the      2018-2027 period.       Estimates of bonus bids for leases in ANWR are uncertain.      Potential bidders might make assumptions that are different      from CBO's, including assumptions about long-term oil prices,      production costs, the amount of oil and gas resources in      ANWR, and alternative investment opportunities. In      particular, oil companies have other domestic and overseas      investment options that they would evaluate and compare with      potential investments in The potential profitability      for a wide range of such global investment options would      probably be a significant factor in prospective bidders'      ultimate choices of how much to bid for ANWR leases. The      number of factors that affect companies' investment decisions      result in a wide range of estimates for bonus bids. CBO's      estimate reflects our best estimate of the midpoint of that      range.       Other In addition to receipts from bonus bids,      CBO estimates that the federal government would collect net      receipts from rental payments totaling about $2 million over      the 2022-2027 period. (Lease holders make an annual rental      payment until production begins.) CBO also estimates that the      federal government would receive royalty payments on oil      produced from ANWR leases; however, based on information from      EIA regarding the typical amount of time necessary to drill      exploratory wells, complete production plans, and build the      necessary infrastructure to produce and transport any oil      produced in ANWR, CBO expects that no significant royalty      payments would be made until after 2027.                      PAY-AS-YOU-GO CONSIDERATIONS       The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-     reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation      affecting direct spending or revenues. The net changes in      outlays that are subject to those pay-as-you-go procedures      are shown in the following table.

Over the 2018-2027 period, CBO estimates that      Alaska would receive a total of about $1.1 billion in      royalties.           INCREASE IN LONG-TERM DIRECT SPENDING AND DEFICITS       CBO estimates that enacting the legislation would not      increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of      the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028.

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Perdue). The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-12-01-pt1-PgS7655-2.txt,1010,TAX REFORM,2017,1,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
924,topic-id,1870,"Mr.President, President Trump and the Republican leadership, as we just heard, are talking every day on television, at news conferences, telling the American people how this tax bill that was passed here at 2 o'clock in the morning on Saturday--without any hearings, with no serious debate--how this tax bill is designed to help the middle class and how it was written for the middle class.  Unfortunately, I suspect that I will not shock too many Americans by suggesting that what President Trump has been saying is not truthful. This legislation, according to numerous independent studies, will provide 62 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent--62 percent of the benefits will go to the top 1 percent--while increasing taxes on 83 million middle-class households by the end of the decade. Why? The reason is that the tax cuts for middle-class families expire by the end of 2025, while the tax breaks for large corporations are made permanent.  We are living in a moment in American history where we have an unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality, where the top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, where the top 1 percent owns almost twice as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, and, if you can believe it, where three of the wealthiest people in this country--Mr.Gates, Mr.Bezos, and Mr.Buffett--three people own more wealth than the bottom half of the American population. That is where we are right now.  Yet, in the midst of this incredible level of income and wealth inequality, my Republican colleagues believe that this is a moment when 62 percent of the benefits of so-called tax reform should go to the top 1 percent and 42 percent of the benefits should go to the top one-tenth of 1 percent, while at the same time tens of millions of middle-class families will end up paying more in taxes. How crazy is that? So we have a situation in which the wealthy, who need tax breaks the least, will benefit the most, and the working class and middle class of this country, who need the most help, will benefit the least.  The President of the United States and my Republican colleagues tell the American people that trickle-down economics--giving huge tax breaks to the wealthy and large corporations--will expand the economy. We just heard Senator Thune talking about that. They will create new jobs and will bring in so much revenue that it will pay for the deficit it creates.  Every independent expert who has taken a look at this tax bill has said it will substantially increase the deficit, even after accounting for the possibility of increased economic growth. The Joint Committee on Taxation has told us that this bill will increase the deficit by $1.4 trillion over the next decade. Why is that important?  First of all, it shows, if I may say, the hypocrisy of my Republican colleagues who, year after year after year on this floor, lectured us about the dangers of a $20 trillion national debt and growing deficits. We heard this time and time again. But somehow, when it comes to the need to provide tax breaks to billionaires, that concern about the deficit seems to have disappeared.  Secondly and more immediately, there is no doubt in my mind that if the Republicans are able to pass this bill, which will soon go to a conference committee--this bill that gives huge tax breaks to the top 1 percent and raises the deficit by $1.4 trillion--there is no doubt in my mind that they will suddenly rediscover their great concern about deficits and the debt and move directly within the next few months to begin the process of cutting programs desperately needed by the working families of this country--the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor.  This is not just Bernie Sanders speculating. This is what the New York Times said in a front-page article a few days ago:       As the tax cut legislation passed by the Senate early      Saturday hurtles toward final approval, Republicans are      preparing to use the swelling deficits made worse by the      package as a rationale to pursue their long-held vision:      undoing the entitlements of the New Deal and Great Society,      leaving government leaner and the safety net skimpier for      millions of       Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans are beginning to      express their big dreams publicly, vowing that next year they      will move on to changes in Medicare and Social      President Trump told a Missouri rally last week, `We're going      to go into welfare reform.'  Let me take this opportunity to translate into English what phrases like ``entitlement reform'' or ``welfare reform'' really mean. What they mean in reality are massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education, nutrition programs, affordable housing, and other programs desperately needed by a declining middle class. It means that after they pass this so-called tax reform bill, which would provide a $200,000 tax break to CEOs who make over $16 million a year, they will come back to the floor of the Senate and fight for cuts to Social Security for senior citizens trying to survive on $12,000 or $13,000 a year. So there are massive cuts for millionaires and billionaires in their taxes at the same time as they want to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for struggling seniors.  ``Entitlement reform'' means that at a time when millions of seniors are splitting their pills in half because they cannot afford the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs, Republicans want massive cuts to It means that when two out of every three nursing home residents in this country rely on Medicaid to pay for their long-term care, the Republicans want to make massive cuts to  We do not know exactly what form these cuts will take. I think that is not yet clear. There has been discussion among Republicans about raising the retirement age for Social Security to 70 years of age, forcing older workers to work years more before they can get their earned retirement benefits.  Maybe they will cut back on cost-of-living increases through a so-called Chained CPI--a new formulation that means lower benefits not only for seniors but for millions of disabled veterans. They apparently believe, for those of you on Social Security now, that the COLAs you have been getting in recent years are just too high. That zero percent increase you got a couple years ago? It is much too high; we have[[Page S7834]]to change the formula and lower benefit increases.  Maybe they will go back to their long-term dream of privatizing Medicare and converting it into a voucher program, which will say to the elderly in this country: Here is a check for $8,000. You go out and find private insurance on your own. I would say good luck to any elderly person in this country who is struggling with heart disease or cancer. You see what kind of insurance program you are going to get with a check for $8,000.  I would remind my colleagues that many of these proposals were included in the budget resolution the Republicans voted for right here on the floor of the This is not speculation; these are issues and items that Republicans already voted for. They already voted for a $1 trillion cut to Medicaid, which would throw some 15 million Americans off of health insurance. They have already voted in the budget to cut Medicare by $473 billion. In my view, the last thing we should be doing is giving tax breaks to billionaires while cutting programs for the most vulnerable people in our country.  During the campaign, Donald Trump, as a candidate, promised he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, and He made that promise over and over again. I have some charts. Let me quote some of the tweets and some of the things Donald Trump said on the campaign trail.  This is what he said: ``I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid.''  On another occasion, he said:       I'm not a cutter. I'll probably be the only Republican that      doesn't want to cut Social  That was January 24, 2015.       It's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way      it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is.  That was Donald Trump on March 10, 2016.  Here is another quote:       You know, Paul [Ryan] wants to knock out Social Security,      knock it down, way down. He wants to knock Medicare way down.      And, frankly--well, two things. Number one, you're going to      lose the election if you're going to do that. . . . Now, I      want to get rid of waste, fraud, and abuse. I want to do a      lot of things to it that are going to make it much better,      actually. But I'm not going to cut it, and I'm not going to      raise ages, and I'm not going to do all of the things that      they want to do. But they want to really cut it, and they      want to cut it very substantially, the Republicans, and I'm      not going to do that.  Before I go on to the next quote, I want to tell Donald Trump that, as a candidate, man, he was exactly right. This is what he said on March 29, 2016. He said that the Republicans wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare and  Well, Candidate Trump, you were exactly right, because that is now what we will see in a few weeks or a few months.  Another quote from Donald Trump as a candidate:       Social Security faces a problem: 77 million baby boomers      set to retire. Now, I know there are some Republicans who      would be just fine with allowing these programs to wither and      die on the vine. The way they see it, Social Security and      Medicare are wasteful `entitlement programs.' But people who      think this way need to rethink their position. It's not      unreasonable for people who paid into a system for decades to      expect to get their money's worth--that's not an      `entitlement,' that's honoring a deal.  Well, there it is. Candidate Donald Trump said over and over again that he would not cut Social Security, that he would not cut Medicare, that he would not cut In fact, quite correctly, he predicted that the Republicans would try to do exactly that.  Now I would like to talk directly, if I might, to the President of the United  Mr.President, on the campaign trail, over and over again, you said that you would not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Today, I am asking you nothing more than to keep your word.

1171,topic-id,761,"Mr.President, I do not ask for the unanimous consent, but I would like to speak on an amendment that I will be offering later.  Mr.President, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the Republican leadership are busy every day telling the American people how this piece of tax legislation is going to help the middle class and how it was written for the middle class.  We see President Trump going to Missouri and saying: This bill is not going to help me, who is a billionaire; it is really designed for the middle class. I trust that I will not shock too many people when I suggest that what President Trump is saying is not accurate, is not truthful.  This legislation, according to numerous independent studies, will provide 62 percent of the tax benefits to the top 1 percent. So 62 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent, while it increases taxes on 87 million middle-class households by the end of the decade.  Here we are, as every American knows, living at a time of massive income and wealth inequality. The middle class is shrinking, millions of people are working longer hours for lower wages, and 40 million people are living in poverty. But over the last 40 years, the people on the top have been doing phenomenally well, and today we have more income and wealth inequality than at any time since the late 1920s.  Given that reality, who in their right mind believes that it makes sense to give huge tax breaks for the people on top, while raising taxes for the middle class? Do you know what? My Republican colleagues here may think that makes sense. That is not what the American people believe. Poll after poll after poll suggests--as it did with their disastrous healthcare legislation--that the American people do not want this legislation.  If you can believe it, the Joint Committee on Taxation told us just last night that by the year 2027, 150 million households in America making $200,000 a year or less will see their taxes go up, not down, under this disastrous bill. Why? Because the tax cuts for middle-class families expire by the end of 2025, while--surprise of all surprises--the tax breaks for large corporations are made permanent.  The benefits for the middle class expire. They are temporary. The benefits for the corporate world are permanent. The leadership of the Republican Party is telling the American people that trickle-down economics--giving huge tax breaks to the wealthy and large corporations--will expand the economy, will create new jobs, and will bring in so much revenue that, magically, it will pay for itself. Just give tax breaks for billionaires and large corporations, and those tax breaks will pay for themselves.  But here is the reality. The reality is that trickle-down economics is a fraudulent theory. When Ronald Reagan slashed taxes for the rich in 1981, economic growth went down by 1.9 percent the following year, and the unemployment rate increased from 7.5 percent to 10.8 percent. The 1981 tax cut was so successful that Reagan had to increase taxes eleven times after that.  After President George Bush cut taxes for the wealthy and large corporations, we lost nearly 500,000 private sector jobs, the national debt almost doubled, poverty increased, and median income went down.  After the rightwing Republican leadership in Kansas--the last example of the theory of trickle-down economics--cut taxes for the wealthy, revenue declined so much that they had to make savage cuts in education, healthcare, transportation, and infrastructure.  Trickle-down economics did not work under Reagan, did not work under George Bush, and did not work in the State of It is a fraudulent theory cooked up by think tanks funded by billionaires and the wealthy.  Every independent expert who has taken a look at this tax bill has said that it will substantially increase the deficit even after accounting for economic growth.  The Joint Committee on Taxation has told us that this bill will increase the deficit by $1.4 trillion over the next decade.  I want to make this point because it has not been made enough. Mark my words. If this legislation is passed, if the deficit goes up by $1.4 trillion, I believe without any doubt, that the Republican Party will come down here to the Senate and go to the House and say: My goodness, we have raised the deficit, and in order to deal with that, we have to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, nutrition, education, affordable housing, and every program that is important.

These numbers were put right into the budget passed by the Senate, which called for a trillion-dollar cut in Medicaid, then a $470 billion cut in Medicare, and massive cuts to other programs.  Let's not even talk about the budget of several months ago. Let's just talk about what our colleague Senator Marco Rubio yesterday--yesterday--told a group of Wall Street lobbyists.

Well, we have not heard any Senators come down to the floor to tell us they will not cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs.

We are living in a moment in American history where we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, where the top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, where three people--three of the wealthiest people in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of the American population.

Will you attempt to end Medicare as we know it by      giving seniors vouchers to purchase private health insurance,      something long supported by Speaker Ryan?       How much will you cut Social Security? Will you try to      increase the retirement age[[Page S7374]]     to 70, cut cost-of-living adjustments for senior citizens and      disabled veterans, and/or privatize Social Security?       Will you support legislation to cut Medicaid by $1 trillion      over the next decade, kicking 15 million Americans off of      health insurance? As you know, this was a provision included      in the Republican Budget Resolution that was passed earlier      this year.

1967,topic-id,523,"Mr.President, this is what I asked:       I am very concerned that if you succeed in passing tax      legislation that significantly adds to our national debt, you      will then move aggressively to balance the budget on the      backs of working families, the elderly, the children, the      sick, and the poor. In other words, in order to pay for tax      breaks for the rich and large corporations, you will make      massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,      nutrition, environmental protection, and every other program      designed to protect the needs of the middle class and working      families of our country.       Before the Senate votes on tax legislation that adds over      $1.4 trillion to the deficit, you owe the American people a      specific and detailed explanation as to how the Republican      Congress will achieve its commitment of balancing the budget      over the next decade.       Will you schedule a vote to raise the eligibility age of      Medicare from 65 to 67 as called for in the House Budget      Resolution? Will you attempt to end Medicare as we know it by      giving seniors vouchers to purchase private health insurance,      something long supported by Speaker Ryan?       How much will you cut Social Security? Will you try to      increase the retirement age to 70, cut cost-of-living      adjustments for senior citizens and disabled veterans, and/or      privatize Social Security?       Will you support legislation to cut Medicaid by $1 trillion      over the next decade, kicking 15 million Americans off of      health insurance? As you know, this was a provision included      in the Republican Budget Resolution that was passed earlier      this year.       How much do you plan on cutting affordable housing, Pell      Grants, WIC, and Head Start to pay for a permanent tax break      for profitable corporations?  That is what I wrote to the majority leader.  My challenge right now to my Republican colleagues is--and I ask you--to come down to the floor of the Senate and tell me I am wrong. Come down here and tell the American people, if this legislation--this disastrous tax bill--passes, that you will not be coming back to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, nutrition, education, and other programs. Maybe I am wrong. If Republicans come down here and say: Bernie, you are wrong. We have no intention of cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, I will come here, and I will apologize.  So here is my challenge right now to my Republican colleagues: Come down here. Tell me and tell the American people I am wrong. Tell us all that you are not going to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and education in order to deal with the $1.4 trillion deficit you will bring about in this disastrous tax bill. Tell the American people you are not going to cut programs that the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor desperately need in order to give huge tax breaks to the wealthy and large corporations.  That is my challenge, and I will be listening eagerly to see if there are any Republicans who are going to come down and tell me what I am suggesting is wrong.  I yield the floor.

This tax bill has seen no hearings, no expert testimony, and absolutely no honest efforts to build bipartisan support. This is a terrible shame and the result is a terrible sham.  Who are the ones calling the shots on this tax bill?  The corporate lobbyists and the big money donors who will make out like bandits.

A good tax plan would be seeking to invest in our people and our infrastructure. It would seek to help working families and build up the middle class. But this plan does the opposite.

1408,topic-id,770,"Mr.President, the consideration of Federal judges with lifetime appointments is perhaps the most important and long-lasting work this body will do between now and the end of the year.  Every Senator--Republican and Democrat--took an oath to perform this duty. Nobody took an oath to outsource this duty to any outside organization. Unfortunately, some of my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee are apparently willing to hand over their voting cards to the American Bar Association, based on the claim that the ABA is an unbiased, indifferent umpire that just calls balls and strikes.  The American Bar Association is not neutral. The ABA is a liberal organization that has publicly and consistently advocated for left-of-center positions for more than two decades now. The ABA has no right to special treatment by Members of this body.  It is pretty simple. If you are playing in the game, you don't get to cherry-pick who the referees are.  Take, for just a moment, a look at the amicus briefs they have filed in recent years.  In the District of Columbia v. Heller, the ABA supported denying an individual their constitutional right to keep and bear arms.  In Christian Legal Society v. Martinez, the ABA supported forcing Christian organizations on campuses to accept members that reject their faith.  In Medellin v. Texas, the ABA supported forcing States to recognize the judgments of the world court in order to stop the execution of a gruesome murderer.  In United States v. Windsor, the ABA supported the recognition of same-sex marriage through judicial fiat rather than through legislative debate.  In Arizona v. United States, the ABA supported a constitutional ban on State and local law enforcement assisting in enforcing Federal immigration laws.  The list goes on. In each of these cases, the ABA decided to weigh into divisive and contentious issues. This is their right, indeed, but it is definitely not neutral. In each of these cases, and many more, the ABA took what can only be described as a left-of-center position. In each of these cases, the ABA was picking a side.  Again--to be clear--they are absolutely allowed to do this. It is what makes this country great. But it is laughably naive to suggest that they are an objective and neutral organization. They are not.  The ABA cannot make liberal arguments to the nine members of the Supreme Court, and then walk across the street and seriously expect that the 100 Members of this body in the Senate will be treating them like unbiased appraisers. That is essentially what Attorney General Bill Barr said in 1992 when the ABA first began to openly take pro-abortion positions--which, by the way, led to thousands of members quitting in protest because those members knew that the ABA claims to neutrality about political issues were no longer even possibly defensible.  Then-U.Attorney General Bill Barr commented on the ABA's pro-abortion advocacy at the time by saying: ``By adopting the resolution and thereby endorsing one side of this debate, the ABA will endanger the perception that it is an impartial and objective association.''  Twenty-five years later, Barr's words were right. His words ring true.  Again, I want to be perfectly clear. The ABA is allowed to have any view that its members want to have, and they are allowed to advocate and to protest on behalf of those views and on behalf of their members. This is America, and that is exactly what the First Amendment is about. That is fine. But what is not fine is that the ABA, which is a liberal advocacy organization, would masquerade as a neutral and objective evaluator of judicial candidates.  The ABA cannot take blatantly liberal positions on the one hand, and then masquerade as a neutral party on the other, and then demand a special seat at the table in the Senate Judiciary Committee and in the Senate--in this body--to try to tell us who is and isn't supposedly qualified to be a judge.  Just as the ABA has every right to advance its liberal policy positions, every Senator has the right--and indeed, the duty--to give our advice and consent on judicial nominees. If Senators decide that they like and value the ABA's policy positions and they like and value the ABA's rating, they are free to give them due deference and consideration, but don't hide behind it.  Don't pretend that the ABA is something that it is not. Do not ignore the facts of what the ABA has become. The American people deserve honesty, not thinly veiled partisanship.  Thank you.

We simplify the  Let's go through those things.  We lower tax rates. Everybody is going to see lower tax rates at every income level.

Hillsdale College is supported by the DeVos family, one of the largest contributors to the Republican A specific provision, just like an earmark, was slipped into the bill, added by a Senator who fought to remove earmarks from Congress several years ago. A single wealthy college--the pet project of a billionaire campaign contributor to the Republican Party--was exempted from a tax by a Senator who fought to get rid of earmarks.

In my long career in politics, I have not seen a more regressive piece of legislation so devoid of rationale, so ill-suited for the conditions of the country, so removed from the reality of what the American people need.

With respect to the process, the bill my Republican friends hope to pass so soon was received by Members of this body only a few hours ago. Not a single Member of this Chamber has read the bill. It would be impossible. Some of the pages were completely crossed off, and text had been replaced by handwritten notes. When we got the bill, this is what it looked like. This is what it looked like.  When asked before by Senator Durbin, the Senate clerk said she couldn't even read it, and this section is one of the most complicated sections of the bill, dealing with passthroughs. Lawyers are paid thousands of dollars an hour to find ways for their wealthy patrons to avoid sections just like this, and my Republican friends don't have the decency, the honor to let us debate it.  Senator McCaskill was the first to discover that a list of proposed amendments was circulating among lobbyists. My Republican friends allowed lobbyists to see amendments, and likely the text of this bill, before their fellow U. There is no score of this bill by the Joint Committee on There will be no analysis of how American businesses and taxpayers fare under this bill, how high taxes go up or go down, whether the economy grows or shrinks, whether it creates jobs or loses them.

With this stunning deception, with this reckless ramrodding of a bill, Republicans are reaching heretofore unreached heights of hypocrisy,[[Page S7700]]and the Senate is descending to a new low of chicanery.  Read the bill? They are still writing it by hand, mere hours before voting on it. Is this really how Republicans are going to rewrite the Tax Code, scrawled like something on the back of a napkin behind closed doors with the help of K Street lobbyists? If that is not a recipe for swindling the middle class and loosening loopholes for the wealthy, I don't know what is. I don't know if it is possible for a Senate majority leader to depart further from responsible legislating than the process we witnessed with this tax bill.  Tonight, Mr.President, I feel mostly regret at what could have been. What a grave shame it is that we weren't able to work together on this bill. Tax reform is an issue that is ripe for bipartisan compromise. Democrats have spent many long hours with our Republican colleagues talking about our tax reform ideas. There is a sincere desire on this side of the aisle to work with our colleagues, particularly on tax reform, but we have been rebuffed time and time again. Even under these difficult circumstances, Senators Coons, Warner, Bennet, Manchin, Heitkamp, Donnelly, and McCaskill have tried in good faith to convince our Republican colleagues to sit down and talk to us. We have tried to convince you all that we want to join you in tax reform, to have a real debate befitting this august body.  It is an expression of the brokenness of our politics that the influence of moneyed interests and the political right was so great that it overcame even the best of intentions of my Republican colleagues, so many of whom I admire, so many of whom I know, because they have said it to me, lament the steady erosion of bipartisanship in the one institution in our government designed by nature to foster it.  I salute my friend the Senator from Tennessee for standing fast by his principles and having the courage of his convictions. I only regret that there were not more who followed his admirable example.  After a divisive and draining battle over the future of healthcare, we could have moved the Senate back toward sanity, bipartisanship, compromise. We could have accomplished something great for the country and for this body at the same time.  Although time is running short, there is still time, and I will make one final plea. Because this bill is so slanted toward the wealthy and powerful and rains tax increases upon millions of middle-class citizens; because the bill is laden with special interest provisions, some recently found and many not yet seen; because the bill was given to lobbyists to read and change before Senators saw it; and because the bill was given to us on few hours' notice and has not been read fully or considered fully by a single Senator, I move that we adjourn until Monday so we can first read and then clean up this awful piece of legislation.                           Motion to Adjourn  Mr.President, I move that the Senate adjourn until Monday, December 4, 2017, at 12 noon, and I ask for the yeas and nays.  The PRESIDING Is there a sufficient second?

423,topic-id,1744,"Madam President, before I address the issue of taxes, let me address the matter of the government funding bill.  We are now only a week away from a government shutdown, which, to remind my colleagues, could cost our economy thousands of jobs and billions of dollars, as it did in 2013. I think a government shutdown is something we all desperately want to avoid, Democrats and Republicans--I talked to some of my colleagues this morning--with the exception, it seems, of the  This morning's Washington Post reports that President Trump has told his confidantes that a government shutdown could be good for him politically and that he has asked friends about how a shutdown would affect him politically. It is disappointing but maybe not surprising that President Trump appears to be putting politics before the well-being of the American people. As President, the welfare of the American people should always come first--always.  We have a lot of things to accomplish by the end of the year, and a government spending deal is particularly important for our men and women in uniform, as well as a host of programs that create jobs and boost the economy.  The President talks about defending the troops and then threatens a shutdown. It is a contradiction--a contradiction--and I am sure our generals would tell him that even playing around with the possibility of sequester and shutting down the government is no good for our armed services, as well as for the rest of the country.  We should all be focused on avoiding a government shutdown. Certainly Democrats will be working with our Republican colleagues in Congress to that end. I think our Republican colleagues agree. I hope they won't succumb to President Trump's whim based on a political decision and not on what is good for President Trump must change his tune--and soon--if he wants to be a constructive partner in those discussions rather than the focal point of blame.  Madam President, on taxes, my Republican friends have stretched into day 2 of their debate on the bill, which still lacks resolution on some critical issues.  After promising over the past few months that their tax bill would pay for itself through economic growth, the Joint Committee on Taxation came out with a report yesterday that showed that these promises were unfounded, way off the mark. Even considering economic growth, the Republican tax bill will add roughly $1 trillion to the deficit. And many economists have said[[Page S7654]]that this dynamic scoring doesn't work at all. Here, the JCT gave credence to the theory of dynamic scoring but then came out with a number that was not the kind of wild exaggerations we are hearing from the Secretary of the Treasury, from the President, and from some of our Republican colleagues, particularly those of the Club for Growth bent.  Earlier in this debate, Republicans claimed that this would be a tax cut for everybody and that nobody in the middle class is going to get a tax increase. Independent analyses show that these claims were not valid, and to their credit, some Republicans corrected the record.  Now Republicans have gotten the ``dynamic scoring'' they have demanded for years. They are in charge. They put dynamic scoring in place. It is still not good enough. As recently as this week, the Republican leader and others claimed that this bill would not add to the deficit. We know now that even under the dynamic scoring method the Republican Party asked for and received, this bill would add $1 trillion to the deficit. All of the claims that tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations will pay for themselves were not correct. It is time for my Republican friends to admit the error and come clean with the American people.  The fact that we received the dynamic score only a day before a final vote on the bill shows just how foolhardy it is to rush a bill like this through.  From press reports, we know that the Republicans are making the passthrough provisions more generous, widening what was already a gargantuan tax loophole for wealthy business owners. Why should wealthy business owners pay a significantly lower rate on their personal income, because they are paying no corporate tax if they use the passthrough, than the average American? That is what this bill does. Hedge funds, big fancy law firms, and lobbyist firms would all get a lower rate than the average American because of the passthrough. The average American who makes $100,000, $200,000 is already paying in the 30-percent range.  From press reports--you would think that maybe Republicans would be concerned by the many reports that their bill increases taxes on 60 percent of middle-class families by the end of the day. Instead, the holdout Republicans are concerned that this bill isn't generous enough to corporations and wealthy business owners. So now the Republican leadership is working to fix that. In the waning hours, this bill is tilting even further toward business, even further away from families. Every time the choice is between big corporations and families, the Republicans choose the big corporations.  And still no one knows what the final bill will look like. Why on Earth wouldn't you want to spend more than a few hours looking at a bill of this magnitude? What might have been snuck in? What might have been changed by mistake--an innocent mistake? There are so many reasons to not rush this bill through, but we know why it is being done. We know why Republican Members will only have a few hours at most to read the draft legislation before voting on it.  Notching a political win, I would say to my colleagues, isn't a good enough reason to throw common sense and legislative responsibility out the window. Notching a political win isn't a good enough reason to raise taxes and premiums on millions of middle-classes families when there is a much better bill to be had by working in a bipartisan way, Democrats and Republicans, across the aisle, together. My Republican friends must know that ``we needed to notch a political win'' isn't a good enough excuse for a constituent who asks why you voted to raise their taxes but slash them for big corporations.  Today may be the first day of the new Republican Party--one that raises taxes on the middle class. The one thing Republicans always promised the middle class is, we are not going to raise your taxes. A good number of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle--the junior Senator from Texas--I heard him talk about it--said he doesn't want to raise taxes on any middle-class person, but this bill does it.  The Republican Party is abandoning its long-held principles to please its political pay masters. It is a bad move for the Republicans, as well as a bad move for  Again, ``we needed to notch a political win'' is going to be no excuse when your constituents complain that they are getting the short end of the stick in this tax bill and wealthy corporations, the richest people, are not.  Democrats remain united against any middle-class tax increase, and we will fight to reverse that. The stakes are too high. Our economy is already stacked against working men and women. Corporate profits and stocks have reached alltime highs. The top 1 percent capture 20 percent of the national income--higher than at any time in our history since the roaring twenties.  Meanwhile, for too many Americans, the American dream is slipping away. Hard-working Americans who get up every morning worried about paying the bills, making the mortgage payment, the tuition payment, the healthcare bill, are not getting the help they need in this bill. Instead, it is going to the wealthiest, biggest corporations on a theory of trickle-down, which almost everyone accepts and rightwing economists agree has never made sense.  Any moral tax bill would focus on giving a leg up to middle-class Americans, to working class Instead, this bill directs the lion's share of its benefits to those at the very top--the already wealthy, the already powerful. It makes healthcare less affordable and less accessible. It will deprive the government of the resources needed to support the military, scientific research, education, and infrastructure.  The hole it blows in the deficit will--make no mistake--endanger Social Security, Medicare, and Republicans, including President Trump, have openly admitted that they will seek changes in this program after the tax bill. Senator Sanders has outlined eloquently how dangerous this bill is to the future of Social Security and I know our Republican colleagues who came down to argue against him were all on the defensive.  All the things our President and Republicans say they wanted to do are not happening. And this bill moves in the opposite direction--not only on helping the wealthy and not helping the middle class in the way it needs to but also in endangering Social Security and Most insidious of all, the bill hides a ticking time bomb of middle-class tax hikes at the center of our Tax Who would want to vote for that?  Many of my Republican friends feel that the hard right--big, wealthy corporate interests--will put these ads on TV saying that this bill helps the middle class. It is not going to work. When the middle class gets a tax increase, they are going to know why, and they are going to know whom to blame, and these ads will have faded into the air.  Today, my Republican friends can choose to cement their party as the party that raises taxes on the middle class. It will be a dramatic turning point in a downward spiral for the Republicans and something they have never believed in before. But Republicans have an alternative. They can step back from the brink and work with Democrats on a bipartisan tax reform bill to deliver across-the-board tax relief to the middle class, a bill that makes our businesses more competitive while closing egregious corporate loopholes and that grows our economy without adding a penny to the deficit.  Bipartisan tax reform--not this cynical bill, not this partisan exercise, not this bill that seems to please the 1 percent but not the rest of America--is possible but only if my friends and colleagues will abandon this bill and reach out for a better kind of politics.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

493,topic-id,569,"Mr.President, instead of rushing a bad tax bill through the conference, the Senate should focus on the bevy of year-end issues confronting us. First and foremost, we must reach a spending bill that would have us meet our commitments to support the military and also urgent priorities here at home, such as combating the opioid crisis, shoring up pension plans, supporting veterans' healthcare, relieving student loan debt, and building rural infrastructure.  In previous budget agreements, Democrats have always strived to achieve parity between our investments in defense and jobs and economic development here at home. It has continually been a sticking point with Republicans as we go through these negotiations. They want to increase the spending for defense, the military, but shortchange important domestic programs such as infrastructure, education, scientific research--measures that create jobs and help the middle class. We Democrats support an increase for our military, but we want to make sure other crucial programs don't get left behind. So we will fight just as hard in this budget agreement to ensure that for each dollar we add for defense, a dollar is added for domestic economic development, 50-50.  We care about our soldiers. They are the greatest. They are risking their lives for us, but we also care about a pensioner who spent his whole life working in the steel mills, working driving a truck, working building buildings. They religiously put money away every month so they would have something when they retire, and if it is not there--they are important too.  General Mattis came to see me and told me how badly our Defense Department needs help. I agree, but I told him to go back to the White House and tell the White House the domestic side of the ledger needs help as well. Spending on the domestic side of the ledger is lower than it was in 2010, despite increased costs.  We also need to provide funding for Community Health Centers, the Children's Health Insurance Program, relief for millions of Americans still recovering from national disasters, and we must come together on a bipartisan bill to support the Dream Act along with tougher border security measures. So it is a lengthy to-do list. It will require hard work, steady cooperation, and compromise on both sides.  Last night, however, there was a concerning spectacle on the House floor. The freedom caucus held up an unrelated vote on the tax bill--who could figure--because they were unsatisfied with the Republican leadership's plan to keep the government open. If we are going to solve all the problems that confront us before the end of the year, House leaders cannot let the Freedom Caucus--a small band of hard-right reactionary conservatives--run the show. If they cooperate with Democrats, they can accomplish something. To just let the Freedom Caucus dictate is a recipe for chaos.  Once again, negotiations broke off because we were at an impasse on the 50-50 parity for defense and nondefense. That has been very important to Democrats for years. We have settled our budget agreements, our spending policy, omnibus agreements always with 50-50, and we believe it is still important today--parity, parity, parity.  As we continue to negotiate with our Republican counterparts, we hope the Republican leadership can avert more of this unnecessary hostage-taking like we saw on the House floor last night that can only impede a serious, ongoing bipartisan negotiation.

759,topic-id,924,"Madam President, in the early hours of Saturday morning, under the cover of darkness, the Republican majority rushed through one of the worst, most hastily considered pieces of major legislation I have seen in my time in the  The bill will cause one of the greatest transfers of wealth to corporate America and the already wealthy, while working America picks up the tab. Millions of middle-class families will pay higher taxes under the Republican plan in only a few short years. Because the bill is unpaid for, the deficit will skyrocket, cannibalizing resources for education, scientific research, infrastructure, and our military, endangering Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.[[Page S7811]]As I said last week, I have not seen a more regressive piece of legislation so devoid of a rationale, so ill suited for the condition of the country, so removed from the reality of what the American people need.  The text of the bill itself was released in the early evening, only several hours before a final vote took place. Lobbyists had a chance to read and change the bill before Members of the U.When we received the bill, there were sections of text handwritten in the margins concerning some of the most complex tax provisions. The Joint Committee on Taxation was not even able to produce an analysis of the bill until after the final vote took place at around 2 or 3 in the morning.  Amid such haste, the Republican majority likely made drafting errors and inclusions that will have unintended consequences, even severe ones. Amid such secrecy, such cloak-and-dagger legislating, the majority slipped in several additional goodies for big corporations and the very wealthy that are already being uncovered. I am sure even more will come to light in the coming days.  The appalling process we all witnessed led Bloomberg News--a middle-of-the-road, business-oriented publication--to write the following in an editorial today:       In their rush to pass something, anything, that they can      call ``tax reform,'' congressional Republicans have achieved      the impossible: They have made an awful plan even worse. The      end result is sheer absurdity: a reform that actually      complicates the tax code further, and that must contradict      itself and partially self-destruct to attain some semblance      of the fiscal discipline Republicans claim to value. It's      hard to imagine a more egregious waste of time and energy, or      a worse outcome for taxpayers and the broader economy.  That is Bloomberg News, not some leftwing publication. It is a business publication. If they can say that, imagine what average Americans are saying. What a condemnation from a publication that would be inclined to favor tax reform. In short, my Republican friends ought to be ashamed of the process and the product that emerged from the Senate last week.  As the two Houses of Congress prepare to go to conference, I suggest that my Republican colleagues reconsider their efforts and think again on how much better of a product we could produce through a bipartisan, open, and transparent process. Regardless, with so much left to do before the end of the year, the Republicans should not be devoting their energies toward the conference on tax reform because this bill, in both the House and Senate, needs dramatic repair.                        Government Funding Bill  Madam President, on the year-end matter, the most pressing matter before the Senate this week is not tax reform. That has no immediate deadline. Rather, it is to make sure that we keep the government up and running on Nobody should want to see a government shutdown. We should all be working to avoid one. I must say that I don't believe my Republican friends, Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan, want a government shutdown. The only one at the moment who has flirted with a shutdown is President Trump, who tweeted earlier this year that we could use a ``good `shutdown' . . . to fix [the] mess'' and was quoted in last week's Washington Post suggesting to associates that a shutdown could help him politically.  While congressional negotiators have continued the hard work of hashing out a deal, the President's unproductive behavior has been the only monkey wrench in the process. It is difficult to find a consensus when one of the parties at the table tweets that he ``doesn't see a deal.''  In a very positive development, however, the White House has reached out and asked for a second meeting with congressional leadership. We hope the President will go to this meeting with an open mind, rather than deciding that an agreement can't be reached beforehand, as he did before the first meeting.  We need to reach a budget agreement that equally boosts funds for our military and key priorities here at home, including: the opioid crisis, pension plans, veterans healthcare, student loan debt relief, and rural infrastructure. We have to provide funding for community health centers and CHIP, as well as relief for the millions of Americans still reeling from the natural disasters that hit us earlier this year. We also must come together on a bipartisan deal to pass the Dream Act, along with tough border security measures. There is a bipartisan path forward on every one of these items.  As negotiations with our Republican counterparts continue, we are hopeful the President will be open to an agreement to address the urgent needs of the American people and keep the government open.

1094,topic-id,1271,"Mr.President, later tonight or in the early hours of tomorrow morning, we will vote on final passage of the Republican tax bill. I would like to make two main points about the Republican tax bill in my speech this morning, first on process and second on substance.  From the beginning, the Republican tax bill has made a mockery of the legislative process. Republican leaders disappeared behind closed doors and negotiated a framework for a tax bill without a shred of Democratic input. Then Republican leaders wrote a bill, behind closed doors, without a shred of Democratic input. Republicans brought that bill through a markup in the Finance Committee, where it underwent the scrutiny of one--I repeat, one--expert witness. That is it. Finance Committee Democrats offered 60 amendments to the bill, but Republicans rejected every single one. The Republicans on the committee made it crystal clear that they were not interested in bipartisanship.  Now that bill is before us on the floor. Even further, significant changes will likely be made by the majority leader today. We will get huge changes in a bill today and try to vote on it tonight. This is tax--one of the most complicated issues before us. These changes, and the way the majority leader is handling this, make it impossible for any independent analyst to get a good look at the bill and how it would impact our country.  From the one-sidedness with which it was drafted to the reckless haste with which it was considered, the Republican tax bill has failed to go through anything resembling the normal legislative process.  Before the night is out, I hope my Republican friends will ask themselves if this is the way they want history to remember how the first major tax bill was passed in over 30 years. I hope they will ask themselves if this process has lived up to the fine traditions of this body, as they were so eloquently described by my friends, the Senators from Arizona, both senior and junior.  The American people are clamoring for us to work together. They believe our politics is broken. They think our politics is starved of commonsense and compromise--and it is. The way this tax bill is being rammed through is exactly why the American people believe our politics is so broken.  Now let me address the substance of the bill. Without exaggeration, I believe that if this bill passes, it will be remembered as one of the worst pieces of public policy in decades. A vote for passage will be a vote my Republican friends will regret.  At a time of immense inequality, the Republican tax bill makes life easier on the well-off and eventually makes life more difficult on working Americans, exacerbating one of the most pressing problems we face as a nation--the yawning gap between the rich and everyone else.  Corporations enjoying record profits get a massive permanent tax break while over 60 percent of the middle class will end up paying higher taxes because their benefits expire. Healthcare premiums will go up 10 percent, and 13 million fewer Americans will end up having health insurance as a result of repealing the individual mandate. The CBO said yesterday that even if we pass the Murray-Alexander bill into law, it would have little or no impact on either of those two things.  When it is all said and done, the tax bill would balloon the deficit by at least $1.5 trillion, adding to the debt burden borne by the next generation and diminishing our ability to support the military and invest in our schools, our roads, and in scientific research. Let me just repeat that. The increased deficits caused by this bill will cannibalize support from everything we know is essential to economic growth and a strong middle class, including support for our men and women in uniform.  Ultimately, this deficit-busting tax cut will endanger Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, as my friend, the Republican Senator from Florida, admitted yesterday when he said higher deficits will mean ``instituting changes to Social Security and Medicare for the future.''  So a win today for the GOP will be a very temporary one. It would be enjoyed almost exclusively in the political media that measures who is up today and down tomorrow but fails to grasp the bigger picture.  It will not be a long-term win politically. Recent polling has shown this tax bill is less popular than previous tax hikes. Let me say that again. Recent polling has shown that this tax bill is less popular than previous tax hikes, but, more importantly, it will not win out in the country. It will not be a win for 13 million middle-class families who pay higher taxes in 2019, or the 87 million middle-class families who pay higher taxes in 2027. It will not be a win for the single mom in the suburbs who no longer is able to deduct State and local taxes and will find it that much harder to send her daughter to college. It will not be a win for the 13 million Americans who go without health insurance and everyone else who will face 10 percent higher premiums next year.  Those hard-working Americans have waited years for their Congress to pass legislation to make things just a bit easier on them. They have watched an economy that for decades rewarded hard work and fair play turn against them, producing more wealth for the already wealthy but less pay and less work for workers.  For so many, this rigged economy that benefits too few and leaves too many behind is a source of frustration, anger, and despair. Donald Trump, in his campaign for the Presidency, spoke to that anger, and yet his tax bill--the Republican tax bill--is a betrayal of the working men and women who feel that anger and would make worse all of the problems that led to it in the first place. We can do a better job on tax reform, but only if we work together.  The way this Congress has careened from partisan bill to partisan bill, with no attempt even made at bipartisanship, has brought shame on this body and reinforced the skepticism that so many Americans have about our politics.  Today my Republican friends have an opportunity to turn back from this partisan bill and this partisan process. If they do, I guarantee they will find a Democratic leader, a Democratic Senate caucus, and a Democratic Party that is eager to work with them on the kind of tax reform our country deserves.  We will not sit in our corner and make unreasonable demands. As many of my colleagues know, there is a lot of sincere intent on this side of the aisle to do tax reform. I have worked with Senator Hatch, and I have worked with Senator Many others of my caucus have worked with Republicans on tax reform ideas for years. We can certainly put together a bill acceptable to both parties that reduces burdens on the middle class, makes our economy more competitive, and creates jobs here at home, and do it in a deficit neutral way. The bill doesn't do those things, but we can write a bill that does--together.  I say: Let's give it a shot. If my Republican friends close the door on their partisan tax bill tonight, they will find[[Page S7510]]an open door for bipartisan tax reform tomorrow.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sullivan). The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1319,topic-id,839,"Mr.President, even as my Republican friends move to reconcile their two tax bills in a conference committee, their problems are far from over.  At the heart of their bill is a toxically unpopular idea--giant tax breaks on big corporations and the very wealthy, paid for by cutting care and raising taxes on millions of middle-class families. The new Republican Party is the party of tax hikes on the middle class to subsidize corporate welfare. That menacing idea at the core of its bill is a problem that, like Hydra, spouts many heads.  Slashing the State and local deduction remains a massive problem for House Republicans from suburban districts like Virginia, New York, Illinois, Washington, and, of course, Multiple analyses have shown that, despite the so-called compromise that allows families to deduct up to $10,000 in property taxes, the pain inflicted on suburban families will not be much mitigated. States like California and[[Page S7829]]New York will still experience an exodus of taxpayers, which will drain local resources and impact services. For those House Republicans, voting for the conference report is a poisonous vote, substantively and politically, not to mention that home values will fall in those districts of those House If they are voting to decrease home values by 10 or 8 percent for every homeowner in their districts, that is political suicide. Why would they do it? That is what will happen, and the homeowners will start seeing that right away.  Another problem: The last-minute inclusion of a corporate AMT has Republicans and corporate leaders scrambling to figure out if it will have the unintended consequence of functionally eliminating the value of the R&D tax credit. Remember, the corporate AMT was added at the last minute because Republicans needed more revenue to offset a generous rate on passthroughs.  That is what Republicans were working on in the waning hours of last week, not trying to figure out how we could help middle-class families with kids in college, with kids who have serious medical expenses, and not reducing the impact that it would have on our deficit. Oh, no. They were busy figuring out how to make tax cuts for the wealthy even more generous as 70 percent of our passthrough income already flows to the top 1 percent, not the top 20 percent, not the top 10 percent--the top 1 percent. There is 70 percent of passthrough income that goes to the top 1 percent of earners. The Republican tax bill already slashed the rate on passthroughs, but several Republican Senators withheld their votes until that loophole was widened further.  I understand that they wanted to help smaller businesses, but take the time and figure out how to help the small businesses without helping the hedge funds, corporate law firms, the big lobbying firms, and other wealthy individuals. Take the time to figure it out--but no. In the rush to get a crumb for small business owners, they are giving a whole, big, nice chocolate layer cake to the wealthy. It is wrong, very wrong.  The inclusion of the corporate AMT is another reminder that Republicans cannot have it both ways. You cannot cut every conceivable tax on big corporations and the wealthy without blowing up the deficit. If Republicans are forced to go back and look at the corporate AMT, they will have to find revenue elsewhere. Will they slightly lessen another corporate tax break or will they ask working Americans to pay more, which they have done in previous iterations on this bill?  Yesterday, we learned the Republican leadership circulated talking points that questioned the legitimacy of the Joint Committee on Taxation--the nonpartisan, independent scorekeepers of tax legislation. Rather than confront the awful truth that their bill will not pay for itself as it, instead, costs about $1 trillion even with dynamic growth estimates, the Republican leadership asked its Members to shoot the messenger. The JCT, which is widely respected and always accepted by both parties, is, all of a sudden, a pariah in Republican circles because it told the truth--that this bill would not cause the growth they projected, that this bill will increase the deficit far more than the Republicans had hoped.  The Republican leadership tried to discredit the nonpartisan umpire it had long praised and had appointed. What a disgrace. It brings up that what has happened in the last week or two here has been one of the most disgraceful episodes in the history of the Senate--a major bill done behind closed doors, rushed through. Then, adding insult to injury, the truthtellers--the independent, appointed-by-Republican monitors--were discredited because our Republican colleagues didn't like hearing the answer.  There is still time to avert this awful bill. If my Republican friends vote no on the conference bill, we can do a bipartisan tax reform bill. We can pursue a much better process and get a much better product and go so far as to heal a Senate that has been wounded by partisanship and strife, greatly aggravated by the majority's actions on this tax bill.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-05-pt1-PgS7828-2.txt,1036,MINNESOTA'S ECONOMIC RIGHTS IN THE SUPERIOR NATIONAL FOREST ACT,2017,5,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1454,topic-id,1763,"Madam President, I welcome you and the Senator from Texas, and all of our colleagues, back after our Thanksgiving break. I had my parents, 94 and 89, at our Thanksgiving dinner with all of their children and grandchildren and cousins and ``thises and thats,'' so I have a lot to be thankful for. I am blessed to have my mom and dad see their whole family and be so happy about it.                         Work Before the Senate  But now, Madam President, we are back, and we have a lot of work to do before the end of the year and precious little time to do it. Funding for the government expires a week from this Eight hundred thousand Dreamers are waiting to hear whether they can live and work in the only country they have ever known. Almost 9 million children are waiting for us to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, and millions more are waiting for us to restore funding for community health centers--the most cost-effective, and often only, healthcare lots of people can get.  We also need to fund the cost-sharing program that holds down premiums and out-of-pocket costs for low-income Americans because the administration refuses to do so. Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.Virgin Islands are desperately in need of additional aid to recover from the natural disaster that God brought on them.  Also, the debt ceiling must be raised again, and in short order.  So we need to come to agreements on all of these issues, and quickly.  To that end, the four leaders will meet with the President tomorrow. Hopefully, we can make progress on an agreement that covers those time-sensitive issues and keeps the government running and working for the American people.                          Republican Tax Plan  We could be working on all of these issues this week, but, instead, the majority is pursuing a partisan tax plan at a breakneck pace. Since the Republicans released their first draft of the tax bill a few weeks ago, we have had 1 week of markup in the Senate Finance Committee during which the bill shape-shifted on several occasions.[[Page S7321]]  Aside from the testimony of one representative from the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Senate hasn't heard from any expert witness in a hearing room. Can my colleagues believe that? A major tax bill in front of the American people, changing lives dramatically--no expert witnesses, except the JCT witness. And the bill is likely to change drastically again on the floor of the Senate, with little time for Senators of either party to grapple with the consequences.  The Republicans are moving so fast, the Joint Tax Committee will not have time to produce a full analysis of the economic impact of the bill until after the bill is voted on. Is that backward--or what?  The Republican tax bill will affect every taxpayer and business in America, and my colleagues will not know many of its impacts before they vote on it.  Two things about this bill, however, seem certain. First, it will raise taxes on millions of middle-class families in every State of the Second, it will explode the deficit. Every independent analysis of the Senate tax bill shows that millions of families making under $200,000 a year will eventually pay more, not less, in taxes under the Republican plan. The most recent Tax Policy Center analysis showed that about 60 percent of middle-class families--those making between $28,000 and $155,000--would see a tax increase at the end of the day. Most middle-class families, by the time the 10-year window is up, will see a tax increase of 60 percent, according to the Tax Policy  While middle-class people are struggling--they either get a small decrease in taxes or an increase--folks making over $1 million a year will get an average tax cut of over $40,000--more than many Americans make in a whole year.  The tax breaks for individuals all expire; the tax breaks for massive corporations are permanent. Because the individual mandate is repealed, the tax bill would cause 13 million fewer Americans to have health insurance; meanwhile, couples with estates worth over $11 million get a tax break.  This bill is terrible for the country. It is a massive transfer of wealth to the already wealthy. It would exacerbate inequality and set the middle class back at the worst possible time.  At the same time, it would increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion, at the very least. Some of my Republican friends are saying that future consequences will extend the middle-class tax breaks that are now set to expire. Well, that would increase the deficit even more significantly. You can't have it both ways. Either the bill socks it to the middle class or it blows a giant hole in the deficit--a ``Scylla and Charybdis.'' No one wants either. The tax bill gives us that awful choice.  Some of my Republican friends say the tax bill will unleash such economic growth that the tax cuts will pay for themselves and the deficit will evaporate. It is curious to me that those same Republicans are rushing the bill so fast through the Joint Committee on Tax that it will not have time to assess the economic impact. Of course, they are afraid of what it will say. They know it is going to say nothing close to what our Republican optimists are predicting. According to a former JCT economist: ``There is good reason to expect the estimate of current legislation will show less than flattering growth affects.'' So one has to wonder: Are the Republicans afraid that the experts will find that the Republican promises of economic growth are pure fantasy? It sure seems that way.  The majority shouldn't be ramming through such an ill-conceived, backward bill. They shouldn't be breaking all the traditions of this body--busting the deficit, hurting millions of middle-class families--when there is so much potential agreement between our two parties on tax reform. We could come up with a good, bipartisan bill--not through reconciliation, through regular order--and we would all be the prouder for it.  We Democrats want to lower middle-class taxes. We Democrats want to reduce the burdens on small businesses. We Democrats want to encourage companies to locate jobs here instead of shipping them overseas, and we want to do all of these things in a deficit-neutral way. Those thoughts probably have a majority on each side of the aisle. It is a shame that the Republican leadership has chosen reconciliation, which means no regular order, no hearings, no sunlight, and no Democratic input into the bill. If Republicans turn their backs on a deeply flawed approach--and I plead with the handful who haven't committed yet--we can work together on bipartisan tax reform that delivers real relief for everyone in the middle class.                  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  Madam President, finally, on the matter of the directorship of the CFPB--the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau--there should be no dispute about who is the Acting Director of the agency. The process for succession laid out in Dodd-Frank is clear: Leandra English, not Mick Mulvaney, is the Acting Director of the  Let me underscore that point: I was involved when Dodd-Frank was written. The clear intention of Congress was to establish a clear line of succession for the CFPB, separate and apart from the Federal Vacancies I remember; I was here.  The language in question wasn't a part of the House version of Dodd-Frank, but we included it in the Senate version for an explicit purpose. We wanted the CFPB to be an independent agency, free from political considerations of the White House, free of the influence of lobbyists, who we knew would not like that consumers were finally protected in the financial area. We wanted a watchdog whose only job was to look out for consumers. That was the whole structure of the bill. That is why it has such a unique structure--to shield it from an administration, whoever it would be, that would be influenced by lobbyists.  That is why we expressly stipulated that if the Director were not available, the Acting Director should be the highest ranking member of the CFPB, not whoever the White House believes is in their political interests.  By attempting to install Mr.Mulvaney as the Director, the Trump administration is ignoring the established, proper, legal order of succession that we purposefully put in place, in order to put a fox in charge of the henhouse.  Mr.Mulvaney has, throughout his career, criticized the mission and purpose of the The man the President chose for Director of the agency called it a sick, sad joke. He doesn't believe in the agency. He would prefer that it didn't exist. That is not speculation; those are Mulvaney's own words. In 2015, he said: ``I don't like the fact that the CFPB exists.'' The only reason the Trump administration would put Mr.Mulvaney forward for this position would be so that he can rot the agency from the inside.  There is a clear pattern in this administration. Rather than trying to scrap agencies that the administration doesn't like--a tactic that would never fly with Congress or the American people, who know how important these agencies are--the administration will put in charge the people who will undermine them.  To head the Environmental Protection Agency, the Trump administration chose an industry advocate who was against just about every advance in the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water  To head the Department of Energy, the Trump administration nominated someone who called for its abolishment.  To head the Ex-Im Bank, which helps exports throughout this country--new jobs--the Trump administration nominated someone who called for it to be disbanded.  Mr.Mulvaney is only the latest in a long line of Trojan-horse candidates selected by the White House to undermine Federal agencies from within. The CFPB should be led by someone who believes in its mission, someone who is committed to working around the clock on behalf of consumers, not by a part-time Director who clearly disdains the agency. President Trump must nominate a permanent Director, and eventually that person will take charge of the agency, if confirmed. Whoever is nominated must have a demonstrated record of standing up on behalf of consumers. Former Director Cordray and Leandra English fit that mold. Mick Mulvaney certainly does not.  For the interim, the law established under Dodd-Frank dictates that Ms.[[Page S7322]]English is the Acting Director of the The White House should abandon any efforts to circumvent that succession process.

1540,topic-id,256,"Finally and briefly, Mr.President, because I know my colleagues are waiting, on the Katsas nomination, the DC Circuit is often called the second most powerful court in the Nation because it adjudicates so many highly charged political issues, including cases that deal with the limits of Executive power and regulations issued by Federal agencies. As examples, major cases on climate regulations, the CFPB, and gun safety laws in the District of Columbia are now before that court. On such a court, we should prize independence and moderation and look warily at candidates with highly political backgrounds.  Unfortunately, Gregory Katsas has been intimately involved in a number of the most partisan and legally dubious Executive orders of the current administration. He was involved in the President's controversial travel ban, his decisions to terminate DACA, to end transgender service in the military, and to establish an election integrity commission based on the lie that 3.5 million people voted illegally in the last election.  His tenure and views in the Trump administration raise important questions about his independence and moderation, particularly on a court that will likely hear cases related to the very same issues he worked on in the White He appears to be another example of the Republican majority pushing judges from a political extreme of their party as a way of advancing their interests in lieu of a legislative agenda, which has floundered.

1928,topic-id,1887,"Madam President, first, before I get to my main issue of taxes, I just heard the majority leader talk about taking away the blue slip. We hear the other side professing they want to work in a bipartisan way, but every step they take takes away bipartisanship. Reconciliation takes away bipartisanship. Getting rid of the blue ship takes away bipartisanship. Unfortunately, the majority leader has taken many steps this year to remove any hint of bipartisanship--most notably, reconciliation on this major tax bill.  This is the first time we are doing tax reform in 36 years, but then, it was done in a bipartisan way. The product lasted, and people, in retrospect, were proud of it. Because this bill is being done in such a partisan and narrow way and the idea--I even heard my friend from Utah say this: Join us. You don't put together a bill in the dark of night with just Republicans and then say: Come join us. That is not how tax reform was done in 1986. That is not how major, bipartisan efforts in this body have ever been done. It is a group from both parties sitting down and coming up with a plan. And to offer amendments and then to have them all defeated or ruled out of order and then say that is regular order? Who are we kidding? Who are we kidding?  This has been a very partisan bill. That is why it is not a great product. That is why the other side is rushing it through. This is not a proud day for this Chamber, and history will show that. History will show that.  Now I would like to talk about the specific plan, although we are still not sure what the plan will be. According to reports, Republicans are, right now, furiously debating changes in the bill, and who knows when they will put the bill on the floor. A bill like this deserves weeks of debate on the floor. At most, we will get 20 hours of debate--and maybe not that--depending on when the leader puts the new substitute bill on the floor. That is so wrong. That is so against the better angels of this Chamber and the history we have had for centuries. It is against the best practices that my dear friend from Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee, has exhibited throughout his career. So I hope we can, even at this late moment, change that.  But we are only 1 day away, unfortunately, from a final vote on the bill to rewrite the entire U.Tax Code, and significant parts of the Republican bill[[Page S7369]]are still up in the air. By the time we vote, no one will have a definitive analysis of how the bill would impact the economy--no one. No one will know how the last-minute provisions Republicans add will affect American taxpayers and businesses.  If this bill should pass--and I sure hope it doesn't, for the sake of America and for the sake of the middle class--my Republican friends will regret rushing it through in such a brazen way. There will be unintended consequences. The rush to get something--anything--done will haunt my Republican colleagues in years to come and, I dare say, in November of 2018.  I would understand the rush if the Republicans were sure they had a great tax bill, but they are not sure. I know so many of my colleagues have expressed real misgivings about this bill. They say that it is better than nothing, but that is not the alternative. It is not either this bill or nothing. We Democrats are ready to sit down and work on a bipartisan bill--it will take a couple of months--and come up with a much better plan that will get 70 or 80 votes on the floor of this Chamber, of which we can all be proud.  Every independent analysis has shown that millions of middle-class people will get an increase in taxes. The Tax Policy Center estimates that 60 percent of middle-class families will see a tax increase at the end of the day, while folks making over $1 million will get an average cut of $40,000. Do millionaires need a tax cut at all? Are they doing so poorly? Is there any study that shows this kind of tax cut will make them work harder or create more jobs? So the individual side here, which reduces the top rate by 1 percent, if that is still in the bill they are going to put before us, is misguided.  Corporations will get permanent breaks while individuals' will expire after only a few years. For estates, right now the only estates that pay any tax are worth over $11 million, and they will get a tax break while 13 million fewer Americans--middle income, low income--will get health insurance. Why rush to pass a bill like that?  It is no wonder the bill is so unpopular with the American people. In every survey that I have seen and in every State survey that I have seen, the numbers who dislike the bill exceed--in most cases, by a lot--those who like the bill, just like healthcare.  Now, corporate profits are at an all-time high. Companies are flush with cash. The richest 1 percent of Americans receive 20 percent of the overall national income. The richest 1 percent get 20 percent of the income. God bless them. I don't like that percentage, and that percentage hasn't been matched in nearly a century since the roaring twenties. But do they need a tax break? Come on.  Corporations and the wealthy are doing great right now. God bless them. They don't need a tax cut. To lavish them with huge tax breaks and ask the middle class to bear so much of the cost--that gets it backward. That is not a bill anyone in this Chamber can be proud of, whether your views are for tax cuts or not.  The main argument my Republican colleagues use to counter these damning facts--what I say is the core argument of their tax plan--is that a massive corporate tax cut would grow the economy and make it easier for companies to invest in their workers. The argument that a massive corporate tax cut leads to more jobs and higher wages is a flimsy house of cards that falls down under the slightest scrutiny.  Just yesterday, Bloomberg published an article citing the CEOs of major companies like Cisco and Coca-Cola, who said, according to the report, that ``they'll turn over most gains from the proposed corporate tax cuts to their shareholders, undercutting the President's promise that his plan will create jobs and raise wages for the middle class.''  We have seen similar quotes by major corporate leaders on earnings calls over the past several months. They admitted that this big corporate tax break will go, in large part, to stock buybacks, dividends, which we all know go to the wealthiest people in The preponderance of it goes to the wealthiest people in The additional profits from corporate tax cuts will not go to new investments or higher wages but to CEO bonuses, stock buybacks, and dividends.  Perhaps the most compelling testimony was given to top White House economic adviser Gary Cohn himself, who spoke at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council earlier this year. The gathering of business leaders was asked to raise their hands if they planned to invest the money they got from corporate tax cuts into their companies.  Gary Cohn had to ask: Why aren't there more hands up?  Again, you say: Well, they were afraid to say so. They didn't want to reveal their plans. Well, corporate executives are revealing their plans in their earnings calls. And when reporters ask them, so many of them say: I am not going to invest this in jobs; I am going to invest it in dividends and stock buybacks, send it back to the shareholders.  The harsh fact of the matter is that tax cuts don't result in the kind of economic growth and job growth my Republican friends predict. It didn't happen after the Bush tax cuts. It didn't happen in Kansas, where there were so many promises: If we cut taxes in Kansas, there will be huge growth and new jobs. Well, it was a dramatic flop, what happened in Kansas, that our Republican colleagues are repeating. They are not learning from history. Kansas's job growth last year was much lower than the national average, despite all the big tax cuts they gave.  I am afraid my Republican colleagues and friends are willing to paper over their serious reservations with this bill in order to say that they got something done. They are willing to look past the fact that 60 percent of middle-class families will see tax increases by the end of the day, that healthcare premiums will rise 10 percent, that 13 million fewer Americans will have health insurance, and that the tax bill will exacerbate inequality in an economy that is already perilously unequal--all in the name of deficit-busting corporate tax cuts that will not create the kind of economic growth and job growth they are predicting.  I heard the majority leader speak a minute ago and say: The focus of this bill--these are his words, in effect; I don't know his exact words, but they are like this. He said: The focus of this bill is on the middle class.  It is only on the middle class if you believe in trickle-down economics, that giving money to the wealthy corporations and giving money to the wealthiest of people will create jobs--trickle-down. It has never worked. According to a recent poll, 77 percent of Americans don't believe that big corporations should get tax breaks. They don't believe in trickle-down. The only people who believe in trickle-down seem to be the Members of this Chamber and the big corporation leaders who will get the benefits. Nobody else seems to believe it. Trickle-down is wrong. This bill could be entitled ``the trickle-down tax bill.'' Let's hope and pray, middle-class people, that when we give most of the breaks to the wealthiest and biggest corporations, you might get a few crumbs. Nobody wants that. We could do much better, working together in a bipartisan way.  In conclusion, I would say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, particularly those who aren't sold on this bill: We can create a better product by working together. Democrats and Republicans agree on many principles in tax reform. We both want to lower rates and close loopholes. We both want to reduce burdens on the middle class and small businesses and simplify the code. I think many on the other side agree with us that it should be deficit-neutral. This bill is none of those things.  If we start over and pursue tax reform in the right way, the bipartisan way, the open way, the sunlight way, I genuinely believe we can find a product that both sides can be proud of and one that will be much, much better--and much better received--by and for the American people.  I yield the floor.                       Reservation of Leader Time  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

2033,topic-id,1716,"Mr.President, as the Senate Finance Committee continues to mark up the Senate Republican tax bill, the House will take a vote this afternoon on their version of the bill.  There are plenty of reasons for House Republicans to vote against this bill. For those who care about deficits, you should vote no because the bill increases deficits by over $1.5 trillion, likely more. Any deficit hawk should be against this increase.  Any defense hawk should be wary of this bill for the same reason. High deficits make it harder to fund important priorities like the military. This morning, three former Defense Secretaries--Leon Panetta, Chuck Hagel, and Ash Carter--penned a letter warning that the Republican tax plan could result, in their words, in a ``hollowed-out military force'' wracked by cuts to training, maintenance, flight missions, and other vital military programs.  I spoke to General Mattis yesterday. He is definitely afraid of a CR because a CR is at sequestration levels. If we pass this tax bill with its huge deficit, we will have no choice but to go back to sequestration, and the fears of our defense leaders that they cannot fund the military adequately will be very real. So my shout-out is to all of those who care about defense, particularly our defense hawks: If you vote for this bill, you are going to be voting for a ``hollowed out military force,'' as three former defense secretaries have written to us this morning.  For those House Republicans who represent middle and upper class suburban districts, you should vote no because this bill will raise taxes on a[[Page S7271]]high number of your constituents. Members of Congress from New York, New Jersey, Washington, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Virginia know that State and local deductibility is crucial to working families in their districts. Today, House Republicans in many districts will take a vote to raise taxes on their constituents. And the compromise--the first three-quarters of the break is rescinded even with the compromise over in the House, but, second, the Senate, so desperate for money, has not even included the compromise here. You can be sure when it comes back, that compromise will not be in the bill--certainly not as generous as it is now. It was not very generous to begin with.  According to the New York Times, the House bill would raise taxes on a third of middle-class taxpayers next year and almost half by 2027. The rich, meanwhile, will do just fine.  The Senate bill, similarly, would raise taxes on 20 million middle-class Americans by 2027. Meanwhile, folks making over $1 million will get an average cut of $50,000. People say: Well, they have more money; they should get a bigger tax cut. The wealthy are doing great. They don't need any tax cut. Give the money to the middle class.  The number of middle-class families who would lose money from this bill may even be higher now, considering the 10-percent increase in premiums that will occur as a result of the Republican plan to repeal the individual mandate. That 10-percent increase in health premiums could more than wipe out the tax cuts received by some folks in the middle. All the while, 13 million fewer Americans get health insurance.  My friend, Senator Graham, recently said: ``I hope every Republican knows that when you pass a repeal of the individual mandate . . . [healthcare] becomes your problem.'' Lindsey Graham is very politically pressured. He is telling his Republican colleagues that if they do this, every problem in healthcare will be on their backs.  The whole idea of taking money from the pockets of hard-working Americans, of taking money out of their healthcare and giving it to big corporations and those at the very top is so backward, so wrong, that the American people will reject it, and the blame will fall on Republican shoulders. If the Republican tax bill should pass, it would make our economy, so unfairly tilted toward the top as it already is, even more unbalanced and unfair.  Over the past three decades, as technology has changed our economy and our world has become ever more interdependent, our economy has grown. Yes, it has grown; there is a lot of growth. But that growth, more than at any time in history, has been captured entirely, almost, by big corporations and the top 1 percent and particularly the top 0.1 percent of our country. We don't begrudge them. We are glad people work hard. With new ideas and hard work, people should become wealthy, but they don't need a tax break.  At the same time, middle-class families have muddled along. Median income has barely nudged up in three decades. The costs of college, healthcare, prescription drugs, cable, and the internet have skyrocketed as corporations have consolidated in their industries, reducing competition and driving up prices.  For the middle-class families in the suburbs, for the working parent in the city, for the young millennials just setting off into the workforce after college, for the single mom raising two children, it is about as hard as ever to balance your income with ever-rising costs. In such an economy, tax reform could really matter to those folks, but only if it is done right.  Instead of focusing all their efforts on improving the condition of those working Americans, Republicans have directed the lion's share of the benefits to the already wealthy, the already powerful--corporate America and the very rich.  There is perhaps no better example than President Trump and his family, for whom this bill would be an express mail gift from Heaven: Repealing the estate tax, they have a big one; repealing the alternative minimum tax--the Trumps pay a lot of alternative minimum tax; dropping the rate on passthrough entities like the Trump Organization, a huge tax break for Donald  So scrapping middle-class deductions while maintaining loopholes for real estate businesses, golf course owners--who do you think came up with this plan? Not the average middle-class guy or gal. All of these things contained in the House Republican bill would likely pile more on top of President Trump's fortune while millions and millions of middle-class families end up paying more.  I am not sure any family in America feels it is right to subsidize tax cuts for folks like President Trump and his family, and their voices will be heard during the debate on this bill and afterward.  This bill will be a huge burden for Republicans to carry on their backs over the next year, make no mistake about it. So we hope they will vote down the bill in the House and in the I want to assure my friends in the Senate on the other side of the aisle that if the bill goes down, Democrats are ready, willing, able, and eager to work with Republicans on a bipartisan reform.                                  DACA  Mr.President, before I yield the floor, seeing my friend Senator Durbin here, I would like to address one final issue--the  My dear friend Senator Durbin has an uncommon eloquence. He speaks with eloquence and yet with Midwestern common sense. He speaks with persuasiveness and ease on a great number of subjects. He is a great asset to our Democratic caucus and to the Senate as a whole, but there is no doubt that the Dreamers are at the top of his list. They are near and dear to his heart. He is one of the chief architects of DACA and has labored on their behalf for as long as I can remember.  Every Dreamer should thank Senator He is their sponsor, their champion, and their staunchest advocate.  This morning I would like to join him in recognizing the contributions of a Dreamer in my State--a reminder of the glaring need to pass the Dream Act, since President Trump so misguidedly terminated the program a few months ago.  Zuleima Dominguez is a DACA recipient who lives in the Zuleima was brought to the United States from Mexico when she was 7 years old. She has grown up in the United States and has gone to school here; she went to her first dance in the United States and knows no other country as her home.  Like so many other Americans, Zuleima is working her way through college--Hunter College, part of City University on the Upper East Side--but because of her legal status, she has been unable to access enough help to afford her tuition. So what does Zuleima do? She works 45 hours a week at a homeless shelter, giving back to her fellow New Yorkers while saving up for her next semester.  She is studying to be a social worker. Isn't Zuleima what we hope an American citizen would be like? Wouldn't we all be proud to call her our neighbor, our friend, our daughter?  She is someone who works hard and feels a calling to give back to her community. Zuleima has the quintessential American spirit, as had millions who came to this country before her, through the centuries.  She is part of that long and grand tradition of immigration in this country, of folks coming from all over the world to find a better life here, build strong families and communities, and make indelible contributions to our society, our economy, and our culture.  Zuleima and her two children are part of that American tradition. They, with all of us, are what makes America great.  There are many more Dreamers just like Zuleima who came to this country through no fault of their own as very young kids. They study at our schools; they work in our companies; they serve in our military. They are American in every single way but one--their paperwork.  We must fix that now and forever by passing the Dream Act through Congress and giving folks like Zuleima and her kids a chance to live and thrive in the only country they have ever known.  I know my entire caucus supports the bill. I know how many of my friends on the other side of the aisle support it as well. So what are we waiting for? Let's put the bill on the floor and pass it.[[Page S7272]]  I yield to my friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant Democratic leader.

2106,topic-id,1105,"On the Republican tax bill, we are only a few days away from a final vote, but from all reports, the Republicans are still debating significant changes to the text of the bill. Some are angling for a change to the passthrough provisions, feeling that a gargantuan new tax loophole for many high-income individuals needs to be widened even further. Right now, it is reported that 70 percent of these passthroughs go to the top 1 percent. The changes that are being proposed would make it even worse.  Help small business, yes. Don't open a giant loophole for wealthy hedge funds, big-shot law firms, and lobbyists. We don't need that.  Others are rightly worried about the impact this bill would have on the deficit and debt. What I would remind my Republican colleagues is that, with any more changes, it is virtually certain you will be voting on a bill without any expert analysis of its impacts; you will be voting without any estimate of whether it will grow or shrink the economy; you will be voting without a good sense of the long-term impacts of the changes you are making to the Tax  Certainly, 1 week of markup in the Finance Committee, with only one expert witness, is not a satisfactory process, particularly considering the changing nature of this bill. Changing the Tax Code in broad brush is a difficult thing. There are so many unintended consequences.  If our Republican colleagues should pass this bill and it becomes law--and I hope it won't--week after week, we are going to find new things in this bill--some intended, some not intended. The people who voted for it are going to regret it. The public will ask: Why didn't you know? With a tax bill, it is impossible to know all these things unless you let it sit out there in the Sun and bake so that people, experts from around the country--there are tens of thousands of tax lawyers paid to figure out ways around our Tax Code and help the wealthy, who are their clients. Unless you examine the bill carefully in sunlight, unless you have a lot of hearings, unless you hear from all kinds of witnesses, the result is usually quite bad for America, with so many unintended consequences.  Our Republican colleagues, in their rush to get a bill done, are legislating in an irresponsible way, especially when it comes to something as important and complex as the Tax If the product were a great one, that would be one thing. We all know this is not a great product. We don't even hear our Republican colleagues bragging about this product, with a few exceptions. Everyone says this could be better, that could be better.  Every independent analysis has shown that the tax bill will end up raising taxes on millions of middle-class families, despite the early intentions of the President and Republican leaders. The Tax Policy Center estimates that 60 percent of middle-class families will see a tax increase--60 percent of middle-class families will see a tax increase--by the time the bill is fully implemented, while folks making over $1 million a year would get an average tax cut of over $40,000.  Some would say: Well, they are making more money; they should get a bigger tax break. I would like to take every dollar of that $40,000 a millionaire gets and give it to the middle class. They are the ones who need the help, not the wealthy people. They are the ones who buy the products and keep the economy humming. They are the ones who, throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, created the best economy America has ever had, not just the few millionaires. It is astounding.  If the President and Republicans in Congress set out to pass a middle-class tax cut, as they claim--if that is where they set out, this bill completely misses the mark. Meanwhile, the big winners--big corporations, the very wealthy--are doing great already. Estates worth over $11 million get a tax break? Why is that? Why is that, when average middle-class people are struggling? Corporations get a permanent reduction in their rates, while individual tax breaks expire after a few years. The bill would even open up drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge because this tax bill wouldn't be complete unless they help Big Oil too.  All of this to saddle the next generation of Americans with larger deficits, even larger debt--something many of my friends on the other side of the aisle have labored against their whole[[Page S7341]]careers. We have heard so many speeches from the other side about deficit reduction. I think my colleagues were sincere. Why are they abandoning it now?  Every one of our colleagues knows that we could do a lot better job in a tax bill at reducing the deficit than we have here. From the very beginning, Democrats have told our Republican colleagues that we want to work with them on tax reform, we want to lower taxes on the middle class, we want to reduce burdens on small businesses, we want to erase the incentives that send jobs overseas and bring jobs back home, and we want to do all these things in a way that doesn't add to the deficit.  From the very beginning, Republicans have said to us: We are not interested in working with you. We are going to draft it ourselves and use reconciliation so we don't need your votes, and you can vote for our bill if you want.  That is not bipartisanship, what the Republican leadership has done.  I know there are some Republicans on the other side who wish we could work together. Well, we can. Today at 11 a.m., I think more than a dozen--certainly a large number of Democrats went to the Press Gallery and said: We want to work with our Republican colleagues to create a better bill.  They came and visited me last night. I encouraged them to do it. This leader--this leader--is not going to stand in the way of bipartisan reform that meets the goals we have talked about: helping the middle class, reducing the deficit, not unduly or in any way aiding the 1 percent.  Bipartisanship and compromise are very possible on tax reform. It is an issue crying out for a bipartisan solution. There are a lot of areas in which we agree. We have to work to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties. I daresay it would be a better bill for the American middle-class than the one we are looking at right now.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-28-pt1-PgS7340-4.txt,1036,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONTINUED,2017,28,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We had hoped to make progress with the administration on these issues in a meeting this afternoon. Unfortunately, this morning, instead of leading, the President tweeted a blatantly inaccurate statement and then concluded: ``I don't see a deal.'' The President said: ``I don't see a deal'' three hours before our meeting, before he heard anything we had to say.  Given that the President doesn't see a deal between Democrats and the White House, Leader Pelosi and I believe the best path forward is to continue negotiating with our Republican counterparts in Congress, instead. Rather than going to the White House for a show meeting that will not result in an agreement from a President who doesn't see a deal, we have asked Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan to meet with us this afternoon.  We don't have any time to waste addressing the issues that confront us. So we are going to negotiate with Republican leaders who may actually be interested in reaching a bipartisan agreement.

It is joyful to be on a committee where when you do argue with each other, particularly when we have conversations in the back, they happen at a fairly high level.  Can I give you sort of a personal global view of how I am viewing this tax reform? I truly believe this will be the single biggest, most important vote I make in my life.  We all know what status quo is. Status quo, in many of the models, basically says, in about 15, 18 years, we hit a debt crisis. Are we arguing here for status quo or our change, or are we having an argument here that you don't like our changes, but you also agree we need to have a revolution in our economic growth?  If we build our lives as it is set right now with a 1.8, 1.9 percent GDP growth for the next three decades, my 2-year-old's future is miserable. Those very seniors whom someone was just speaking about, do you understand what happens to those earned entitlements? There is no money. We hit a debt crisis. We are just a few years away from publicly held debt equaling the size of our entire economy.  If you love people, if you care about this country keeping its promises, we have got to grow. We have seen the attempts at sort of managed economy, managed control, managed targeted.  How about something much more elegant: let's make us competitive in the world again; let's get rid of all the lobbyist-created little special deals in the Tax Code, or as many as we can politically, and do everything we can to get this economy growing.  Yes, it is going to require more, in my view of the world, than tax reform. We are going to have to deal with immigration, we are going to have to deal with technology, we are going to have to deal with regulation, but we all know around here that if we do not have a revolution in this Tax Code, our future is pretty dark.  With economic growth, our future is actually really bright. When you see the Atlanta Fed telling us, just in anticipation of tax reform, we have crossed 3\1/2\ percent GDP growth right now, maybe that 1.8 percent misery of economic growth isn't our future, isn't the future for my little girl, isn't the future for every American, but it is an opportunity for this country to start looking as it should: a land of opportunity.

195,topic-id,476,"Mr.President, this is what I find astonishing. We have been talking about this for a number of months. Frankly, for years we have been talking about tax reform. Actually, since 1986 we have been talking about tax reform. Our plan removes millions of low-income Americans from having to pay taxes.  I think it is interesting that our friends' argument on the left is sincere but wrong. It misses the fact that if you are living in a single-parent household, with a mother or a father who is working paycheck to paycheck, getting another $100 a month is real money. Why are we not talking about the actual benefits to the specific people who benefit from this tax reform? When Senator Toomey talks about the typical American family seeing its taxes slashed by 60 percent, why is that specific savings of $2,200 not a meaningful--perhaps, transformative--savings that allows someone now to save for college or to save for retirement?  To me, this is where the rubber meets the road. Yes, here on the other side of the Potomac, it is OK to talk in platitudes. I prefer to talk to individuals about the impact of our actions in their households and the impact of our actions in their accounts. It is a very simple way of doing the math. You don't have to pull out a calculator for a 75-percent savings for the average single parent who makes $41,000. The reason that we use $41,000 is that that is the average income of a single head of household. The reason that we use $73,000 is that that is the typical American family's income.  When we are talking about the benefits, we are talking about real people--people like Sherry, back in South Carolina, a single parent with two kids, who is trying to start a business, who is struggling to keep her ends together, believing that someone, somewhere, sees her, that the decision makers in Washington don't see her as invisible or unimportant. I am not talking about tax philosophy. I am talking about real people who need their money more than the government does.  If we are going to talk about tax cuts and tax revenues, let us be clear that in the 1920s, during the Mellon tax cuts, which slashed the high rate from 70 percent down to the twenties throughout the 1920s, revenues went up by 61 percent. Under the Kennedy administration, we cut taxes, and tax revenues went up to the government from those cohorts from whom we cut it.  So what we have is a history. Our friends on the other side say that there is no actual history. Well, there is history that proves that. In the cohorts where the brackets are and where the cuts occur, we can demonstrate that the revenues have increased.

I look forward to hopefully passing this bill today. I hope we do. I look forward to the American people taking[[Page S7675]]the time to remember the exact time, the exact date that this was said, and then do the research necessary to draw their own conclusion. The first conclusion that will be easy to come to is that when you look at your pay stub and you see there is more money in it in 2018 than there was in 2017, just remember how it got there. It is not because of what we do, because there are some folks on this side of the Potomac who believe we actually have Federal dollars. There are no Federal dollars.

230,topic-id,658,"Mr.President, I thank my good friend from  I say to Senator Portman, may I see that list? I have been on the floor and, unfortunately, I have not been able to get a copy of the list. Obviously, you have been able to have your staff get it or go online and get a copy of this list. I think my good friend from Oregon said they needed their good friends who are lobbyists to supply them with a list.  I am not sure what the other side is missing. They had control of the House, the Senate, and the White House for a couple of years, and they increased spending without doing anything about revenues, other than trying to have a tax increase a few years ago, $630 billion of tax increases, and somehow they have missed the correlation between higher taxes and lower revenues. We have gotten it right that oftentimes lower taxes actually increase revenue, which has been proven from the twenties, sixties and eighties.  It is good news that my friends on the left are finally thinking about the national debt. We had a couple hundred years of life in America that produced about $10 trillion of national debt. Eight years after Democratic leadership, we have a national debt of $20 trillion. I find it a tad disingenuous that my friends on the left are going to counsel us about debt when, in fact, their record is so clearly obvious. When it comes to the benefits this bill has for those folks who are working paycheck to paycheck, as the country saw its debt double in the last 8 years, what they did not see double were their wages. As a matter of fact, their wages were stagnant. Why? Because when you take money out of the private sector economy and place it into the hands of the government, you do not grow the private sector economy. It is a simple formula.  While wages were flat, the economy grew at an anemic 1.9 percent, even though they doubled the national debt from $10 trillion to $20 trillion. It is fascinating that my friends on the left, looking for ways to create lobbyist loopholes, are on this floor lecturing anybody about debt. We, on the other hand, aren't thinking about lobbyists or our friends on the left. We are thinking about the American people, the hard-working group of individuals who find themselves too often at the end of too many weeks with too little left in their pockets.  We are not asking the American people to just believe us. What we are saying with great clarity is, starting in paychecks in 2018, because of our tax cuts targeted toward the typical American family, you will see in your paycheck more of your hard-earned money.

To my good friend from Ohio, my friends on the other side of the aisle are starting to overcook my grits just a little bit. I don't mind having a vigorous debate on facts, but to sell fear--as I said a few minutes ago, fear being false evidence appearing real is just turning the heat up on my grits. I have to tell you, this leads to an unhealthy outcome for the American people because at the end of the day, the goal is not for us to be right and for them to be wrong. I don't think their goal is for them to be right and for us to be wrong. It is kind of simple.

1197,topic-id,521,"Mr.President, many people are asking the question: What is the difference? I believe my good friend from Michigan is sincere in her desire to see the middle class succeed under any tax reform package, and I agree.  The fact of the matter is that we are not talking about Republicans versus Democrats when it comes to tax reform. We are talking about the American people. I wanted to make a list of those benefits that will go directly to the middle class--to every single tax bracket we have. Every bracket gets a tax cut.  The typical American family makes around $73,000 a year. They will see their taxes come down about 60 percent. If you are a single head of household--a single mom like mine--raising a couple of kids, making around $41,000 a year, your taxes under the new tax reform plan comes down about 75 percent.  We are actually going to help by nearly doubling the standard deduction. If you are a single person, your current deduction is $6,300. Under our plan, it goes to $12,000.  If you are a single head of household, it is $9,300 now. It goes to $18,000 under our proposal.  If you are in a dual-income household, the current deduction is around $12,000. We double it to $24,000.  We double the child tax credit to $2,000.  I will tell you that there is a lot being said on the floor, and much of it is hard to follow. I like to keep things simple. If you are a single head of household with $41,000, put simply, there is a 75-percent cut in your taxes. If you are the typical American family earning around $73,000, the average tax cut is around 60 percent. We are doubling your standard deduction. We are doubling the child tax credit. There is a whole lot in this bill that benefits hard-working, everyday  I am glad that my friends on the left are finally concerned about the debt. This is a good thing. Under the last 8 years in the previous administration, our debt climbed from $10 trillion to $20 trillion. So it is good news that we will finally have an opportunity to address that debt.  If we are going to address the debt, we are going to have to grow our economy. Growing our economy requires us to do a couple of things. 1, we have to make sure that our Tax Code is competitive in a global economy. Today, 35 percent is the highest in the industrialized world. Our competition is around 23 percent. We have to be in a competitive position so we grow our economy here at home. We do that with a 20-percent rate.  If we want to make sure that the economy of the future is built here at home, we also have to be able to bring home overseas profits, also known as repatriating those dollars--$2.5 trillion--and build factories and build opportunities with that $2.5 trillion here at home, creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs.  Our tax reform package focuses specifically where America lives.

1245,topic-id,727,"Mr.President, I had the privilege of sitting on the floor and listening to this debate on tax reform. Our friends to the left and center have done a really good job of painting a picture of fantasyland, a land that does not exist in  Frankly, when I think of fantasyland, I think about the fact that sugar-free cookies will not help you gain any weight. Anyone who has had sugar-free cookies and too many of them can attest to the fact that may not be an accurate picture, but these, they may, in fact, be sugar-free.  My good friend to the left oftentimes speaks in illustrious language, compelling words, but they are not necessarily always accurate.  When I think about our tax reform package, it really comes down to some very simple concepts--families. Too many American families feel invisible because so often we hear folks talking about people before they actually talk to people. When you talk to the average American family, what you will hear, time and time again, is that it is very difficult for the average family to get their ends together, making ends meet. Working paycheck to paycheck is too often, in too many places, the norm.  So when we start talking about helping the average American family, when we start talking about helping single parents, we are talking about helping them keep their dollars. In other words, we believe they know better than government how to spend their money.  If you are an average American household with only one breadwinner, the fact is, our plan delivers a 75-percent tax cut if you earn around $41,000. Why do we talk about $41,000 for a single-parent household? It is because the average single-parent household with a couple of kids earns around $40,000. So we want to paint a clear picture, not a picture filled with facts but facts that lead you to the truth. That is not what we are hearing all the time in this  When you think about an average family, a typical American family, with two earners in the household, the average family in America makes around $73,000. Our tax cut for that average, typical American family is 60 percent.  Here is what I struggle with. Why is it not a bipartisan objective to deliver tax cuts to hard-working families, too often working two jobs to make their ends meet? Why is there not a bipartisan coalition working to make sure there is a tax break in every single bracket?  I just can't figure out why doubling the standard deduction for an individual to $12,000 is not a bipartisan activity. I really can't appreciate why taking a single-parent household from a standard deduction of $9,300 to $18,000 is something my friends on the left are resistant to do.  I cannot explain to you or to the folks back in South Carolina why almost doubling the standard deduction from $12,700 to $24,000 isn't a bipartisan exercise.  I can't explain to you why families who are strapped with kids in the home, why we can't say to them that doubling the child tax credit is a good thing. Where is the controversy around saying that instead of getting a $1,000 child tax credit, we are going to make it $2,000? Where is the controversy?  Why can't our friends on the left be a part of that conversation? Why is it that our friends on the left have finally come to the conclusion that after 8 years of running the Nation from the White House and taking a $10 trillion debt that was accumulated over 230 years and then doubling it in 8 years--now they want the American people to take them seriously about the debt.  Let me close by simply suggesting that 4,700 businesses would still be American businesses, according to an EY study, if we had a 20-percent corporate tax rate--4,700 businesses are no longer ours. They have been acquired or inverted because our Tax Code punishes success. In a global competition, our American workers deserve better. In a global competition, our workers deserve the opportunity to work for companies whose tax rates are competitive in a global economy.  If we don't do that, more American companies will invert, and fewer Americans will work here at home in places like Alaska, South Carolina, and the  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Kennedy).

11,topic-id,278,"Mr.Speaker, I join my colleagues in honoring the memory, legacy, and public office of Maurice  Mo and I were elected in the same election in 1974 and met during freshman orientation that December on a cold Albany day. From then on, we were friends.  I came from the South Bronx, so I knew about the issues of the environment, but I didn't know the intricacies of how they should be approached legislatively. He taught me all about it, as he did our whole freshman class. From day one, he was that person who spoke about saving this Earth, saving this country, and saving this land that has been loaned to us.  In addition, Maurice was, as has been said here, one of the nicest guys you could ever imagine. He was a unique elected official. He was a liberal in a conservative district who was loved by his constituents.  Early in my assembly career, the first year, I visited his district and saw how he cared for the people and how they cared for him. He took me all around. It was wonderful how he loved his community.  He taught us that there were places outside of New I will always remember Maurice used to say to me: I have got to go to New York City once a month.

1661,topic-id,1733,"Mr.President, I agree with my colleagues that we need tax reform, but we need tax reform that simplifies the Tax Code, bolsters the middle class, and helps small businesses to create jobs. I think we can do that, and we can do that in a fiscally responsible way, but we need to work together, Republicans and Democrats, as we did the last time we did tax reform.  Unfortunately, these priorities are not reflected in the bill that is before us. Instead, it is a partisan, fiscally irresponsible giveaway to the wealthy and the largest corporations in this country, and it comes at the expense of the middle class and small businesses.  We know that the wealthiest Americans will see massive tax breaks from this bill, including President Trump himself. In fact, the New York Times has estimated that President Trump and his family would save more than $1 billion from this tax bill.  How does this legislation pay for these tax cuts? Well, it asks today's middle class and future generations to foot the bill. The nonpartisan analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation has found that the bill will raise taxes on millions of middle-class families making less than $75,000 a year. The bill sunsets any middle-class tax breaks in 2026, and at the same time it makes tax breaks for large corporations permanent. It increases the national debt by $1.5 trillion.  I think the headline in the current Forbes Magazine says it all. It says[[Page S7399]]``The GOP Tax Bill Is The End Of All Economic Sanity In Washington.'' As more people look at this bill, they are beginning to see how it will hurt middle-class families across the country.  Over the past few weeks, I have heard more and more concerns from people throughout New Hampshire, and I just want to take a minute to highlight some of these concerns. I met recently with the New Hampshire Realtors and homebuilders. They are major advocates for home ownership in New They told me that this bill is nothing short of an attack on home ownership. In particular, they are concerned about the impact of repealing the State and local tax deduction, which would be a huge hit to middle-class families in New Right now, more than 200,000 Granite State homeowners use the State and local tax deductions so that they are not double-taxed. That is about one-third of taxpayers in New It is particularly important to us where property taxes account for 66 percent of all State and local taxes. That is a higher share than any other State in the country.  Homeowners are also concerned about proposals to limit the mortgage interest deduction, including on home equity lines of credit, where homeowners in New Hampshire are going to get hurt more than others because we have approximately 14 percent of homeowners who have a home equity line of credit, compared to 3.8 percent nationally. The result is, according to the Realtors and the homebuilders, that home values will decline significantly.  According to the Association of Realtors, this bill will put downward pressure on home values by as much as 18 percent in New Hampshire and 10 percent nationally. If we look at this chart for New Hampshire, we can extrapolate this across the rest of the economy.  If we look at this tax bill, this is the impact on homeowners in New Values are going to be reduced by about 18 percent. That is equivalent to what we saw after the financial meltdown in 2008, where, again, we had about that same reduction in property values--about 18 percent. That is a huge hit for us in New Hampshire and for people across the country.  I thought the Realtors put it very well when they said: It is simply unfair to ask homeowners, who pay 83 percent of all Federal income taxes, to take a greater tax burden so that the biggest corporations in this country can have steep tax cuts. It doesn't make sense.  I also heard significant concern from students, colleges, and businesses that this bill will raise taxes on students trying to get the skills they need to get ahead. That is really crazy because when we do that, we don't create the workforce we need for the future. The House bill, for example, would eliminate the ability of individuals to deduct the interest on their student loans, and it would tax graduate students on tuition assistance. I heard from a graduate student who, right now, is making $20,000 a year on a stipend. That is what he is trying to live on. If this bill goes into effect, he will pay $5,000 of that in taxes. It doesn't make sense. We need to be encouraging our students to get graduate and higher education degrees so that they can take on the jobs of the future.  Again, in New Hampshire, it is a particular problem, where student loan debt is higher than the national average. For the graduating class of 2016, New Hampshire had the highest per capita student loan debt in the country. The average debt for New Hampshire graduates was $36,367. We know, nationally, student loan debt has roughly tripled since 2004 to a staggering $1.3 trillion. That is higher than the total credit card debt. What this legislation is likely to do is to make that worse for young people who are trying to get out of college, have their student loans paid, get married, start families, buy a house. If they continue to have this impact, they are not going to be able to do any of those things.  The top challenge that faces New Hampshire businesses and so many businesses across this country is finding skilled workers. The last thing we should be doing is making education more expensive.  I also serve as the ranking member on the Senate Small Business Small businesses employ more than half of our workforce. They make up more than 99 percent of all employers. We need to work in a bipartisan way to enact tax reform that supports our small businesses. Again, this bill, unfortunately, doesn't provide meaningful reform for small businesses and the problems they are facing with the Tax First of all, this bill doesn't address the top issue that we have heard from small businesses--tax simplification and the cutting of redtape in our Tax  For entrepreneurs, time is one of their most valuable resources. Every wasted hour spent filling out forms or navigating confusing tax rules is an hour they can't spend innovating, marketing, and growing their businesses. The tax system is so difficult to navigate that 89 percent of small businesses turn to outside tax preparers to fill out their forms and file their returns. The compliance burden for small businesses is 67 percent higher than it is for large businesses, and it costs about $18 billion annually.  Tax reform should be an opportunity to help us help small businesses focus on what they do best, and that is running their business. Instead, this bill will result in even more redtape and complexity.  According to a former Joint Committee on Taxation economist, if this bill becomes law:       Treasury will be writing regulations and Congress will be      enacting technical corrections for years. There are more      ticking time bombs in this bill than in a Roadrunner cartoon.  A recent poll of small business owners from Businesses for Responsible Tax Reform found that a majority of them oppose the plan. This is polling that has just been done in the last week or so; 61 percent oppose, and only 28 percent support.  Small businesses are even more concerned about the impact this tax bill will have on our debt and deficit. In fact, 61 percent of small business owners oppose raising the debt by $1.5 trillion to pay for tax cuts.  Increasing the debt will inhibit our ability to address the real challenges facing small businesses, such as educating a skilled workforce, building out broadband in rural areas, and fixing our broken infrastructure.  Then there is the repeal of the individual mandate, which is a part of this tax proposal. According to CBO, repealing the individual mandate, as this bill does, would cause 13 million Americans to become uninsured by 2027. It would sharply raise premiums for those who purchase insurance on the individual market.  Now, we have heard from our colleagues that they think that including the Alexander-Murray legislation would help address that, but that is not designed to address the underlying healthcare bill that we have in this country. All that will do is address the uncertainty in the marketplace.  Repealing the individual mandate is going to deny health insurance to millions of It is going to cost middle-income families more, and, ultimately, it is going to have an impact on people's abilities to provide for their families and the long-term health of this That is not the kind of investment we should be making in the future of this country.  There are many more issues with this tax bill, but my time is limited. If we look at who is opposed to this bill, there are so many organizations: the Realtors, the homebuilders, the AARP, and the Fraternal Order of They have all come out in opposition, and that is just to name a few.  I have heard from nearly 3,000 Granite Staters who have expressed their opposition to the impact of this bill, and as more and more people have a chance to read it, that number is going to continue to grow.  You know I want to work with my colleagues here. I think Republicans and Democrats should genuinely reform the Tax It is long overdue. But we need to do it in a way that is transparent, that looks at where we want to go in the future and what we need to be investing in in this country. We need to work in a bipartisan way that puts the middle class and small businesses first and that doesn't leave a massive debt for our children and grandchildren. If we pass this legislation, that is exactly what we are going to be doing--leaving future generations to deal with a massive debt without[[Page S7400]]the benefits of the investment that we should be making in this country.  So it is a sad day for  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-11-29-pt1-PgS7394.txt,1901,DACA,2017,29,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

603,topic-id,1193,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.3017, the Brownfields Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment, and Reauthorization Act of 2017. This legislation has broad bipartisan support, and I would like to thank Chairman Walden and Ranking Members Pallone and  I would also like to specifically thank a few of my colleagues who have exhibited leadership and commitment on this issue, Congressman David McKinley, my fellow Energy and Commerce Committee member, who introduced this important bill, and my colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Congressman John Katko and Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty who guided a similar bill through their committee.  We have been working closely with our colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee over these past few months, and the bill that we will vote on today reflects compromise on both sides.  The bill takes a very important step in reauthorizing the Environmental Protection Agency's brownfields program for the first time since the law was enacted, and so I would like to also thank Chairman Shuster for his leadership and support as we move forward.  The bill we are voting on today makes several important changes to the brownfields law that will result in more contaminated sites being cleaned up and returned to productive use, such as the creation of multipurpose grants, which will allow communities to use grant funds for both assessment and remediation, as well as allow communities to clean up more than one site in a designated area.  The bill also provides liability relief to States and municipalities who voluntarily acquire brownfields property through their authority as a sovereign, which will allow local units of government to address contamination on property they acquire through tax delinquency, bankruptcy, and/or abandonment.  The bill expands grant eligibility for nonprofit organizations and for publicly owned brownfields sites that acquired the property prior to January 11, 2002, which will put more parties into the mix of persons eligible for grant funding, which will result in more sites being assessed and cleaned up.  The legislation increases the limit for remediation grants from $200,000 to $500,000. As we learned from witnesses at our hearings, this will result in more brownfields sites being cleaned up because many of the sites that remain to be addressed are more complicated and, therefore, more expensive.  The bill provides for a limited amount of grant funds to be used for administrative costs, which will allow small and rural communities to be able to receive and utilize grant funds, and it carves out grant money to assist Indian Tribes in small, rural, and disadvantaged communities as they work to assess and clean up contaminated properties.  The EPA brownfields program is critical to States and local communities as they address contaminated industrial and commercial properties and return them to productive use. Cleaning up these sites is great for the economy because brownfields grants can be directly leveraged into jobs, additional redevelopment funds, and increased residential and commercial property values.  In fact, the brownfields program, on average, leverages over $16 in private investment for every Federal dollar spent and leverages 8\1/2\ jobs for every $100,000 of brownfields funds expended on assessment and cleanup.  The brownfields program is a proven results-driven program that has changed the way contaminated property is perceived, addressed, and managed. A visible, national example of the brownfields program at work was the Houston Astros and the Los Angeles Dodgers facing off in game three of the World Series at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Minute Maid Park sits on a former brownfields site that the city of Houston redeveloped and obviously returned to a very productive reuse, especially for the  The EPA brownfields program is uniquely positioned to protect the environment and spur the economy. You can tell, from the broad bipartisan support that H.3017 enjoys, the support for the EPA brownfields program is unqualified. The program has strong support from local and State governments, private developers, and all sectors of the economy.  Because brownfields funding is so important to States and local communities across the country, I want to encourage my colleagues on the appropriations committee to fully fund this important and successful program.  Mr.Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.[[Page H9541]]         House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and            Infrastructure,                                 Washington, DC, November 9, 2017.

The changes we are making also bring more parties into the process by clarifying their eligibility to receive funding under the brownfields program, including making nonprofit entities eligible to receive all forms of brownfields funding.  Unfortunately, the Environmental Protection Agency provided us technical assistance a week ago, telling us that the definition we used for how to delineate which nonprofit organizations should be included was too limited, and would exclude a number of important organizations that the EPA currently provides funding to through the brownfields program, including the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials, commonly known as ASTSWMO, and other entities organized under section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code that are involved in the cleanup of brownfields sites around the country.  We need to address this issue as this process moves forward.

2001,topic-id,336,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman and my good friend, Mr.McGovern, for the kind words.  What we did here was simple. It is not always simple to get through the legislative process, but what we attempted to do was reauthorize a bill that hadn't been authorized. Appropriated dollars were being spent.  It has been the focus of the Republican Congress to make sure we reauthorize programs, and we do that to fix things that have gone wrong over the years or because a changing environment has occurred.  The last time the bill was really authorized was 2002. Fast-forward 15 years, there are things changed. The authorization amount was set. We actually spent more than the authorization amount.  People love this program, but we have got to update it to the modern day, and we need to fix some of the items. Those are reflected in this bill, and I appreciate the Rules Committee hearing the debate, addressing some of the concerns, and deciding that this bill can come to the floor. As it was stated, no amendments were offered to debate on this floor, which I think is a great process.  Simply put, I have a friend from Houston, Texas, who is very proud of the Houston Astros, and he will cite Minute Maid Minute Maid Park is on a brownfields. So if you looked at the World Series and you saw that beautiful facility, well, that is the result of the brownfields program that we are now trying to update and fix.[[Page H9482]]  The stats are pretty clear. I mean, you get a $16 return for every dollar we put in at the Federal level. That is a great return on investment. Jobs are increased by every projection, and even local land values around the brownfields, the property values increase around them. This and more will be debated and discussed when we bring the bill to the floor tomorrow. This rule helps us do that.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

2003,topic-id,620,"Mr.Speaker, one other thing I will end on, and I know we will have a lot of debate and frustration and controversy, but this did go through regular order. We had a hearing. We had a subcommittee mark. As Mr.McGovern mentioned, we had a full committee mark. We invested with our Democratic colleagues--they brought some ideas; some were accepted; some were rejected; some of the ones that we had they rejected--and we have a pretty good product to bring as part of this rule.  I would ask my colleagues to support the rule so we can bring the bill to the floor, and I thank my colleagues on the Rules Committee for making it happen.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I just want to again respond to my colleague from Wyoming when she again raised the issue as to why our leaders didn't show up to the White It is not because they have a fragile ego. It is because they didn't want to waste their time. It is because they didn't want to be a prop or just be there for a photo op. It is because they are actually focused on trying to do the people's business, and they are tired of the gamesmanship.  If the gentlewoman wants to talk about fragile egos, I would suggest that she observe the behavior of the man who is in the Oval I mean, this is a guy who will get into a Twitter war with a basketball player's father.  I would say that, and I would just respectfully urge my Republican colleagues, now is the time for an intervention because we have serious business to deal with in this country: there are issues of war and peace; there are issues of domestic security; there are issues of economic security that we have to deal with; and instead, we are dealing with constant nonsense coming out of the White So it is time for the Republican majority to intervene and to say to the President, ``Enough is enough.''  Mr.Speaker, you know, for weeks, tax experts have been reporting that the Republican tax plans would raise taxes on millions of middle class families in order to cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations. Their proposed legislation may directly benefit President Trump and his family members to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, according to independent analyses. President Trump has denied this, stating that he would be a bigger loser if the House GOP tax bill is approved.  Well, without his tax returns, we simply have no way of knowing exactly how much President Trump stands to gain from the tax bill. The American people deserve to know whether or not our President is directly benefiting from legislation that would hurt millions of  Mr.Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Eshoo's bill, H.305, which would require Presidents and major party nominees for the Presidency to release their tax returns.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?  There was no objection.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, as I stated earlier, there are so many conflicts of interest in this administration, and especially with this This administration is on a collision course with corruption. It is time for Democrats and Republicans to stand up and to be united and to demand a little sunshine on what the reality is.

726,topic-id,422,"Mr.Speaker, thank you to Chairman Hensarling and Congressman Barr for working with me to make housing more affordable for Arizona families.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.1699, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Manufactured housing is an important form of affordable housing in Arizona, particularly for rural and underserved communities. More than 300,000 families in Arizona live in manufactured homes. Low- and moderate-income families count on manufactured homes as an affordable choice.  Just last week, we had the honor of working with Habitat for Humanity to help Ed, a Vietnam veteran living in Tempe, spread gravel and improve his front yard. Ed first moved to the Valley in 1950 and bought a manufactured home a few years ago.  If Ed wanted to use his VA eligibility to purchase a home, the realtor would be able to connect Ed with a number of lenders who offer VA home loans. However, if Ed wanted to purchase a manufactured home, he would be instructed to go to a table by himself and sift through the countless brochures and loan programs to decide which lender is best. This is a daunting and discouraging process for most borrowers, especially for first-time homebuyers.  Current regulations harm existing manufactured homeowners and potential buyers by curtailing consumer access to manufactured home loans or assistance in the home-buying process. These regulations unintentionally make it more difficult to match borrowers with lenders who can help them in a timely and efficient manner.  H.1699 is a commonsense fix for Ed and the hundreds of thousands of Arizonans who own or are looking to own manufactured homes. The bill ensures that regulations give homebuyers more options, better advice, and greater confidence when buying a new home. The bill also amends the definition of a high cost mortgage and corresponding thresholds to ensure that consumers of small-balance mortgage loans will have the opportunity to access mortgage credit.  It was a privilege to meet Ed and thank him for his service to our country. We should make it easier, not harder, for veterans and fellow Arizonans like him to purchase a home of their choice. I urge members of both parties to join me in supporting H.1699.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.  Pursuant to House Resolution 635, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended.  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.

958,topic-id,437,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.2658, the Venezuela Humanitarian Assistance and Defense of Democratic Governance  I thank Ranking Member Eliot Engel and Chairman Royce for all their hard work and always being there for the people of  Of course, I want to thank the dynamic duo of Eddy Acevedo and Ileana Ros-Even though we are going miss Eddy, I am sure he will continue to fight in the defense of human rights wherever he is.  The situation in Venezuela continues to deteriorate. A country with the world's largest known oil reserves is spiraling into a collapsed state. We have people struggling just to survive. Journalists and citizens risk their lives every day to report what is happening inside Caracas and around the country.  We see that tensions are growing and government security forces shoot first and ask questions later. It is clear that the failed Chavismo policies and the authoritarian actions of Nicolas Maduro have brought all of this pain and suffering upon the Venezuelan people.  Maduro and his cronies continue to get rich as they traffic money and drugs while doing nothing to help the millions of suffering people. Multiple news reports confirm a growing health crisis as people lack access to basic medicines, and reports of infant mortality rates and preventable diseases such as malaria are on the rise.  To hold the Maduro regime accountable, both the Obama and Trump administrations have sanctioned senior officials in the Venezuelan Government for their actions with narcotrafficking, money laundering, and other illicit activities.  There is consensus among the majority of the hemisphere--multilateral institutions such as the OAS, the United Nations, and the European Union--that Maduro is destroying democracy and violating human rights.  These sanctions are not against the Venezuelan people but are carefully crafted and targeted toward the individuals who are committed to destroying the lives of millions of innocent civilians in exchange for money and power.  That is why I am supporting this important and timely legislation that helps to address the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Venezuela and codifies President Obama's sanctions related to corrupt officials in the country. The United States needs to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Venezuelan people and be ready to assist them, while holding the corrupt regime officials accountable.  Once again, I thank my colleagues for all their hard work on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support H.2658.  Before I yield back, I wish Eddy good luck. I thank him for all his hard work. He will be missed. I hate to see that dynamic duo split, but I am sure it will continue to work.

792,topic-id,984,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act was enacted in 1994 as an amendment to the Truth in Lending It is designed to address predatory lending practices in refinancing and home equity loans with high interest rates or fees.  Loans that meet these high-cost triggers are subject to disclosure requirements and limitations on the loan terms. Borrowers are also provided enhanced remedies if it is violated.  Now, the first bill before us, H.1699, would amend the Truth in Lending Act by exempting manufactured home retailers from being defined as mortgage originators. In the process, it would exempt these retailers from important consumer protection rules. That would perpetuate conflicts of interest and restore incentives for these retailers to steer customers into loans with high costs and fees. These are precisely the type of loans that are more profitable for the retailer even though they are bad deals for the customer.  My good friend from Georgia asked what could be wrong with this; how can we protect those customers? I submit: You may not protect those consumers by taking all regulation off for them. Obviously, it was there for a reason, and we will see how it turns out.  Those may seem like arcane changes to existing law, but let me put the issue in better perspective.  According to the Manufactured Housing Institute, 22 million Americans live in manufactured homes today. That is equal to the entire State of                              {time}  1245  Mr.Speaker, why in the world is the majority prioritizing a bill that would undermine consumer protections for tens of millions of We know the legislation would create more access to affordable housing. It would only make the incredibly profitable manufacturing housing industry even more money through predatory lending.  Those who rely on manufactured housing as an affordable option deserve the same antipredatory lending standards as every other family. This bill fails that test. In fact, it was written specifically to take the protections away from the housing industry.  The second measure before us today, H.4182, is completely unnecessary. It would extend the probationary period for members of the Senior Executive Service and members of the competitive service from 1 year to 2. That would double the time that new civil servants are essentially at-will employees without any employee protections or due process rights.  There is no evidence to support the need for doubling the probationary period for Federal employees. The bill would simply serve to delay employees' access to worker protection laws that ensure that they are treated fairly on the job. It would also undermine whistleblower rights and prevent them from coming forward.  These are the people who are essential to getting to the bottom of legal violations and waste and fraud in government agencies. Standing up for their rights used to be a bipartisan priority, but the majority is now prioritizing a bill that would undermine their rights and put the integrity of our Federal civil service at risk.  This comes on the heels of the majority bringing a separate bill, H.3441, to the floor recently. That legislation threatened collective bargaining rights for employees and allows employers to evade liability for wage theft or even child labor violations. And just like the bill before us today, it chips away at workers' ability to do their job without retaliation or unfair treatment.  Mr.Speaker, there is a pattern here. The majority is bringing bills to the House floor that threaten worker protections while they work to advance a procorporate agenda at the same time.  There is perhaps no bigger giveaway on the agenda right now than their tax bill. Under the guise of so-called reform, the majority on the other side of the Capitol is crafting a tax bill that is nothing but a giveaway to the rich and powerful.  And, please, don't take my word for it. On Monday, The New York Times published a piece entitled: ``Senators Scramble to Advance Tax Bill That Increasingly Rewards Wealthy.'' The very first line of the piece gives away the majority's game plan. It said: ``The Republican tax bill hurtling through Congress is increasingly tilting the United States Tax Code to benefit wealthy . . .''  I believe that is beyond dispute by now. In fact, I think every major economist and publication have told us that that is exactly what it is. The scam will raise taxes on tens of millions of middle class families in order to hand deficit-exploding giveaways to the wealthy and corporations that ship jobs overseas. In fact, I heard an economist last night, Jared Bernstein, saying that he thinks this bill encourages moving jobs overseas.  The Republican plan eliminates the alternative minimum tax, which is designed to prevent the very rich from gaming the system. And the bill passed by the Chamber eliminates the estate tax, which will benefit the wealthy, certainly--and very few of them, though, are even liable for paying that tax.  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Congressional Budget Office, under the Republican plan, persons making $40,000 to $50,000 a year would pay an additional $5.3 billion in taxes, combined, over the next decade. At the same time, those earning $1 million or more a year would see a $5.8 billion tax cut.  Note, please, the similarity of those figures. If that isn't taking money from the poor to give to the rich, I don't know of anything that could describe it any better.  This is the third time America has tried trickle-down theory. It didn't work with President Reagan; it didn't work under President Bush; and, certainly, it did not work in There is a word for doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.

802,topic-id,380,"Mr.Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, funding for the government expires on December 8. That is 8 days from now. We wonder why we are wasting time on unnecessary bills before us today and running us toward another shutdown.  Let me remind everyone watching here today about the last shutdown in 2013. The majority shut down the government rather than fund the Affordable Care Act, which was then and remains today the law of the land. The shutdown lasted 16 days. In just that short time, it cost our economy an estimated $24 billion. The shutdown cost the government $24 billion.  Federal facilities were not opened. The mom-and-pop stores and little restaurants in Federal buildings all closed. The processing of veterans' disability claims was stalled. Head Start grantees that serve an estimated 6,300 children were forced to close their doors for 9 days until some private philanthropists stepped in. Hundreds of patients were unable to enroll in possible lifesaving clinical trials at the National Institutes of  Ninety-eight percent of the employees at the National Science Foundation, nearly 75 percent of the employees at the National Institutes of Health, and two-thirds of the employees at the Centers for Disease Control were furloughed. That brought new Federal research to a standstill.  An estimated $4 billion in tax refunds were delayed, denying middle class families the money they expected and planned for. Even the National Transportation Safety Board was impacted, unable to investigate 59 plane accidents as swiftly.  Another shutdown will be devastating, but I am afraid that is what we are headed for under the leadership here.  The President recently tweeted that he doesn't see a deal on the horizon. This comes after he tweeted earlier this year that our country needs a ``good shutdown.''  Instead of doing anything about that here today, we are frittering away precious legislative time on bills that are, at best, not urgent and, at worst, completely unnecessary and even damaging.

This legislation will provide law enforcement's agencies with the resources they need to address mental health issues faced by officers.

Step two: grow a giant, $2.5 trillion debt.  Part of that is to also grow the deficit so we can get to step three: use that to justify cuts to Medicare and Social Security for our seniors.  Our ability to protect our environment for the future, education, infrastructure, research and development, homeland security, and our military all will see cuts if this goes through.  If you are worried about income inequality, this puts that disparity on steroids by charging the credit card and getting rid of popular deductions to boot, and it will ship jobs overseas by lowering the abroad tax rate.

1890,topic-id,589,"Mr.Speaker, I thank our ranking member, Mr.Brady, for his steadfast support on this issue; the chairman, Mr.Harper, who has moved swiftly to address this issue; and also my colleague, Congresswoman Comstock, for bringing this resolution to the floor.  Mr.Speaker, I have been working on this issue since 2014. I am so delighted that we are here today taking up this measure. As we take this up, I hope that we remember that training must be more than an online module. It must be in person, interactive, specific to congressional workplace issues, and taken seriously.  Today's bill is an important step in the right direction, but let's not fool ourselves. It is a baby step. Let us not, to paraphrase Shakespeare, tread the primrose path while leaving survivors to struggle the steep and thorny way to justice.  We are in the midst of a cultural revolution. We are elected Representatives of the American people, and we must not hesitate to do what is needed to fix this broken system.  Seventy percent of those who are sexually harassed never report it. They never report it. One woman came up to me as I was walking the Halls of Congress to thank me. She said that she was on this very floor working late in the evening on a particular bill. A Member came up behind her, grinding up against her, and then stuck his tongue in her ear. That happened on this floor, with Members probably standing around. So we do have a problem, and we must address it.  Unfortunately, due to the system Congress has created to protect itself from being exposed, there has been no accountability. It is now clear that this misguided attempt to protect the institution is instead harming it and leaving victims in its wake.  We work in a very special place, a trusted place, but let me be very clear: we are not special. The outcry for accountability that we are hearing from all corners of the country must be heeded. We are seeing titans of entertainment, news, and every other business be swiftly terminated. Yet, here in Congress, we hide behind due process niceties when, in reality, we have constructed a system that shields us from true accountability.  Did Harvey Weinstein or Matt Lauer receive months of due process before being terminated?  When do we simply believe the victims and provide them a fair and safe process to report and get justice? Then we have got to decide: Is one occurrence worthy of expulsion? Two? Three?  These are thorny issues. We don't like to come down on our friends and colleagues. I get that. But don't we have a moral responsibility to victims, to society at large?  When the CEO of a major company is fired because of sexual harassment, the board of directors doesn't say: Let's wait until the shareholders can meet and decide.  Well, colleagues, our board of directors are the American people, and they are loud and clear. They do not want us to hide behind opaque decisions by the House Administration or Ethics They do not want to pay for our inability to keep our hands to ourselves. They want accountability and transparency, and they want it now.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, but to also join me in taking Congress from a cruel and disgusting joke to a leader in workplace fairness. I know we can do better than this. The American people know we can do better than this. We must rise to the challenge.

232,topic-id,883,"Mr.President, my friend from South Carolina said the proof is in the pudding. I would suggest the proof is in your paycheck. That is what I suggest.  We had a chance yesterday with my amendment to absolutely guarantee that my friends on the other side of the aisle believe what they are saying; that people are going to get a minimum of $4,000 in increased wages. I offered an amendment to simply say that in a couple years from now--2 years from now, 2020, we can make it 2021 or 2025, just pick a day when folks are going to get $4,000 in their wages, and we will put that in an amendment and pass it.  The truth is, there is no guarantee in this bill. If my friends on the other side of the aisle believed that there would be $4,000 more in wages in middle-class families' pockets with this supply-side trickle-down economics tax cut, they would have voted for my amendment yesterday, which simply says that if there is a $4,000 increase in wages, the tax cut continues. If it doesn't, if they don't have $4,000 more in people's pockets, then the tax giveaway stops because all it means is it is adding to the national debt.  I am all for anything that puts money in people's pockets. I have sponsored and voted for tax cuts for small businesses, manufacturers, farmers, and families over the years in public service and here in the Senate, and I want to do that; close tax loopholes that are taking jobs overseas, not increase new ones, which, by the way, this bill does, a new $4 billion tax loophole for oil companies--not closing tax loopholes. If folks really believe this, if they really believe the numbers, let's lock it down. The proof is in your paycheck. That is what families in Michigan are saying. They want to know it is in their paycheck. They want to know it is a guarantee. You know what, they are very skeptical. Because the truth is, in the past, supply-side economics/trickle-down economics has not worked. You say that it is going to trickle down. People in Michigan are still waiting. They are still waiting to catch it. It is not trickling down. We do have examples. What are the facts?  With the tax cut in 1986, 10 years after that, the wages of working people in this country were flat. They did not go up. That is a fact.  With President Bill Clinton in his effort to balance the budget in 1997, I was pleased. I had only been in the House for 6 months and went in and had the opportunity to balance the budget, which we did for the first time in 30 years.  What happened during that process? Actually, taxes on wealthy people were raised a little bit to give a middle-class tax cut and invest in education, which I know our distinguished Presiding Officer cares deeply about, and innovation. What happened? There were 22 million jobs that were created.  Then we went into 2001, 2002 with President George Bush, and there was a big tax cut in 2001, a supply-side/trickle-down tax cut. We were told that it was going to put money in people's pockets. It didn't. It created debt. In 2003, we had another supply-side tax cut that was going to put money in people's pockets. It didn't. It created a huge debt. We had wars that weren't paid for. Then it went into the biggest recession that we have seen outside of the Great Depression with the financial crisis, and 8 million people lost their jobs. People lost the equity in their homes and their pension values. It was terrible.  President Obama came in in 2009 and had to try to begin to dig out of the hole. That is a fact. He began to dig out of that hole and put things back together for folks. It was a big hole, and a lot of families are still feeling that hole. I know that is true in  So part of me may feel a little skeptical when I am hearing: Have I got a deal for you. Let's try supply-side economics one more time, and this time it really is going to create jobs and really is going to put money in your pockets.  There is no proof of that. There is no proof that this grows the economy to be able to cover the costs of the tax giveaways whether you look at supply-side economics, whether you look at new dynamic scoring--the new ways of scoring on things--to make it look better. That didn't even show up. What I[[Page S7677]]would say is that the proof is in your paychecks, for the people who are watching.  There is a lot going back and forth, and it is very confusing because we hear one thing from one side, and we hear the exact opposite from the other. I understand how confusing this is, but I would just ask this:  Why weren't my friends willing to support my amendment that would say that if folks really get the $4,000 minimum amount being promised in increased wages, then this goes on, and if they don't, then the tax giveaway stops? Why didn't they support that?  ",CREC-2017-12-01-pt1-PgS7655-2.txt,1531,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,1,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While mayor, Virg led Lansing through the recession and, despite facing major budget shortfalls, was able to maintain 12 consecutive balanced budgets and produce a budget surplus during each of the last 3 years.  He led efforts to attract new business investments in the city, including a $182 million repurposing of a former electric powerplant into the headquarters of a major national insurance company. He worked to foster regional cooperation and economic development efforts and led the creation of the Lansing Economic Area Partnership, the Lansing area's first regional economic development public-private partnership.  During the automotive crisis, Virg organized Michigan mayors and led a passionate and aggressive defense of the American auto industry, which is one of Lansing and mid-Michigan's backbone industries. He founded and led the Manufacturing Alliance of Communities, a national coalition of mayors that worked to secure Federal support for our automobile industry. Since that time, General Motors has invested more than $1 billion in their Lansing facilities and recently moved production of the Chevrolet Camaro from Canada to the Lansing Grand River assembly plant.  I am grateful for Virg's friendship and congratulate him on his years of extraordinary service. I wish him and his family all the best as he begins this new chapter in his life.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-05-pt1-PgS7844-2.txt,1531,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONTINUED,2017,5,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
539,topic-id,626,"Mr.President, today I wish to remember and pay tribute to Judge Anna Diggs Taylor, who turned her lifelong passion for justice into a highly successful legal career, breaking down barriers for women and people of color and inspiring me and so many others in our  When Anna Katherine Johnston was born in 1932 in Washington, DC, women had very few options. African-American women had even fewer. However, Anna's parents, Hazel Bramlette Johnston--a business teacher--and Virginius Douglass Johnston--a Howard University trustee--deeply believed in the power of education and in their smart, hard-working daughter. When she was in 10th grade, they pulled her from the segregated DC school system and enrolled her in the prestigious Northfield School for Girls in Massachusetts, from which she graduated in 1950.  Her own early experiences with segregation and witnessing how the law could be used as a tool to further equality led her to the legal profession. It wasn't a common career path for women in those days. In fact, when she graduated from Yale Law School in 1957, there were only four other women in her class. About 5,500 women were practicing lawyers in the United States in 1960.  Anna got her chance to join those ranks when Ernest Wilkins, the first African-American man appointed as an Assistant Secretary of Labor, hired her as a staff lawyer in the Office of the In 1960, Anna married Congressman Charles Diggs, Jr., and moved to Detroit, where she had two children and a career, including as an assistant Wayne County prosecutor.  In 1964, her passion for justice led her to Mississippi, where she represented civil rights workers who were jailed for helping register African-American voters. She arrived the same day civil rights activists James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner disappeared, and she became a target of hatred herself when an angry mob yelled racial slurs at her and three other activists as they were leaving the Neshoba County courthouse after trying to question the sheriff.  Over the years, Anna worked both in private practice and in public service, as an assistant U.attorney and managing her husband's congressional office. When she and her husband later divorced, she helped to elect Coleman Young as Detroit's first Black mayor and worked to integrate city government during his administration.  In 1976, Anna married Martin Taylor and worked on Jimmy Carter's Presidential campaign. Three years later, President Garter appointed her to the U.District Court for the Eastern District of She was the first Black woman Federal judge to serve in our State and the first Black Woman chief judge for that circuit. She retired in 2011.  She once said that ``black judges have an important role, especially in staying close to their communities,'' and Judge Taylor did just that. She was deeply involved in community organizations including the Community Foundation for Southeast She was an adjunct labor law professor at Wayne State University, vice president of the Yale Law School Association, and served on the joint steering committee of the gender and racial ethnic fairness task forces for the Sixth Circuit, positions that allowed her to help open the same doors that others had opened for her.  In a biography, Judge Taylor once wrote that her legal career was ``a thousand times more exciting, more intellectually challenging, and more enriching'' than she had ever imagined while at Yale That didn't mean it was easy; breaking barriers never is. Yet she did it. Judge Taylor's life and career will long serve as an example of just how far you can go with hard work, persistence, and a passionate dedication to your ideals.  I think that young girl in a segregated DC classroom would be really proud. I know that many people in Michigan certainly are.  Thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-30-pt1-PgS7559-2.txt,1531,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017,30,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1196,topic-id,1630,"Mr.President, this would put in place a guarantee that middle-class families would receive the benefits they are being promised in this bill. I am offering this motion to[[Page S7537]]commit with the support of Senators Casey, Van Hollen, Udall, Cardin, Booker, Wyden, Menendez, Harris, and  I have said it before, and I will say it again, there is no question we need tax reform. We need tax reform that creates jobs, incentivizes companies to bring back jobs from overseas, protects our farmers, helps small businesses, and puts more money in the pocket of middle-class families in Michigan and across the country. That is what we need, and that is what I would vote for and I know other colleagues on our side would vote for, but that is not what this bill does. That is not what this Republican bill does.  We know our friends across the aisle are in a hurry to pass this legislation as quickly as possible before the American people discover what a bad deal it is. Unfortunately, for Republicans, we keep uncovering new ways that this tax legislation is a huge giveaway for the wealthiest 1 percent. Now we know, from the latest scoring, it blows a huge hole in our Nation's debt, expanding our Nation's debt.  Here are just a few ways this legislation hurts middle-class families. It keeps a loophole that lets corporations write off their expenses, their moving expenses, when they move jobs overseas. However, a family moving across the country to Michigan for a new job could no longer deduct their moving expenses. Big businesses could keep on deducting their State and local taxes, but middle-class families, sorry, no State and local tax deduction for you. Oil companies would enjoy a brandnew $4 billion offshore tax loophole. Merry Meanwhile, 87 million American households who earn less than $200,000 a year get a tax increase. Let me repeat that. Eighty-seven million American households who earn less than $200,000 a year will get a tax increase under the bill in front of us, and health insurance premiums will go up by 10 percent, and continue to go up, while 13 million fewer people would have healthcare coverage.  President Trump has called this bill, in his words, a ``great, big, beautiful Christmas present'' for the American people. Well, I certainly hope the American people remember to keep the gift certificate. This bill is a disaster for the middle class and a disaster for our future.  President Trump isn't the only person who has made big promises about this legislation. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, one of the bill's biggest salesmen, has said: ``On the personal tax side, middle-income people are getting cuts and rich people are getting very little cuts.'' I would like to highlight his first words ``on the personal tax side''--very sneaky language. Once all the proposals that actually help the wealthy are taken into account, all of them, it is clear that those in Secretary Mnuchin's personal income category are the real winners.  White House budget director Mick Mulvaney is making promises too. He said, ``The White House, the President, is not going to sign a bill that raises taxes on the middle class, period.'' I would assume, based on that statement, he wouldn't sign this bill. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that 87 million middle-class and working families will see their taxes go up.  Perhaps the biggest promise of them all came directly from the White ``The average American family would get a $4,000 raise under the President's tax cut plan.''  Republicans have promised hard-working, middle-class families in Michigan and across the country that by giving the top 1 percent and large corporations a huge tax giveaway--you know the trickle-down economic approach--that magically they will receive $4,000, $7,000, even $9,000 in extra income. By giving this big supply-side tax cut, magically, families will receive $4,000, $7,000, or even $9,000 in their income.  Well, the proof is in their paychecks. That is what is going to happen for the American people. They are going to take a look at their paychecks to find out whether this is true, and that is why I am offering a motion that will ensure that the benefits of these tax cuts go to the middle class and that the promises being made to the families in Michigan and across the country will be kept. This motion would send the bill back to the Finance Committee with instructions to include a trigger to return the corporate rate to its current level if the average household wage doesn't go up at least $4,000 in the next 2 years. That seems only fair to me. People are being told over and over again they are going to get money directly in their pocket. The President said a minimum of $4,000. Well, the proof is in your paycheck. That is what the American people are going to be looking at.  This motion simply makes sure the American people get the raise the Trump administration is promising them. If my Republican colleagues are serious about putting more money in the pockets of the middle class, I urge you to support this motion.  You know Michigan families could certainly use an extra $4,000 in their paycheck. What they don't need are broken promises--the kind of promises they have heard before too many times. Just think back to the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. Colleagues from across the aisle came to the floor and said the 2003 Bush tax cuts would ``allow us to grow our way out of our current economic doldrums.'' What did we get? Massive debt. And the Bush tax cuts ``will aid the people and businesses who make up our economic machine and get it moving down the tracks at full speed again.'' We got massive debt, and wages did not go up. The train derailed, growth was anemic, and middle-class families saw very little lasting benefit. If this approach worked, if trickle-down economics worked, I would be supporting this. There is no evidence that this has ever worked.  A new analysis of the tax bill is even more skewed to the top than the Bush tax cuts. Economist Bruce Bartlett served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy during the Reagan and George H.Bush administrations. Last month, when asked if tax cuts pay for themselves through greater economic growth, Mr.Bartlett said:       That's a lie. It's always been a lie. . . . There's not one      iota of evidence that will support this argument.  In fact, he added that wages actually fell--actually fell--for 10 years after the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was enacted.  The Bush tax cuts didn't benefit middle-income families in the long term. The Reagan tax cuts didn't benefit middle-income families in the long term. What they did was cause the deficit to explode. That is a fact. We all know what happened next. Republican colleagues pointed to the huge deficits. President Bush said that now we need to privatize Social Security, cut Medicare because, oh, my gosh, we have big deficits. Thankfully, Democrats put an end to that plan. Well, another distinguished Republican President once said: ``There you go again,'' and that is true.  The recently passed Republican budget resolution makes it clear that their next step after this is to cut Medicare and In fact, their budget already allows almost $1.5 trillion to be cut from these programs. But don't take my word for it. Take their word for it. Earlier this month, Speaker Paul Ryan made the Republican plan very clear. He said: The next thing we are doing is going to entitlements--Medicare and In fact, after the numbers that just came out and the fact that even with dynamic scoring--what many would call ``voodoo scoring''--it doesn't solve the problem on deficits. So it means cutting Medicare and Medicaid may be suggested even sooner.  You have huge tax giveaways to the wealthy 1 percent, which causes the deficit to explode and causes them to cut crucial programs like Medicare and That is the scenario that is in front of us.  I hope people will remember this. This is only step one. When folks come back and say: Oh, my gosh, there is a huge deficit; we have to cut Medicare and Medicaid, they will remember this debate and this time.  Middle-class families see their taxes go up. They see their healthcare costs go up, and they see Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid cut. This is worse than a one-two punch. It is a one-two-three punch, and middle-class families will feel every blow.  Michigan families deserve better than this. American families deserve better than this. American families deserve real tax reform that creates jobs and incentivizes companies to bring[[Page S7538]]jobs back to America by closing loopholes, not creating new ones; that protects our farmers, helps our small businesses, and puts more money in their pocket. That is what I support.  They deserve to be told the truth about the end goal of this Republican tax plan. If Republicans mean it when they say middle-class families will get at least $4,000 more in wages, well then, everybody should be voting for my motion to commit because American working men and women know the proof is in their paycheck. The proof is in your paycheck. The proof is in your paycheck. That is what every single man and woman working today is going to look at--their paycheck.  All I am saying is that, if you are going to tell them there is $4,000 more, then we are going to measure that in the next 2 years. If there is, that is terrific, and if there isn't, this tax scheme should stop.  I yield the floor.

1231,topic-id,444,"Mr.President, in a few minutes, we are going to be voting on a motion of mine that actually dovetails with what the distinguished Senator from Florida was talking about in terms of hard-working people who have been told there will be a minimum of $4,000 put into their wages based on what is being done in the Senate with the Republican tax proposal. We have no evidence of that. In fact, we have no economic scoring that shows that. We have no evidence in the past that has ever been done with supply-side economics. If that is true, at least $4,000 in people's wages is great. I think that is wonderful. We want to guarantee that. We want to make sure the proof is in somebody's paycheck.  I am very pleased to have Senators Casey, Van Hollen, Udall, Cardin, Booker, Wyden, Menendez, Harris, and Brown joining me in a very simple approach that I would hope everybody would support. If you are confident that what is being done here in this supply-side tax cut is going to end up with $4,000 in the pockets of middle-class families, then let's make sure it is true. Let's make sure that happens.  We are going to measure this in 2 years. If it doesn't happen in the next 2 years, then the tax cuts stop. Why? Because all they are doing is blowing a hole in the budget. All they are doing is creating more deficits and not putting money in people's pockets.  I hope everyone will join me. I agree, we have hard-working folks who have[[Page S7545]]seen their wages flat for years. They have seen not only their wages flat but their pensions attacked, and they find themselves in a situation where, yes, they are working, but the wages are down or maybe it is two jobs now instead of one in order to be able to keep the same wage, but they feel like they are treading water and not getting ahead. Folks are talking a lot about that, about wanting to help middle-class families. I have a lot of folks in Michigan who would love to have $4,000, $5,000, $6,000 more in their wages. I would love to support something that does that.  Let me go back and say, it didn't happen under the Bush tax cuts, even under Reagan tax cuts. Wages were flat for the next 10 years. It certainly didn't happen in Kansas with what they did, doing the same kind of supply-side economics. If this could actually work, sign me up.

1763,topic-id,1773,"Mr.I actually am going to speak for a moment about something other than the tax provisions, but I have to say, with my friend from Missouri on the floor--and I do mean my friend from Missouri--that we may not agree on the tax provisions, but we do agree on what I am going to be talking about today, which is community health centers and children's health insurance. I am hopeful that, as the Senator was speaking about new market tax credits--which I support strongly--and historic preservations, they don't get hurt in this process at all. I know there is work to do on this to make sure it doesn't happen, but I appreciate working very closely with my colleague and friend from Missouri on what I want to talk about today.  I rise today to draw attention to the way the Senate majority is failing children and families in Michigan and all across the country. It now has been 60 days--nearly 2 months--since Republicans let funding expire for the Children's Health Insurance Program and community health centers--60 days. It doesn't have to be this way because we have bipartisan support to be able to continue the funding for both of these programs.  We also can't say that we haven't had time. During these 60 days, Republican leadership has found time for us to work on plenty of other issues. They passed their budget. They have taken 75 floor votes. Republicans introduced their tax plan, which is now before us, and we are spending time this week on that. And, by the way, they rewrote their tax plan in a way that would cause 13 million people to lose their health insurance. The Senate has considered 24 nominees, but Republicans haven't taken any action to ensure that the 9 million children who have health insurance from the Children's Health Insurance Program can continue to get medical care, even though we have bipartisan support.  In the middle of all of the division going on right now on the floor, we could bring something to the floor that would have bipartisan support and do the right thing for families and for children and make sure that we are taking away the anxiety that families are feeling now across the country about what is going to happen. There are 9 million children right now at risk because of inaction.  CHIP provides children from low- and moderate-income working families with affordable healthcare. These are families who are working. They don't qualify for other kinds of help. These are working families who sometimes have one job, sometimes two jobs, or part-time jobs, and they trying to hold it together. They want to be able to take their child to the doctor. They want the peace of mind that comes from knowing that if their child gets hurt or if they get sick, they can take them to a doctor.  In addition, the Senate majority hasn't taken any action on another very important community healthcare program to ensure that 25 million people who count on community health centers will continue to have a place to go when they get hurt, when they get sick, to take their child, and to take their parents.  Included among those 25 million patients are 300,000 of our veterans--300,000 veterans--and 7.5 million children that rely on health centers in our communities.  I have often said that healthcare is personal not political. There is nothing more personal than waking up in the middle of the night because your child is crying and they are sick. There is nothing more personal than worrying about whether you are going to be able to get them the care they need. There is nothing more personal than wanting to know that you have a healthcare provider in your community who can help you or a family member manage your chronic conditions--high blood pressure, diabetes, and other things--so that you don't find yourself getting sicker and sicker and sicker.  Healthcare is personal not political, and each one of these 9 million children and 25 million Americans are being personally let down by this inaction.  As I indicated before, it doesn't have to be this way. We can take action today. We have bipartisan support right now, and bipartisan cosponsorship right now. We could stop the divisive debate and take a moment to do something really important for families and children before the holiday season. Right now we can ensure that families and children know that the Children's Health Insurance Program will continue in the new year and that they are going to be able to go to their community health center and get the care they need for themselves and their families.  I was really proud of the fact that Senator Hatch, our distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator Wyden, our distinguished ranking member, and all of us on the Committee came together to put together a bipartisan Children's Health Insurance Program extension for 5 years. It came out of Committee with only one Senator voting no.  I was hoping that it was going to get done right away. Why wouldn't it? It is something that could sail through here. In addition to that, 70 Members of this body, led by Senator Blunt and myself, have signed a letter of support for continuing funding for community health centers. Now, Senator Blunt and I have put in bipartisan legislation with eight other Democrats and 8 other Republicans to extend funding for 5 years.  I know if this came up on the floor, we could get this done today and ease the worries of families that are beginning to get notices across the country that the health insurance for themselves and their children is going to run out.  These programs have long had strong bipartisan support. Why can't we get the action on this that these families and children deserve? Instead, families continue to wait every day--60 days.  I truly thought back in September that this was something that would be enough of a priority that it could get done amidst all the other things that have been brought to the floor of the But now the clock ticks every day--every day. This is wrong. We need to put these children and these families first.  We might be 60 days late, but there is no reason we can't act today or tomorrow--before the end of the week--to make these children and families a top priority.  Before CHIP, too many hard-working families in Michigan couldn't afford to take their children to the doctor. Today, 100,000 children are covered by MIChild, which is what we call our Children's Health Insurance Program--100,000 children.  With all the efforts to provide affordable healthcare that are going on in Michigan right now--successful efforts--97 percent of the children in Michigan today can now see a doctor--97 percent. They are, at the moment, not having to go to an emergency room and wait hours and hours and hours or have their parents try to figure out[[Page S7380]]what they can do to help them when they get sick. So 97 percent of our children can now see a doctor, and that is the highest level ever, and we should be proud of that. That is a good thing.  Yet, unless Congress acts soon, MIChild will begin running out of funding as early as January, which is not very far away. Happy New Lose your health insurance.  January will also be a bad month for Michigan's community health centers. Nearly 20,000 people will lose access to healthcare. Some 20,000 people in Michigan who now are able to go to a community health center would see that access to healthcare go away, with thousands more dropped each month.  Last year, Michigan's community health centers treated more than 680,000 patients--680,000 people--including 12,710 of our veterans. They diagnosed coronary artery disease in more than 21,000 people. Nearly 34,000 Michigan residents were diagnosed with asthma and began to get help. Nearly 140,000 people were diagnosed with diabetes and could get help. All of those health conditions can be managed--we know that--if you have access to a doctor, to nurses, and to medications. You can manage those kinds of chronic diseases. However, they can be deadly if they are undiagnosed and untreated.  Just ask He didn't have a regular doctor after moving to Jackson, MI, from Chicago, but one morning he knew he needed one. He woke up feeling light-headed. So he went to the Center for Family Health, a great facility. They discovered that William's blood pressure was high--so high, in fact, that he was in danger of having a heart attack or a stroke. It took about a year for William's doctors to find the right combination of medications to control his blood pressure, but they were able to do that. He has been getting his care at the Center for Family Health ever since. They literally saved his life.  Emily from Rochester Hills has her own story about the Children's Health Insurance Emily's dad was laid off from two separate jobs within 3 years at a time when her mom was working a part-time job that didn't provide insurance. That is a very common story for a lot of hard-working folks in Michigan as well as across the country. Thankfully, Emily and her brothers and sisters had health insurance through It covered their scoliosis, asthma, a seizure disorder, and typical children's health insurance issues like bronchitis and broken bones. Emily's words are:       The Children's Health Insurance Program was a lifesaver for      my siblings and me. . . . I can't imagine the stress that my      parents dealt with during that time and how we would have      survived so well without the program.  Emily and William know CHIP and community health centers make lifesaving differences for people in Michigan as well as across the country.  We are 60 days late, but there is no time like the present to get this done. We are 60 days late, but we don't have to make it 61. Our children and our families should be put at the top of the list for action, not at the bottom. It is time to make things right for the 9 million children who rely on the Children's Health Insurance Program and the 25 million people who use community health centers.  We shouldn't let one more day go by without acting. We can do this now. There is bipartisan support to get this done, and our children and our families deserve to have this done as quickly as possible.  I yield the floor.

768,topic-id,2092,"Mr.President, I also want to express appreciation to a number of my colleagues and, again, Senator Portman is certainly one of them. We had an important night the other night with regard to the critical passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs I think it is going to be very important legislation to help grow our economy and, finally, get money in the hands of middle-class families and small businesses so we can finally start growing this economy nationally and, back home in Alaska, get my State out of a deep recession that it is in.  There are a lot of Senators who played critical roles. Senators Hatch, Portman, Toomey, Scott, and so many others, but, in particular, I want to thank the majority leader. There is a provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which I think is going to be critical for America and certainly critical for my State, which is to help unlock more of the vast energy resources we have in Alaska, particularly on the coastal plain of the North Slope--what we call the 1002 area of That pass is part of this bill. It is something in Alaska we have been working through in a bipartisan manner. Over 70 percent of Alaskans want to get this done. We have been working on it in Alaska for over 40 years to get this done.  I really want to commend and thank the majority leader, Mitch Over a year ago, he and I sat down to talk about doing this. Every step of the way, his commitment to me and to the people of Alaska to make this happen for my State as well as for our great country--he was there for us.[[Page S7817]]  So I want to thank the majority leader for that firm commitment to helping on an issue that has been critical to Alaskans for decades. We have never realized it. We have a lot more work to do before we get there, both on the tax bill and the 1002 area provision in it, but we are closer. We are closer, in large measure, because of the leadership of the majority leader, and I thank him.  Mr.President, I have been coming to the floor--many of us have been, actually--for the last several weeks to talk about a really important issue for the country; that is, getting administration officials in the Trump administration confirmed by this body. There has been a resistance, a desire to not want to move very qualified people, unfortunately, by my colleagues on the other side. It is just not helping the country.  With each new administration, our great Nation sees a peaceful transition of power. It is a remarkable pillar of American democracy. This doesn't include just the transition with regard to the President and Vice President but also the team of officials in the Federal Government at senior levels who are required to run this country. Good people, whether it is a Democratic or a Republican administration--Republican administration is not always easy to serve--and what we have been trying to do is help this administration find, get nominated by the President, and confirm high-quality American people in these jobs to serve their country.  As a Senator from Alaska, I have had particular focus on Alaskans to serve in positions of the Federal Government, and I will say that the Trump administration has been very receptive to a number of these highly qualified Alaskans who want to serve their country, but, unfortunately, what we are seeing on the other side is just obstruction. They don't want to move people. They never explain it.  I have come to the floor and given this speech several times, and I have asked for the minority leader to come to the floor to explain why they are delaying all of these very well-qualified Americans who want to serve their government. Come to the floor and explain it. Tell the American people why Assistant Secretaries across Federal agencies who have been waiting months to be confirmed by this body, who have been voted out of committee, with big bipartisan numbers, sit and wait and wait and wait. What good is that doing for the country? Come to the floor and explain it. I have been asking them to come to the floor and explain it, and they never take me up on the offer.  So, unfortunately, we know the numbers. At this point, 8 years ago in the Obama Presidency, almost 70 percent--almost 70 percent--of the nominees by President Obama, who won his election, were confirmed by the  Now, I wasn't in the Senate then, but I know my colleagues on this side of the aisle, if they didn't like someone, they could vote against them; they could put a hold on them for a while and get their questions answered. So that is the way it worked. That is normal. Those numbers are about normal. At the same time now, under the Trump administration's Presidency, the Senate has only confirmed 40 percent--40 percent. Now, is that helping the country? It is not helping the country. Do they ever come to the floor and explain why they are resisting? So it is a frustration, and it is not helping the country. We need good people in government.  If this trend continues, with the number of people we need to confirm for the remaining Presidential-appointed positions, it will take us more than 11 years. Let me repeat that--more than 11 years. We all know a Presidential term lasts 4 years.  This is unprecedented. It is unprecedented; go take a look. Yet the other side doesn't want to explain why they are so focused on obstruction. It is certainly not helping the people. The vast majority of these nominees are really well qualified.                      Nomination of Joseph Balash  I want to talk about someone I know really well who is part of this partisan logjam. He is an His name is Joe I am a little biased here; he was my former chief of staff in the But Joe is also the former commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources in Alaska; he was the deputy commissioner. What is the position he has been nominated for? To be the next Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Lands and Minerals--essentially, the Federal official who would be working with Secretary Zinke at the Department of the Interior to oversee Federal lands--minerals, mining, oil, gas, onshore, offshore--for the country. It is a really big job in Alaska; 66 percent of our lands are But this is a huge job for the country and a really important job, as we are trying to take advantage of this new energy renaissance in our Nation, which is great for the Nation, great for jobs, great for foreign policy, great for energy security.  Joe Balash comes super well qualified. The DNR commissioner in Alaska manages one of the largest portfolios of land, oil, gas, water, minerals, and timber of anyplace in the world--in the world.  Nobody doubts that Joe is very well qualified for this position. As a matter of fact, on September 19, Joe's nomination was voted out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee by voice vote, which means unanimously, with the exception of one Senator who said that he wanted to vote no. Every other Senator--it was very bipartisan.  We might not fully agree with all the policies he wants. I was talking earlier about opening the coastal region of the Arctic Slope, the North Slope, in Alaska, which we voted on last week in the Certainly, Joe Balash is supportive of that as an If someone doesn't like that, they should just come down here and vote against him, but he has been put on hold. I have been trying for weeks to figure out why. Who has a hold on him?  I want to compliment the Democratic whip from Illinois, Senator I reached out to him several weeks ago. He mentioned to me that he had a hold on him. He said that there were certain things he wanted to get from the Secretary of Interior in some meetings. So I worked with Senator Durbin and Secretary Zinke, and after those meetings it looked as if it was all good. The Senator from Illinois said to me: We are ready to move forward with him. So I appreciated that; it was very constructive.  As I mentioned, I am not opposed to holds. Sometimes it is important to put holds on administration officials. I did it in the Obama administration. I have done it even for some Trump administration nominees. But what is going on here, after working with the Democratic whip, seemingly clearing out everything--and he thought we were, too--getting ready to move Joe No, all of a sudden, there is a ``secret hold''--a secret hold on Joe He is very qualified for the job, but somebody has a secret hold.  My colleagues on the other side talk a lot about transparency, but this has been months now. Working with the Democratic whip--again, in good faith, and he worked hard and I am complimenting him as much as I can on this. Then someone else decides: No, I am going to keep holding. But I am not going to come down here and say who it is or why or how long they want or what else they want out of the administration or maybe it is a question for Mr. My point is, if Senators want to vote down or oppose a nominee, they should make their opposition known and transparent.  We are going to have a vote here in a couple of minutes. After the vote, I am going to come back to the floor. I could do it right now, but I am trying to be respectful to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, even the secret holder, whoever he or she is. But I am going to come down and make a unanimous request to move Joe Balash forward. We have been waiting for months.  Maybe they don't want to show who the secret holder is, but I really hope my colleagues will come down and will not object. We are going to do this in a little bit, and I am going to essentially try to free Joe I am hopeful that we can agree on that and move this very well-qualified candidate forward. Maybe there is going to be an objection. We will see. I am going to ask for this in about half an hour. But if there is an objection, I certainly hope the secret holder is going to come to the Senate floor, speak to the American people, and say: Here is why I am secretly holding this guy, even though he is very well qualified, even though[[Page S7818]]unleashing the American energy renaissance for the country is great for everybody.  I am hopeful that whoever it is can show a little transparency. Hopefully, they will agree, but if they don't, come on down. Tell us who you are; tell us what the problem is.  We need to put good people in government, whether Democrat or Keeping people out of the government is not helping the American people. That is what is happening here, and, unfortunately, the other side is getting away with it. The media will not write about it, but it is a big problem, and people should be concerned.  Finally, in a couple of minutes, we are going to be voting on Kirstjen Nielsen for a really important job: the Secretary of Homeland It goes without saying how important this job is. Every day, every minute of the day, that Department is trying to protect the American people, and we don't have a Secretary there right now.  I believe she is very well qualified. A number of people have spoken about her qualifications. I had a very good meeting with her on a whole host of issues. I certainly hope my colleagues will vote to move her nomination forward. If they don't like her, if they want to vote against her, great; vote against her. But we need good people in government, and there is no more important position right now in America than the Secretary of Homeland  I encourage my colleagues to please vote to move her nomination and confirmation forward--but no more secret holds.

1246,topic-id,1635,"Mr.President, I want to compliment my good friend from South Carolina who came down here and talked about what this is all about. I couldn't agree with him more. This is about families. This is about American families. He has these poster boards up there showing the American people what this is about. I want to reiterate a couple of points he mentioned.  First, the most important thing we are doing here, the bulk of the relief we are providing in this tax bill is to provide middle-class families with more take-home pay, more money in the pockets of American citizens. That is what Senator Scott just talked about, and I couldn't agree more.  So, on average, right now, our bill would bring the average American middle-class family about a $200 additional amount of money in their pocket per month--per month. Now, some people watching that might think it may not seem like a lot, but it is over $2,000 per year. Every tax bracket that we have right now in the Senate bill would get a reduction.  So I want to echo the words of my good friend from South It is confounding to me that our friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle would deny hard-working Americans that extra money in their pockets. You don't hear them say that, but that is what they are doing, and they would spin and twist the facts to make the public believe the middle class is actually getting a tax increase. The public is getting spun by them.  This would be a tax cut for these families, a significant amount. That is a plain fact.  What is so puzzling about this debate is that those who oppose this bill is trying to deny the Americans who need it--we need it--extra money in their pockets, particularly right now.  I want to talk a little bit about an article I read last year in the Atlantic magazine. It still haunts me. The article was titled ``The Secret Shame of the Middle Class.'' Here is a copy of it, ``The Secret Shame of the Middle Class.'' It says: ``Nearly half of all Americans would have trouble finding $400 in a crisis.''  You often talk about families. Forty-seven percent of American families, according to one Federal study, wouldn't be able to come up with $400 in case of[[Page S7549]]an emergency. This is truly the definition of living paycheck to paycheck. The bill that we are debating helps to address this significantly--more money in the pockets of American middle-class families.  Let me quote from this article. The author says:       It was happening to the soon-to-retire as well as the soon-     to-begin. It was happening to college grads as well as high      school dropouts. It was happening all across the country,      including places where you might least expect to see such      problems. I knew that I wouldn't have $400 in an emergency.  That is the author.       What I hadn't known, couldn't have conceived, was that so      many other Americans wouldn't have that kind of money      available to them, either. My friend and local butcher,      Brian, who is one of the only men I know who talks openly      about his financial struggles, once told me, ``if anyone says      he's sailing through, he's lying.''  That is from this article.  These are our constituents he is writing about. These are the people whom we see when we go home. These are American citizens who need this kind of relief. They tell us they are struggling. They tell us they felt left out of the system and that nobody is listening.  This bill is listening. It is about listening to them. It is about giving them a voice through more economic security.  The other thing this bill does--the other thing that is so important to do in this Congress and the other thing that we should have no issues with bipartisan support for what this bill does--is finally getting our economy back to traditional levels of economic growth--growing our economy, which has been stagnant for well over a decade.  The next chart I have is one that I have come to the floor and spoken about many times. It is an important chart. It shows the levels of economic growth that have occurred year after year in the United States since the Eisenhower administration. It shows GDP growth. Let me explain it a little bit.  It starts with Eisenhower, and then goes to Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush 43, and President These are the numbers. The green is growth. We have a couple of years of 8, 6, 7 percent growth. But the line I want people to take a look at is this 3 percent GDP growth line--3 percent. Now, that is not a great growth rate. It is not a bad growth rate. The average since World War II is closer to 4 percent, but 3 percent is pretty good.  When we look at this chart, and we think about what we are trying to do on the floor here today, it tells a really important story. It is 3 percent every year. Reagan, Bush, Clinton are 4, 5, and 6, and then we get to the Obama years. Actually, we get to the last 10 years we have had, and we never hit it. We had the Bush great recession, and in the entire 8 years of President Obama, we never hit it.  Now, GDP sounds like some kind of technical economic term, but it is really a proxy for the health of our economy. It is a proxy for the American dream. It is a proxy for hope. We have had a sick economy. For over a decade, we have had a sick economy.  One thing that surprises me is how few of our colleagues talk about this. As we have debated the tax bill, a lot of my colleagues on this side of the aisle have been talking about growth--growth, growth, growth--and how we ought to get back to traditional levels of GDP growth--3 percent or higher. It is a bit of a surprise to me that in my little under 3 years in the Senate, I don't know if I have heard any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle come to the floor to talk about this--that this number, below 3 percent is not good for the country. To the contrary, some of them, unfortunately, have bought into what the Obama administration used to tell us: Listen, we can't hit 3 percent. So guess what, America, this is the new normal. We can't expect 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 percent growth. We had years of 7 percent GDP growth during the Reagan era and strong growth during the Clinton era. Don't expect that anymore. The new normal is about 1.5, maybe 2 percent, if we are lucky.  I asked one of my Democratic colleagues this morning: Do you believe in the new normal? Do you? Because that is a surrender. That is a surrender of the American dream.  There has been a lot of talk over the last year about what makes America great. This is what makes America great--strong economic growth. We haven't had it in over a decade.  This tax bill, we believe, is going to spur economic growth. That is another reason why it is so important--families' take-home pay and finally getting back to traditional levels of strong, robust economic growth that has enjoyed bipartisan support from every President since the end of World War Yet, somehow, on the other side of the aisle, they don't want to talk about it. Well, to me, it is the most important thing we are doing here.  So how do we do it? There is tax reform, certainly, and also energy policies that unleash our opportunities, infrastructure, and regulatory reform. But we have to get out of this lost decade.  I want to go back to that ``Atlantic'' article I mentioned. The author talks about the fact that people don't have the money they once did because of this--because we are not growing; because the strongest economy in the world, for the last 10 years, is sick.  The author says: ``In the 1950s and '60s, American economic growth democratized prosperity.''  Everybody had opportunity with strong economic growth. That is what he is talking about right here. Then he says: ``But, in the 2010s, we have managed to democratize financial insecurity.''  We went from democratizing prosperity for families to democratizing financial insecurity, where almost half of the American people don't believe they have $400 in an emergency. Yet my colleagues don't want to provide a tax cut for middle-class families who are struggling.  What we need to do is to end this democratization of financial insecurity and get back to prosperity and get back to traditional levels of GDP growth through tax reform, through energy, through infrastructure, and through permanent reform. We can do it.  Any American watching: Please don't believe this idea of the new normal, that we will never get back to these strong rates, that somehow our future is destined to be below this 3 percent line. Don't believe it. What we need are policies that can get us there.  That is why I am hopeful still that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are going to join us in promoting this tax reform that will do one of the most important things we can do--get the U.economy growing again. Families will benefit, middle-class families will benefit, hard-working Americans will benefit, our economy will benefit, and our national security will benefit, but we need to act. We can't accept this.

937,topic-id,458,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, since 2014, the Veterans' Affairs Committee has held countless hearings focused on VA medical centers that were found to have covered up wait times or failed to consistently provide high-quality healthcare to veterans.  Many of these failures were first brought to light by whistleblower allegations and were later substantiated by Government Accountability Office studies and VA inspector general investigations. Solutions to these failures were only uncovered through multiple inspections of medical centers' facilities, their policies, and their employees.  Congress relies on the hard work of medical inspectors and investigators at the VA, the OIG, and the GAO to review allegations and issue recommendations regarding how VA and Congress should work to correct deficiencies at medical centers and hold VA officials accountable. With limited resources, the inspector general and the GAO have completed a staggering number of investigations and reviews that have led to significant reforms of the VA system. They should be commended for their excellent work.                              {time}  1400  The Enhancing Veteran Care Act gives the Secretary another tool for developing solutions to problems at VA medical facilities. The VA Secretary should be able to contract with nonprofit-nongovernmental medical inspectors or auditors when deemed appropriate.  However, I strongly believe that granting the VA Secretary the authority to contract with nongovernmental inspectors and auditors should not result in cuts to the IG's or VA's budgets. We need to ensure VA inspectors and the VA OIG have the resources to continue their thorough and timely investigations.  I am also concerned about these nongovernmental organizations not being required to follow Federal laws that require transparency. I believe these nongovernmental bodies should be held to the very same level of transparency as the IG, GAO, and VA investigators, including requirements to publish their methods for conducting audits and reviews alongside their findings and recommendations. Without transparency, Congress and the public will not have the same level of confidence in their findings.  If we had the opportunity to consider this legislation in committee, we could have received testimony from VA, the IG, and GAO on this legislation and done more to address concerns around transparency, while also ensuring that investigative efforts are not duplicated. I encourage the chairman to continue his inclusive approach by seeking to bring all veterans related bills through committee for due consideration.  However, these concerns will not prevent me from supporting the Enhancing Veteran Care I trust the Secretary will execute this authority in a manner that supports and supplements government-led investigations.  Veterans should have full confidence that they will receive high-quality healthcare at VA facilities. Rigorous and transparent investigations and audits will help guarantee these high standards are met.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

1169,topic-id,832,"Mr.President, I want to go back to what this motion does. This is to remand the bill back to the Finance Committee so it can come back without adding nearly $1.5 trillion to the national debt--maybe a heck of a lot more than that.  I am in business too. I will tell you that if I ran my business and did the things in my business that this bill is doing, I would go out of business. Why? Because my kids wouldn't be able to afford to stay farming because I would have acquired too much debt. That is why this is so important. It is why I applaud Senator King for bringing this motion forward.  I sat on this floor, and I listened to folks talk about the threat from North Korea, which is absolutely real. The money it is going to take to deal with that threat is not going to be cheap.  I come to the floor, and I listen to people talk about the national security interests of this country and how there are people who want to do bad things to our country. We have to keep our country safe, but it comes with a cost.  I heard Senator King talk earlier today about rebuilding our military. We have been at war for 16 years, and there is a cost it is going to take to rebuild our military. All of those things take money. They are expenses of what we have to do here to keep this country secure.  It is absolutely incredible to me that we have people walk to the floor and talk about a 38-percent effective rate. Everybody on this floor that is in business knows that is not the rate that corporations pay in this country. By the time you do your deductions, your effective rate is far less than that. In fact, some people feel it is about 20 percent.  But nonetheless, I will agree--I think both sides of the aisle can agree--that we need to do tax reform. We need to modernize our code. It hasn't been done in 30 years, but it can't be done in a way that adds $1.5 trillion on to our kids.  Right now, we have a $20 trillion debt. There is no doubt about that. That is $63,000 for every man, woman, and child in this country. When I sat in that chair that the Presiding Officer is sitting in now, when I first got elected some 11 years ago, I heard folks from that side of the aisle talk about the debt every single day. After the 2014 election, it has been crickets on that side of the aisle when it comes to the debt. The debt is still real.  When we had the biggest meltdown in this country since the Dirty Thirties, we had to make an investment into this country. I had people in the construction business in my office with tears in their eyes saying: There is no work in the private sector. You have to do something to help stimulate this economy or things are going to go to heck.  Times were tough. The debt increased. We had to get the economy turned around.  Now, times are good. For all the folks who are in business--or at least claim that they are in business--in good times, what do you do? You pay down your debt. You save. You make a rainy day fund because you know it is not always going to be like this.  Instead, in this body, we say times are good, but we are going to add another $1.5 trillion on the debt. Just do it. Our kids can worry about it. Hell, we will be dead and gone.  That is why this motion is so critically important--so we can send it back to finance; so that there can be a true bipartisan discussion in committee about what needs to happen with this bill and to have it come back so it is revenue neutral. We can do that. We can help push the economy forward, and we can help have a bright future for our kids, but we are not going to do it with this bill. We are not going to do it with a partisan bill like this is right now.  So I want to commend Senator King for pushing this motion forward to remand this bill back to the Finance Committee so that they can bring it back in a revenue-neutral position. We can cut taxes. We can broaden that base without adding to the debt, and we need to do it. We need to do it for our kids--the same reason that most of us claim we are here. We are here to make sure we have a better future for our kids and our grandkids. Let's do it with this bill. Let's walk the walk, not just talk the talk.[[Page S7533]]  I yield the floor.

1769,topic-id,1091,"Mr.President, I have long supported efforts to reform the Tax Code--tax reform that gives a break to working-class Americans and small businesses so that they can create more jobs and keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets, tax reform that provides permanent, long-term certainty for job-creating businesses and middle-class families so that they can plan for the future, and tax reform that doesn't burden future generations with loads of debt. Unfortunately, the bill that we are going to vote on this week is not tax reform.  The majority and the administration can call this proposal whatever they want, but from where I come from, which is north central Montana, we call it how we see it. This is a tax giveaway to the wealthy--a tax giveaway that will cut taxes for the wealthiest families while raising taxes on nearly 14 million middle-class This tax giveaway benefits wealthy out-of-staters at the expense of hard-working In fact, folks making less than $30,000 a year will see a tax hike in 2019, and folks making less than $40,000 will see a tax hike in 2021. That pattern continues climbing until every individual will see a tax hike in 2025.  Why is this important?  We haven't done tax reform in 30 years, and 2025 will be here tomorrow. A tax break for the wealthiest will continue not only to add to our debt, but it will continue to take money out of the pockets of hard-working middle-class families. All the while, the large corporations will enjoy permanent tax giveaways.  It doesn't have to be like this, but the majority has chosen, once again, to write a bad bill in secret--no bipartisanship, no input from working families, no regard for how this bill is going to impact folks down the road. This tax giveaway to the wealthy reeks of the swamp, and it represents everything that folks hate about Washington,  So why are we rushing this process?  During the Reagan tax cuts in the eighties, the House and the Senate combined to hold over 20 committee hearings before bringing a bill to the floor. Why was there no public input in this process today? Why aren't we waiting for final estimates from the Joint Tax Committee to let us know what the impacts will be? Why don't we know what the long-term impacts--past the first 10 years--are going to be? Why are we voting before we have analysis on what happens to those folks 12, 14, 16 years from now? Why are we voting on a bill before we have even had time to read it?  There is an appetite in this Senate for good tax reform--a tax bill that will cut taxes for middle-class families and small businesses and will not add to the debt, a bill that will actually drive our economy. I don't understand why folks in this body are rushing to pass this tax giveaway that is going to hurt the folks who need a tax cut the most. This is not the first time we have been down this road. Next year, nearly one-third of our national debt will be a direct result of the Bush tax cuts--over $5.6 trillion. Yet here we are again, a decade later, and we are about to make the same mistake.  Most folks who serve in this body will say that they came here to provide more opportunities for the next generation, that they came here to work on bills and pass bills that will help our kids and our grandkids succeed. I am here to tell you that actions speak louder than words. This bill saddles our kids and our grandkids with even more crushing debt by adding, at a minimum, $1.4 trillion to the debt. Why? It is so that we can give tax giveaways to the wealthy and big corporations and so that some politicians can claim a political victory. If you vote for this bill, you are putting $1.4 trillion on the credit card that our kids and our grandkids are going to be forced to pay. That is a fact. Where are the deficit hawks? Where have they flown? My, how times have changed.  We can do better than this. Our kids and our grandkids deserve better than this. Hard-working families in this country deserve better than this. We need to do the right thing and pull this bill from the floor and work together in a truly bipartisan way to pass real tax reform--get public input, get support from both sides of the aisle--and get a bill that Democrats, Republicans, and, as far as that goes, Independents can support.  The truth is apparent. The other side of the aisle doesn't want to be bothered by differences of opinion or public input, so we end up with a poorly written bill that doesn't do what it is advertised to do. Let's help businesses create more jobs and raise wages, and let's make sure that hard-working folks can keep more of their money in their pockets. That is the kind of tax reform that America deserves. Instead, we are stuck with a partisan gimmick that makes the rich richer while the rest of us pay the bills.  I am voting no on this bill, and I am voting no for Montana's kids and grandkids. I encourage my colleagues to take a look at this bill, by the way, that we don't even have yet. Take a look at it, what is there, and vote no to avoid, at a minimum, a trillion and a half dollars being added to our national debt.  When I go home, one of the things that folks ask of me is to work together--to work together and find bipartisan solutions. Don't just cast off those on the other side as being wrong. Listen to them. Try to find that middle ground. That hasn't happened here with this bill. Anything but that has happened. We have a bill that has been crafted by one party in secret and has been put in front of us, and they have said: Take it or leave it. We don't even know the impacts of this bill, and they don't know the impacts of this bill. Once this passes, it will be too late. This is the most deliberative body in the world. We ought to do a little deliberating and get some public input and find bipartisan support and move forward with a bill that works for  I yield the floor.

173,topic-id,3102,"Mr.President, we are about to embark upon a vote that I think will be historic, a once-in-a-generation opportunity, in my view.  The last time we did major tax reform in this country was 1986, 31 years ago. Believe it or not, I happened to be a staffer here back then. Although my boss was not on the Senate Finance Committee, I was the tax LA in the office, and so I had the opportunity, in a very small way, to be a part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, which at that point was landmark legislation, very historic, very far-reaching, and had a profound impact in a positive way on the economy.  Well, here we are 31 years later--long overdue, I might add, to get to the point where we once again can do something fundamentally about a tax code that is completely outdated, completely antiquated, and puts us at a competitive disadvantage with countries around the world with whom we have to compete. So we have an opportunity today--and we will have an amendment process here that will get started very soon in which Members will have an opportunity to lay down their amendments, to debate them, and to get them ultimately voted on, but when it is all said and done, I believe we will have a final product that moves us fundamentally in a different direction when it comes to our tax policy, in a direction that is good for jobs, that is good for growth--economic growth--and that is good for wages in this country for hard-working families and people who have been living paycheck to paycheck for a really long time.  We didn't get here overnight. There has been a lot said about how this is all of a sudden rushed to the floor. I have to tell you that I got on the Senate Finance Committee in 2011, and since 2011 when I joined the committee, we have had 70-plus hearings on tax reform. We have had 70 hearings examining different aspects of the tax reform, listening to recommendations about how it might be changed, how it might be modernized, how it might be updated, and how it might be improved. It has been a long, methodical process to get us to where we are today.  Two years ago, in 2015, the chairman of the committee, Senator Hatch, created five working groups, and each of the working groups had a specific area of responsibility to look at different elements of the Tax Code and come up with a series of recommendations for how it might be improved. I was privileged to chair one of those working groups, along with Senator We had both Democrats and Republicans participating in that process.  At the end of it, each of the working groups submitted recommendations, many of which, I might add, are included in the mark we are going to be voting on later today. A lot of those ideas came from those bipartisan working groups. So there are a lot of Democratic and Republican ideas that have been incorporated into this legislation.  I would hope, in the end, that there might be some Democrats who ultimately will vote for it. But I think it is important to note, for those who believe that perhaps this was somehow rushed in here, that there has been a lot of thought over a long period of time. There were not only months but years--literally years--of work that has gone into bringing us to where we are today.  When the bill was introduced--the mark was put out there by the chairman--that put in place a process in the committee where we had a markup. So we spent 23 hours over several days marking up the bill. We voted on 63 Democratic amendments in all 69, or thereabouts, amendments on the bill while it was being marked up before it was reported out here to the floor.  Since it was reported out of the committee, there have been a number of changes that have been made in response to concerns and issues that have been raised by individual Senators on both sides of the aisle. And that brings us to where we are today.  I say that by way of context to let people know that this has been a long process--an arduous process, I might add--and frankly one that is really overdue. I happen to believe profoundly that it is high time that we undertake the important work of readapting and readjusting our tax policies to reflect an economy and a marketplace that is very different from the last time this was done in 1986.  So that gets us to where we are today. In trying to figure out how to modernize, how to update our Tax Code, there are a couple of things that clearly needed to be dealt with. One is that we have a tax system that has the highest rates among businesses in the industrialized world. We have a 35-percent rate for corporations. When we look at every other industrialized country around the world--look at the OECD average; it is down around 22 percent. A number of countries have gone well below that. We continue to hemorrhage jobs and businesses and profits to other places around the world because our tax rate, our Tax Code, frankly, isn't competitive.  We operate in what is known as a worldwide tax system in which not only do you pay a tax in a country in which the income is generated, but you also pay a tax when it comes back into the United States at the higher level, at the 35-percent rate. So that also had to be adapted, and we are moving now more toward what is called a territorial tax system in which the income is taxed in the jurisdiction in which it is generated. I believe that will make us a much more competitive economy globally and make America a much more attractive place to do business.[[Page S7664]]  We get the corporate rate, the business rate, down to 20 percent. And when I say businesses, that is what we call C corporations. There is a slightly different treatment for passthrough businesses. Those are your partnerships, LLCs, and sole proprietorships, things like that. But we also significantly reduce rates on small businesses. We believe that is important to growth. This needs to be a pro-growth bill. We want to grow our economy at a faster rate because a faster growing economy, an economy growing at rates that are more normal to historic averages, means that we are creating better paying jobs. That means we are lifting wages in this country.  Wages have been flat for so long. For the last decade or so, the American people have rarely had anything that could be characterize as a pay raise. That is why we needed to update our business tax rates, our business tax code, so that we can get the economy producing and growing at a faster rate to generate those good-paying jobs and provide higher wages to American families and American workers. We believe this bill does that.  I think the changes that have been made in addition to lowering the rate--allowing for expensing of capital investments allows businesses to recover their cost of investment faster, accelerate that cost recovery, which enables them to get that capital they can use to expand and grow their operations and thereby, again, create those better-paying jobs. Those are key changes that are fundamental to greater economic growth, better jobs, and higher wages in our economy.  There have been a lot of analyses and studies that have been done that demonstrate how, in fact, that might work. If you look at what the President's Council of Economic Advisers says, they suggest that lowering the rate on businesses will generate $4,000 in additional average household income on an annual basis. That is an additional $4,000 in the pockets of families in this country as a result not just of the tax reductions, which I will get to in just a moment, but the changes we made on the business side of the code generate an additional $4,000 annually per household. There is another study out there by Boston They conclude that it would increase the average household income by $3,500, which is slightly less than $4,000.  It is safe to say that families in this country, households in this country, and people in this country are going to benefit, because when you create a more favorable environment, favorable conditions for investment and creating jobs, you get competition for labor. Competition for labor raises the price of labor. When the price of labor goes up, companies have to pay higher wages. That means bigger paychecks for American workers. That is precisely what these particular studies have shown.  Let me say, too, because I think that as I have listened to our colleagues on the other side--they consistently make the argument that somehow these are tax cuts for the rich, which I don't think is any surprise. That is normally what they say anytime we have a debate about reducing taxes.  My experience here, in the time I have been in Washington, both as a Member of the House of Representatives and now as a Member of the Senate, has been that, generally speaking, Democrats like to grow government. We like to grow the economy. We believe the best way to lift all boats--to generate better paying jobs, to improve the quality of life and standard of living for American families--is to get a stronger economy that is creating those better paying jobs and raising wages in this country.  Suffice it to say that our colleagues on the other side have attacked this bill, as they do most bills. This is no exception. Most of the attacks are on reform bills for delivering too much relief to high-income earners. I have to say that I take issue with that because I think, if you look at the actual content, the substance of the bill, you will come to a very different conclusion.  I said this before, and I mean it sincerely: I hope people don't take it from me. Sit down and look at your own tax situation. Plug in the changes that we are making here, and find out if you come out better or worse than you are today.  I will tell you that if you look at the average family of four with a combined annual income of $73,000, you are going to see that they are going to see a $2,200 tax cut. A $2,200 tax cut is what your average family of four making $73,000 in this country is going to see. What does that represent to them? That is a 60-percent reduction, a 60-percent tax cut relative to what they are paying today under current law.  By reforming the Tax Code and putting these changes in place, the average family of four with a combined annual income of $73,000 will see a $2,200 tax cut or about a 60-percent reduction in what they are paying today. Why does that happen? Well, it happens because we are making some changes that provide significant relief in the Tax Code relative to families when they file their taxes.  The first, of course, is we double the standard deduction. The standard deduction is the amount that people can deduct from their income right away, from their adjusted gross income. That lowers the amount that is actually taxable to start with. Under our legislation, the standard deduction for both married couples and those who are filing single--they actually get a doubling of the standard deduction.  The second thing we do in our bill--and if you are raising kids, this will dramatically reduce the tax burden you will have--is we double the child tax credit, which under current law is $1,000 per child. Under this legislation, that will double to $2,000 per child.  The other thing we do is we lower rates. We have a significant rate reduction through all the different brackets in the code.  The combination of doubling the standard deduction, doubling the child tax credit, and lowering rates means that middle-income families are going to pay less in taxes.  We think we have found the right balance in designing a bill that delivers tax relief to hard-working, middle-income families in this country. At the same time, we are reforming the business side of our Tax Code in a way that unleashes our economy and unleashes those job creators and a lot of that investment that has been sitting on the sidelines and allows our small businesses and our larger businesses to expand their operations, and as they do that, they will have to hire more workers and pay those workers higher wages.  We think the combination of those features of this bill makes this a bill that is very beneficial to middle-income families in this country. Those are just a few of the features of the bill that lead to, as I said earlier, an average tax cut for a typical family of four of $2,200 or about a 60-percent reduction over what they are currently paying.  As we have listened to the debate from the other side, they attacked it as being a tax cut for the rich. They attacked it for being rushed out here. They attacked it for being a windfall for corporations. It is very predictable. There is nothing new in any of these arguments. I have been around here long enough to know in advance what the other side is going to say. But in this case, these arguments simply don't comport with reality. They just don't fit the facts. They don't fit the data.  With respect to the issue of who pays, we pay a lot of attention--and we should--to tax burdens in this country. One of the things this legislation we will be passing today does is it maintains in the law the progressivity in our Tax We have the most progressive Tax Code, I would argue, in all the world. So we paid very close attention to this to make sure that the tax burden, when all is said and done, doesn't change very much from where it is today. So people of different income groups, income categories, continue to pay similar burdens to what they are paying today.  What this shows is that those in the $20,000 to $50,000 category today pay about 4.3 percent of the entire tax burden, the taxes collected in this country. People who earn between $20,000 and $50,000 pay about 4.3 percent. Under our legislation, that will go down to 4.1 percent. Those in the $50,000 to $100,000 category--earners in that group today pay about 16.9 percent of all the taxes collected. That is their share of the tax burden. Under this legislation, that will go down to 16.7 percent. Again, that is a slight reduction in the overall tax burden relative to what they have today. Those making $100,000 or more[[Page S7665]]actually will see their taxes tick up a little bit--not a lot but a little bit. They are currently paying 78.7 percent of the tax burden in this country, and that will go up to 78.9 percent. So those at $100,000 or more are paying almost 80 percent of all the taxes that are paid or collected in this country today, and that number is very similar to what it would be--up a little bit. But that is really the only category that is going to pay more relative to what they are paying today.  To me, that is a demonstration, clearly, of how--when we went through this process, we committed to ensuring that there was fairness in the code, and we paid attention to the tax burden to ensure that people continue to pay their fair share and that particularly those in the upper income categories pay their fair share.  Another argument that has been made by our colleagues on the other side--which is interesting to me because it is a revelation to many of us that all of a sudden they are concerned about deficits--is that somehow this is going to blow up the deficit. Well, we did allow for a net tax cut in this. There is about $5.5 trillion of tax cuts overall, about $4 trillion of which is offset by what we call base broadeners, or killing and getting rid of preferences and loopholes and deductions in the code, and the balance of which will be made up through economic growth. There are debates about how much growth will occur in the economy, but I think it is fair to say that this is going to grow the economy.  Even the Joint Committee on Taxation, which uses numbers that, to me, are completely inaccurate--I mean, it is hard to feature that over the course of the next decade, our economy isn't going to grow at more than 1.9 percent, but that is what they assume. Just by way of example, over the last two quarters, it has grown to 3.3 and 3.1 percent. If we can continue to build on that, we will more than pay for and have lots of revenue left over when this is all said and done. So if you assume modest amounts of economic growth--about two-tenths, three-tenths of 1 percent of additional growth in the economy per year--it more than covers what we are talking about here in terms of the shortfall of forgone revenue associated with this tax legislation.  We have a bill that is based upon reasonable assumptions about growth. We have a bill that, if our economy really does pick up--and I believe it will if we put the right policies in place that encourage investment, track investment into this country, and provide the right incentives for businesses to expand their operations--we will see an entirely new economy where 1.9 percent growth, which has become the normal for too many people--there are too many people in this country who don't know anything but 1.9 percent growth. We can do so much better than that. This is America, the greatest economy on the face of the We ought to be able to get up to that 3 to 3.5 percent growth rate. If we do, this economy will take off, American businesses will start, entrepreneurs will start creating jobs, and we will have higher wages and bigger paychecks for American workers.  I hope we get a ``yes'' vote later today on this.  I yield the floor.

199,topic-id,1209,"Mr.President, our country has always been about opportunity. The American dream is the hope that your kids and your grandkids and those who come after you will have a better life than you have had. One of the ways we do that is that we get a growing, expanding economy that creates better paying jobs, more opportunity, and higher wages. When you get higher wages, you improve that standard of living, and you improve that quality of life. That is what Americans aspire to. That is what all American families--moms and dads--aspire to for their kids and those who are going to come after them.  I would say to our colleagues on the other side, who, like I said, have a newfound interest in deficits and debt, that one of the ways in which you deal with deficits and debt is to grow the economy. When you get an expanding economy that is creating better paying jobs, more people are working, more people are investing, more people are taking realizations, and more people are paying taxes. What history has shown is that when you have a vibrant, growing economy, you get more government revenue.  Of course, the official scorekeepers, whether you use the Congressional Budget Office or the Joint Committee on Taxation, both agree that you are going to get more revenue when you get more growth in the economy. There might be a slight difference of opinion about how much. The CBO, I think, says that for every one-tenth of 1 percent increase in the GDP, you see an additional $273 billion in tax revenue that is generated over a decade or, to put it a different way, almost $3 trillion for every percentage point increase in gross domestic product.  If you want to get serious about dealing with America's fiscal problems, you have to restrain spending, which there hasn't been much appetite for around here in the time that I have been here. You also have to get the economy growing and expanding. That is what this exercise--what we are going through here in reforming our Tax Code--is really all about, because 2-percent growth is not good enough.[[Page S7669]]This 2-percent growth is not and should not be the new normal for the American economy.  That is what we have had for the last 8 years. During President Obama's entire time in office, we didn't have a single year--not 1 year--in which the GDP was more than 3 percent--not 1 year. If you go back historically--literally to the end of World War II, about 1948--and roll forward to today, the average in the American economy has been 3 to 3.5 percent, but there has not been a single year in the last 8 years in which we have had 3 percent growth in the economy.  What does that mean?  That means that, without that kind of growth, businesses are not expanding. They are not investing, they are not hiring new workers, they are not paying those workers more, and you end up with flat wages. We have had, literally, a decade now of flat wages, where American families and individuals have not seen any growth in their incomes.  What we hope to accomplish through all of this will be changes made to the Tax Code that will increase investment through lowering rates on businesses, allowing them to recover their costs of investment faster, and accelerating their cost recovery. Those are changes--those are reforms in our Tax Code--that will help unleash this economy and get us back, closer to normal, when we were creating those good-paying jobs. Then, we can start doing something, at the same time, about spending around here, and we will start seeing those deficits go down. The best thing that can happen for the American economy, the best thing that can happen for the American family, and the best thing that can happen for the American worker is to have a growing, vibrant economy.  To my colleagues on the other side who consistently get up and say there is no benefit to this that will be delivered to middle-income families in this country, again, I will say what has already been said by my colleagues from South Carolina and from Pennsylvania, which is to look at a typical family of four with a combined annual income of $73,000, who under this tax cut bill will receive a tax cut of $2,200--a 60-percent reduction over what they are paying today under current law. That is what that average family of four will see.  Now, the Senator from Colorado said that he doesn't believe that Colorado Republicans are for this. I can tell you who is going to be for this--the people, the families, who get the $2,200 tax cut. That is $2,200 they are going to have in their pockets.  You heard my colleague from South Carolina talk about that family that lives paycheck to paycheck or about that single mom who wants a better future for her kids. How do we help them? One of the ways we help them is to reduce the burden--the take--that their government takes from them every single year and to allow them to keep more in their pockets. Let's give them bigger paychecks, and let's let them decide how to spend the money.  That is a fundamental difference that we have had around here for a long time. We come here believing that the way you help American families is to start growing the economy rather than growing the government, allowing the American people to make decisions that are in their best interests and in the best interests of them and their families about how they want to save for retirement, how they want to help their kids get college educations, how they want to improve their lives, rather than sending the money to Washington, DC, and letting Washington spend it. That is, fundamentally, the difference, I think, that we are talking about here.  As to the arguments that have been made by the other side, they just aren't based on facts. The data tells a different story as the Senator from Pennsylvania pointed out. Look at the chart. Look at the percentage of tax cuts. Who benefits? We have worked very, very hard on this bill to maintain progressivity in the Tax Code so that we have tax relief delivered to those hard-working American families, to those hard-working American taxpayers who need a break, who are living paycheck to paycheck.  Honestly, I hope, when this is all said and done, that not only will we be able to pass this bill but that, maybe, we will get a few Democrats who might decide that it will be in the best interests of their constituents to help their families and their States realize more income in their pockets and bigger paychecks and, hopefully, an opportunity to live out their versions of the American dream for them, for their kids, and for their grandkids. That is what the American experience and the American dream are really all about. When we take more and more here in Washington, DC, that means that American families have less with which to help themselves and to plan for their futures.  Our time has expired.

215,topic-id,835,"My recollection is like his, and, frankly, my recollection, when it comes to all the work that went into getting us to where we are dates back a long way. I joined the Senate Finance Committee in 2011. I am not sure when the Senator from South Carolina joined or the Senator from Pennsylvania, but it was shortly after that, I think.  Since I have been on the Finance Committee, we have had 70-plus hearings--70-plus hearings on tax reform. We have looked at every facet, every aspect, every element of the Tax We even went so far 2 years ago, in 2015, to create five working groups. We all participated in those, along with, I might add, our Democratic colleagues, each of whom had a key role in helping with the final recommendations that were put forward. A lot of what is in this bill is based upon the work that was done by those working groups. There isn't a single shred of the Tax Code that we haven't covered and haven't studied in great detail.  Then, of course, as the Senator from South Carolina pointed out, when it came time to mark the bill up, we spent several days--23 hours debating back and forth, listening to each other, and in some cases arguing. In some[[Page S7673]]cases, those were very spirited arguments. The Democrats offered 63 amendments, all of which got votes in the Senate Finance  So for anybody to suggest that this has been anything but a transparent process based upon years of work and buildup and lead-up to get us to where we are today is absolutely misstating the facts. I think the work we have done in advance of this has led to a product that is the culmination of a great deal of thought, a great deal of input, and a great deal of research from not only experts in the field but fellow Members--Democrats and Republicans--Senators and staff--who have gotten us to where we are today.  I think the fact, which has been pointed out many times, that a family that is living paycheck to paycheck will now get the benefit of a doubling of the standard deduction and a doubling of the child tax credit, frankly, I happen to believe--contrary to my colleague from Pennsylvania--is a pretty big deal. If you are a family who has any sort of tax liability, that tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar credit against that tax liability. An increased portion of that is refundable under this legislation.  If you look at the lower rates we have in the bill, that middle-income family in this country stands to benefit significantly as a result of this to the tune of--if you are a family of four with a combined annual income of $73,000--an additional $2,200 in your pocket. That is $2,200 in the American family's pocket that they get to decide how to spend.  As the Senator of Pennsylvania pointed out, don't take our word for it. You can sit down, if you like to, and look at the features of the bill. Look at your individual tax situation. Plug in these changes, and I think you will find you are going to see a pretty significant reduction in your tax liability.  When January rolls around when this passes, people will get their check. When they look at their withholdings, they will realize they have a lot more money. That paycheck is bigger. The paycheck is going to be bigger. Why? The amount taken out in terms of Federal taxes is going to be significantly smaller. That is a good thing for the American family.  That is why this debate and the bill we have before us are so important, not only to those families who are trying to build a stronger, brighter, and more prosperous future for themselves and their families but also for this American economy. With the other changes that are made in the bill, it is going to lead to better paying jobs and higher wages that are going to lift the boats of all  Americans haven't had a pay raise, literally, in about the past decade. We haven't had a single year in the Obama years of 3 percent growth, which has been the historical average going back to the end of World War We are growing at 1.5 to 2 percent. We don't happen to believe that is good enough. We think we can do better. That shouldn't be the new normal. The American economy is the greatest economy on the face of the We ought to be able to grow at 3 to 3.5 percent.  I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that the average middle-income family in this country is not only going to get a big tax cut--which means they are going to get a bigger paycheck and have more money in their pocket--but they will get the benefit of the higher wages coming with a growing, more dynamic economy that it reflects.

304,topic-id,951,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for outlining and highlighting what are, I should say, some of the many reforms that are included in this legislation. Now, what he talked about is critically important.  If America is going to be competitive in the global marketplace, we have to change our Tax Code because it is completely outdated, completely antiquated relative to any of the countries with whom we compete. So, as the Senator from Pennsylvania pointed out, the reforms we make in this bill allow American companies to compete and win against those other countries around the world--the Chinas of the world, the Russias of the world. Those countries in which America has to compete on a daily basis have a huge advantage over American companies today simply because we have a tax code that doesn't recognize and reflect what is happening in the global economy, and that is why modernizing and updating our tax code was such a critical part of our tax reform effort.  I was listening to my colleague from Vermont, and I think this is a really great day in the U.We are getting close to the finish line on this tax bill. Over the past 24 hours, I think we have made a really great bill even better with more middle-class tax relief and more relief for small businesses. We have moved our bill closer to the House's bill in key areas, which I think will help us get this bill to the President's desk in the very near future. I am excited about what this tax bill is going to do for the American people.  America has always been about opportunity, a place where you could start from nothing and become anything. Generations of people have come to this country to build a better life for themselves and an even better one for their children. My grandparents were those people. They came here from Norway back in 1906, started a small merchandising company after they had learned the language and worked for a while on the railroads that were being built across this country. It later became a hardware store, and to this day in Mitchell, SD, there is still a store that goes by the name of Thune The family is not associated with it, but it is an example of the millions of Americans or millions of people who came to this country, came to America in search of opportunity.  Unfortunately, in recent years, those vast horizons that so many people came to this country for seemed to shrink. The American dream has grown dim. Getting ahead has been replaced by getting by. We have watched idly as our jobs get shipped overseas, as other countries drop their business tax rates to better compete in the global marketplace, as emerging economies and developed nations grow faster than the United Americans now frequently spend more time worrying about their future than looking forward to it.[[Page S7693]]  We are turning that around starting today with this tax bill. I am reminded of Ronald Reagan's Presidential ad noting that ``It's morning again in America.'' Well, it may not be morning yet, but the dawn is peeking over the horizon.  The tax bill before us today is going to provide immediate relief to hard-working It is going to immediately lower their tax bills. It is going to immediately mean more money in their pockets, but this bill is about much more than that. This bill isn't just about helping Americans today, although it is most certainly going to do that. This bill is about helping Americans for the long term. It is about restoring the American dream. It is about giving Americans access to the kinds of wages, jobs, and opportunities that will set them up for a secure and more prosperous future, and it is about sending a message to the world that America is finally serious about competing for 21st century jobs and innovation.  For years, our tax laws have kept American businesses at a disadvantage in the global economy. As other nations have changed their Tax Codes to strengthen their businesses, our Tax Code has kept American businesses struggling, but that ends now. This legislation makes a tremendous investment in American businesses and American workers. Under this bill, American businesses will no longer face the double taxation that has kept them at a disadvantage next to their foreign counterparts and has pushed them to keep jobs and investment overseas. They will no longer face the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. They will no longer be playing catchup with their foreign competitors. Instead, American business will have money to invest in American workers. They will be able to expand their domestic operations, and they will be able to compete with and beat their competitors around the globe. What is the result of that? It means more growth here at home, more jobs, more opportunities, higher wages, and an America that can lead the world in innovation, job creation, and economic growth.  America may have been through a rough patch lately, but she is coming back stronger than ever. America led the world in the 20th century, and this tax bill makes it clear that she is going to do the same in the 21st century.  I hope our colleagues, when it comes time to vote on this tonight, will vote in favor of tax relief for middle-income families, vote for a stronger, growing, vibrant, robust economy that is creating better paying jobs, raising wages for American workers and American families, and a brighter, better, and more prosperous future for future generations of  I yield the floor.

923,topic-id,1121,"Mr.President, relief for American families is on the way.  Last week, the Senate passed our version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a tax reform bill that will provide immediate, direct relief to hard-working  Our legislation doubles the standard deduction, it doubles the child tax credit, and it lowers rates. Under our bill, a family of four making $73,000 a year will see a $2,200 tax cut, or a reduction in taxes of about 60 percent over what they are paying under current law. A single parent with one child making $41,000 will see his or her taxes drop from around $1,865 today to just $488 under our bill, a reduction of nearly 75 percent over what they are paying today.  That is just the beginning. The tax bill before us today is going to provide immediate relief to hard-working families. It is going to immediately lower their tax bills. It is going to immediately mean more money in their pockets.  But this bill is about much more than that. This bill isn't just about helping Americans today--although it is most certainly going to do that--the bill is about helping Americans for the long term. It is about giving Americans access to the kinds of wages, jobs, and opportunities that will set them up for a secure and prosperous future.  The way we do that is by improving the playing field for American businesses. In order for individual Americans to thrive economically, we need American businesses to thrive. Thriving businesses create jobs, they provide opportunities, and they increase wages and invest in their workers.  But our current Tax Code hasn't been helping businesses thrive. For years now, our tax laws have left businesses of all sizes struggling under the burden of high tax rates and an outdated tax system that has left American businesses at a disadvantage in the global economy.  Small businesses employ nearly half of American workers and create a majority of the new jobs in this country. But right now, small businesses face high tax rates that can make it difficult for these businesses to even survive, much less thrive and expand their operations. Our bill will fix this.  To start with, our bill implements a new deduction for passthrough businesses like partnerships, LLCs, and S corporations. This deduction will allow them to keep more of their money, which will allow them to reinvest in their operations, increase wages, and hire new workers.  Our bill also reforms current provisions in the Tax Code that frequently leave small businesses with very little cash on hand. Under our legislation, small businesses will be able to recover the capital they have invested in things like inventory and machinery much more quickly and, in certain cases, immediately. This, in turn, will free up capital that small businesses can use to expand and to create jobs.  Our legislation also includes provisions that I helped develop that will simplify accounting rules for small businesses, which will also help reduce their tax burden, leaving more of their earnings to reinvest in their businesses and their workers.  In addition to providing relief to small businesses, another thing our bill will do to boost Americans' wages is lower our massive corporate tax rate. Our Nation's corporate tax rate today is the highest in the industrialized world, which puts the United States at a major disadvantage next to our international competitors. Reducing the corporate tax rate will enable American businesses to compete on a more level playing field, which will, in turn, free up money that U.businesses can use to create jobs and increase wages.  The White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates that reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, as our bill does, will increase wages for U.households by $4,000 annually. That is money that families can use to save for retirement, help pay for a child's education, replace an aging vehicle, or invest in a new home.  Our bill will also boost wages and increase opportunities for Americans by ending the outdated tax framework that is driving American companies to keep jobs and profits overseas. Our Nation currently operates under a so-called worldwide tax system. That means that American companies pay U.taxes on the profits they make here at home, as well as on part of the profits they make abroad once they bring that money back to the United The problem with this is that American companies are already paying taxes to foreign governments on the money they make abroad. Then, when they bring that money home, they could end up having to pay taxes again on part of those profits and at the highest tax rate in the industrialized world. It is no surprise that this[[Page S7833]]discourages businesses from bringing their profits back to the United States to invest in their domestic operations and new jobs and increased wages.  Our bill replaces our outdated worldwide tax system with a territorial tax system. Under our legislation, American companies will no longer face the double taxation that has encouraged them to send their investments and their operations overseas. Instead, U.companies will have a strong incentive to invest their profits at home in American jobs and in American workers.  All in all, the Tax Foundation estimates that in addition to increasing wages, our bill will create nearly 1 million new jobs for American workers and boost the size of the economy by 3.7 percent.  I don't need to tell anybody that American families have had a tough time in recent years or that our economy as a whole has stagnated, with weak economic growth, almost nonexistent wage growth, and a lack of opportunity that has become the norm for way too many families. But this tax bill marks the beginning of the end of the Obama-era economy.  The tax bill we just passed will usher in a new era of dynamism in this country. It will let Americans keep more of their earnings right now, and it will improve Americans' economic situation for the long term. It will send a message to the world that America is serious about competing and succeeding and winning in the 21st century economy.  Under this bill, American companies will compete and win globally, and American businesses, large and small, and the American people will thrive as a result.  I look forward to going to conference with the House of Representatives and getting a final, comprehensive tax reform bill to the We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity--literally, a once-in-a-lifetime chance--to make a real difference in the lives of literally millions of It is time to get this bill across the finish line.

1186,topic-id,1649,"Mr.President, a lot of our colleagues on the other side have come to the floor today and have talked about why they don't like our tax reform bill. Many of those arguments have been focused on who benefits from it. Of course, as is usually the case when you start talking about any kind of an attempt to reduce taxes on the American people so they can keep more of what they earn, keep more dollars in their pockets so they can decide how to spend it rather than send it to Washington, DC, Democrats complain that it is tax cuts for the rich.  Well, again, I want to point out--and this, of course, is based upon the Joint Committee on Taxation, which was just alluded to--where they find the benefits of the tax relief goal. As you can see from this chart, these represent different income groups. The highest percentage tax cuts actually go to those in the lower and middle-income groups. If you look at who benefits from this, every income group gets a significant tax cut, but middle-income Americans do particularly well percentagewise under this tax reform proposal.  So the argument, again, that this is somehow simply a tax cut for the rich just doesn't pass the smell test. It doesn't comport with reality. Clearly, the numbers tell a very different story.  The other point I wish to make is that if we look at what we tried to accomplish in the design of this tax bill, we see that we tried to maintain the existing progressivity in the tax bill. We have one of the most progressive tax codes in the world. We have a lot of people in this country who don't have any income tax liability and some who benefit from refundable tax credits that help to eliminate or partially eliminate their payroll tax liability as well. But this chart shows who, under our bill, when it is all said and done, bears the tax burden in this country--in other words, the percentage of the tax liability paid by each different group in different income groups.  When we look at this, we can see that those in the $20,000 to $50,000 range--this is their tax burden as a percentage of the entire tax burden levied on Americans around the country--the rate drops from 4.3 percent to 4.1 percent. So those in the $20,000 to $50,000 income group, as a percentage of tax burden in the country, pay less under our proposal than they do today.  If we look at the group from $50,000 to $100,000, that income group also, as a percentage of the entire tax burden borne by Americans, pays less under our proposal than they do today. They pay 16.9 percent today, and under our proposal they will pay 16.7 percent of total taxes in this country.  Those, on the other hand, making $100,000 or more will pay slightly more of the overall tax burden. Today they pay 78.7 percent, and under our proposal they will pay 78.9 percent.  So people under $100,000 are going to be paying less as a share of the overall tax burden than they currently do today. I don't know how anyone can, with a straight face, argue that somehow this is a tax bill that benefits those in the upper end.  With respect to the arguments that are being made right now regarding the Joint Committee on Taxation release of the dynamic score, I would say the same thing that my colleague from Texas said. I think the good news in all of this is what it demonstrates is that what we are trying to do actually generates economic growth. It actually generates additional revenue for the Federal We can argue about how much.[[Page S7535]]  We happen to think that the assumptions used by the Joint Committee on Taxation are not accurate because they assume that we are going to continue to grow for the next decade--our economy--at 1.9 percent. Historical averages in the American economy going back to the end of World War II show that we have averaged somewhere between 3 and 3.5 percent growth. So if we take the assumption that we are never going to do any better than 1.9 percent growth in the economy, then perhaps their estimate could be accurate. We happen to believe we are going to do a whole lot better than that. We believe that if we put the right policies in place and we make America an attractive place in which to invest, we are going to see considerably higher growth than 1.9 percent.  So what does it take to cover the number that we created in this tax bill that would have to be paid for with additional growth in the economy? Well, it takes about four-tenths of 1 percent of growth--increase in average annual growth--over the next decade. What does that mean? That means that instead of growing at 1.9 percent a year for the next decade, we are going to have to grow at 2.2, 2.3 percent--somewhere in that ballpark--to not only cover this but actually start generating revenue above and beyond what the impact of the tax cut would be on the Federal budget.  What I would simply say to my colleagues is that when we look at these various models that are done and the assumptions that are made, remember that the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Congressional Budget Office--the numbers they are using assume 1.9 percent economic growth. I can't believe that we wouldn't have more confidence in the American economy that we could generate higher than 1.9 percent economic growth. That is the straitjacket that constrains their models.  There are other models out there that have looked at the same information, the same data, looked at the same tax bill, considered the behavioral effects of that, how it would affect the entire economy, and come to a different conclusion. In fact, the Tax Foundation has suggested that the tax bill we have in front of us today would generate an additional $1.26 trillion in revenue over that same time period because of the additional growth that would come with it.  What we tried to do is design a tax bill that not only delivers tax relief to middle-income families--I think the two charts I just showed demonstrate that we do--but secondly to put policies in place that will create conditions that are favorable to economic growth so we can get growth back up to a more historic level. When the economy is growing at a faster rate, it means that companies and businesses are creating better paying jobs. And if there is a competition for labor in this country, and I believe there will be--when companies start to expand, start to grow their operations, it increases the demand for labor, and the price for labor goes up, and wages go up. That is what we want to see.  That is the other thing about this bill that doesn't get talked about enough. The reduction in rates on businesses means that they have more to invest in their businesses, and one of the byproducts of that is that it goes into higher wages for their employees. The President's Council of Economic Advisers suggests that that impact would be about $4,000 a year in additional income for average households in this country. There is another study done by Boston University in which they have concluded that it would result in $3,500 a year in additional income per household in this country.  So the impact of the tax cuts is really twofold. One is that American families would have more in their pockets. Why? Because we double the standard deduction. In our bill, we double the child tax credit. We lower rates. All of those actions impact lower and middle-income families in this country. Those are all features they can take advantage of that generate additional benefits to them.  Those benefits, by the way, if you are an average family in this country--a typical family of four with a combined annual income of $73,000--result in a $2,200 tax cut. That is a 60-percent tax cut over what they would pay under current law. So that is $2,200 in that family's pocket that they will be able to spend on themselves and their families instead of sending that to Washington, DC, and having somebody decide how to spend it here. We happen to have a lot of confidence that the American people are better prepared and better equipped to decide how to spend their own money rather than the Federal So that is a direct benefit, 1.  Secondly, as I said earlier, if you give the benefit of not only a tax cut that comes to middle-income families but also the additional growth in the economy that generates better-paying jobs and generates higher wages, that increases your overall household income. That is how American families benefit directly from the legislation we are considering today.  My colleague from Ohio is here, and he pays a lot of attention to economic trends. I think it is interesting to note that the Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Tax Committee, which, in their analysis, assume 1.9 percent growth in the economy for the next decade--we think we can do a lot better.  I ask my colleague from Ohio, aren't we already starting to do better economically? I think we have seen a significant improvement in growth in the economy just in the last couple of quarters. If we continue to stay on that track or a similar track, which I think this tax reform legislation helps enable, we might be able to get to a point where we are growing at a more historic rate.  What was the growth rate, for example, just in the last couple of quarters that we have seen in this country?

We also have to do the other side of this, which is to restrain spending. But in order to deal with debt and deficits, we really need that growth in the economy because higher growth, the economy growing at a faster rate, means people are working, people are paying taxes, people are taking realizations and paying taxes, and government revenues go up.

1636,topic-id,2037,"Mr.President, I know I don't need to tell anybody that American families have had a tough time in recent years. Weak economic growth, stagnant wages, and a lack of opportunities have left many Americans struggling just to get by.  To put a fine point on that, during the entire years of the Obama Presidency, there wasn't a single year wherein the growth rate and the economy exceeded 3 percent. If we go back to the end of World War II, average economic growth in this country has averaged somewhere in the 3 to 3.5 percent range. So in the entire 8 years of the Obama Presidency, there was not a single year--not one year--where economic growth exceeded 3 percent.  What did that mean for American workers? It meant that their wages stayed flat. In many cases, up until just recently, American families haven't had a pay raise for the better part of a decade as a result. It has been a sluggish, anemic, slow-growth economy that wasn't creating the kind of good-paying jobs or the wage levels that enabled American families to benefit from increasing incomes.  A recent survey found that 50 percent of Americans consider themselves to be living paycheck to paycheck. That makes perfect sense if we look at the economic statistics, economic record of the past 8 years. About one-third of those same Americans say they are just $400 away from a financial crisis.  Real help is on the way. This week, we will bring the Senate version of comprehensive tax reform to the Senate floor. The legislation we have produced will provide immediate, direct relief to hard-working Americans, but that is not what we are hearing from Here is what we are hearing Democrats say about the Senate plan--and I will just contrast that with the facts, what is really true. Here is what we have heard: The Republicans have somehow drafted this secret tax plan behind closed doors and are forcing it through the voting process much too fast.  No doubt we have heard this as well: The Senate tax bill raises taxes on lower and middle-income, middle-class Americans while cutting taxes for the rich.  Here is an interesting attack that is coming from my colleagues on the other side as well who have, in the past, not been considered budget hawks: The Senate tax bill somehow is a budget buster that irresponsibly increases the deficit.  First off, let me address that question. The answer to the deficit question is that this is a $5.5 trillion tax cut. Seventy percent of the tax cut is paid for by ending loopholes and special exemptions in the Tax Code today--what we call base broadeners--broadening the base by doing away with some of the preferences that exist in the code today.  The Joint Committee on Taxation says that with a static score, we will have about a $1.4 trillion delta to cover. Assuming that we use current tax policy--and we normally do extend current tax policy--we believe the remaining cost of the tax cut will be covered through increased economic growth.  What does that mean? What kind of growth do we have to achieve in the economy in order to have the kind of growth that would enable this tax relief above and beyond what we have done in terms of base broadeners and pay-fors to be covered?  Just to put it in perspective, the Congressional Budget Office is assuming and forecasting 1.8 percent growth over the next 10 years. Again, as I mentioned earlier, we didn't have good growth over the last 8 years in the Obama administration. We were averaging 1.5 to 2 percent growth. The Congressional Budget Office is forecasting currently 1.8 percent growth for the next 10 years.  Well, I can't believe that growth rate would be acceptable to people in this country--the greatest economy on the face of the Earth growing at less than 2 percent a year. That cannot be the new normal. We have to do better than that.  If we get just 2.2 to 2.4 percent growth with this bill, we will have covered the remaining cost of the tax cut. The amount I pointed out earlier is not covered in terms of base broadeners and pay-fors and offsets, but it assumes a certain reasonable amount of growth--just the growth necessary to cover the cost of that tax cut--which is 2.2 to 2.4 percent. Again, to put it in perspective, going back to the end of World War II, the economy in this country has averaged 3 to 3.5 percent growth. It is only in the last decade, where we have had heavy taxes and heavy regulations and policies that have created conditions that are not favorable for that kind of growth, where we have gotten stuck with this malaise of 1.5 to 2 percent. So if we can just get 2.2 to 2.4 percent growth in the economy, we will cover the remaining cost of this tax cut.  In reality, when my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that this is[[Page S7381]]going to add to the deficit, they are saying our country cannot grow at 2.2 to 2.4 percent a year over the next 10 years. They have gotten used to the low, slow, sluggish, anemic growth and have accepted that as the new normal.  I don't accept that as the new normal, and the American people shouldn't accept that as the new normal because we are selling our country--the greatest economy in the world--woefully short when we find it satisfactory that the economy can grow at less than 2 percent. As I said, since World War II, we have averaged over 3 percent growth.  After such a long period of stagnant growth, I understand how my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are resigned to accept this as the new normal, but I think I can speak for all of our Republican colleagues here when I say we can do much better than we did during the Obama years. We can and we will grow at a faster rate on account of this tax reform bill. Why? Because when you reduce taxes, you allow people to keep more of what they have earned. Instead of growing the government in Washington, DC, you start growing the economy. When you reduce taxes on businesses, those businesses invest. They expand their operations. When they expand their operations, it means they have to hire new people. The demand for labor raises the price of labor. Wages go up. Paychecks get bigger. That is what happens.  It also means the government generates more revenue. When the economy is growing at a faster rate, people are working, paying taxes; people who have invested are taking their realizations, and that raises tax revenues in this country.  We can and will grow at a faster rate if we can put the right economic policies in place, starting with this tax reform bill. We can create those new, good-paying jobs, keep existing jobs from moving overseas, and we can see wages in this country go up and finally give Americans a much needed break in their paychecks. We can get the economy growing again and generate enough revenue to cover the remaining 30 percent cost of this tax reform bill.  This bill has been put together after many years of hearings and work. Democrats argue that this was somehow cooked up in a short amount of time. I joined the Senate Finance Committee in 2011. Since I have been on the committee, we have had 70-plus hearings on tax reform. Two years ago, in 2015, the chairman of that committee, Senator Hatch, created a number of working groups to examine various aspects of the Tax I had the privilege of chairing one of those groups along with Senator Cardin, a Democrat on the other side of the aisle. We looked at and examined the business part of the Tax Code to try and determine what sorts of recommendations we could make that would get the economy growing at a faster rate and generate better paying jobs. There were five groups like that, all of which made recommendations, much of which formed the basis for the tax bill we are considering today.  We have been working on this for years to get to where we are today. It has involved a lot of thought, a lot of analysis, a lot of work has gone into the legislation that we will be voting on later this week.  We made a focus of this tax reform legislation delivering meaningful tax relief to middle-income families who we believe know better how to spend their money than the Federal Government here in Washington, If we can make American families' paychecks bigger, they can decide what they want to do to help themselves and their families, such as save for college education, perhaps save for a more secure retirement, or take care of the daily needs they have in their lives. The fundamental premise is, we trust the American people to make those decisions.  We believe, after the last decade of stagnant wages and a slow and sluggish economy, that they deserve a pay raise, that they deserve to have a bigger paycheck than they do today. So reducing tax rates, doubling the standard deduction, doubling the child tax credit, which are all features of the Senate bill--all benefits of this Senate bill--are things that will help allow these families to keep more of what they earn.  The average family in this country, under this legislation that we will consider--when I say ``average family,'' a typical family of four--with a combined annual income of $73,000, will receive a $2,200 tax cut as a result of this tax legislation. That is a 60-percent tax cut over what they are paying today under current law.  So if we look at the way this impacts middle-income families in this country, doubling the standard deduction, doubling the child tax credit, and lowering rates are all policies that will inure to the benefit of middle-income families in this country. We believe middle-income families deserve to keep more of what they own. They deserve bigger paychecks. This tax bill will do that for them, in addition to creating the growth in the economy that we need to see if we are going to get those better paying jobs generated and get wages back up to where American families are enjoying a higher standard of living and a higher quality of life than what they have today.  We need to get back to normal. We need to get back to 3, 3.5 percent growth. We can do that with the right policies, and it starts by passing the kind of tax reform we have before us today that will lower rates on businesses, lower rates on families, double that standard deduction, double that child tax credit, and allow American families and American workers to get the benefit of keeping more of their paychecks, more of their hard-earned money in their own pockets, and the benefit of higher wages that will compliment a stronger, more robust economy that is growing at a faster rate than what it is today.  That is what is at stake in the discussion over tax reform. I hope, before the week is out, we will get the votes that are necessary to pass this and then go to conference with the House of Representatives, which has already passed their version of tax reform, and then put a bill on the President's desk that he can sign into law before the end of this year that moves us in a direction that provides meaningful tax relief for middle-income families in this country, as well as creates conditions that are favorable to that economic growth that will create better paying jobs and higher wages.  The American people deserve better than 1.5 percent growth. They deserve a pay raise, not a pay cut, and that is what this tax reform bill will help accomplish.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

904,topic-id,1451,"Mr.President, I want to thank Chairman Grassley for his leadership on this issue and for his willingness to sit down and talk to a diverse group of people who think we have a problem that we should solve and that we must solve.  Senator Grassley just did such a good job of describing some of the technical aspects of the SECURE Act and the BRIDGE Act and other legislation that actually came together to create the SECURE  I want to back up and talk a little bit about what we are actually trying to do here. There are two key components to this bill and to efforts that have gone before the point at which we have introduced this bill that I think are very important.  The first one is the DACA That is Deferred Action for Childhood The DACA Program is something that was implemented in 2012 by President What President Obama sought to do was to provide some certainty for young adults and children who were brought across the border--not through their own decisions but through the decisions of their parents or a guardian to cross the border illegally--and find themselves illegally present in the United Today, they are still protected because they are still protected under DACA, but the President announced on September 5 that on March 5 that program would end.  Now, you can imagine that there are hundreds of thousands of young men and women who are uncertain about their future status in this country. It is a problem we need to solve. The other side of the equation is something that is also equally important to me and to a number of people in this body. It has to do with our border security and interior enforcement.  Back in late winter, I spent a week down on the southern border. I went to the Rio Grande Sector and the West Texas I spoke with a lot of people at the land ports that hundreds of thousands of people cross every day. We listened to their concerns about things we need to do to better secure the border.  There are two debates in Congress right now. I don't actually embrace either of the two extremes. There is the one extreme that says build a big, beautiful wall that is 2,000 miles long. It is impractical and not necessary.  There is the other extreme that says we don't need borders; we need bridges. That is impractical and unsafe.  What we need is a solution to border security so that we know who is in this country and so that we have an orderly way to move between countries for someone who is in our country who[[Page S7836]]wants to come to work or visit the United States and return back in a legal fashion.  The other thing we have to look at in border security that I think is oftentimes overlooked is the humanitarian crisis with an unsecure border. There is one of the numbers that stuck with me. There were so many that we covered when we were down with border security, but this stuck with me--actually, two numbers. This one is most heartbreaking: Over a 20-year period, 10,000 people have died crossing the border unsuccessfully. Ten thousand bodies have been recovered as a result of crossing the border and not finding their way to a safe place. About 1,000 of them were children. Unless we have the people, technology, and infrastructure on the border to know who is trying to cross, we can't protect them. Even if it means we are going to take them into custody and potentially deport them, at least they will be alive.  Another statistic was very important to me, too. It was in a discussion I had with border security agents down in Laredo, one of the big land ports where people cross every day. I am not going to get into a lot of the details, except to say that they confiscate about 400,000 doses of methamphetamine about every 48 hours in this one land port. That is where they confiscate it. By most estimates, it is only a minor percentage of all of the illegal drugs crossing the border. So we obviously need more people, technology, and infrastructure to be able to capture people who are crossing the border in various trucks and cars. They are finding ways to hide these drugs that are poisoning our Nation's youth and, really, people of all ages.  So there is a reason for border security. There is a reason to invest in people, technology, and infrastructure. There is a reason for us to have a productive discussion about how we can provide a compassionate, sustainable solution to the children and young adults who came to this country through not their decision but the decisions of their adult guardians.  That is what this bill, the SECURE Act, is setting forth. We are trying to get a productive discussion going with Democrats and Republicans who will come together and recognize that a balanced bill provides for border security, provides a sustainable solution for the DACA population, and get it done before March 5.  There are some people that want to, I think, play a little bit of brinkmanship. They have already set in their mind how they want this bill to look. What worries me about a bill where you use timing, maybe a year-end budget agreement, or some other device to get the bill done, is that that doesn't necessarily produce a bipartisan outcome that you can be sure of is always going to be on the books. Those types of bills--those types of quick ``gotcha'' sort of actions--are oftentimes the bills somebody will try to come back to and repeal or revise.  We want a sustainable solution. We want a solution that is going to work and give certainty to this DACA population for the rest of their lives. I think the provisions of the BRIDGE Act that are now in the SUCCEED Act do that.  I want to thank Senator Senator Lankford and I filed another bill. We are full of acronyms here. I don't know, but sometimes they say we are full of other things, but we are full of acronyms. The SUCCEED Act is another bill, and I think that many of its provisions will be considered as we go through the negotiation process to get a bill to the President's desk. The bill that we sponsored is the called SUCCEED It is the Solution for Undocumented Children through Careers, Employment, Education, and Defending our Nation It is a lot like the BRIDGE Act, in that we go to the DACA population, and we know something about the DACA population that I think is oftentimes overlooked. It is a great group of people. There are a little bit less than 2 million. Many of them are working hard, going to school, and serving in our military. They deserve an opportunity and to be provided a way to be able to recognize they are legally present in this country.  That is what I think we are going to accomplish with this SECURE This is what I hope my Democrat colleagues will do, those who actually endorse the BRIDGE There are many of them. Senator Grassley ran through the list. I will not do it again. Let's sit down and solve this problem. Let's accept that there are people at the far left who are going to stand on one issue at the expense of letting March 5 pass and have the DACA population at risk. Let's also tell the people at the far right who want nothing less than full deportation, that that is not going to happen.  Let the people in the center who want to come up with a sustainable, respectful, compassionate solution that is paired up with solid border security measures and interior enforcement, provide a solution for this population. I think my colleagues who have worked together in the working group that Chairman Grassley has led are committed to working with Democrats to come up with a reasonable solution. I know that I am. I know my colleague, Senator Lankford, is.  I hope that everybody will sit down and recognize that, at the end of the day, this is for our Nation's security and the security and the certainty of the DACA population. If we set out about accomplishing those two goals, then I think we will be very successful. Then we can start building on that dialogue for so many other things we need to talk about when it comes to interior enforcement and immigration reform.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-12-05-pt1-PgS7834-2.txt,2291,"TOYA CANTRELL, THE MAYOR-ELECT OF NEW ORLEANS",2017,5,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1969,topic-id,1209,"Thank you, Mr.I thank the Presiding Officer for his comments just before mine, and thank him for presiding so that I can step down and speak briefly.  I wasn't sure if I was going to speak. I don't have any notes. But I was inspired by some of the comments that were made by the Senator from Vermont as I was presiding.  We heard--actually, for those who are visiting the DC area, if you don't get an opportunity to go to any of the wonderful theaters we have here, such as the Kennedy Center, don't worry because you are seeing a lot of theater down here on the Senate floor.  Anybody who would suggest that we are going to come back and cut my mother's Medicare and my mother's Social Security and that of the mothers and brothers and sisters of other people who are depending on that for their livelihood is somewhat involved in political theater.  Some of you were here and probably heard the challenge to have a Republican come down here on the floor and say: Bernie, you are wrong.  Well, the distinguished Senator from Vermont is wrong.  This bill is about actually providing freedom and tax relief to working families and reducing the tax burden on businesses so that the economy will grow and we will have the resources to pay our bills.  I can understand that maybe it is not intentional theater on the part of some of these folks; it may just be because they simply have never done it before. But if you have ever lived in North Carolina or if you have lived in North Carolina since 2011, you know that we did.  I have seen this theater before--from the dais as speaker of the house in the State of North Carolina when we were one of the highest--the sixth highest tax State in the Nation, with one of the slowest growing economies. We were having a problem paying our Medicaid bills. We were having a problem paying our bills. We had a $2.5 billion structural deficit. I heard the theater on the floor: If you cut taxes, you are going to drive up the deficit. If you cut taxes, you are going to cut If you cut taxes, you are going to cut social services.  I heard it all. Everybody accused us of that. I hit the gavel, and I ratified the bill for tax reform. Guess what happened. We went from being the sixth most taxed State that today is in the top ten best taxed. We went from one of the worst performing State economies to now one of the best performing State economies. We have reduced the[[Page S7376]]number of people in poverty, and statistically--I mean, we can prove it to you. We do the counts. The number of people who have been lifted out of poverty has increased over the last 3 years. Median incomes have gone up. Job creation has gone up. Our gross domestic product has gone up over the past 5 or 6 years by $80 billion. We were at about $400 billion, and now we are at $480 billion.  So let me tell you how we are going to pay for these tax cuts. We are not going to pay for them by cutting Medicare for seniors. We are going to pay for them through the economic activity that will absolutely occur if we have the courage to fulfill the promise that we made last year to the American people. We are going to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses. We are going to get our tax policy consistent and competitive with nations that are eating our lunch on locating business expansion and having businesses come offshore--away from the United States to more preferable tax jurisdictions, and we are going to change people's lives.  I am motivated to support this plan because I have been in a position of leadership where I had great people in my caucus who had the courage to fulfill a promise that I made if I became speaker of the house. Now we are at a point in time to do the same thing for America that we did for North If we do it, it is going to be extraordinary.  Let me reduce it down to an answer I gave to a little boy yesterday. I think he was in fourth grade. I had a Skype video conference with an English as a second language class in an elementary school down in North One of the little boys asked me a great question, and it is a question that has never been asked of me. I have been in politics only for about 12 years. But he said: What piece of legislation are you most proud of? What is the thing you are most proud of since you have been in the legislature?  I thought about it. It was a tough question because I can think of many things I have done. But then I went back to this little boy in the classroom, and I said: You know what, buddy, it was something I did back when I was speaker of the North Carolina By the way, if any politician tells you ``I did this,'' they are invariably not telling you the truth because you don't get anything done unless the team commits to it. So I, along with a lot of people in North Carolina, decided that your parents could not afford to pay the bills. They were having a difficult time paying the utility bills, their rent, and their groceries, paying for food. So we decided we were going to do something to make sure that government gave your parents more money to make sure you could go to school, to make sure they could pay their bills, to make sure they could have a better paying job. And, buddy, that is the thing I am most proud of. The thing I am most proud of was tax reform that produced results that are indisputable. I have seen the theater before, and it didn't work out too well because it proved to be fiction in North  If we have the courage over the next couple of days to take that same vote here, we are going to see the same results for those working families and those job employers in the United So I hope all of the Members of this body recognize that we are not going to fund the tax cuts on the backs of people who need the help the most. That is absurd. It is unfair. It is theater. We are going to take care of them, and we are going to take care of everyone else who is relying on us, this caucus, to fulfill the promise we made, get the economy back on track, and start winning more than losing against our international competition. I am completely convinced that the bill that is going to be before us over the end of this week is going to do just that.  Thank you, Mr. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr.Speaker, my bill, the Fowler and Boskoff Peaks Designation Act, would designate two unnamed peaks in the Uncompahgre National Forest in Colorado as Fowler Peak and Boskoff  Charlie Fowler and his partner, Christine ``Chris'' Boskoff, were longtime residents of San Miguel County, Colorado, and were avid alpinists.  Charlie Fowler was one of North America's most experienced mountain climbers. He was also an author, a guide, a filmmaker, a photographer, and an advocate for the outdoors. Beginning in the mid-1980s, Charlie worked full time as a mountain guide, leading mountaineering expeditions in the United States and abroad.  His photographs and articles were published in a variety of books and magazines, and he was the author of multiple mountaineering guidebooks. In 2004, Charlie was awarded the Robert and Miriam Underhill Award by the American Alpine Society, an honor given annually to an individual who has demonstrated the highest level of skill in the mountaineering arts and who, through the application of this skill, courage, and perseverance, has achieved outstanding success in the various fields of mountaineering endeavor.  Christine Boskoff began her climbing career in 1993 and quickly rose to become a leader in the sport of mountaineering. Christine summited Mount Everest and five of the globe's more than 26,000-foot mountains. One of the world's leading female alpinists, a professional mountaineering guide and an adventure entrepreneur, Christine participated in numerous expeditions in the United States and on five continents.  Charlie and Christine were also known for their philanthropic work. Charlie worked to promote his sport by installing climbing walls in schools across southwest Christine was active in nonprofit organizations that supported the rights of porters and Sherpas, women's education, global literacy, and gender equality.  Sadly, Charlie and Christine were killed in an avalanche in 2006 while exploring a series of unclimbed summits in China's Sichuan province.  The naming of these peaks is a fitting tribute to Charlie and Christine,[[Page H9442]]who were outstanding mountaineers and advocates for our Nation's treasured open spaces.

2111,topic-id,276,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, H.3115, authored by Congressman Richard Nolan, is a bipartisan bill that implements a land exchange to facilitate the exercise of certain mineral rights in the Superior National Forest in Minnesota to create economic growth for the area.  Congressman Nolan will certainly provide the history of this exchange,[[Page H9447]]but I do want to take note that this bill has greater impacts than just a single forest in  Across the United States, people hold mineral estates underlying lands that were acquired by the National Forest under the Weeks Without an agreement such as the one authorized by this bill, their ability to exercise those valid preexisting rights is in jeopardy.  I note that the land exchange authorized in this bill has undergone extensive environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and was supported by the Obama administration.  This is an equal-value land exchange, but the holder of the mineral estate forgoes any equalization under the bill if the private land being swapped for the Federal land is worth more.  Finally, the bill provides a net increase in the size of the Superior National Forest of 40 acres. It is no wonder that this bill was supported by the ranking members of the Subcommittee on Federal Lands and the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources when it was considered by the Natural Resources Committee in  I commend Congressman Nolan, Congressman Collin Peterson, Congressman Tom Emmer, and Congressman Jason Lewis for working together to craft this commonsense solution bill to help  Mr.Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.1491, which would reaffirm the Bureau of Indian Affairs' action placing approximately 1,400 acres of land known as Camp 4 into a trust for the benefit of the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Mission Indians in Santa Barbara County,  The Chumash Tribe has about 140 enrolled members with a 138-acre reservation in Santa Ynez, The Tribe constructed a casino and hotel resort on its reservation pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which has lifted the Tribe from historic poverty to economic success.  With other private investments in the region, the Tribe has become one of the largest employers in Santa Barbara  In 2010, the Tribe purchased a 1,400-acre tract of land known as Camp 4, located about 2 miles from the reservation in an unincorporated area of Santa Barbara County, from the Fess Parker estate. The Tribe has testified that it intends to use Camp 4 for suitable Tribal housing for its current and future members. At present, the landscape of Camp 4 is mainly agricultural.  In 2014, the Bureau of Indian Affairs approved an application filed by the Tribe to place Camp 4 in trust under the agency's regulatory procedures. However, the title had not been transferred to the United States pending the resolution of an administrative appeal filed by Santa Barbara County and private citizens.  On January 17, 2017, the Department of the Interior dismissed pending appeals of the application and affirmed the 2014 decision.  Despite the dismissal of the appeals, the Tribe and the County of Santa Barbara continued work to address concerns with the trust acquisition. On November 1, 2017, the Tribe and county entered into a long-term memorandum of agreement to protect the mutual interests of both the Tribe and the county. The bill, as amended, includes a reference to this agreement and support of the County of Santa  I would like to thank the sponsor of this bill, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Indian, Insular and Alaska Native Affairs, Mr.LaMalfa, for his hard work on this legislation.

Indeed, this is ongoing.  On October 31, the county ratified an agreement with the Chumash, ensuring that any impacts of Camp 4 housing on local infrastructure and other resources would be addressed, and the Department of the Interior approved this agreement on the same day.  In order to enable the Chumash to address their housing crisis and ensure any impacts to local governments are addressed, H.1491 takes the following actions:  It affirms and ratifies the action of the Department of the Interior to take the Camp 4 parcel into trust on January 19, 2017.  It codifies references to the Chumash-county agreement ratified by Santa Barbara County on October 31, 2017, addressing impacts to local infrastructure and services.  By request of the Chumash, it prohibits the operation of gaming facilities on the Camp 4 parcel.  It protects and respects rights-of-way also held by local stakeholders.  Mr.Speaker, this bill represents, again, the culmination of years of effort on the part of the Chumash, the county, the committee, and Congress to ensure that the concerns of all stakeholders were addressed fairly through a local process and reaching a consensus with the Tribe and the county that we sought from the beginning. Indeed, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Indian, Insular, and Alaska Native Affairs, I believe this agreement is the outcome of good faith negotiations by all parties and should be considered a model for maintaining positive working relationships between tribal and local governments.

608,topic-id,570,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey, our ranker, who has done great work on this bill, for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, the bill before us today represents what we can accomplish when we work together for the good of our local communities.  My district includes the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk These rivers were at the heart of our Nation's early industrialization. Along the river banks, factories manufactured carpets, collars, leather goods, and many other products.  Many of those manufacturers have since left these mill towns, but the legacy of contaminated land continues, and many of those sites remain vacant. The contamination, or the perception of contamination, makes developers avoid investing in these very important parcels and properties. Assessing and remediating these sites is critical for environmental revitalization and economic redevelopment.  The Brownfields Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment, and Reauthorization Act would improve an already successful EPA program. This legislation would reauthorize EPA's brownfields program, which expired in 2006. This would extend the program through 2022.  Since 2002, with EPA's support, tens of thousands of acres of idle land have been made ready for productive use, increasing nearby property values and helping to preserve greenfields. These properties have been brought back onto local tax rolls, helping to support local economic development. In the process, more than 130,000 jobs have been created and some $24 billion has been leveraged from this Federal investment.  Local governments are realizing that, through this program, we can turn a liability into a golden opportunity; but, unfortunately, there are many more sites yet to be assessed or remediated.  More than 450,000 brownfields exist across our great country. Many of the easiest, low-hanging fruit sites have already been cleaned up. The more difficult ones will require more funding. In recognition of this, the bill increases the maximum individual grant from $200,000 to $500,000, which will enable more complex sites to be remediated.  The bill creates multipurpose grants, enables nonprofits to receive grants, allows a small portion of grants to be used to cover administrative costs, and makes certain publically owned sites eligible for funding. These are important improvements to the program, supported by a wide array of stakeholders.  Strengthening EPA's brownfields program will continue to create jobs, remediate contaminated land, and promote sustainable economic development. It is also a key factor in creating aesthetics for neighboring parcels, thereby enhancing the entire regional aspect of certain given regions across our communities. This reauthorization will give communities the resources, the capacity, and, indeed, the flexibility to turn more liabilities into opportunities.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the members of the majority, including Mr.McKinley; Chairman Shimkus, who is the Environment Subcommittee chair; and Chairman Walden, who is the Energy and Commerce chair; as well as our colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for working with us to produce this bipartisan bill, a golden opportunity for us to come together, work together, and accomplish.

194,topic-id,340,"Mr.President, I am going to be brief. I am going to yield to my colleague from South Carolina, and I think my colleague from South Dakota has a few comments.  I want to respond to some of the points my colleague from Colorado made. First, I want to thank him for bringing out our chart. What our chart illustrates is that every category of income earners in America gets a tax cut under our plan. If you look toward the left of the chart, you see that the biggest reductions go to the people in the[[Page S7668]]lowest income categories in a percentage term. My colleagues said percentages don't matter. I am a little bit confused because it seems to me that I think they do matter. I will give you an example.  Under our tax plan, our tax reform, and our working-class and middle-class tax cuts, the average single head of household--a single mom who, as head of household, has one child and earns the average income of $41,000, which doesn't make her a millionaire, or not typically, with $41,000--is going to have a $1,400 tax cut. That is a 75-percent tax cut for her. Now, maybe our colleague from Colorado thinks that percentage doesn't matter. I think it probably matters to her. A 75-percent reduction in the taxes that she has to pay probably matters to her. It is probably pretty helpful.  You could take the case of a family of four who earns the median national income. That is $73,000. On average, they will have a $2,200 tax cut. That is a 60-percent tax cut. So I am at a loss as to why that doesn't matter to that family. I think it matters a lot. I think that family can do a lot with that $2,200.  The fact is that our bill lowers taxes for every category of income earner, and the proportionate share is the greatest for the lowest income earners. This is good for working Americans and middle-class  I yield to my colleague from South  ",CREC-2017-12-01-pt1-PgS7655-2.txt,1594,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONTINUED,2017,1,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

212,topic-id,909,"Thank you, Mr.I will be brief because I think my colleague from South Carolina has a comment he wants to make.  Let me respond just briefly to my colleague from my State of Our bill increases the child tax credit. Our bill lowers the tax burden on every category of income earners, including working families, middle-income families--every category.  As my colleague from Colorado demonstrated kindly, he showed in the chart that the biggest proportional savings go to the lower-income families, and the pro-growth policy is going to create more job opportunities at higher wages. So let's see: more money in child tax credit, less taxes owed on the part of families, more job opportunities, and higher wages. I think it is a pretty safe bet that this is good for kids. I think it is a pretty safe bet that when families get to keep more of their money, that is probably good for their kids. I think most of my constituents would probably agree with that.  We have heard folks on the other side suggest that we are actually not cutting taxes on the middle class. This is unfortunate because we have enough areas where we disagree without having to make up areas that aren't true. Our friends on the other side like higher taxes; we like lower taxes. They like to redistribute wealth; we like people who earn it to keep wealth. We focus on growing the economy; they want to grow government. We have honest differences in priorities, so I wish we would focus on where there are actual differences and the facts in question. But there is no question that we are lowering taxes on middle-income families because we are lowering taxes on every category of wages.  The people who are watching on C-SPAN and the people who are listening in the gallery must get a little frustrated and must ask themselves: Well, who can we believe? We hear one side say: This is lower taxes for working families. We have the other side say: Oh, it is higher taxes.  I have a suggestion. I know there is a solution. You could look it up at Joint Committee on Taxation, but that is tedious. You have to go to the website, you have to find it, and then you would see in the tables--because they are unambiguous--that taxes owed go down in every category.  Do you know when people are going to know for sure what the answer is? It is going to come in January when the withholding in their paycheck changes and when their take-home pay goes up because the taxes they owe go down. I know we are still a few weeks away from that, but when this passes and gets signed into law, the proof is going to be very clear, and people are going to see it.  Here is a quick word about the repeal of the individual mandate. My friend and colleague from Oregon described it. I am paraphrasing, but I think I will get it about right. He described the repeal of the individual mandate as driving a stake through the heart of ObamaCare or something equivalent to that. I couldn't help but think: What an incredibly damming indictment of Think about what that means.  Think about what they are saying if repealing the individual mandate drives a stake through the heart of The individual mandate is the provision which says that you have to buy this whether you want it or not. You have to. You are forced to. The government dictates the terms, the government effectively dictates prices, and you must buy it. If you don't, you will get hit with a penalty, a tax penalty.  We don't actually repeal the mandate, but we eliminate that tax penalty, and that is going to be very helpful for low- and middle-income families, working-class families. In Pennsylvania, 83 percent of all the people who get hit with this individual mandate tax live in a household with income of $50,000 or less. That is who is paying this.  But what I wanted to stress for a moment is what a damming indictment it is of ObamaCare that it only works, according to its proponents, if people are forced to buy the product. It is so badly designed, it is so terrible that people will not buy it voluntarily, despite huge subsidies.  We don't change any of the subsidies. They are all available to anyone who wants to participate. We don't change the rules. We don't change eligibility. We don't change anything except one thing. We say that if you decide this plan doesn't fit your family or if you decide for all the subsidies you get it is still not worth it for you to have this plan and you opt out, you will no longer be punished with this tax. That is the only thing we do in this bill.  Since we eliminate that coercion, which forces people to buy it, our colleagues on the other side say that drives a stake through the heart of It seems to me that a product or a service that people have to be forced to buy and that is killed if they are not forced to buy it probably isn't a great deal for those people, and I think we just got that admission.

268,topic-id,1280,"Mr.President, two points I would like to address, and then we have other Republican colleagues who would like to use our time as well.  One, I want to address the comments made by my friend--and he is a friend of mine--the Senator from West I have worked closely with Senator Manchin on a variety of pieces of legislation, some relatively ordinary and noncontroversial and others quite controversial. We have been through some battles together, Senator Manchin and I, and I enjoy working with him.  I hope he is going to support this product in the end. I am not sure he will, but he might--I don't know--and he probably has some good ideas he could bring to this.  Let me be very clear about the process we have used here. First of all, this legislation has gone through the regular order. It has gone through the committee. It was extensively debated in the committee. It was marked up in the committee. There were many dozens of amendments debated and voted on in the committee. The committee document, which is very similar to the final document we are going to vote on tonight, has been available for weeks.  Here is one of the problems we faced from the onset in this. Very early on in this process, the vast majority of our Democratic colleagues announced they wanted to leave the room with respect to a tax reform discussion. Now, as it happens, Senator Manchin was not among them, but 45 of the 48 Democratic Senators sent a public letter, and they stipulated the terms under which they would be willing to work with us on tax reform. One of the terms was that we had to use a process that could allow them to kill it by a filibuster, if they wanted to. That was one of their terms.  If they were going to participate in the process, they were demanding that we would have to empower them to kill the final product by a filibuster, if they wanted to.  Well, I just think that tax reform, tax relief for low- and middle-income families like we provide in this bill and the pro-growth policies through the reforms in this bill are too important to allow the minority to kill it by filibuster. It would have been malpractice on our part to allow that possibility, and so we didn't.  All that means is one thing. All it means is, the final passage on this legislation is not 60 votes, but it is 51. That is all. Any Democrat can offer any amendment. Any Democrat can join us in supporting this legislation. That was also true in committee, and it will be true right through the end of this process.  Our Democratic colleagues also had other stipulations in their letter. They said there can be no savings in the tax reform package for the people who pay 40 percent of all the taxes. It is actually really hard to do pro-growth, meaningful tax reform if you say the people who pay 40 percent of all the taxes must not be allowed to get any benefit whatsoever.  Another feature in their letter was that there could be no savings for the very substantial category of American businesses organized as what we call passthroughs--these are partnerships and subchapter S corporations--because under the stipulations in their public letter, there couldn't be any benefit at all to anyone whose income was in the top 1 percent. Well, there are a lot of passthroughs that have some ownership on the part of people who are in that income category.  My point is, they were systematically taking themselves out of the discussion from the very beginning. Despite that, we had an open process. We had unlimited amendments, and they participated in that process.  Now I would like to address the issue my colleague from Maryland raised, which is the deductibility of State and local taxes. I just want to say, for me, disallowing the deductibility of State and local taxes and offsetting that with lower income tax rates for everyone--which is what we do in our bill, among other things--it is a matter of fairness. It is just a simple matter of fairness.  Under our current policy, which our Democratic colleagues would prefer we keep, the current policy of allowing people to deduct their State and local taxes and requiring higher Federal income taxes for all Americans as a result, that amounts to a subsidy that is paid by people in low-tax jurisdictions that gets sent to people in high-tax jurisdictions.  For the life of me, I don't understand why my constituents in Dauphin County, PA--a relatively lower tax place--should have to pay higher Federal income taxes so a very wealthy guy who owns a penthouse on the Upper West Side of Manhattan can deduct the very substantial taxes he chooses to pay because he lives in a very high-tax jurisdiction.  How is that fair that a person of much more modest means should have to subsidize a person of great means through the Tax Code? I don't think that is fair, but it is also unfair not just from one State to another but even within a State it is really not fair.  Let me illustrate my point with an example. Let's imagine you have two families who have the same financial circumstances. They are neighbors, but they happen to live on either side of a municipal boundary. One family lives on the side of a town that provides a lot of services and has high property taxes, which pays for the services. Maybe they pick up the trash. Maybe the town picks up the leaves. They provide lots of services. They have a nice community center. So the family has higher property taxes to pay for all of that.  Then the other family on the other side, in a different township right next door, they don't get their leaves picked up, they don't get the trash hauled away, they don't have a nice community center, but they have lower property taxes.  Now, the family who doesn't have all those services, they have to privately contract for those services. They have to go hire a company to take away their trash barrels. They have to hire a company to take away their leaves. They have to pay to join a gym or a recreational facility, and they don't get to deduct any of those expenses. They don't get to deduct the cost of paying someone to take their trash away or leaf removal or their membership at a local gym or facility like that.  So how is it fair that one person gets all of those services and gets to deduct the costs in the form of deducting the property taxes that pay for it, and the[[Page S7684]]other person, otherwise identically situated, does not get to deduct the cost? That just does not strike me as fair.  So all we are doing is saying: Let's be fair about this. Let's just be fair. Let's disallow that deduction. For the most part, we do preserve a portion of that, but the principle is to reduce the ability to deduct these taxes because it is more fair, and then what we can do as a result is we can lower the income tax rates paid by everyone.  I think that is a step in the direction of fairness, and it is one of the things that I think is a good feature in the bill.  I see my colleague the Senator from Montana is here so I will yield the floor to him.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Heller).

303,topic-id,1354,"Mr.President, I want to talk about one of the truly pro-growth features in this tax reform that is going to encourage investment in the United States, new business creation, startup, expansion, and hiring that will be associated with that. That means new jobs, more demand for workers, and higher wages.  What am I referring to? I am referring to one of the things we do on the business side of this tax reform. The way I think about it, there are several big features that are going to drive economic growth on the business side of the Tax One is certainly lowering the top rate from the 35 percent that makes us uncompetitive in the global economy to 20 percent, which puts us pretty close to dead even among our competitors. That is one. That is an important part.  The second one that I think is even more powerful is simply allowing businesses to recognize, for tax purposes, expenses when they actually occur. Allow businesses, when they buy equipment and put that equipment to work in a factory or when buying earth-moving equipment or new machinery, to recognize that cost when it occurs. By allowing them to recognize that cost when it occurs, they can afford to purchase more of that equipment.  Why is that important?  That is important because that is the source of enhanced worker productivity. Workers are more productive when they have machinery and equipment to work with. This is why capital drives productivity growth. It is the investment in that new equipment that creates demand for workers but also makes the worker more productive. The example I like to use that I think illustrates it reasonably well is this: If you go to a construction site and you have two guys working on that site and one of them is operating a backhoe and the other is using a shovel, they are both digging a hole; they are both moving dirt. Which one do you think gets paid more? It is not a close call. The[[Page S7692]]guy who is operating the backhoe is getting paid more on every such job site in America, not because there is a law that requires it but because he is a more productive worker. He has a skill set, and he is using major equipment that allows him to be much, much more productive than any human being can be with a simple hand tool. That is an illustration of how it is that when a company is able to put that equipment to work, the worker benefits.  That worker operator is not the only one who benefits, because somebody has to make the backhoe. Someone has to work at the factory that builds the backhoe that was bought. So what we are doing when we allow this expensing to occur--when we allow businesses, for tax purposes, to recognize the expense when it occurs rather than gradually over time, we simply make it more affordable for business to put capital to work, to buy the kind of equipment to help them grow and help them help their workers become more productive. That is why this is a very constructive, pro-growth feature in our tax reform that is going to be very, very helpful to workers.  But there is a third feature in our business tax reform that is also going to be great for America, and that is going to be our change from the current global tax system that we apply on the subsidiaries and affiliates of multinational companies--the change away from a global system to a territorial system. So what does that mean? So a global system is the system we have today, and America is unfortunately almost unique in the world in having this very counterproductive system.  Here is how it works. If a subsidiary of an American company goes overseas--say they go to England--and they open a business there because they want to serve the English population and they want to sell a product in So they go to England, they open their business, they make a profit, and they have to pay a tax to the English That is normal. That is what any company operating there has to do.  What America does, what we do in our Tax Code that almost no one else does is, we say: After you have paid that tax to the English Government, if you would like to dividend that money back to your parent company so it can be invested back home in America, we are going to charge you another layer of tax. We are going to make sure the combination of what you pay there and what you bring back home hits 35 percent, which is our current rate. It is completely uncompetitive.  So, if you think about it, the rest of the world has a different system. They have the system which we know as a territorial system, and the idea there is the subsidiary in England pays its tax to the English Government and then whatever aftertax profit they choose to send home to their parent, if it is a French company or German company or a company somewhere else in the world, there is no additional tax layer.  So which country do you think has a competitive advantage doing business in England? Anyone other than the United This has been the very reason that you have seen these inversions, these American companies getting acquired by other companies. In many cases, it is not about the economics, it is not about synergies, it is because there is a tax advantage to having a multinational headquartered almost anywhere other than the United There are a lot of good jobs at a corporate headquarters. There is management and sales and finance and planning and all kinds of really good jobs. We are losing these systematically because we have this system that nobody else in the world has--almost nobody else has--that punishes companies when they bring that money back home.  So what are we going to do? We are going to change our system from one of the worst in the world to what I think is going to be one of the best. What we are going to do is we are going to say: Well, a company operating overseas has to pay that local tax, but we are not going to punish that company with another layer of tax when they bring that money back home to America and invest here. Most estimates of how much money--I should point out, you only get hit with that tax penalty if you bring that money home and reinvest it in That is how crazy this is. It is called the deferral system.  The common popular estimates by the economists who looked at this is that there are somewhere between $2 trillion, maybe even more than $3 trillion of earnings by the subsidiaries of American-based multinationals, where they have paid the tax overseas, as they must, but they refuse to bring the money back home because they don't want to get hit with this huge tax. So think about all this money that is overseas somewhere else and not being invested in  I have had conversations with CEOs who have told me they want to invest in the United States, but the tax makes it prohibitively expensive to bring it home, and therefore they are looking for opportunities overseas where they will not have this tax.  We have to end this and we are going to end this in this bill and that is going to put an end to the tax incentive for these inversions--the movement overseas of corporate headquarters. It is going to make America a great place to invest and to headquarter a multinational company, and it is going to encourage that kind of growth. It is one of the central pillars of our business tax reform that is very constructive and very important.  I see my colleague from South Dakota is with us, and I will yield the floor now to him.

1124,topic-id,2072,"I thank the Senator from Texas and the Presiding  Let's describe what is really going on. There are two big accomplishments with this legislation that I am really proud of, and they are the reason that this is going to succeed and that this is going to be a big success for the American people.  The first thing we do is we absolutely directly lower the tax on lower income and middle-income Americans, hard-working families, and folks who live paycheck to paycheck. The fact is, virtually all of them are going to get a significant tax cut. That is fact 1.  The second fact is, we fundamentally restructure the way we tax business so that we can be competitive, so that our workers can compete and win against companies from anywhere in the world, so that we will have more jobs, more companies, and existing companies will expand.  Those are the two things we are trying to do. That is what is in this bill, and that is why this is a great deal for the people I represent. Let me go through these individually.  The first is on the individual side of the Tax I have said it before, and I will say it again. It doesn't matter how many times my colleagues on the other side get this wrong, the fact is, we are lowering taxes for every single[[Page S7515]]income category--absolutely, no exceptions, every category, and they know it. They absolutely know it. We do this through a number of mechanisms.  We double the standard deduction, so that on the first $24,000 that a couple earns, they pay no tax at all--none, zero, nothing--and then the income above that is taxed at very low rates, and there are other deductions that are available beyond that. The fact is, that is one of our tools. Another is that we lower the rates. The rates that are applied to income are lower under our bill than under current law. We increased the child tax credit dramatically. That is another huge source of savings for people who have children in our country. That is a fact.  Let me start with this simple chart, which is a simple and compelling fact that is going to be hard for our colleagues on the other side to ignore.  A family of four who earns a median income, which is $73,000 in America--a family of four: mom, dad, and two kids--is going to save $2,200 a year in a lower tax bill. Their taxes go down by $2,200 a year. How is that not a tax cut? How is that not good for that family? It is, and that is a fact. That is absolutely typical. That is just one illustration.  The second fact--and this chart is a little bit harder to read, but the folks on the Joint Committee on Taxation quantify whether people in different income categories are going to pay more or less. It is broken down into narrow incremental changes in income, showing people who earn less than $10,000; people who earn between $10,000 and $20,000; $20,000 to $30,000; all the way up. This column is titled ``Change in Federal Taxes.'' In every single category, the dollar amount goes down. It is negative because every category of Americans is going to have a savings. We designed it that way. By design, there is a tax savings for all working families, all categories of income, all middle-income families. That is the reality. That is a fact that is illustrated here. And it is not my word; it is the Joint Tax Committee in their report of November 27.  Finally, let's take a look at the last chart. What this shows is who gets the biggest percentage of relief, because it is not uniform across all the different categories of income. What do we see? The biggest tax cuts tend to be for the folks who have more modest income. Again, this is not my data. This is from the Joint Committee on Taxation, completely independent of us. The higher income folks get some tax relief, but it is not as much, relative to the percentage increase of savings for lower income and middle-income people. So those are the facts.  We can have lots of discussions about things on which we disagree, and we disagree on a lot of things. These guys want higher taxes. We like lower taxes. These guys like to redistribute wealth. We like people to be free to earn more and keep more of what they earn. There are lots of differences, but let's at least stick to the facts. These are the facts.  Now, let me move on to a discussion about the other big part of it. I said that there are two big accomplishments in this bill. One is direct tax relief for the people we represent. That is a fact. The second is making the changes to our business Tax Code so that we can actually have the economic growth we have been waiting for and have the prosperity we have been waiting for.  The fact is that we have lived through the weakest economic recovery in American history. In every past severe recession--even ordinary recessions--the economy has always come roaring back, and we have achieved economic growth that puts us back on the path we were on before the recession. That is what is normal for America--strong economic growth.  It didn't happen this time. It didn't happen after the great recession, and it is not just a coincidence. Now, as my colleague from Texas pointed out, there are some folks on the other side who think that America isn't the country it was and just can't really have strong economic growth anymore. That is absolutely nonsense. It is ridiculous. We are entirely capable of restoring the robust growth that allows our constituents to have a better standard of living. There is nothing about America that has lost that ability to grow and prosper. That is ridiculous.  What has happened over the last 8 years is that we have had the wrong policies. President Obama and our Democratic colleagues got everything they wanted when they had complete control of the government: huge tax increases, massive wasteful spending bills they called the stimulus, government virtual takeover of healthcare, massive overregulation of the whole economy. Lo and behold, the result was exactly what we feared--really weak economic growth, actually unprecedented weak growth for an extended period of time.  Well, one of the problems they inflicted on us was some really bad tax policy and multiple tax increases. While the rest of the world has been making their tax code on the business side more competitive and more aggressive, we have actually gone backwards. We haven't had a major reform since 1986, and the incremental changes have been counterproductive. So here is a big chance to make a huge improvement.  One of the things I am most excited about with this is that I am completely convinced that the passage of our bill is going to address one of the most persistent and really maddening challenges that we have, which is stagnant wages of working They have been stagnant for years. So you might ask: Why are they stagnant? Again, it is not a great mystery, and it is not an accident. Under the Obama administration era, we saw a collapse in the growth of invested capital. That means investment in the kind of equipment that makes workers more productive.  It is growing worker productivity that allows us to have higher wages. Think about it this way. You go to a construction site, and you have two guys digging holes. One guy is operating a backhoe, and one guy is swinging a shovel. Which one is getting paid more? I guarantee you every time it is the guy operating the backhoe, and it is not because there is a minimum wage there that forces it. It is because the guy operating the backhoe is more productive. He has a set of skills, and he is using them on a big piece of expensive equipment. He is able to dig a lot more dirt in any unit of time than the guy swinging the shovel. When business is able to put capital to work, workers become more productive and they make more money. That is what is going to happen under our bill.  One of the things we do, fundamentally, about the business side of our Tax Code is that we lower the cost of investing in that new equipment--that new tractor, that new vehicle, that new machinery, filling that new plant with the ability to produce more goods and services. Our bill makes that more affordable, and when you make that more affordable, guess what, businesses buy more tractors and factories and backhoes. When they buy those things, someone has to operate them. That means they are creating new jobs. Guess what. Someone else got to have a job in building it in the first place. I know that some of our colleagues don't understand how that leads to growth. They don't understand. So I am trying to explain this. If you have more invested capital, you increase the productive capacity of the economy, you produce more goods and services, you have more workers needed to do that and more wages.  Guess what. Businesses don't go out and raise wages because they wake up one day and decide: Oh, I think I will be generous today. That is not what happens. What happens is they have to compete for workers. They need more employees. There is a limited number, and so they start bidding up wages. That is what I want to see, and we are going to see that. We are going to see so much demand for workers that companies have no choice but to offer more compensation, better terms. That is how people have a higher standard of living. That is how they get the pay raise they ought to have.  Let me mention another provision in our bill that is extremely constructive. We are fixing a badly flawed international treatment for our multinational companies. I think our Senator from Oregon, our Democratic colleague, has acknowledged real problems in the way our system works. The short version is that we have a system that encourages companies to move overseas. Has anybody heard of inversions? I think we all have.[[Page S7516]]  Why do companies invert? It is because there is a tax code that drives it. It is now very hard to explain and justify why you would headquarter a multinational company in the United States when we see uniquely put multinational companies at a competitive disadvantage because of our tax system. So we are changing that so that we can compete.  It is very good to have multinationals headquartered in I have a number of them in There are great jobs in Pennsylvania supporting all of their business domestically and supporting a lot of their business internationally.  Now, in order to cover the cost of what we are doing--the tax reductions, the rates reductions, allowing the lower cost for deploying capital--we have some offsets. We have ways that we are asking business to pay more taxes, in some respects, where it will not be harmful for economic growth. We limit the amount of interest that a business is going to be able to deduct going forward. We limit deductions that favor certain industries over others. We limit deductions for certain fringe benefits, and we close a lot of loopholes. That helps us generate the revenue that allows us to have the constructive pro-growth features, like lower marginal rates and lowering the cost of putting capital to work. So that is what we are trying to do here. That is what we do in our legislation.  The effect of this is very, very clear. A large number of economists have acknowledged that it is going to mean more business investment, more new businesses being launched, businesses moving from overseas back to America, expansion of existing businesses. All of that activity requires more workers--all of it--to fill the additional jobs that are going to be created. That means more jobs, but it also means upward pressure on wages if everyone has a job now because businesses are going to have to compete.  To be continued.

1165,topic-id,372,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his kind courtesy in agreeing to let me take 2 minutes to reply to my friend and colleague from  If this legislation is signed into law, we are going to have a smaller deficit in future years than we are on a path to have now, and I want to explain why. Fundamentally, I think most of us agree that tax reform done properly generates more economic growth than a terrible tax code. The right incentives lead to stronger growth. This is not a simple tax cut; this is a complete overhaul.  We have $5.5 trillion worth of tax reductions, mostly offset with $4.1 trillion of base broadeners. It is a net of about $1.4 trillion. The effect is to fundamentally change the incentives--incentives to invest, buy new capital equipment, bring money back from overseas, start new businesses. They are powerful.  The question becomes this: How much more economic growth do we need to generate in order to have additional Federal revenue that will offset the static score at which this bill is scored?  We know the answer to that; Joint Tax has given us the answer to that. What we need is a mere four-tenths of 1 percent of extra economic growth on average over the next 10 years. If we get that--less than one-half of 1 percent of economic growth--then we will fully fill in this hole and, relative to current policy, have a smaller deficit than we are on track for. We are talking about going from 1.9 percent economic growth, which is the current CBO's term projection, to 2.3. This year we are running at 3 percent, even before we do this.  I strongly urge my colleagues: If we pass this--if you care as much as I know the Senator from Maine does about our budget situation, if you care about our deficits, if you would like to have smaller deficits and less debt, pass this legislation. Let's have the economic growth that is going to swamp this really modest score as a percentage of the revenue that we are forecasted to take in.  Again, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his kind courtesy.

1210,topic-id,639,"Mr.President, I believe the Senator from Vermont is next up, and he has graciously agreed to let me take 2 minutes of time out of our side now, before he speaks, so I appreciate that. I thank Senator  Our colleagues were talking about a number of topics. One that they brought up was the SALT controversy, and the other was the individual mandate. I am going to very briefly touch on these and hopefully have a chance to expand on these at another time.  Let's be very clear about what SALT is. This is an acronym for the State and local tax deduction. This is a provision in the Federal Tax Code that allows taxpayers to deduct from their Federal return the State and local taxes that they pay.  Some States have very high State and local taxes, and others have relatively low ones. So what we have now in the current law is a mechanism by which low-tax States are required to subsidize high-tax It is not only States, by the way; it is also within a given But I don't know how it could possibly be fair to force my constituents who live in, say, Dauphin County, PA, and have relatively modest services and pay a modest amount of taxes--why they should pay more in income taxes to subsidize someone who gets to live in a multimillion dollar condo in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, but that is exactly what happens.  What we are doing is neutralizing this. We are saying: No, you are not going to be able to have this subsidy. Everyone is going to pay their own State and local taxes, and we will have a lower rate of Federal income tax as a result.  Let's be very clear. This benefits the wealthiest taxpayers. It is the wealthiest taxpayers who take the State and local tax deduction. A big majority of ordinary taxpayers take the standard deduction. They don't itemize. They don't take the State and local tax deduction. This is a blow for fairness among the States, but also within a State where you have varying tax jurisdictions.  The second thing I want to point out is the individual mandate repeal. That is what we call it. In honesty, as we all know, what we have done is--we are zeroing out the penalty, the tax imposed on people who cannot afford or do not wish to purchase an ObamaCare plan. That is all we are doing here. Not a single person is disqualified. Not a single person loses the benefit. There is no reduction in reimbursements to any healthcare providers. There is no spending. There is no reduction in spending. The word ``Medicare'' doesn't come up; ``Medicaid'' doesn't come up.  What we are simply saying is this: If you find that these ObamaCare plans are not suitable for you and your family or you can't afford them, we are no longer going to hit you with a tax penalty for the fact that you can't afford this plan that is not well suited for you. That is all.  Again, let's be clear about who this affects. This terrible tax hits low-income people the hardest. In Pennsylvania, 83 percent of the people who pay the individual mandate tax make less than $50,000.  What a terrible offense to our sense of freedom--the idea that the Federal Government would force someone to purchase a product or a service that they don't want to buy, a service or product that doesn't meet their needs, and then hit them with a tax if they don't purchase it. It was always a very bad idea. This is a blow for freedom, and it is a tax relief measure, especially for low-income people.  I thank the Senator from Vermont for giving me this time.

In our bill, the corporate rate goes from 35 down to 20 percent in 2019. On the basis of 1 year of a competitive corporate rate, we are supposed to believe that corporations are going to change their behavior and make the kind of investment that follows from the incentives we have when they know, if this were adopted, that the rate goes back to 35 1 year later? This is designed to be a self-fulfilling prophecy to guarantee that there can be no growth, and then we go back to uncompetitive, very high corporate tax rates that is stipulated right here at 35 percent  ",CREC-2017-11-30-pt1-PgS7508-4.txt,1594,"BROWNFIELDS ENHANCEMENT, ECONOMIC REDEVELOPMENT, AND REAUTHORIZATION",2017,30,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1236,topic-id,275,"I will take back my time.  Let me explain how this works. The whole idea behind our bill is to create the incentives that will encourage the investment that hasn't been happening. The last 10 years, there has been a collapse, a collapse in the investment growth of capital stock, a collapse in productivity growth, and therefore stagnant wages.  What I want to do, and what my colleagues want to do, is see that wage growth that we have been waiting for that didn't happen under the last administration. The only way we can encourage that investment is if the investors know the tax rate is going to be there permanently. If we tell them you are going to get 1 year of a low rate, who is going to invest in a new factory for 1 year? It will not work that way. The wage growth will come when investors around the world and domestically have the confidence they are going to be investing in a competitive regime.  By the way, the average tax rate of the OECD--the countries that we compete with--is 22.4 percent. It is amazing that we are able to eke out even the feeble growth that we have at a 35-percent tax rate. Our bill takes it to 20 percent and allows us to compete, but you have to keep it there so that business will actually make those investment decisions, so that people will decide to launch those new businesses, and we will have the expansion of existing businesses. That is what our legislation does, and that is why I urge my colleagues to reject this motion to commit.

1934,topic-id,611,"Mr.President, I wish to honor the life of Vietnam veteran TJ McGarvey of Upper Clair, Mr.McGarvey passed away at age 74 on November 13, 2017. He is survived by his loving family and the countless friends and neighbors whose lives he touched during a lifetime of service and commitment to his country and community.  As a member of ``The Walking Dead,'' 1st battalion, 9th Marines, Cpl TJ McGarvey served in Vietnam from March 1967 to April 1968. Only a month after deploying to Vietnam, Corporal McGarvey was wounded. However, he refused to accept the Purple Heart medal he earned because he did not want to upset his mother with the news.  For many, having served their country in war fulfilled a selfless act of duty--not so for Corporal His service to his country and fellow vets would remain a constant for his entire life. TJ was cofounder of the Vietnam Veterans Leadership Program, a member of the Friends of Danang, and a fierce advocate for soldiers exposed to Agent Orange, and their families.  Just days before his death, his hometown of Upper Clair held a Veterans Day ceremony at the town's Veterans Monument Much of the ceremony would honor TJ, whom a fellow veteran called ``the ultimate Marine.'' The park was the brainchild of TJ, who served as its president and key fundraiser. It honors every branch of the military and serves as both a monument to veterans and an educational instrument for visitors and local students.  TJ was known as a man of deep faith, committed to his family, and a leader in his community. As a longtime football coach at Louise de Marillac, generations of students looked to TJ as a mentor.  Ultimately, TJ's legacy will be forever linked to his efforts to ensure that veterans of the U.military will never be forgotten. In the 1980s, TJ tirelessly fought to erect a Vietnam veterans monument in The monument was dedicated on Veterans Day 1987.  The beautiful dedication to the soldiers who fought, died, and went missing in America's war with Vietnam lies peacefully along the banks of the Allegheny River on Pittsburgh's north side. A fitting tribute to the heroes of southwestern Pennsylvania ploughed by a man who lived a life quiet and humble, yet loud enough to help spark a change in the hearts of many. Here, at the confluence of three rivers which defines a community, TJ's poem defines the ethos of the monument--a tribute, but more so a fulfillment of a commitment to ensure our soldiers will never again be denied these two words: ``Welcome Home.''  It is with these words, etched in brass for all to see, that TJ adopted the voice of a remorseful community to right a wrong and fittingly honor a generation of heroes:     Welcome home to proud men and women     We begin now to fulfill promises     To remember the past     To look to the future     We begin now to complete the final process     Not to make political statements     Not to offer explanations     Not to debate realities     Monuments are erected so that the future might remember the            past     Warriors die and live and die     Let the Historians answer the political questions     Those who served--served     Those who gave all--live in our hearts     Those who are left--continue to give     As long as we remember--     There is still some love left.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.3317, the SAFE Act, legislation that will increase the Federal penalty for female genital mutilation from 5 years to 15 years.  This past April, just north of Detroit, reports of this appalling and brutal practice surfaced in my district. As a lifelong resident of southeast Michigan, I was horrified to learn that three local residents, including two physicians, professionals we trust with our children, were charged for allegedly performing and participating in this barbaric practice.  The subsequent Federal prosecution has shed light on an evil practice that has no place in southeast Michigan or the United This person who claims to be a physician is a monster and has reportedly committed this heinous act hundreds of times.  This despicable practice has no place in our society, and we must ensure our Federal laws reflect this principle. We must make it clear to Americans and the rest of the world that this practice will not be tolerated.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that over 500,000 girls in the United States have undergone or are at risk of That is 500,000 girls too many. We must set a zero tolerance against this practice. This is gender violence and oppression, and it is time for the government to punish such egregious behavior accordingly.  My bipartisan SAFE Act will increase the Federal penalty from 5 to 15 years, putting it more in line with other developed countries. We need to protect our girls right here at home, and increasing the penalty will go a long way toward accomplishing this goal.

1150,topic-id,797,"I thank the Presiding Officer for the recognition.  Mr.President, the Republicans' tax bill is a disaster for the American people. It would give the ultrawealthy a tax cut and make middle-class families pay for it. I can't tell you how strongly I am opposed to it.  We have heard a lot from the President and the Republicans about how their tax cuts will be a rising tide to lift all boats, but this claim just doesn't hold water. Look carefully. On top of $1.5 trillion in new deficits, they are hiding where more than $5 trillion of cuts over the next 10 years will come from and just who will actually benefit. The Republican budget would force steep cuts in healthcare, education, and other programs that working and middle-class families rely on.  It is a terrible plan for my home State of New Mexico, where a lot of families already have a hard time getting by. Plain and simple, the Republicans' plan is a massive redistribution of wealth. Listen to who it is taking money from and where they are giving it to. It would take money from working families, seniors, children, the sick and disabled, rural families, and the poor, and give it to the very top 1 percent. They propose it at a time when the gap between the very rich and everyone else is already growing. We now have greater income inequality in the United States than at the height of the Gilded Age over 100 years ago.  I want to highlight for my colleagues across the aisle another big problem with the Republicans' bill. It has not been talked about enough, but it is important to my home State of New Mexico and to many Western The Republicans' deficit-creating tax cuts are going to cause automatic sequestration, and this will cut several mandatory programs under the Pay-as-You-Go Some of those are the mineral royalties from oil and gas drilling and coal mining on public lands that the Federal Government shares with New Mexico's royalty share is projected to be $437 million next year. Other States count on these payments for millions of dollars in their budgets too. Colorado received over $80 million in 2016. All of that will be at risk. Wyoming received over $660 million last year. Its State budget cannot afford to lose that kind of money. Utah, Montana, and North Dakota received tens of millions in mineral payments last year as well. These are royalties that New Mexico and the States are entitled to.  In New Mexico we mainly use this money for public schools. Other States use it for vital government programs like healthcare, roads, and police.  Our State legislature has struggled the last couple of years to balance the budget. The chair and vice chair of the New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee wrote just this week to our entire delegation. They warn that losing so much revenue ``would have a devastating impact on the State's budget and would wipe out the reserves our State has struggled to rebuild.''  New Mexico school kids just can't afford to take a $437 million hit. I know it is possible for Congress to pass legislation sometime in the future to take mineral royalties out of sequestration, but there is no guarantee at all of that ever happening, and I am not willing to take chances with the education of New Mexico's school children.  The Republicans' tax cuts will also hit Medicare hard. That is also another[[Page S7522]]concern for New Mexico families. Tax cuts for the superwealthy and big corporations will mean New Mexico could lose out on about $178 million of Federal Medicare payments every year. I am opposed to trading off seniors' health just so the rich can get richer, but the Republicans seem bound and determined to take away America's healthcare, even though the American people have spoken loud and clear. They want their current healthcare rights fully protected. Republicans want to do away with the individual mandate under the Affordable Care But we also know that will mean millions of Americans will lose coverage, and we know that premiums will go up because the insurance companies will be covering a sicker population. I am opposed to trading off the American people's health just so the rich can get richer.  The majority's bill is a bad idea for basically everyone in New Mexico and across the country, except for the very wealthy individuals, multinational corporations, private equity and hedge funds. These are the folks who are being helped--the very wealthy, multinational corporations, private equity and hedge funds.  Let's instead get down to the business of governing on behalf of the American people, not just the top 1 percent  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

Mr.Speaker, the EPA's brownfields program is an important grant program for the State of Michigan and, more specifically, the district I represent, Michigan's Seventh  Because of Michigan's rich manufacturing history, there are a number of former industrial sites that are ripe for revitalization. These sites can range from large industrial manufacturing sites to local corner gas stations.  This program provides communities the chance to take abandoned and vacant sites and once again turn them into economic assets, all the while cleaning up our beautiful environment.  Just this summer, the EPA announced that the historic former Tecumseh Products site in Tecumseh, Michigan, received a $500,000 grant to revitalize this 53-acre industrial site. This $500,000 grant will go towards cleaning up the former manufacturing facility site and create more jobs in the process.

Well, they are vacant, underused, and often contaminated properties that are a blight on local communities across our The EPA's brownfields program is a successful, results-oriented program, and it provides grants to assess and clean up these polluted areas.  Since the brownfields program's inception, more than 27,000 contaminated sites have been remediated, allowing communities across the country to return them to productive use. Cleaning up brownfields sites increases local tax bases, facilitates job growth and wage increases, promotes the development of new infrastructure, improves and protects the environment--all really good public policy goals.  Over 129,000 jobs have been leveraged because of the brownfields program, and almost 70,000 acres have been made ready for reuse. The brownfields program has leveraged over $24 billion, a[[Page H9542]]significant return on the Federal investment in the program. I read somewhere it was a 16-to-1 rate of return based on Federal investment compared to what we get out of the program.                              {time}  1430  A 2017 study concluded that cleaning up brownfield properties led to a residential property value increase of up to 15 percent within a mile of these brownfield sites. Another study found an estimated $29 million to $97 million in additional tax revenues for local governments in a single year after the cleanup, which is two to seven times more than the $12.4 million the EPA contributed to the cleanup of those brownfields. So, property values go up, local tax revenues go up, communities are improved, and we create jobs with this very important program.  In my home State of Oregon, we have had a very active and effective brownfields program, and we have seen some great success in my own district. The Old Mill District in Bend--which is pictured here; this is the site of an old lumber mill--was one of those sites. It is easy to see--as the debris was here and the mill was crumbling and we lost all of those jobs--it was transformed into this incredible place with great recreation. With the reopening of the Deschutes River, we have movie theaters and restaurants and offices and residential housing all in this complex now, and it is a showplace. It is a gem of Deschutes  Bend isn't alone. In The Dalles, where I was born, Google broke ground on an expansion to their data center there on 26 acres of former mill land that was cleaned up under this program. That expansion of the Google data center is a $600 million investment, expected to create 50 new jobs.  Also, in my hometown of Hood River, the Port of Hood River just finished a brownfields cleanup of another former mill site. That opened up 12 acres of land for future business opportunities in the area.  And in southern Oregon, the city of Grants Pass is in the early stages of working towards a similar goal. They have successfully secured assistance through the brownfields program to begin planning the cleanup and redevelopment of the old Spalding Mill site.

1650,topic-id,1717,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to join other colleagues from both sides of the aisle to talk about this tax debate. We don't do tax reform nearly enough here in the United It seems we have taken it on about every 35 years whether we need to or not. But if there is one lesson we have learned from previous tax reform efforts, it is that while they can do a lot of good, they can also do a lot of harm.  I have to start by expressing my extraordinarily deep frustration with the process we have gone through. Today we are considering a bill that was drafted in secret, designed with more gimmicks and loopholes than I have ever seen, and is being rushed through the process without input from all of us on this side of the aisle and without even appropriate analysis of its true financial impact.  In many ways, to quote the President, what got us here is the worst of If you want to see swamp 101, look at the process of this tax bill. It is a 300-page tax bill that was released on the eve of a holiday weekend, only days before it was marked up in committee. Over a 4-day markup, two significant rewrites of this bill were presented. One consisted of over 100 pages of changes, and a second was released a mere 30 minutes before Members were asked to vote on its myriad of provisions. Now, less than 2 weeks later, we are considering that bill or a variation of it on the Senate floor. We are voting to proceed to the bill later today and then maybe on amendments tomorrow, before we even have any analysis from  We know that near the end of the debate on the floor, another bill will[[Page S7389]]magically appear from the majority leader's office without any time for those of us who want to do tax reform to have a chance to genuinely review or analyze its provisions. I believe it makes this process enormously dishonest.  I know my friend from Delaware has just come on. I will speak quickly because I know he will raise some of these same concerns.  One of the things I have been most involved with since I have been here in the Senate is trying to grapple with our Nation's overwhelming debt. We are a country that has run up close to $20 trillion in debt, and both sides--both sides--have been a party to that over the last 70 years.  But what I have heard from colleagues on both sides of the aisle is that when you are in that deep of a hole, you ought to stop digging, and that we need to make sure that if we are going to do tax reform, we do it in a fiscally responsible way.  This legislation is the absolute opposite of any kind of fiscal responsibility under anybody's guideline. It starts with a $1.5 trillion acknowledgement that that money will somehow magically appear through magical growth. But when you peel that away a little bit, it is bad enough that it is not really $1.5 trillion in additional debt that we are adding, the real number is $2.2 trillion. Let me tell you why. Off of the over $1.4 trillion of additional debt that is added, that alone will generate more than $230 billion of additional interest payments over the next decade, raising the cost of the bill from over $1.4 trillion to roughly $1.7 trillion. And then, in an effort that really takes the cake in a place where both sides have been known to use gimmicks, this legislation includes 37 different expiring provisions--provisions that are popular, provisions that a number of my colleagues have said give middle-class tax relief. The interesting thing is, all of these provisions are due to expire in 5 to 6 years, within the 10-year window.  Rather than acknowledging the true costs of the bill, what people have said is, we know what we are going to create. We are going to create a whole new series of fiscal cliffs, in the neighborhood of $500 billion, that the expectation will be that it will become so popular that Congress will go ahead and have to extend these provisions, again, without paying for them.  In terms of gimmicks, don't take my word for it; you only need to listen to the words of the President's own OMB Director, Mick Mulvaney, who recently acknowledged that the tax bill had a lot of gimmicks to it. Well, if we add that over $500 billion and the $230 billion of additional interest and the $1.4 trillion that we start with, what we are talking about today is a $2.2 trillion addition to our debt.  All my friends who for years have stood with me on the floor of this Senate and spoken out against adding this additional burden to our kids and grandkids, I hope they will take a moment and rethink their support for this legislation.  Some have asked: Well, how will this get paid for? I believe there might be some dynamic growth. I believe there might be some addition from some smart tax reform that would add to the growth of our economy but nothing near what this bill assumes. In fact, it is even worse than that in certain ways. Not only will this add over $2 trillion to our debt and deficit, but we have even had the audacity of the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr.Mnuchin, who said that this bill is going to be so good for our economy, it is going to decrease our debt by $1 trillion. Yet there is no responsible budget projection of any economist from left to right that makes any kind of assumption that would make that kind of prediction true at all. And, if we go back and look in recent American history, when you pay for tax cuts with borrowed money, you end up with a pretty bad situation.  Many of my friends on the other side of the aisle like to cite Ronald I think President Reagan was a great President, in many ways. President Reagan's 1981 tax cut did provide a short-term stimulus, but then that stimulus ran out and our debt and deficits grew dramatically, and President Reagan himself had to raise taxes in 1982 and 1984.  Likewise, again, President Bush, in 2001, inherited a surplus. He promised to give the magic of tax cuts that would grow our economy. Instead, we ended up with very little job growth and a debt and deficit now that is rapidly approaching the full size of our economy.  When we look at the scoring of the effects of this kind of tax cut, we see that the Tax Policy Center did a dynamic score, saying: How can we build in growth that would come from a tax cut? They said again that this bill would cost $1.5 trillion.  The Penn-Wharton Budget Model--again, an organization that is well respected by both sides of the aisle--did a dynamic score on this legislation as well. Again, they are saying the bill would still cost $1.5 trillion.  Congress's official scorekeeper, the group that we look to for outside advice, the Joint Committee on Taxation--we are rushing this bill through so quickly that we have not even allowed our official scorekeeper to come up with a score.  This is not the way to do a once-in-a-generation tax reform process.  The truth is, when you do a tax cut with borrowed money, in periods similar to where we are right now--relatively full employment--there is no historical precedent at all in which you will see any kind of economic growth.  Again, don't take my word for it. Alan Greenspan, the respected Fed Chair, pointed this out just within the last 2 weeks: Tax cuts paid for with borrowed money do not provide the kind of growth that this budget projects and that this tax reform bill projects.  I could go through a whole litany of other concerns with this legislation. I, for one, believe we do need to do international tax reform. I, for one, believe we need a corporate tax rate that is more competitive. I, for one, believe we need repatriation and we need to bring back tax profits that have gone abroad. But we have seen analyses recently that show that this legislation may actually increase the amount of American jobs that are pushed overseas, for example, because of the average of tax rates in their so-called territorial system, where a company can go ahead and build that factory in a relatively high tax State, move their intellectual property to a tax haven like the Cayman Islands, average out the tax bill combined, and end up paying our country nothing and, at the same time, continue to see job loss around our country.  There are a group of us--close to 17 of us, and many of them are my colleagues who are on the floor today--who came together yesterday and said to our Republican colleagues: Time out for a few minutes. We will work with you to do a responsible tax reform effort. We share many of the same goals. But, unfortunately, the process we are going through here today--to reach some kind of arbitrary Christmas present for the President--is not the way we ought to be doing responsible tax reform.  I hope my colleagues will reconsider. I hope they will take the offer of the 17 of us who said that we will look at corporate tax reform, we will look at lower rates, we will look at repatriation, we will look at ways to make businesses more competitive, and join with us to do this in a way in which we can all be proud. If we are going to do tax reform only once every 30 or 35 years, we sure as heck owe the American people a product that we can all be proud of, not a product that is rushed through with one party only and that, at the end of the day, will leave our kids and grandkids paying the bill for decades to come.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-11-29-pt1-PgS7380.txt,1897,RECOGNIZING ERIN HAMLIN,2017,29,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1292,topic-id,624,"Thank you, Mr. I have been sitting on the floor for a while, listening to other Senators tell amazing stories about young people who came to this country as children and how they have thrived, how they have become woven into a part of the American fabric. These are stories of courage, stories of hope, and it is inspiring to listen to these stories.  Tonight I want to add another piece to this story, and that is about why law matters--why it matters that we have a Dream This photo portrays Reina She is a Massachusetts resident. She is a student now at UMass When Reina was 11 years old, she fled from El Salvador and settled with her mother in Everett,  Reina is a model student. After completing high school and graduating with high honors from Bunker Hill Community College, she won a scholarship and transferred to UMass Boston, where she currently has a double major in philosophy and in public policy.  Until DACA came along, Reina had to live in the shadows, and living in the shadows wasn't easy. She worked long hours in a restaurant where she was subjected to sexual harassment. Knowing that she didn't have legal status, Reina's boss frequently propositioned her to have a sexual relationship with him and threatened to report her to immigration authorities if she didn't go along with what he wanted. So instead of giving in to her boss's advances, Reina quit her job, even though her boss refused to pay her for the work that she had already completed.  DACA changed the world for It meant protection. It meant that she could go to work without the fear of being sent back to a country that she barely knew. It meant that she had access to more jobs, where she wouldn't have to face exploitation, humiliation, and sexual harassment. It meant that Reina could pay instate tuition and become the first person in her family to complete college, opening up even more doors of opportunity.  Right now we are in the middle of a long overdue discussion about sexual harassment and sexual assault. Women are bravely coming forward to tell their stories about powerful men who have abused their power to hurt others. Sexual assault isn't just happening in Silicon Valley or in Hollywood or in legislative chambers. It happens all across America at hotels, fast food restaurants, and convenience stores. If you are a woman without official status, you have yet another barrier to speaking out.  When the DACA Program started, we made a promise to young people like We promised them that if they came out of the shadows, they would have an opportunity to live and to work and to go to school without the fear of deportation. We promised to protect them. Donald Trump broke that promise when he ended  But there is something that Congress can do to help Reina and people like her, young kids who have spent their lives reaching for their dreams. We can pass a clean Dream Act, a bipartisan bill that would give young people like Reina status and a path to citizenship, a bill that protects those young people without subjecting their parents or their siblings to deportation. We could do that, but time is running out.  Soon DACA recipients will begin losing their status and will be subjected to deportation. We can stop that from happening, but we have to act soon. I am ready to vote and many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are ready to vote. So I have one question for Mitch McConnell: What is stopping you?  We are ready to pass this bill. Just get it done.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-12-05-pt1-PgS7851.txt,2182,TAX REFORM,2017,5,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1610,topic-id,1092,"Mr.President, Senate Republicans are about 24 hours away from passing a bill that would make middle-class families in this country pay more taxes so big corporations and millionaires can pay less.  A bill like that would never really make sense, but it really, really doesn't make sense right now. Since 1980, corporate profits have shot through the roof, while wages for working people have remained pretty much the same. With corporate profits up and family incomes flat, who is paying the cost of running the government? Thanks to Congress, over the past 50 years, corporations have gone from picking up about 25 percent of what it costs to run the government to picking up about 9 percent or, to say it another way, hard-working families now pick up a much bigger share of the cost of running our government.  I don't care whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, this just isn't fair. Corporations are wallowing in profits while hard-pressed families are picking up the bill for our military, for our government agencies, for homeland[[Page S7502]]security, for our infrastructure, and for everything else we have to pitch in to pay for.  Here comes the Republican tax bill, which would make a bad situation worse. The Republican tax bill would slash taxes on corporations even further and raise taxes on millions of working families. It is hard to comprehend how deeply unfair that is. A survey released last May by the Federal Reserve found that 44 percent of American families--just a bit under a half--don't have enough slack in their budget to cover a $400 emergency expense. If the transmission blows up or if a kid gets sick or the fridge stops working, these families are just plain out of luck. These are the same families whom the Republicans have targeted to pay more in taxes under the Republican plan.  In trying to sell a bill that is deeply unfair, Republicans have landed on a tried-and-true strategy--just lie about it.  The first big lie is that the plan will supercharge economic growth. Spoiler alert: It will not. We have seen this movie before, and we know how it ends. There is not one single credible projection that says this plan will have any meaningful impact on the growth of the American economy. One group of economists after another has looked at this bill and said it will not do a darn thing to help the economy grow.  Even Wall Street banks--which stand to pocket billions of dollars in tax giveaways from this bill--have grudgingly had to admit the bill will not lead to any growth. Barclays Bank said: ``A permanent boost to growth remains unlikely.'' Goldman Sachs said: ``We find a boost to GDP growth of 0.1-0.2 [percentage points] in 2018-2019 and smaller amounts in subsequent years.''  The second big lie is that if we just give corporations more money, they will surely do us the favor of raising wages or creating more jobs. We have seen that movie before too. Over the last 30 years, corporate profits have exploded, and companies have not trickled down those profits to workers. They didn't do it before, and they will not do it after the Republicans give away even more money to these giant corporations.  You don't have to take my word for it. The top executives at the companies have already admitted as much. Bank of America and Merrill Lynch surveyed 300 CEOs about what they would do with their tax giveaways. What are they going to do with those tax giveaways? The top three responses: pay down debt, buy back stock, and fund new mergers. In other words, something for the banks, something for wealthy investors, and nothing for workers.  The third big lie is that the plan will not increase the national debt. That is just plain false. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says this bill will tack on $1.4 trillion to the debt in the next 10 years, and we all know what comes next. The same Republican Senators who will vote for this trillion-dollar budget buster tomorrow will turn around next week and say our national debt is just too high, and we need to cut Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, education funding, affordable housing, and you name it. In fact, the Republican budget they passed last month tees up more than $1 trillion in cuts to those very programs.  This bill raises taxes on millions of middle-class families, and it doesn't create any real economic growth. It doesn't create any real job growth, and it explodes the national debt. So this bill clearly is not about helping working families.  You really have to stop and ask the question, What is it about? The answer is simple. This is about Republican Senators paying off the rich corporate donors that helped get them elected. It is about the way that money has corrupted It is about wealthy donors investing a few million dollars in political contributions to secure billions of dollars in tax giveaways.  Here is what one of my Republican colleagues said recently: If we don't pass a tax bill, ``financial contributions will stop.'' A Republican Member of the House was even more blunt. He said on the record that his donors told him to pass this tax bill or ``don't ever call them again.'' In other words, Republicans have said to each other they need to pass a tax giveaway to give their donors money in order to get reelected. This is a smash-and-grab job.  The Republicans are looting the U.Treasury so their donors will keep funding their reelection campaigns. They don't even try to hide the corruption, and they don't worry about how many middle-class families get hurt in the caper. My take on this is pretty simple: I don't think a single middle-class family in this country should pay more in taxes so big corporations and millionaires can pay less. I think big corporations should pay more--not less--so we can cut taxes on working families and small businesses, so we can make investments in fixing our roads and our bridges and our power grid, so we can help young people reduce their student loan debt.  This is about basic fairness. We can build an America where every kid has a shot at success, where every family has some measure of economic security, where every senior has enough savings to retire with dignity. We can do that, and we can start by defeating this Republican tax giveaway.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

2062,topic-id,545,"Mr.Speaker, more jobs, bigger paychecks, and fairer taxes. Those are the three big promises of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and I am proud to lend my support.  This tax relief legislation serves as an opportunity for all American families to achieve the American dream--because it is crafted with working families and providing relief for the middle class in mind.  This bill does much to reform and revitalize the tax code. I look forward to doing even more to assist American families and communities, ensure U.companies can fairly compete with foreign counterparts, and close existing loopholes in our laws. For years, our nation's high corporate tax rate has created an unlevel playing field for U.businesses to compete in global markets. By reducing rates and moving to a territorial system much in line those of our international competitors, we will incentivize companies to build investment here, thereby creating new jobs and increasing take-home pay for hardworking  Further compounding this problem is the ability, in some industries, for foreign-based competitors to exploit loopholes in the tax code to avoid taxes altogether. For instance, under current law foreign-based reinsurers to transfer a portion of their profits to offshore tax havens, and thus shielded from our corporate tax rate, has essentially gutted the domestic reinsurance industry over; the last two decades. Rather than allowing our domestic insurers to effectively compete, this uneven and unfair playing field instead promotes the use of foreign inversions and affiliate transactions to achieve a lower tax rate. This environment erodes the U.tax base to the tune of billions, and forces U.insurers to decide whether solely-domestic operations, which many have maintained for decades, is worth paying a higher effective tax rate. Mr.Speaker, these are not decisions that our tax code should force on job creators.  As our country competes with the rest of world in a 21st century global economy, it is essential that our tax policies offer opportunities for job creators in the United States of all sizes to grow, thrive, create jobs, and increase the take-home pay for all hard-working Americans so that they may thrive and seek their dreams.  As the U.economic engine drives forward, aided significantly by the passage of this historic legislation, we must also ensure that neglected and distressed communities are kept in mind. My district in southern Ohio has leveraged the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) and Historic Tax Credit (HTC) to bring hundreds of millions of dollars of investment to such areas, and the net result is thousands of permanent new jobs and housing units in my district alone.  Given the positive impacts these pro-growth credits have had in my district and across the country, I was hopeful for the preservation of NMTC and HTC as my colleagues on the Ways & Means Committee crafted this legislation. While H.1 would repeal both credits, the Senate's proposal would retain the NMTC and a modified version of the I hope the House and Senate come to a productive solution in conference.  More broadly, I encourage my colleagues in the upcoming House and Senate conference process to produce a final version that will ensure our tax relief creates a level playing field for all competitors in an interconnected world, and realizes the vast potential of our nation's overlooked communities.

1727,topic-id,1803,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.Gosar), my friend and colleague, for yielding me this time.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.3905, the Minnesota's Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest Act, or the MINER This act does not remove or reduce the permitting requirements should a future project ultimately be developed in the Superior National  But nearly a year after President Obama's departure from the White House, I stand before this body to speak in favor of a bill that would rectify an injustice placed upon Minnesotans by the previous administration.  As we have heard throughout this debate, on President Obama's last day in office, the previous administration pulled such a politically motivated stunt that appears more as a thumb-in-the-eye of hardworking Minnesotans than sound policy.  Without a second thought, and one stroke of his pen, President Obama proposed withdrawing over 200,000 acres from future mineral exploration while, simultaneously, rejecting a renewal application for a hard rock mining operation that had been renewed in 1989 and 2004, without controversy.  This decision endangered thousands of jobs. These are good-paying jobs that are significantly higher than the median average wage in Minnesota and the United Additionally, that decision could devastate the State's permanent school trust fund that will support nearly 900,000 K-12 students statewide if the withdrawal application and canceled leases are not rejected. At a time when it is vital that our teachers and students are given the resources they require, it would be foolish to allow this to take place.  Some may ask why a Member from Arkansas would care about this decision. It is close to 1,000 miles away from my district to the Superior National The answer though is twofold, and it is simple.  The first, it restores Federal land management oversight back to where it belongs, the United States H.3905 will prevent executive order overreach by requiring congressional approval of all mineral or monument withdrawals within National Forest System lands in Minnesota and reverses the unwarranted action taken under the Obama administration to unilaterally block responsible mineral development in the Superior National  Secondly, as someone who represents communities, counties, and schools that depend on the safe, responsible harvest and mining of our natural resources, I understand the real devastation that will take place, not only in Minnesota, but possibly in my district and other areas across the country if H.3905 is not passed.  Mr.Speaker, for the protection of our constitutional system of checks and balances, and preservation of rural economies, I believe that it is vital that we pass this piece of legislation. I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of H.3905.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 53 bipartisan Minnesota State legislators, a letter from Jobs for Minnesotans, and a letter from the Minnesota Pipe Trades                                                November 27, 2017.     Congressman Tom Emmer,     Washington,       Dear Congressman Emmer: As elected leaders of the Minnesota      Legislature, we are writing in strong support of H.3905.      This legislation supports jobs, economic development and      industry in Northeast Minnesota, and will reverse an onerous,      overreaching and politically-motivated decision by the Obama      Administration that withdrew nearly 240,000 acres of federal      lands and minerals from potential development. H.3905 will      halt these last-minute land withdrawals, reinstate leases      affected by that decision including the Twin Metals' lease,      and require congressional approval for any future withdrawal      actions.       The decision by the Obama Administration last January put      jobs and nearly $2.5 billion of our state's economy at risk.      Furthermore, it risked the depression of the precious metals,      technology, infrastructure and manufacturing industries in      our state, and the economic well-being of Northeast      Minnesota--a region where mining has been an economic anchor      since the late nineteenth century. And that's not to mention      the estimated four billion ton deposit of copper, nickel, and      other strategic minerals located within the Duluth Complex      which could generate as much as $3 billion in royalty      revenues for the state's Permanent School Trust Fund--     resources that would support education for nearly 900,000 K-     12 students across the state.       H.3905 also reaffirms our shared commitment to the      protection of our environment and support of a thorough and      proper environmental review process for the mineral leases,      as well as upholds our state's commitment to restricting      mineral development in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area      Wilderness and Mine Protection       The expansion of the precious metals mining industry offers      generations of Minnesotans thousands of good-paying jobs,      billions of dollars in investment in industry, and billions      of dollars in revenue for Minnesota schools. Moreover, it      provides an incredible opportunity to further establish our      nation's economic and energy independence from foreign      nations. The decision to remove vast amounts of federal land      from potential development and blocking the Twin Metals'      federal mineral lease renewal was short-sighted and damaging.

Re In Support of MINER     Erik Paulsen,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Congressman Paulsen: I'm writing on behalf of      legislation described below but wanted to let you know I had      submitted a request to meet in person, as I plan to be in      Washington the week after I hope you have time      to meet with me. Thank you for considering.       On behalf of the coalition Jobs for Minnesotans, which      represents business, labor and communities across the state,      I am writing in strong support of H.3905, the Minnesota's      Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest Act, known as      the MINER This bipartisan legislation sponsored by      Congressman Tom Emmer (MN-6th) and co-sponsored by      Congressmen Collin Peterson (MN-7th), Jason Lewis (MN-2nd)      and Paul Gosar (AZ-4th) seeks to ensure the proper      consideration of future job growth and economic opportunity      in northeastern Minnesota by requiring congressional approval[[Page H9507]]     of any mineral withdrawal or monument designation involving      the National Forest System lands in the state. It also      provides for the renewal of certain mineral leases and      ensuring that future leases in northeastern Minnesota remain      valid and renewed as outlined by current law. H.3905 is      currently before the House Rules Committee and is expected to      reach the House floor in coming weeks.       H.3905 leaves intact existing environmental review      processes and standards and restates Congress' prohibition of      any mining activity in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area      Wilderness (BWCAW) and surrounding protective buffer. As      such, it reaffirms long-standing Congressional intent in      management and development of critical minerals in Minnesota      and cuts bureaucratic delays in assessing responsible mine      project proposals.       Unfortunately, federal agency actions in December 2016      jeopardized the economic future of the region by canceling      valid, long-standing federal mineral leases and withdrawing      235,000 acres of federal land in the region from future      mining development. This was contrary to the previous      directives by Congress in 1950 and again in 1978. In 1950      Congress made land available for mineral exploration and      development within the Superior National Forest (SNF) within      the Iron Range region. In 1978, while Congress prohibited      mining within the BWCAW and an adjacent protective buffer      zone, it also reaffirmed that mining should be allowed and      promoted in the remaining area of the       The agency actions in 2016 would block the potential      creation of thousands of jobs, billions of dollars in      economic growth, and billions more in revenues for      Minnesota's public schools through mineral development on      state school trust lands.       H.3905 aims to correct these injustices, which is why we      strongly urge you to cast your vote in support of it. Thank      you very much.

The total      withdrawal application boundary spans 425,000 acres,      including 95,000 acres of state school trust fund lands.       With this policy in place, Minnesotans lost their mineral      rights. Unable to utilize these natural resources, 17,000      jobs are at risk and roughly $2.5 billion of economic      activity is jeopardized.

As the National Rural Letter Carriers' Association notes, these carriers are essentially post offices on wheels, providing many of the same services to rural residents that urban dwellers take for granted.  One such rural carrier was Larry Earl Robertson from Jessieville, Larry was my mailman for more than 25 years and, as many rural letter carriers throughout our country can attest, he was a part of our family. He knew my wife and children, just as we knew his family. He was an integral part of our community and played an important role in the lives of rural Garland County residents. Simply put, Larry was a friend to everyone. Just as Larry was a friend to all, he was also a faithful Christian and family man.  Through his service--at just 54--he had made an important and lasting impact on his community, as many rural letter carriers do. That is why it was especially sad when we received word of his untimely passing last week. In the pain and grief of death, we take comfort in the words of Christ who said: ``I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live.''

1565,topic-id,1761,"Mr.President, in this season of Thanksgiving, let me say that I am thankful, as I rise for my 187th ``Time to Wake Up'' address, for the spirit of commitment and innovation that this great Nation devotes to tackling the challenge of climate change, even with this  The United States now is alone in the world as the only Nation not committed to the historic Paris Agreement, but at the U.Climate Change Conference in Germany, I saw firsthand that Americans are still committed to climate action. Corporate leaders like Mars, Microsoft, Facebook, and Walmart were there to discuss the role American corporations can take on climate change. American Governors, mayors, universities, and many other corporations all brought the same message to Bonn; that notwithstanding the corrupted Trump administration, America is still in.  Senators Cardin, Markey, Schatz, Merkley, and I sent the message that most of our constituents and the majority of the American people believe[[Page S7353]]that climate change is a serious threat to our country and the planet and that American action and leadership is necessary.  An entire day was dedicated to the changes we are seeing in the world's oceans. This is where the industry liars and climate deniers get stumped. The oceans bear the brunt of our carbon pollution. Sea levels are rising, waters are warming, and seas are acidifying. These undeniable measurements have no answer from the climate denial apparatus, so the denial apparatus just chooses to ignore the oceans, but we can't ignore the oceans, certainly not in coastal  The reality of ocean climate change hits home along our coasts: Warming waters move our fisheries around, sea level rise erodes our shores, and we must prepare for more frequent and intense hurricanes and storms.  The Trump administration is more or less completely crooked on this subject, but even they had to throw in the towel and release without amendment the recent U.``Climate Science Special Report.'' They had no scientific rebuttal--none--to the dozen Federal Agencies and Departments that assembled the latest and best understanding of the effects of climate change on the United They couldn't rebut it. They chose to ignore it.  Will that report affect this administration's industry-paid climate policies? Of course not. Those policies are bought and paid for. But it is worth looking at the ``Climate Science Special Report.'' This report gave special attention to storms. The report says:       For Atlantic--  That is, the ocean off my home State of Rhode Island--     and eastern North Pacific--  That is, the ocean off our western coast--     and eastern North Pacific typhoons, increases are projected      in precipitation rates and intensity. The frequency of the      most intense of these storms is projected to increase.  The report continues:       Assuming storm characteristics do not change, sea level      rise will increase the frequency and extent of extreme      flooding associated with coastal storms, such as hurricanes      and nor'easters.  Extreme flooding matters quite a lot in Rhode  The report continues:       A projected increase in the intensity of hurricanes in the      North Atlantic could increase the probability of extreme      flooding along most of the U.Atlantic and Gulf Coast      states beyond what would be projected based solely on      relative sea level rise.  It is going to happen just from projected sea level rise. This means that extreme flooding could exceed those predictions because of storm activity.  Humans are driving these changes, the report says, not the alternative explanation for these changes offered by the climate deniers. Oh, wait; that is right. They have no alternative explanation. They have nothing. They have nothing but industry-funded denial. There is no alternative explanation to what the scientists say, which is actually consistent with the finding of the ``Climate Science Special Report'' that there is ``no convincing alternative explanation.''  That is not the only report. Last year, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a report titled ``Effects of Climate Change and Coastal Development on U.Hurricane Damage: Implications for the Federal Budget.'' That report projected that by 2075, annual damage from hurricanes will increase by $120 billion as coastal populations increase, sea levels rise, and U.landfalls of strong hurricanes become more frequent. That is the prediction. Of that increase, around 45 percent can already be clearly attributed to climate change.  In a presentation from early November, CBO summarized:       Expected damage from hurricanes will grow more quickly than            The share of the population facing substantial damage will      grow fivefold by 2075.       On the basis of past patterns, Federal spending on      hurricanes will also grow more quickly than  The World Meteorological Organization has also released a report connecting ``extraordinary weather'' to man-made climate change. Warmer temperatures spur increased precipitation, the report says, and higher sea levels amplify storm surge as driven by hurricanes and other coastal storms. This is not new. It is just being frequently and constantly reported with no convincing alternative explanation.  During the typical Atlantic hurricane season, storms develop in the warm, tropical waters off the western coast of These storms gather heat and energy as they pass over this band of warm seawater across the Atlantic known as the hurricane highway. This is the west coast of Here is South Here is the United There is And here is the hurricane highway leading to the Whether these storms become devastating category 4 and 5 hurricanes or weaken and disperse along the way depends on atmospheric conditions and on this ocean heat that powers up those hurricanes.  A typical Atlantic hurricane season used to generate roughly six hurricanes, three of which reached category 3 or higher. That was then. Typical is no longer typical. During August of 2017, this hurricane highway that I showed you reached 9 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than the 30-year average. This exceptional warming supercharged storms into hurricanes bearing catastrophic damage.  The superheated 2017 hurricane highway fueled not 6 but 10 named hurricanes, and 6--not 3--reached category 3 strength or higher, including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Jose, and What is more, all 10 of the season's hurricanes occurred in a row--the greatest number of consecutive hurricanes in the satellite era.  Typically, what happens is that a storm will churn up cooler water in its wake. So during typical years, a following storm will weaken over the cooler waters left in a preceding storm's wake. That is the way it ordinarily works. This should have been the case for Hurricane Irma as it charged northwest through the Caribbean just days after But as I said, hurricanes are powered up by sea surface temperatures, particularly sea surface temperatures above 82 degrees And by September 7, as Irma moved over the coast of Cuba and up into the Bahamas and Florida, the hurricane highway surface temperature Harvey had left behind measured up to 87 degrees The result of that onslaught was that the entire island of Puerto Rico is still recovering. The Virgin Islands were also slammed. Houston saw epic, widespread flooding. Welcome to the new typical, thanks to ocean warming, which comes to us thanks to climate change, which comes to us thanks to carbon pollution, which still comes to us in such a polluting flood, thanks to a generation of industry lying that has not stopped to this day.  At the Southern New England Weather Conference earlier this month, University of Rhode Island Professor Isaac Ginis presented his worst-case scenario models for a ``Hurricane Rhody,'' which would bring levels of destruction to Rhode Island not seen since we were hit by the Great Hurricane of 1938, the destruction of which is seen here in downtown Providence, or Hurricane Carol, which brought similar destruction in 1954. That is Providence City This is the roof of a streetcar. Another streetcar is half-flooded. And this is water in a river pouring in downtown Providence through the streets. Essentially, this is white water in downtown  The flooding that Providence endured in Hurricane Carol caused us to build a hurricane barrier across what is called Fox Point to protect downtown. However, even with the hurricane barrier in place, Professor Ginis's simulations show 3 feet of flooding in downtown Providence if a category 3 hurricane were to hit us at high tide. And, he proposed, if our ``Hurricane Rhody'' were to swing back around and make a second landfall, as Esther did in 1961--he modeled it based on the previous experience of Hurricane Esther--then if it came back, even in a weakened category 2 state, Providence could see up to 14 feet of flooding.  But wait, there is more. Fast forward a few decades and several feet of projected sea level rise, and then Providence doesn't stand a chance. The Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration put 9 to 12 projected vertical feet of sea level rise riding up Rhode Island's shores by the end of the century. According to CRMC--our Coastal Resources Management Council--at 10[[Page S7354]]feet of sea level rise, Rhode Island would lose 36 square miles of total land area. Good-bye to much of Newport, Warwick, Barrington, Block Island, Point Judith, and other coastal communities Rhode Islanders hold dear. This is the present projection by our State agencies, our State University, and  As the Senate prepares a third disaster relief funding package, we can't just fund immediate hurricane recovery. We must also help coastal communities look ahead to the next storm. We need better coastal flood mapping and risk modeling. We need to prepare for damage to natural and engineered coastal infrastructure. We need research and modeling to understand what coastal populations face from the new typical: stronger hurricanes, sea level rise, heavy precipitation, disrupted fisheries, and increased storms and storm surges.  We have to prepare for this. It would be stupid not to put a small percentage of what we are spending in cleanup and recovery into prevention, protection, and preparation. It is just common sense.  The Trump administration does not represent American views on climate change. It has been captured by an industry that has been dishonest about this issue for a generation, and it now represents the falsehoods of that industry. For that reason, it also no longer represents American determination to tackle this challenge. That determination is now found in State Houses, in corporations, in our great universities, and with the American people. Americans know that we can pull together to avoid some of these worst-case scenarios. Coastal communities, in particular, are keenly aware of the special risks they face.  In the Senate, I remain eager to work with my colleagues on all of the above. You know where to find me.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Strange).

Greg was elected to the Arkansas State Senate in a special election in 2015 and selflessly dedicated himself to improving Arkansas while fighting his long battle with cancer.  Mr.Speaker, as former President George H.Bush said many years ago, any evaluation of having lived a successful life must include a measure of service to others. Senator Standridge may have died young at the age of 50, but his life was truly well lived.  I join his wife of 26 years, Karen Standridge; their children, Hunter, Lakin, Cameron, and Breonna; his mother, Jewel Simcox; his late father, Marvin Standridge; his sister and my classmate, Jeania Evans; and other extended family members in celebrating Greg's life.

791,topic-id,1183,"Mr.Speaker, I just had a chance to visit with my colleague from New We were talking about, well, the same thing all Members talk about when they get together: those things they have in common, those things that make their day a little bit better, those things they are struggling with that make their day a little bit worse.  I regret that so often we come to the House floor and the debate that we are having seems like we just have absolutely nothing in common whatsoever. I am sure it has been your experience. I think you can ask any freshman Member of this institution, Mr.Speaker, ``What is the biggest surprise you have had in your first year in Congress?'' and they will say, ``I am surprised at how hardworking and conscientious and diligent and committed absolutely every single one of my colleagues is, because I was reading in the local paper back home, and it sounded like it was a big cesspool there in Washington, D.I am pleasantly surprised at how sincere my colleagues are at working for their 700,000 to 800,000 constituents back home.''  Mr.Speaker, we have two bills that this rule makes in order for debate today, and they are two bills that I will tell you are incredibly well intentioned. I plan to support them. I plan to enthusiastically support them, but they are on issues that are hard in their minutia.  The first bill that is made in order today under a closed rule, Mr.Speaker, is H.1699. It is the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing We had testimony in the committee yesterday, and the discussion was how do we protect buyers of manufactured housing from being exploited while still enabling those Americans who don't have other avenues for purchasing housing to get into that most affordable of housing, manufactured housing. We have common goals to protect people and to empower people, but how do we get that done?  This bill was worked through committee. I believe it is a good compromise. We didn't allow any amendments to this. There were no germane amendments presented in committee, so that is coming under a closed rule today.  This rule also would make in order a structured rule for H.4182, the Ensuring a Qualified Civil Service Act of 2017.  Again, Mr.Speaker, when you go and read the headlines, it makes it sound like every discussion on Capitol Hill is among a bunch of partisan hacks. It is just not true.  The civil service, an incredibly important part of American Government, has dedicated men and women who show up every day to institute the laws that you and I pass, to be the interpreters of the bridge between the laws that we pass and the way they hit folks on the ground. We all want those employees to be protected from the swinging pendulum of partisanship.  I don't want a Republican President to get elected and fire all the Democrats serving in government. There are some bright-minded scientists, some great folks in law enforcement, some really talented people in education. I don't want them to lose their jobs because of the partisanship of a  Similarly, I don't want to see a Democratic President get elected and fire all the folks who are There are some fantastic Republican minds in our Department of Agriculture helping our farmers to succeed, our Department of Labor helping our workers to succeed. You go right on down the list, there are strong men and women helping folks to succeed.  But we are also facing a reality that that same civil service system that seeks to protect those hardworking, those exceptional workers trying to serve America, that same system that works to protect them also protects folks who are completely derelict in their responsibilities.  We had that discussion as a conference, as a In fact, in a bicameral discussion, it went to the President's desk for his signature, as it came to the VA, to say: Can't we do more to reform a civil service system, to reform Federal labor union provisions so that folks who need the protection, because they are exceptional, continue to be protected; but those folks who are failing our veterans, that those folks cease to be protected from a system that seeks to require accountability? We passed that together. We did that together here, Mr.We sent it to the They did it together. The President signed it into law.  This Ensuring a Qualified Civil Service Act does one thing and one thing only: it extends the probationary period of a new civil service worker from the current 1 year to 2 years.  The Department of Defense has done this already, and it has been working exceedingly well for them. The concern is: Have I been able to adequately assess an employee's ability to perform in a 12-month period?  We are committed to trying to train people up, Mr.Nobody is trying to run folks out before they have had a chance to learn their job. The question is: Is a year long enough to uncover the flaws in an employee or is 2 years a wider window?  You will hear folks on the other side say: Rob, why in the world can't you all figure out if an employee is talented in year one?  That is fair.  They will say: Rob, if you are going to train somebody up, why couldn't you get it done in year one?[[Page H9531]]  That is fair.  But as the GAO has looked at this issue, what they found is managers aren't getting that done in year one. Whether it is because they are ineffective as managers or whether it is because they keep trying to give people a second chance and get them trained up is an open question. This bill mandates nothing, but it allows this 2-year window so that managers can give their new employees a good first, second, and third look.  The data suggests that once folks get fully protected by the civil service system, it is very difficult to move underperforming employees out. That work should be done during this probationary period. This bill aims to lengthen that probationary period to 2 years.  Mr.Speaker, reasonable men and women can disagree on these measures. I believe they are important steps in the right direction. But what gives me so much pleasure to come to the floor to bring this rule to you today is the earnestness with which these two bills were presented.  These are common challenges: How do we ensure the very best staff for the American people? How do we ensure access to homes and protection for home buyers for the American people? These are sincere concerns, legitimate disagreements.  If we pass this rule today, we will enable a debating period. We will bring these bills to the floor so that we can air our concerns and challenge our assumptions. I hope, at the end of the day, my colleagues will decide to support this rule and to support the two underlying pieces of legislation.  I reserve the balance of my time.

803,topic-id,994,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.[[Page H9534]]  Mr.Speaker, the gentlewoman raises a lot of important points. I am absolutely concerned about funding the United States Government, but, sadly, in a way that has become systemic as we talk about who we are as a people, Mr.Speaker, we can either be glasses half full or we can be glasses half empty.  Is it true that the number of days we have left in this continuing resolution are limited?  It is.  Is it also true that this House has fully funded the government ahead of schedule for the first time since the good people of the Seventh District elected me to Congress?  It is.  This House has nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, this House should be shouting it from the rooftops:       The United States Constitution gives the United States      Congress a job to do. The House has done its. Senate, get to      work.  This is the first time, Mr.Speaker, that we have been able to fund all the appropriations bills--there are 12 of them--before the end of the fiscal year since I was elected in 2011. The Senate has passed, I believe, zero appropriations bills so far this year.  Mr.Speaker, let's not give anybody a pass on getting the good work done. Let's do hold people accountable, but let's not chastise ourselves and create an atmosphere of failure.  Success begets success. We succeeded together for the first time in a long time. Let's not waste that opportunity to get that bill across the floor of the  Similarly, Mr.Speaker, we are talking about civil service protections today. There is not a man or a woman in this Chamber who doesn't want the absolute best Federal workforce that we could find; not one.  The question today is: Do we lock you in and give you all of those ironclad protections that every American knows the civil service system offers?  We all know that it is hard to get fired from a government job. We all know that.  Should we extend the probationary period where folks can be monitored, trained up, disciplined, worked with from 1 year to 2 years?  If that gets us a better Federal workforce to serve the American people, the answer should be a unanimous yes.  I say to my friends who oppose this bill: If it doesn't end up in that result, I will vote with you to repeal it. But I believe it will end up with a more highly qualified workforce, that it will end up with an American taxpayer who feels like they are getting their money's worth.  I will tell you the best thing we can do for our civil service employees is to end the narrative that civil service is a place of failure instead of a place of success, it is to end the narrative that substandard people work for the Federal Government as opposed to exceptional people work for the Federal  I represent employees of the CDC in my part of the world, Mr.The Centers for Disease Control is second to no one in the intellectual firepower that they assemble to serve the American people. Those men and women put themselves in harm's way to battle those pandemics that scare the bejesus out of the rest of us. They do it as an act of service, and they should be praised for it.  The best thing we can do for them is to make sure folks don't slip through the cracks and they get saddled with a substandard partner. We want them to have access to an exceptional partner. This bill would do that.  Mr.Speaker, as to access to manufactured housing, the bill from my friend from Kentucky, it is absolutely true that every man and woman in this Chamber wants to protect the American consumer from predatory lending. That is undisputed. But as my friend in Kentucky stated, when do we protect someone right out of the opportunity to have a home? In the name of protecting people, when do we fail those very same people?  We had testimony in the committee yesterday, Mr.Speaker, presented credit union after credit union after credit union that would no longer loan money to its members to purchase a manufactured home. They wouldn't do it. They couldn't do it.  Talk about predatory lending if you want to; it is not your local credit union that is doing it. Talk about big Wall Street banks exploiting people if you want to; it is not your local credit union who is doing it.  Talk about people who want to build your community; it is your local credit union.                              {time}  1315  Yet credit union after credit union said: The men and women whom we strive to serve, we will no longer help access the American We can't. Why? Because of the regulations coming out of Washington, D. Do we want to protect the American consumer? We do, and we can, but we can't protect them right out of home ownership. We shouldn't, yet we have.  Passing this bill today that my friend from Kentucky brings forward corrects that mistake, puts us back on track for protecting consumers and enabling consumers.  Mr.Speaker, you can pick any day of the week on Capitol Hill, and you can find a way to describe everything that goes on as nefarious, as misguided, as contrived. But, Mr.Speaker, you can also look at days on Capitol Hill and see the earnestness with which men and women work together to move this country forward. That is the day we have today. I hope it is the day we have tomorrow and the next day and the next day.  I urge my friends, support this rule. Support bringing this bill to the floor for manufactured housing.

148,topic-id,930,"Mr.President, I want to pick up where Senator Murray left off and emphasize to colleagues that not only would this bill raise taxes on millions of middle-class families, but it would also be a dagger in the heart of the Affordable Care Act, causing millions to lose their coverage and raise costs for millions more. By gutting the personal responsibility portion of the Affordable Care Act, this legislation is going to take America back to the days when healthcare was for the healthy and wealthy because it will green-light once more discriminating against those with preexisting conditions. It will say the insurance companies can go out and beat the stuffing out of somebody who has a preexisting condition.  If that is not enough, evidence this morning in the paper shows that this will trigger a new wave of health insurance scams and rip-offs that are going to harm our people. This morning in the paper, they talked about how this is going to encourage these cheap, junk, short-term health insurance policies, which often lack consumer protections and in so many instances have been a magnet for fraud and unscrupulous sales practices.  For example, the paper this morning talked about how--I will read it. ``Examples abound of people who are dumped from such policies''--these short-term policies--``or denied coverage, mired in debt and medical bills totaling thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.'' It documents the various sales tactics used to rip people off. I remember what those tactics were like. When I was director of the senior citizens, the Gray Panthers, at home, it was common for agents to sell policy after policy that was not worth much more than the paper it was written on. It sure sounds to me as though these short-term policies, while a different time, are going to encourage the same kinds of rip-off practices that are going to harm our people.  As we have touched on, we have heard from Senators on the other side that they think that if they vote for this bill, what they are going to be able to do is get two other bills that somehow will mitigate, will eliminate a lot of the harm this horribly flawed bill is going to do. It is going to harm millions of middle-class families who don't get a fair shake in the marketplace and then inflict all this damage on healthcare that I just described.  I happen to think these two bills are constructive bills. The Alexander-Murray bill will make payments that will help limit the amount low-income Americans pay for health insurance. Our colleagues, Senators Collins and Nelson, have another constructive idea--reinsurance money. That helps to stabilize the insurance market, which, by the way, the President of the United States has worked so hard to destabilize. The fact is, the Congressional Budget Office, which is the nonpartisan group of experts we use, has made it clear that these two bills will not even come close to wiping out the disastrous consequences of the health provisions in this bill that the Senate is about to vote for.  I want to be clear. This is not just a tax bill, not just a bill with handouts to multinational corporations and a grab bag full of goodies for campaign supporters and powerful, well-connected interests. It is not just that. It is a big step backward in the cause of making sure that all our people have affordable, accessible healthcare.  What we ought to be doing is looking at ways to come together and find common ground on provisions that we know are cost-effective, things like the children's health bill, which if I had my way would have been passed a long time ago, and community health centers and other vital provisions. We should be building on what we have, such as holding down the cost of pharmaceuticals, for example, targeting the middlemen who are at the heart of the problem. That is what we ought to be doing.  We should not be doing what is on offer this morning. What is on offer this morning is turning back the clock on American healthcare, turning back the clock to those dark days when the insurance companies could beat the stuffing out of somebody who had a preexisting condition. We are better than that. We still have time. As I have said on the floor, as the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, we still have time to choose a different course. A few days ago, 17 Democratic Senators--led by Senators Manchin, Kaine, Donnelly, and Heitkamp--came together and said: We want to find common ground on taxes. I have written two bipartisan, comprehensive Federal income tax bills, the most recent one with a member of the President's  We don't have to go this route. We don't have to go this route on taxes. We certainly don't have to do it on healthcare. There are approaches that would bring us together, and I have just described several of them. What I know we shouldn't do is turn back the clock to the days when healthcare in America was for the healthy and wealthy. That is what you get when you green-light discrimination against people with preexisting conditions. If they are healthy, no problem. If they are wealthy, they can take care of it. We should reject this bill and especially the provisions that relate to healthcare and that take America back to dark days, horrible days when healthcare in America was essentially for the healthy and wealthy.

I mean, we don't know if, in the middle of the night, somebody will add another round of favors for the powerful interests, the politically well connected. What I can tell the Senator is what we have been able to put together as of now.  In 2004, legislation was written that we were very much involved in that helped eliminate the loophole by requiring U.citizens to be bona fide residents of the Virgin Islands and imposing U.tax on income effectively connected with the United Now, in the dark of night, as I have indicated, it appears that we have a provision that is relaxing this rule.  From our conversations, I know the Senator understands that we all want to help the people of the Virgin Islands after a devastating hurricane. Are we helping people by creating a huge, new loophole, possibly for a handful of those people who are especially well connected and can get to the Finance Committee? I am convinced that if one looks at the Paradise Papers and the Panama Papers, what they were warning about in those papers was of all of these efforts to stash money and create new options for people to wheel and deal in offshore accounts.  So my colleague is right. I continue to wonder why, when we want to ask these really important questions about special interest favors and when we look to the other side, we have this barrier between both sides of the aisle. We need somebody here to explain to us and explain to the American people how this has seemed to just fly out of the sky.

I just think it is important to make sure that the public understands exactly what some of the facts are behind the Republican proposals.  My colleague from Ohio just talked about how the Republican proposal is going to create many more jobs in the United States and certainly isn't going to keep the system that makes it attractive to do business overseas. Yet my understanding is, all the previous versions--and we are going through the 500-plus pages now--are based on territorial taxation.  I don't imagine too many folks in coffee shops are up on what territorial taxation is, but it is an express lane for shipping jobs overseas. The fact is, a number of the proposals earlier from the other side have made it more attractive to do business overseas than in the United  Here are a couple of other points. My colleague said that 70 percent of the corporate tax reduction would go to the workers. That is not what Tom Barthold, the head of the Joint Committee on Taxation, said.

He speaks a special language known as economics, but he has made it clear he didn't envision anything like that.

I think, rather than continue this, I will just ask my colleague to see if his side can produce an actual document--even a summary--of what this new bill is actually going to mean for middle-class families who are concerned, based on the earlier versions, about seeing their taxes go up, particularly after 2027.  I have one question for my colleague from Maryland because he has been talking about the State and local deduction, which is enormously important to folks in my State and in my colleague's as well.  My question is, when the first income tax was enacted in 1861, it was to finance the cost of the Civil It included only one deduction at that time for State and local taxes, and that was really composed to respect the States' ability to make their own fiscal decisions.

305,topic-id,755,"Mr.President, I would just like to set the record straight on a couple of points. I have a response to my colleagues who continually say this corporate tax cut is going to raise workers' wages by $4,000.  Now, I asked the head of the Joint Committee on Taxation whether that was the case. He essentially said, no, he did not believe it was the case and referred us to tables that document it.  Perhaps even more egregious is tonight we heard our colleague from Ohio say that a Congressional Budget Office report claims that workers are going to get 70 percent of the benefits from a corporate tax cut so it was raised even higher.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a portion of the report from the Congressional Budget Office, making it clear on the cover where it says the analysis and conclusions expressed there should not be interpreted as those of the Congressional Budget It directly contradicts the comments made by the Senator from Ohio on wages and corporate tax cuts.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Working Paper Series, Congressional Budget Office, Washington, D.          International Burdens of the Corporate Income Tax  William Randolph, Congressional Budget Office, Washington, D.C.,                          August, 2006, 2006-09       Working papers in this series are preliminary and are      circulated to stimulate discussion and critical comment.      These papers are not subject to CBO's formal review and      editing processes. The analysis and conclusions expressed in      them are those of the authors and should not be interpreted      as those of the Congressional Budget References in      publications should be cleared with the authors. Papers in      this series can be obtained at www.cbo.gov (select      Publications and then Working Papers).                                Abstract       This study applies a simple two-country, five-sector,      general equilibrium model based on Harberger (1995, 2006) to      examine the long-run incidence of a corporate income tax in      an open economy. In equilibrium, capital is assumed to be      perfectly mobile internationally in the sense that the      country in which a real investment is located does not matter      to the marginal investor. In addition, each country is      assumed to produce at least some tradable corporate goods for      which the country cannot affect world output prices. Like the      original Harberger (1962) model, the worldwide stock of      capital and the supply of labor in each country are fixed.      Under those assumptions, the model provides closed form      solutions and easily understood predictions about its      comparative static equilibria. As with any simplified model,      the analysis is silent about some potentially important      issues--such as the effect of the corporate tax on savings,      growth and other dynamics--that may also have important      effects on corporate tax incidence.       The analysis shows how the domestic owners of capital can      escape most of the corporate income tax burden when capital      is reallocated abroad in response to the tax. But, as in      Bradford (1978), capital owners worldwide cannot escape the      tax. Reallocation of capital abroad drives down the personal      return to investment so that capital owners worldwide bear      approximately the full burden of the domestic corporate      income tax. Foreign workers benefit because an increased      foreign stock of capital raises their productivity and their      wages. Domestic workers lose because their productivity falls      and they cannot emigrate to take advantage of higher foreign      wages. Under basic assumptions of the numerical application,      the outcome is also similar to the implications of the      simpler model of Bradford in that the full worldwide burden      falls on domestic owners of productive inputs. That outcome      changes, however, under alternative assumptions.       Burdens are measured in a numerical example by substituting      factor shares and output shares that are reasonable for the      U.economy. Given those values, domestic labor bears      slightly more than 70 percent of the burden of the corporate      income tax. The domestic owners of capital bear slightly more      than 30 percent of the burden. Domestic landowners receive a      small benefit. At the same time, the foreign owners of      capital bear slightly more than 70 percent of the burden, but      their burden is exactly offset by the benefits received by      foreign workers and landowners. To the extent that capital is      less mobile internationally, domestic labor's burden would be      lower and domestic capital's burden would be higher. Burdens      can also be affected by the domestic country's ability to      influence the world prices of some traded corporate outputs.      But the signs and magnitudes of those effects on burden      depend upon the relative capital intensities of production in      the corporate sectors that produce internationally tradable      goods.

We, as we have indicated, have been digging through the amendments. As far as I can tell, what we have is the earlier language that imposes a new excise tax on the investment income of large university endowments. That has been in the bill, so be it.  Now, there seems to be a new exception on page 289. The bill says that the new tax does not apply to a university otherwise subject to the tax if it is described in the first section, which is 511(a)(2)(B), and which does not receive Federal funds.

1091,topic-id,731,"Mr.President, I would like to respond briefly to the majority leader, who touted what he claimed would be great benefits coming from the Republican tax reform bill.  Colleagues--and I say to the public that is following this--this isn't tax reform at all. What this is, is a grab bag full of special interest goodies for multinational corporations, powerful political supporters, and lots of people who are in the position to have vast amounts of influence to sway the Tax Code their way.  The fact is that the independent tax umpire, which is called the Joint Committee on Taxation, has just told us that 37 million middle-class families are going to pay more in taxes in 2027. Those are the consequences of the Republican bill that writes into black letter law a double standard--permanent breaks for the multinational corporations and, of course, temporary breaks for the working class.  I believe we will have more to say today on analyses that are being done by the Joint Committee on Taxation, but already we have seen a variety of reports indicating that this proposal is going to produce negligible growth and big deficits. That is why Republicans are talking about how they would like to have some kind of trigger to deal with this proposal.  Well, what has been in the bill is the Republicans' wildest dream, which says a lot about their priorities. If their wildest dreams about magical growth come true and this bill causes Federal revenue to skyrocket, multinational corporations would get yet another automatic tax cut. They already go from 35 to 20.  By the way, when we had our bipartisan bill, Senators Coats and Gregg didn't insist on going to 20 or spending hundreds of billions of dollars more that could go to the middle class, beyond what the bipartisan bill called for.  Then, on top of that, the trigger says that if the Republicans get their magical unicorn mathematics about growth--if the growth fairy arrives--multinational corporations will get yet another tax cut.  I would like to respond briefly to what the Republican leader said, because this does not resemble the kind of tax reform Ronald Reagan and Democrats wanted.  I will close just by way of saying that it did not have to be this way. Seventeen Democrats, led by Senators Manchin, Kaine, Donnelly, Heitkamp, McCaskill--a big group, with a tremendous outpouring of good faith, said: We would like to have a bipartisan bill. They asked me to come because I have written a bipartisan bill.  I want to show the contrast between what Ronald Reagan did in 1986 with Democrats and what has happened, unfortunately, here. In 1986, Bill Bradley--someone I have talked about a bit on the floor, a Democrat who served on the Finance Committee, committed to good government, to growth and innovation--flew all over the United States to work out with Republicans the various provisions of tax law that would make the bill bipartisan. So in 1986, Democrats flew around the country to meet with Republicans to get bipartisan reform.  This year, Republicans have not been willing to walk down the corridor to discuss specific provisions about how we can move forward on a bipartisan tax reform bill. That is why our moderates are so concerned that we are missing a great opportunity.  The multinationals are awash in cash. By the way, look at the first letter from the Joint Committee on We could be looking at interest rates that will make it hard for people[[Page S7509]]to buy a house or buy a car because of what this bill produces.  This bill is not tax reform. It is a grab bag of goodies for special interests. It embeds into the tax law a double standard with breaks for the multinationals and vanishing benefits for the middle class--and, most importantly, it didn't have to be, and it still doesn't have to be. There is another alternative. That is what 17 moderate Democrats expressed, and I was proud to join them.  We will have more debate on this over the course of the morning. But since the leader did talk about how this was sort of a textbook case of what tax reform ought to look like, I wanted to make sure that we started this morning by injecting a little bit of reality with respect to what is actually on offer.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-11-30-pt1-PgS7508-4.txt,1247,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONTINUED,2017,30,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1115,topic-id,574,"Mr.President, just to respond briefly to the chairman, the chairman, I think, said about eight times that what really ought to be the focus here is working together. I so share that view.  As we start voting today, I would just like for the public to understand that this side was never given the chance on this tax bill to work together--never once. The majority leader announced, right at the outset, that the most partisan process would be used. It is called reconciliation. It means that it is our way or the highway, that we have the votes, and that is the end of it.  I appreciate what the chairman has said about emphasizing our working together, but that was taken off the table by the majority leader when we started, when it was declared that we would use the reconciliation process.  There are other areas that I will just touch on.  The chairman made mention of the fact that everyone over here is for socialized medicine. Right now, what we are trying to do is to ensure that we don't have upheaval in the private insurance marketplace because of the majority's effort to unravel the Affordable Care The Affordable Care Act is not socialism. It focuses on private sector choices through the exchange. What the challenge is going to be is, if you further hammer this effort to increase choices in the private sector marketplace, you are just going to cause more problems for our people and make it more difficult for us to hold down the costs of medicine.  I will close this section of the discussion simply by clarifying again this point about the middle class, because Senator Brown was right with respect to the number of families who are going to get hammered under the Republican bill, but when the Republicans said that is a partisan group, the figures Senator Brown talked about are supported by nonpartisan organizations as well.  The Joint Committee on Taxation, which is composed of the people who are our independent tax referees, has indicated that by 2027, more than 50 percent of middle-class persons are going to see a tax hike. That is not a Democratic group; that is not a Republican group. That is an independent group.  I think that this has been instructive this morning. I am one who has dedicated my time in public service to trying to find common ground. I see Senator Cornyn and Senator Toomey, both of whom I have talked with about bipartisan tax reform--and, again, the chairman, whom I very much enjoy working with. Yet this tax bill has really been an anomaly; it has been so different from everything else. It is important that the public knows that when there was discussion about working together, the majority leader took that prospect off the table. It was ruled out--not going to happen. This was going to be a partisan bill. This would be just the opposite of what Democrats and Ronald Reagan would have wanted.  That is why 17 moderate Democrats, earlier this week, made one more plea, as we will continue through the day to talk about, that if you want to do tax reform right, it has to be bipartisan in order to bring certainty and predictability to the private sector. It is not about socialism. It is about certainty and predictability for private sector growth.  I yield the floor.

This bill does just the opposite. It makes it more attractive to do business overseas. It is not what the bipartisan bill was all about. It is not what our former colleague, Senator Gregg, signed onto when he went onto our bipartisan bill.  I think I would like now to pose a question to my colleague, a valuable member of the Finance Committee, about why the patriot corporation legislation is so important. I think my colleague believes that it is so important--as I did with Senator Gregg, the Republican from New Hampshire--that we ought to make it more attractive to have red, white, and blue jobs. Is that really what my colleague is working on here?  ",CREC-2017-11-30-pt1-PgS7508-4.txt,1247,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONTINUED,2017,30,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is the total opposite of what was promised. Even with the dynamic score, what we are seeing is that the sponsors of this bill are spending $1 trillion and not helping those who need the help.

1241,topic-id,1978,"Mr.President, before he leaves the floor, I would like to thank Senator Cardin for his leadership on so many finance issues and especially for highlighting today, as part of this major debate on tax reform, the importance of infrastructure. The fact is, you cannot have big-league quality of life with little-league infrastructure.  My colleague has made the point that repatriation would be a natural as one of the two bookends for infrastructure. It would ensure that we would have some funds we could count on, some publicly available funds, and I think it would be a natural fit with the kind of bonding that Senator Hoeven and I and others have been interested in.  I am here to talk on another subject, but before he leaves, I would like to thank my colleague for his comments.  Mr.President and colleagues, it is fair to say that it is throwback Thursday here in the It is also a big day for the Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin--not only because we are dealing with taxes, not only because there is another glamorous photo shoot with a big sheet of dollar bills, but this is also the 1-year anniversary of what has come to be known as the Mnuchin rule.  It was November 30, 2016, when news broke that Mr.Mnuchin was the likely nominee to head the Department of Treasury, and that morning, the Secretary-to-be went on TV and delivered what sounded like a very sweet promise. Here is what he said about the Trump administration's ideas for the issue we talk about tonight, tax reform. I am going to quote Steve Mnuchin directly. He said: ``Any reduction we have in upper-income taxes will be offset by less deductions so that there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class.'' In case anybody missed that last part of his statement, he said ``no absolute tax cut for the upper class.'' And he didn't stop there. He went even further in hyping big plans he had. He said: ``When we work with Congress and we go through this, it will be very clear: This is a middle-income tax cut.''  This is all part of the anniversary, to kind of refresh everybody's memory.  After that pledge, I talked about this matter with Mr.Mnuchin during the Senate Finance He smiled. He was thrilled that I was recalling the pledge he made.  When I brought it up, I said: Well, we could just call this the Mnuchin rule.  Mr.Mnuchin, at that time, thanked me, and he said: There would be great esteem in having the Mnuchin rule with both the Buffett rule and the Volcker rule. He said: I take that as a great compliment.  So here we are a year later, and what a difference a year has made. The Mnuchin rule is now a broken promise for the history books.  This week, Republicans scramble to pass a tax plan that reaches into the pockets of working people in the middle class and showers trillions of dollars in handouts to multinational corporations, high-flyers, and the politically connected.  I think it is also important to remember that the Mnuchin rule was[[Page S7547]]just one part of the sales pitch. Now there is a whole lot more to the con job.  Republicans have said time and again that the tax cuts would pay for themselves. Time and time again, we heard about the unicorns. We heard about the growth fairy. The magical growth will be so powerful that new revenue is going to come pouring in, and the tax cuts are going to be fully paid for.  In addition to that, I think it is important to recognize this on the special anniversary. The Secretary went even further. He said that the tax cuts wouldn't just pay for their $1.4 trillion cost, they would bring in, on top of the $1.4 trillion, an additional $1 trillion. Well, today--after pushing and making sure that we could get it before we actually had the key final votes--we were pleased to receive from the independent referee on taxation, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the official dynamic scoring analysis that they did of the Republicans' plan. Let's be clear, folks. Now that we have heard from the independent tax umpires, we can say officially that the magical growth fantasy is over.  I say that also in the context of bipartisanship, because in the course of writing the two bipartisan bills that I authored--first with Senator Gregg, second with Senator Coats--I said that I happen to believe that behavior matters. I believe a good, bipartisan tax reform bill will generate some revenue. And the Congressional Budget Office agreed with me. But it is not going to be fantasy land-type growth.  The reality is, after Mr.Mnuchin said that what was going to happen was that the Republican plan would pay for the $1.4 trillion cost and generate another $1 trillion on top of it, what we now know as a result of what I was sent today is that the Republican tax plan, even with dynamic growth factored in, actually loses more than $1 trillion.  There is other bad news on top of that. The Republican tax plan, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, slows down economic growth after 2025.  So you put the kibosh on two major selling points that we heard about month after month after month from Republicans in selling this plan. The tax cuts don't pay for themselves, and there is no new wave of growth headed our way.  The party of Reagan is on a mad dash to run up the deficit by $1 trillion, slow down the economy, and raise taxes on more than half of the middle class. And the only analysis Republicans can get to back up their tax plan is either cooked up by the in-house staff at 1600 Pennsylvania or is based on revenue-neutral tax bills that don't even exist.  By the way, there is more news a year into Mr.Mnuchin's work. The Secretary promised a comprehensive analysis from the Treasury Department that would prove his claims, prove that there would be more growth, more jobs--red, white, and blue opportunities--for our people; that the tax cuts would pay for themselves or, as he said, would generate much more revenue than that. The Secretary of Treasury promised us that. He promised us that repeatedly, that we would get that analysis of what this bill would do for growth and jobs and improving the quality of life for our people. Let me tell you, that was another broken promise, yet one more in a chain of broken promises over the months and a particularly important one because the Treasury Secretary made some especially surprising projections, and, in effect, we asked him to back them up. He said he would, and now we know that not only is he not going to do it, apparently he had no intention to ever do it. Based on the news that broke this morning, as far as I can tell, Secretary Mnuchin never even asked his Department to do the comprehensive analysis of the bill that he promised. On top of that, his Treasury Department buried a recent paper that showed that the overwhelming beneficiaries of corporate tax cuts aren't workers, they are shareholders. They said it didn't agree with the Department's current thinking.  Let me be clear. I think it sounds like another part of the coverup at the Treasury  Colleagues, a year ago, Secretary Mnuchin told the American people that there would be no absolute tax cut for the upper class. ``It will be very clear: This is a middle-income tax cut.'' Then he said that the tax cuts wouldn't just pay for themselves, that a trillion new dollars of Federal revenue would come pouring in. Not a single word of that has turned out to be true. The Mnuchin rule is the most expensive lie since George Bush stood on an aircraft carrier and said that the mission in Iraq was accomplished. And the idea that these tax cuts will pay for themselves isn't just a little off the mark, it is a trillion-dollar misfire.  What we have here is a con job on the middle class, and Secretary Mnuchin and his allies have covered it up every single step of the way.  My Democratic colleagues and I have said over and over again that we agree that the Tax Code is broken. We share our colleagues' view that there ought to be an opportunity for a bipartisan bill. And every single time I have spoken on this subject, I made it clear that it doesn't have to be this way.  In the beginning of the week, I joined 17 moderate Democratic Senator Donnelly said it very well--I mean, really an outpouring of enthusiasm for taking a bipartisan approach to do tax reform right. A bipartisan approach is not just some kind of pie-in-the-sky happy-talk; bipartisanship is what gets you the certainty and the predictability you need to grow private sector jobs that are good-paying and are driven by innovation. And I know it can be done.  I am glad to see that the Presiding Officer of the Senate here tonight is from the State of One of the two bipartisan bills that I wrote was with one of his former colleagues, Senator Dan Coats, who is not just a very well-liked Member but is somebody who believes deeply in sensible economic policy. He was on the Finance We worked on this for a substantial amount of time.  You know what. It is not easy to write a bipartisan tax reform bill. You have to have some give-and-take. Senator Bradley would fly all over the country to work with Republicans to try to find common ground. Right now, we can't get people to even walk down the corridor to help put together a proposal.  It didn't have to be this way. We had opportunities for bipartisanship. It is something I feel very strongly about because I spent literally hundreds of hours with two very fine, very conservative Republican Senators in order to put together two actual bills--bills with bill numbers, bills that were proposed in the  But what a difference between that approach and what we have seen from Secretary Mnuchin--not a single effort--not one--from Secretary Mnuchin to talk specifics about what it would take to get a bipartisan approach.  Then we had, as I have noted tonight, these promises--promises of making sure the focus would be on the middle class, making sure it would generate additional revenue. It has been a trail of broken promises, when it could have been an opportunity to bring everybody together and to give everybody the opportunity to get ahead.  Well, one of my very favorite phrases is from the late Israeli diplomat Abba Eban, who said: Americans always get it right. He paused and said: After they have tried everything else. Well, my hope is that Secretary Mnuchin will see the error of his ways, see why the policies I have described aren't right for the American people, see why it is important for the administration to change course and push for what Democrats here have called for, a bipartisan approach, which our moderates eloquently spoke to this week. We have bills that can help guide us. I hope, in the future, we can break with the kinds of policies I have had to describe on the 1-year anniversary of the Mnuchin rule and decide that we are going to change course, have a tax policy that focuses on the middle class, puts money in their pockets, gives everybody a chance to get ahead, and that the Secretary will recognize that his claims about what the Republican tax bill is all about are not borne out by the facts.

1658,topic-id,3256,"Mr.President, I listened to the remarks of my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, and he said there were 70 hearings on taxes. I think it is important that the American people know that there was not one single hearing--not one--on this bill. There were no discussions of the specific provisions in this legislation. There was no hearing on the personal responsibility requirement in the Affordable Care Act, which is so essential to that law and to what we ought to be looking at strengthening in the years ahead with respect to cost containment. So I just want to set the record straight right at the outset of the debate. Since I have heard once again that there were 70 hearings, I think it is important that the American people know that there was not one on this bill.  Contrast this to 1986, when Democrats and Republicans got together and there were more than 20 hearings--more than 20 discussions on specifics about how to work together and find common ground on this enormously important issue.  The Senate is 20 hours of debate away from a broken promise of truly historic proportions. This was supposed to be the year that the working people of America regained a powerful voice in Instead of a strong voice, what they got was a big con job. If this Republican tax bill passes, Washington is going to reach into the pockets of working Americans and cut a big check to multinational corporations, to tax cheats, and to the politically powerful and well connected.  The bill before the Senate would enshrine an economic double standard that makes permanent second-class treatment of Americans who work hard and do their best day in and day out to provide for their families. For the cops, for the nurses, for the mechanics, and for those who work retail, this Republican tax plan is a big gamble. They don't get any special tax dodges--no Cayman Islands deals for them. Those folks are stuck clinging to the hope that they will not be among the millions hit with an immediate tax hike. Even for those lucky Americans who do see some benefit, there is bad news coming down the pike. All they get out of this Republican plan is the fleeting sugar high of temporary tax cuts.  That is not the case, though, for multinational corporations or powerful high fliers who wield big political power in this town. Under this tax plan, the basic message to them is this: You can pay what you want, when you want, and, if you are lucky--really lucky--you may pay hardly anything at all. That certainly is not what working people were promised in the fall 2016 campaign. That is not what Republicans have spent month after month telling Americans their tax plan would do. The Republican rhetoric doesn't match the reality of this tax plan, and every day we get frightening news reports about the harm it is going to do to working people and the middle class.  Just yesterday, I received a letter from the independent congressional tax experts known as the Joint Committee on Taxation, and they gave us really important information about the bill. Buried in one of those answers was information that ought to put a scare into millions of Americans who work hard every day to get ahead. This bill showers trillions of dollars on multinational corporations, but the fact is, these multinational corporations are already awash in cash. What it means, according to these independent congressional tax experts, is that interest rates are going up. The Federal Reserve will have to tighten the screws of the economy.  But here is the bottom line for what it means for a middle-class American in North Carolina, or Oregon, or anywhere else in the United States: If you want to buy a house, this bill is going to make it more expensive. If you want to buy a car, this bill is going to make it more expensive. If you want to get a credit card, this bill is going to make it more expensive. If you want to take out a student loan, this bill is going to make it more expensive.  It is not just harm for typical families. The cost of doing business is going to rise for the brewery owner or the tool-and-die maker who wants to build a new facility or purchase new equipment. They would like to hire new workers, but they will find that the money they need to do it is getting drained by higher interest rates.  In short, higher interest rates will wipe out the benefits of this bill for a lot of small businesses and add pain to the tax hikes that are going to hit millions of families. The only businesses and individuals who will not feel the effects I just described are those sitting on mountains of cash--those who will never need to borrow to get ahead. That is just one of the latest of truly frightening details about what this destructive bill would do.  If there was any doubt remaining, it is clear based on those tax experts that individual working Americans and families are going to be on the hook for handouts to multinational corporations.  Republicans have spent months shouting from the hilltops that they were bringing jobs back. The President made it a centerpiece of his campaign. Jobs are coming home, he said. Corporations that ship jobs overseas are going to be punished. The plight of so many mill and factory towns is over. It is too bad that those talking points from stump speeches and interviews never made it into the proposals on paper, because the tax plan that is actually before the Senate does the opposite.  Under the new notion of taxes for American companies overseas called the territorial system, corporations will get a bigger tax cut if they lay off their American workers here in the United States, pack up, and move abroad. It creates colossal new loopholes, a true bonanza of new tax gifts for the tax cheats, for the people who have sophisticated help to cut corners.  When it comes to international tax rules, my view is that the United States shouldn't get suckered into a race to the bottom with a bunch of no-tax, resort-lined islands to please the tax avoidance industry and their lobbyists. That is a truly expensive competition in terms of taxpayer dollars and jobs, but this Republican plan forces working Americans to pay up.  The tax experts we rely on here in the Congress make it clear that the Republican corporate tax scheme loses[[Page S7396]]revenue, but the individual tax changes raise revenue. That is a whole lot of tax lingo for saying that working people are going to get fleeced so that multinational corporations can pay a lot less.  Here is how it is going to work. More and more Americans will face a tax hike with every passing year. Stealthy tax tricks will force people into higher tax brackets over time, heaping a heavier burden on their shoulders. Millions of working Americans are going to lose their healthcare and the tax credits that make insurance affordable for them and their family. Put all together, it is an immense amount of money being taken from people who are already walking an economic tightrope--an economic tightrope in North Carolina and Oregon and everywhere else--where they balance food costs against the fuel bill and the fuel bill against the cost of housing. An immense amount of money is being taken from them and being handed to multinational corporations that ship jobs overseas.  This is not a plan to create red, white, and blue jobs. This is not a plan to turn the lights back on in factories that went dark many years ago. This is a plan to sell out millions of Americans--American workers and their families--and the damage will get even worse when the deficit climbs into the stratosphere.  As I begin to touch on the deficit, I want to note that it didn't have to be this way. I wrote two fully bipartisan Federal income tax reform bills with our colleagues. I believe they were here before the Senator from North Carolina joined us: Dan Coats, now the head of national intelligence, and Judd Gregg, the former Republican chair of the Budget The three of us--Senator Gregg first, then Senator Coats--made changes to ensure that American companies could be competitive for red, white, and blue jobs. We understood that you had to have a competitive rate to grow those companies. But we certainly didn't create new breaks for shipping jobs overseas, and--because I am going to touch on the deficit now--our proposal was revenue neutral.  So it didn't have to be this way. That is what Senator Manchin and Senator Kaine said yesterday, along with 17 We wanted a bipartisan alternative that didn't create new incentives for shipping jobs overseas and that didn't jack up the deficit, but I certainly was surprised when I saw early on that Senate Republicans, who had given so many speeches on their concern about the deficit, said: It is kind of OK with us if we have a net deficit of $1.5 trillion. And as the Joint Committee on Taxation has essentially indicated to me, it would be higher than that.  All of the deficit hawks in the Republican Party just flew away. That was surprising because it seems like just yesterday when the Congress couldn't buy lunch without a whole cast of Republican deficit hawks doing some pretty serious hollering about the deficit. But based on history, what is coming next is pretty predictable. We have seen the movie before. The deficit hawks come flying back after ideas like the one we are looking at in the Senate become law. We have already heard the Speaker say, what is next? Entitlement reform, which means Medicare, Medicaid, and anti-hunger programs.  The Speaker said that is what is next. That is next on the docket. Everybody listening ought to know that is code for attack, and it is multiple fronts on these kinds of programs for the most vulnerable people in our country--the lifeline programs, the safety net programs I have just described. What we are going to hear, because this is the script from earlier movies, is we have these big deficits. Oh, my goodness. There is a lot of red ink. America can't afford the safety net. They will say we have to do something. Instead of being willing to go after the people at the top, history says the people who really face the burden of those deficit reductions are the most vulnerable.  The first big legislative push after the Bush tax cuts, for example, was an all-out assault on Social The fact that it was stopped doesn't mean Medicare or Medicaid or other safety net programs like Social Security are going to be safe this time around.  The policy on offer, in my view, is simply a disaster. It makes a mockery of the approach Ronald Reagan took with a big group of I know so many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle admire President Reagan greatly. This bill is the opposite of what President Reagan did.  What President Reagan did is he said to those big multinational corporations: I have to ask you to give up some money in order to make sure the middle class, the individual ratepayer, will get a fair shake.  This is just the opposite--180 degrees away from what Ronald Reagan did. We are going to have an amendment on the middle class pretty soon, but what could be more stark than the fact that the tax cuts for the multinationals are permanent, and the relief for the middle class is temporary. This bill is the opposite, the total opposite, of what Ronald Reagan worked on in 1986.  Our colleague Senator Enzi--and I have worked with him often, and I am sad to see us have such differing views on this--said we have had 70 hearings. I can tell you, the once storied Senate Finance Committee never even attempted once to craft a bipartisan bill. We said for months that was our preference. That was what was stated in the letter the vast majority of Senate Democrats signed. That is what we said when we were invited to the White House to meet with the We said it repeatedly.  I mentioned the two bills I wrote. They are the only two bipartisan Federal income tax reform bills--the only two we have had since 1986. By the way, they didn't go as far as Ronald Reagan went. Ronald Reagan, in 1986, said, for purposes of taxes, a dollar is a dollar is a dollar.  We are going to have the same rate for those who make money on investments that we do for those cops and nurses who get that wage, that ordinary income. I have indicated on the floor that Senator Bradley, former New York Knick--and as I like to say, another tall Democrat who served on the Senate Finance Committee with a much better jump shot than mine--is incredulous at this process. He is just slack-jawed when he asks about what is being done to bring both sides together. Senator Bradley, and others on the Republican side, in 1986, flew all over the United States to get together with senior Republicans and Jim Baker, Richard Dorman, and others to talk about the specifics of getting bipartisan tax reform together. You hear the stories, and you see that is the way you tackle an issue like this. Bill Bradley flew all over the country to work with Republicans to get a bipartisan tax reform bill. Right now, the majority on the Senate Finance Committee wouldn't walk down the corridor of the Dirksen building once to talk about anything resembling how we would put together a bipartisan proposal. So the process we have seen here makes a mockery out of Reagan-style reform.  Some have asked, was this foreordained, did it have to be. I have already made it clear that I don't think it had to be. It is hard work putting together a bipartisan bill. Senator Gregg, for example, when he was in the Senate, I think was one of Leader McConnell's top economic advisers--chairman of the Budget We used to say in our house, Judd Gregg is scary smart. We sat next to each other in chairs in our office for almost 2 years to put together a bill. It is heavy lifting, but it can be done. A lot of that work was brought into other efforts since then--the question of the Bush proposal, bipartisan commissions, or a variety of other ones. It is pretty hard to do when the majority leader says, on the first day, the very first day out, we are going to use the most partisan process--budget reconciliation and, in effect, say: What we are telling the other party is we don't want your ideas because we don't need your votes. Sometimes it got almost a little ridiculous because I know there were times when statements were made by the Republican leadership that no Democrats were interested in bipartisan tax reform, despite the fact that in the few instances where a White House official would call and ask our opinion, Senate Democrats would meet. That was the point of the press conference that was held yesterday with 17 Democrats from various parts of the country, as well as legislation I have described that was written.  By the way, in the work product Republicans finally produced, they took[[Page S7397]]some of the ideas from the bipartisan bills; for example, increasing the standard deduction, but we tripled the standard deduction without any takeaways, like the State and local deduction or the permanent exemptions, and what that meant is, in the bipartisan bills, if you passed something like that, people adjust their wages, and immediately working-class folks get hundreds and hundreds of dollars more in every paycheck. Not only were there no discussions--and I have seen Republican Senators stand out on the floor sometimes and hold up a sign: What we are doing is the Wyden-Coats bill. Nothing could be further from the truth, whether it is on the international provisions I mentioned or the personal provisions. I was so proud to stand with Senate Democrats in a meeting yesterday put together by Senators Manchin and Kaine, once again, stating that it doesn't have to be this way.  What is the rush to take taxes for multinational corporations from 35 to 20 percent? Back when I was working with Senator Gregg and Senator Coats, the Republicans, we didn't have multinational corporations saying we should go to 20 percent. The difference between 25 and 20 percent is $500 billion.  My colleagues yesterday were saying--moderate Democrats--we are serious about tax reform, both on the individual and the corporate side, but it ought to be based on bipartisan give-and-take, not something like we have seen.  Republicans in Congress and the administration's top salesmen have spent months and months telling the American people that in the long run, their bill is going to pay for itself with explosive growth. They had cheerleaders, those who cooked up these phony growth forecasts based on revenue-neutral reform proposals that don't exist. Respected economists will tell you tax cuts don't pay for themselves. In fact, when we had a chance to have some discussion not about a specific bill but some ideas about taxes, the Republican economists who were before the Finance Committee said the tax cuts wouldn't pay for themselves.  The honest predictions say that any growth caused by this bill is going to be modest. After they have spent years insisting--I can't tell you how many times I heard this--that we would have dynamic scores, Republican Senators are rushing the independent scorekeepers to try to get a thorough analysis, but we don't have it as we are on this floor debating the bill.  Finally, we ought to forget that this bill has been getting a rewrite behind closed doors for weeks now. A number of my colleagues on the other said what was important to them is we have what is called regular order. Regular order is probably not a concept people talk about in too many coffee shops unless they traditionally get eggs or toast or something, but what it means is, you have a process where both sides work together, and you have a chance to discuss ideas and differing approaches or offers. We haven't had anything like that. We haven't had an open process with open debate and real amendments. What we have seen is a mad dash to pass a bill that can't stand scrutiny in broad daylight. If this bill really got scrutinized and had a chance to be examined, we would see a lot of Americans coming to their Senators and saying: Senator, no way--no way--should you support that bill.  What is on offer is a plan to force working people and working-class families to pay for handouts to multinational corporations and tax cheats. This bill does not deserve to pass. My view is, it really doesn't deserve the ink that was used to print it on paper. The process that has culminated in this scramble to drive this through, drive it through with the most arbitrary process imaginable, I consider shameful.  With that, I yield the floor.

The motion says: Let us send this bill back to the Senate Finance Committee on a bipartisan basis and come up with a plan that actually works for the middle class.  I am going to wrap up just by recapping the Republican rhetoric on this tax plan. First, it was said to be a guaranteed middle-class tax cut. Then, it was merely focused on the middle class. Next, it was an average tax cut across a variety of income cohorts. Now the numbers are actually in. Republicans want to run up enough red ink to threaten Medicare and Social Security and still raise taxes on more than half of the middle class. The Senate, on a bipartisan basis, can do better than this.

1770,topic-id,1030,"Mr.President, a number of Senators have been inquiring as to what will happen next with respect to the handling of the tax legislation. My sense is that, in a relatively short period of time, the Senate will be voting on the motion to proceed to this legislation. I just want to take a couple of minutes to talk about why I am going to oppose the motion to proceed.  The fact is, right now, on a topic that will involve $10 trillion worth of tax policy changes--the biggest change in the Tax Code in 31 years when the U.Senate votes on the motion to proceed--we, essentially, will not know yet what the Senate will be debating. There are rumors; there are whispers, but the fact is, as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which has authority over taxes, I haven't seen the text of the bill that we will actually be debating.  The bill seems to have changed practically every half hour. It has certainly been a moveable feast for the super lobbyists, but there are a couple things we already do know. We know, for example, it is not going to give a fair shake to working families. What we have talked about again and again in the Senate is that the Senate leadership is committed to a double standard with respect to the American economy: temporary breaks for the middle class--they vanish in a few years--and permanent breaks for those at the top.  We can do better than this. The middle class is responsible for 70 percent of the economic activity in our economy. They are the ones who buy the cars, who buy the houses. They send kids to childcare. Instead, many of them certainly fairly soon are going to be further in the hole than they already are.  So this is a piece of legislation, both on the substance, from the standpoint of what my colleagues have been talking about in terms of the double standard--I mean, we already have in our economy essentially two tax systems, one for the cops, the nurses, autoworkers, and timber workers. Their tax system is compulsory. Their taxes come right out of their paycheck. There are no Cayman Island deals for them. The people at the top pay what they want when they want to. The reality is, what it looks like we are going to get--as I say, I don't have the details--is going to make this work.  So a number of Senators have asked, for example, about the passthrough provisions, important to small business. We don't have the details on that. We have Members who care about how we are actually going to not rack up hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of debt in the years ahead. Some Senators have suggested that there be triggers. I happen to think they are gimmicks in all of the approaches I have heard. They just don't seem to add up. We don't have the details on that.  What we do know--and I know there are several other Senators who would like to speak--is, we have never had negotiations in the Senate Finance Committee over the specifics of this legislation or any other. We have never had a legislative hearing. When Ronald Reagan and Democrats got together in 1986, they had more than 20 of these hearings.  I will just tell my colleagues in the Senate, Bill Bradley, the former Knick and basketball great who was on the Finance Committee--and I like to kid colleagues that he was another tall Democrat on the committee with a much better jump shot than I--he always would tell stories about how he would fly across the country to meet with Republicans to talk about the specifics of tax reform. Back then, Senators went to great lengths to talk to each other about the specifics of tax reform. In this instance, the majority hasn't been willing to even walk down the corridor of the Dirksen Senate Office Building to talk about the specifics of tax reform.  The Senate is better than this. I was part of the bipartisan group yesterday, and Senator Donnelly, our colleague from Indiana, really set out what became an outpouring of good faith among something like 17 Senators who said we can find common ground here. I happen to know we can find common ground here because with two Senators, who happen to be very close to the distinguished majority leader, Mitch McConnell, I wrote two full bipartisan Federal income tax reform bills--my former colleagues, Senator Gregg and Senator  We can do this. This is what the Senators said yesterday. We can find common ground. There is not a Senator here who doesn't agree that the Tax Code is a rotting economic carcass. It is a dysfunctional mess. Every single Senator understands it is broken. Since it has been 30 years since the last reform, there have been scores of changes to the Tax Code that really cause as much confusion as they do benefits. So I know we can do this. That is what Democratic Senators said yesterday. They said we want to work together in a group led by our colleagues Senator Manchin and Senator Kaine, who brought us together.  So we are going to vote, and I think it is going to be soon, on a motion to proceed. I would just tell Senators, as of right now, we don't yet know what the Senate is going to be debating, and on those crucial issues I just mentioned, we still don't have any information. Yesterday, the Joint Committee on Taxation told me they hoped to have what the Republicans said was the essence of why their bill works: a dynamic score of the tax legislation. We haven't seen that either.  I hope our colleagues will vote no on the motion to proceed because I don't think it is too much to say that as Senators, when we are talking about going to a bill that involves $10 trillion worth of tax policy changes in the Senate, we ought to know what the Senate will actually be debating.

1498,topic-id,318,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate my friend yielding time.  Mr.Speaker, this is a horror show today, this is a horror show debate, and this is a horror show process, but it is a disaster for the American people.  The tax bill we are debating today will abandon millions of American families. It showers the wealthy and corporations with massive tax cuts, and it adds $1.5 trillion to our deficits. The top 1 percent get this massive payout in the neighborhood of $500 billion; hardworking families get pocket change.  But millions don't even get that. In fact, 36 million middle class families will pay more in taxes because of this bill. Our Republican colleagues will be taking money out of the pockets of these families to give more tax cuts to the rich.  But it doesn't stop there. It never does. This is part of a dangerous three-step process that we have seen, unfortunately, far too often:  The first step, Republicans enact massive tax cuts for the rich, claiming they will generate enough growth to pay for themselves. I know my Republican colleagues desperately want the American people to believe that this is what will happen. But the record is clear. It failed in the 1980s, and it failed in the 2000s. It was an epic failure in  This is about politics, not reality, for them, which brings us to step two. Once these cuts fail to produce the growth that they promise, Republicans will shriek about the impending doom of high deficits and debt. Then they will quickly move to step three, demanding cuts in vital programs that benefit working families throughout our country.  We have seen this act before. As I said before, it is a horror show. There is a reason why a lot of people are looking at this and saying this is the great tax scam of 2017--because it is the great tax scam of 2017.

897,topic-id,188,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to talk about the importance of adoption and what Congress can be doing to help more kids get adopted into loving, caring families.  November is National Adoption Month, and it is time we talk about how the GOP tax reform bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, will help children in need of loving families by supporting those whose lives have been touched by adoption.  Our tax reform bill preserves the adoption tax credit, which allows taxpayers to claim expenses related to the adoption of a child, including fees, court costs, and travel expenses. This credit ultimately helps get more children into permanent, loving families, and the credit costs only about $3.8 billion over 10 years, a small fraction of our overall budget.  Mr.Speaker, I worked tirelessly with my colleagues to ensure that this adoption tax credit was included in the House's tax bill, and I am pleased that the Senate's version also preserves it in their draft.

92,topic-id,733,"Mr.Speaker, the Trump administration recently made the important decision to release hundreds of thousands of documents in the possession of the CIA which were found in the May 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in These documents reveal a much more intimate relationship between Iran and al-Qaida than previously suspected.  While it will take time to analyze the extent of the 470,000 documents, some important conclusions can already be made:  The Obama administration selectively released 571 of these documents during his term, none of which identified the significant relationship between Iran and al- While President Obama claimed al-Qaida was ``on the path to defeat,'' these documents showcase al-Qaida strategically reorganizing its operational base. One of these documents describes Iran as al-Qaida's ``main artery for funds, personnel, and communications,'' and instructs members to ``refrain from attacking Iran and devote your total resources . . . to the fight against the crusaders and the apostates.''  On the one hand, al-Qaida would publicly declare all Shiites to be apostates; on the other hand, internal deliberations by the organization called for a transactional relationship with the mullahs of  Another finding in a 19-page document written by senior al-Qaida operative Abu Hafs al-Mauritani outlines a detailed arrangement between al-Qaida and The relationship between al-Qaida and Iran was based on their mutual hatred of the United Iran agreed to provide shelter, financial support, and coordinate efforts with al-Qaida across the region.  In this document, a senior al-Qaida operative confirms that Iran and al-Qaida's ``interests intersect.'' He goes so far as to describe the Iranian regime as ``the best example . . . of pragmatism in politics. Anyone who wants to strike America, Iran is ready to support them with money and arms and all that is required as long as they are not directly and clearly implicated.''  Iran offered al-Qaida everything it needed, including ``money, arms,'' and ``training in Hezbollah camps in Lebanon, in exchange for attacking U.interests in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf.''[[Page H9525]]  Al-Qaida operatives were safeguarded in Iran, with the consent of the military. In fact, the 9/11 Commission report confirms that 8 out of the 14 hijackers passed through Iran during the period from October 2000 to February 2001.                              {time}  1045  Iranian intelligence facilitated the travel of some operatives with visas while sheltering others. In these documents, there is even a wedding video of bin Laden's son with al-Qaida members in attendance in--you guessed it-- As Sun Tzu famously said in ``The Art of War'': ``The enemy of my enemy is my friend.'' We are their shared enemy.  It is shameful that the Obama administration deliberately withheld this information. If these files exposing Iran's outreach and association with al-Qaida had been released, support for the Iran nuclear deal would have eroded even further, and rightfully so.  Since the JCPOA was entered into, Iranian aggression in the Middle East, including Iraq and Syria and elsewhere, has only increased. These bad activities have only gotten worse. Now it is even clearer why that is.  Any terrorist group that wants to attack U.interests will have Iran's financial and material support. By providing Iran with $150 billion sanctions relief, we are giving Iran the resources it needs to carry out its bad activities threatening the United States and our allies.  While we already know of Iran's close ties with Hezbollah and political influence in Iraq, these documents exhibit the extensive reach that Iran has in the region. Keeping these documents hidden from the general public while the JCPOA was being debated and approved was blatant politicization of intelligence, and it was totally reprehensible.  Thankfully, the current administration has released these documents to let the American public know the truth. I commend the CIA Director, our former colleague in this House, Mike Pompeo, who has hit the ground running as the new CIA Director and made the bold decision to take these 470,000 documents and release them for the American public and for the world to see. They shouldn't have been hidden in the first place. They should not have been hidden for so long.
