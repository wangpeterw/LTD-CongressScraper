                              GUN VIOLENCE

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the wake of yet another mass 
shooting in this country to ask the House of Representatives to summon 
the courage to actually do something to prevent the next terrible 
tragedy.
  Last evening we held a moment of silence on this floor, and what I 
fear is that, again, that moment of silence will be followed by days of 
silence by this House, by weeks of silence by this House, by months of 
silence by this House on the very question of gun violence in this 
country.
  There are things we can do to move past the typical partisan 
response: the legislation that I and three others crafted, bipartisan 
legislation, to regulate these terrible bump stocks that could have 
prevented the tragedy in Las Vegas from being as bad as it was.
  Other things we can do that we agree on: closing the background check 
loophole, making sure that if you are too dangerous to fly on an 
airplane, you can't buy a weapon.
  These are the things that Congress ought to take up and that the 
American people have every right to expect us to act upon.
  Let's do something.
