                         HONORING JUDITH MORRIS

  (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say good-bye to a dedicated 
public servant and a key part of my team. Judith Morrishas served the 
Olympic Peninsula for a decade, first for my predecessor Norm Dicks, 
and for the past 4 years in my office.
  Judith's knowledge of the peninsula and her dedication is unmatched. 
There are few that combine her compassion and guidanceto any 
constituent who had a question or who needed help with a Federal 
agency. Whether at the office or at the grocery store orat an event, 
Judith was available.
  Mr. Speaker, Judith has served our Nation with distinction, first in 
the Peace Corps, and now in the United States House ofRepresentatives, 
making equity and conservation and human rights a tenet of her time in 
service. Judith's wit, thoughtfulness,and easygoing manner will be 
missed.
  Our entire community thanks her and her husband, David, an 
outstanding public servant in his own right, who worked for theNational 
Park Service, for leaving a legacy of integrity, excellence, and 
service.
  I am humbled and honored to offer my sincere thanks to Judith Morris 
for her dedication to the Sixth Congressional District,and I wish her 
the best as she continues to explore her passion for travel and service 
all around this world.
