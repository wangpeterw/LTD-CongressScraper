 WISHING ARNOLD HIGH SCHOOL AMERICAN GOVERNMENT STUDENTS GOOD LUCK ON 
                    UPCOMING ADVANCED PLACEMENT EXAM

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Dunn) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish Mr. Ryan Ziem's American 
Government students at Arnold High School the very best luck in their 
upcoming advanced placement exam. I visited these students last fall, 
and I was impressed by their articulate questions and commitment to 
understanding our system of government.
  Of course, understanding our system of government means understanding 
the U.S. Constitution. It is the greatest gift left to us by the 
Founders, and it has stood the test of time.
  The success of the Constitution is due to its carefully designed 
system of checks and balances. By separating the powers of government 
into separate but equal branches and guaranteeing individual rights, 
the Constitution has been, as James Madison suggested, ``the guardian 
of true liberty.''
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in wishing these bright young students 
good luck on their AP exam and in their college applications.
