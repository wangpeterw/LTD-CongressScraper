                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Spirit, to whom we must give an account for all our powers 
and privileges, guide our steps, use us to bring healing to our Nation 
and world.
  Give wisdom to our Senators, making them faithful stewards of Your 
will. As they strive to serve You, help them to remember that to whom 
much is given, much will be required. Open their minds and hearts to 
know and do Your will, relying on Your strength to empower them to 
serve You with honor. May they discover in their daily world the joy of 
partnership with You.
  Lord, use them to keep America a shining city on a hill. As they 
delight in Your presence, plant within their hearts a greater desire to 
glorify You.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
