                        House of Representatives

  EXPLANATORY STATEMENT SUBMITTED BY MR. FRELINGHUYSEN OF NEW JERSEY, 
CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, REGARDING THE HOUSE 
             AMENDMENT TO THE SENATE AMENDMENTS ON H.R. 244

       The following is an explanation of the Consolidated 
     Appropriations Act, 2017.
       This Act includes 11 regular appropriations bills for 
     fiscal year 2017. The divisions contained in the Act are as 
     follows:
         Division A--Agriculture, Rural Development, Food 
     and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations 
     Act, 2017
         Division B--Commerce, Justice, Science, and 
     Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017
         Division C--Department of Defense Appropriations 
     Act, 2017
         Division D--Energy and Water Development and 
     Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017
         Division E--Financial Services and General 
     Government Appropriations Act, 2017
         Division F--Department of Homeland Security 
     Appropriations Act, 2017
         Division G--Department of the Interior, 
     Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017
         Division H--Departments of Labor, Health and 
     Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies 
     Appropriations Act, 2017
         Division I--Legislative Branch Appropriations 
     Act, 2017
         Division J--Department of State, Foreign 
     Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2017
         Division K--Transportation, Housing and Urban 
     Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017
         Division L--Military Construction and Veterans 
     Affairs--Additional Appropriations Act, 2017
         Division M--Other Matters
         Division N--Honoring Investments in Recruiting 
     and Employing American Military Veterans Act of 2017 (This is 
     the original subject matter of H.R. 244.)
       Section 1 of the Act is the short title of the bill.
       Section 2 of the Act displays a table of contents.
       Section 3 of the Act states that, unless expressly provided 
     otherwise, any reference to ``this Act'' contained in any 
     division shall be treated as referring only to the provisions 
     of that division.
       Section 4 of the Act states that this explanatory statement 
     shall have the same effect with respect to the allocation of 
     funds and implementation of this legislation as if it were a 
     joint explanatory statement of a committee of conference.
       Section 5 of the Act provides a statement of 
     appropriations.
       Section 6 of the Act states that each amount designated by 
     Congress as an emergency requirement is contingent on the 
     President so designating all such emergency amounts and 
     transmitting such designations to Congress. The section 
     further states that each amount designated by Congress as 
     being for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on 
     Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) is contingent on the President so 
     designating all such OCO/GWOT amounts and transmitting such 
     designations to Congress. The provision is consistent with 
     the requirements in the Budget Control Act of 2011.
       Section 7 of the Act addresses possible technical 
     scorekeeping differences for fiscal year 2017 between the 
     Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget 
     Office.
       Section 8 of the Act makes a technical correction to the 
     long title of the Further Continuing and Security Assistance 
     Appropriations Act, 2017.
       The Act does not contain any congressional earmarks, 
     limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined 
     by clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of 
     Representatives.

       DIVISION A--AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG 
     ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017

                        CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTIVES

       The explanatory statement is silent on provisions that were 
     in both the House Report (H. Rpt. 114-531) and Senate Report 
     (S. Rpt. 114-259) that remain unchanged by this agreement, 
     except as noted in this explanatory statement.
       The agreement restates that executive branch wishes cannot 
     substitute for Congress's own statements as to the best 
     evidence of congressional intentions, which are the official 
     reports of the Congress. The agreement further points out 
     that funds in this Act must be used for the purposes for 
     which appropriated, as required by section 1301 of title 31 
     of the United States Code, which provides: ``Appropriations 
     shall be applied only to the objects for which the 
     appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by 
     law.''
       The House and Senate report language that is not changed by 
     the explanatory statement is approved and indicates 
     congressional intentions. The explanatory statement, while 
     repeating some report language for emphasis, does not intend 
     to negate the language referred to above unless expressly 
     provided herein.
       In cases in which the House or the Senate have directed the 
     submission of a report, such report is to be submitted to 
     both the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations no 
     later than 60 days after enactment of this Act, unless 
     otherwise directed.
       Hereafter, in division A of this statement, the term `the 
     Committees' refers to the Committees on Appropriations of the 
     House of Representatives and the Senate.
       For the appropriations provided by this Act and previous 
     Acts, the departments and agencies funded by this agreement 
     are reminded that the Committees use the definitions for 
     transfer, reprogramming, and program, project, and activity 
     as defined by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 
     GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law--Vol. I and GAO-05-734SP 
     Budget Glossary.
       A transfer is the shifting of funds between appropriations. 
     It applies to (1) transfers from one agency to another, (2) 
     transfers from one account to another within the same agency, 
     and (3) transfers to an interagency or intra-agency working 
     fund. In each instance, statutory authority is required.
       Reprogramming is the utilization of funds in an 
     appropriation account for purposes other than those 
     contemplated at the time of appropriation. It is the shifting 
     of funds from one object to another within an appropriation.
       A program, project, or activity (PPA) is an element within 
     a budget account. PPAs are identified by reference to include 
     the most specific level of budget items identified in the 
     Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, 
     and Related Agencies Act, 2017, accompanying Committee 
     reports, explanatory statements, the Statement of Managers, 
     and budget justifications. Program activity structures are 
     intended to provide a meaningful representation of the 
     operations financed by a specific budget account by project, 
     activity, or organization.

[[Page H3328]]

       For fiscal year 2017, the Committees continue to include 
     bill language requiring advanced notification of certain 
     agency actions. Notification will be required at least 15 
     days in advance of any action if (1) a major capital 
     investment is modified; (2) an office is realigned or 
     reorganized; and (3) activities are carried out that were not 
     described in the budget request.
       The agreement directs the Office of Budget and Program 
     Analysis (OBPA) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
     to provide an organizational chart for each agency funded by 
     this Act to the division and subdivision level, as 
     appropriate, by June 1, 2017. The agreement also directs the 
     Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Farm Credit 
     Administration (FCA) to provide an organizational chart of 
     each agency respectively to the division and subdivision 
     level, as appropriate, by June 1, 2017.
       Further, USDA and FDA should be mindful of Congressional 
     authority to determine and set final funding levels for 
     fiscal year 2018. Therefore, the agencies should not 
     presuppose program funding outcomes and prematurely initiate 
     action to redirect staffing prior to knowing final outcomes 
     on fiscal year 2018 program funding. The agreement directs 
     OBPA to provide the Committees with the number of staff years 
     and employees on board for each agency funded by this Act on 
     a quarterly basis.
       The agreement includes the authority to spend $8,608,000 to 
     address expenses incurred at the National Finance Center 
     resulting from the February 2017 tornado to ensure continuity 
     of vital services at the existing location.
       The agreement directs NIFA to study the recent infestation 
     of oak mites and focus on suppression and eradication 
     possibilities.
       The U.S. cotton industry has experienced three years of 
     market returns well below the cost of production without a 
     viable safety net for producers under the current Farm Bill. 
     Market projections for 2017 and subsequent years indicate an 
     acute need for immediate relief and long-term program 
     security. Within 60 days of the enactment of this Act, the 
     Secretary is directed to issue a report detailing 
     administrative options for financial relief and recommended 
     legislative actions to provide the cotton industry with a 
     viable safety net.
       The Margin Protection Program for Dairy Producers, which 
     was included in the Agricultural Act of 2014, was intended to 
     provide a safety net for dairy producers in times of low 
     margins. However, that program has not worked as anticipated, 
     and dairy farmers have been hit with milk prices that have 
     plummeted since 2014, as well as new challenges with our 
     export markets. This has resulted in sharply reduced incomes 
     and a significant number of dairy operations going out of 
     business, and many more dairy producers who are struggling to 
     keep their operations financially sound. Prompt congressional 
     action is needed to fix the program so that it provides the 
     support that was intended. The Secretary is encouraged to use 
     all available methods and authorities, including the use of 
     the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act, to provide 
     immediate assistance to these producers until such time as a 
     revised safety net program can be provided.

                 Production, Processing, and Marketing

                        Office of the Secretary


                     (including transfers of funds)

       The agreement provides $44,555,000 for the Office of the 
     Secretary.
       The agreement recognizes the Department has statutory 
     authorities and programs designed to help break the multi-
     generational trap of poverty in rural counties and supports 
     USDA's utilization of existing programs and funding within RD 
     and FNS in order to assist families, create jobs, and develop 
     a path towards self-sufficiency. Other existing resources 
     such as the extension service and public universities can be 
     used for coordination and outreach activities. The Committees 
     have not received the detailed plan required to be submitted 
     by the Secretary detailing all funding resources and bundled 
     services to combat rural poverty.
       The following table reflects the agreement:

  Office of the Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs

       The agreement provides $901,000 for the Office of the Under 
     Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs.

               Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

       The agreement provides $946,212,000 for the Animal and 
     Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Salaries and 
     Expenses.
       The agreement includes a net increase of $51,797,000 for 
     high priority initiatives in order to protect the plant and 
     animal resources of the Nation from pests and diseases. 
     Nearly half of this increase is applied to the agency's 
     request for $24,000,000 in new funding for Emergency 
     Preparedness and Response. This increase stemmed from the 
     agency's experience with the 2015 outbreak of Highly 
     Pathogenic Avian Influenza that cost taxpayers nearly $1 
     billion. The agreement also provides increases within the 
     total funding level of: $2,518,000 for Animal Health and 
     Technical Services; $500,000 for the Equine, Cervid, and 
     Small Ruminant Health Program; $1,175,000 for the National 
     Veterinary Stockpile; $3,000,000 for the Veterinary 
     Diagnostics program; $7,000,000 for the Zoonotic Disease 
     Management program; $1,430,000 for the Agricultural 
     Quarantine Inspection program; $8,500,000 for the Specialty 
     Crop Pests program; $2,199,000 for the Wildlife Damage 
     Management program; $500,000 for the Agriculture Import-
     Export program; and, $400,000 for Animal Welfare in order for 
     APHIS to provide oversight of animal research at the 
     Agricultural Research Service.
       The agreement provides a one-time increase of $1,000,000 
     for the Animal Health Technical Services program to conduct a 
     pilot program for the study of the effectiveness in improving 
     disease traceability, cost, and durability of Ultra High 
     Frequency (UHF) Radio-frequency identification (RFID) back 
     tags in comparison to the other types of animal 
     identification methods currently used by the livestock 
     industry within USDA's Animal Disease Traceability framework.
       The agreement provides $28,810,000 for the Animal Welfare 
     program, an increase of $400,000, and directs APHIS to 
     continue its inspections of ARS facilities, to post its 
     inspection reports online, and to provide copies of the 
     reports to the Committees.
       The agreement includes funding to collect additional data 
     that will inform policy related to the appropriate antibiotic 
     use in all settings across agriculture and clinical medicine. 
     The agreement provides an increase of $7,000,000 within 
     Zoonotic Disease Management for on-farm surveillance, data 
     collection, sampling, surveillance, and testing to enhance 
     the understanding of on-farm levels of antibiotic use and the 
     impact on antimicrobial resistance levels. The information 
     collected should clearly delineate between antibiotics used 
     for food-producing and companion animals. Further, to avoid 
     duplication with existing programs like the National 
     Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System, the agreement 
     expects surveys regarding on-farm usage to be limited to 
     collecting information about the antibiotics used and should 
     not be utilized for other regulatory purposes.
       The agreement includes no less than $3,500,000 for cervid 
     health activities. Within the funds provided, APHIS should 
     give consideration to indemnity payments if warranted.
       The agreement provides an increase of $24,000,000 for 
     emergency preparedness and response to establish a more 
     robust agency framework for addressing animal and plant 
     disease outbreaks. The Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza 
     outbreak of 2015 exposed a number of challenges facing the 
     agency. Additional funds will allow APHIS to increase 
     veterinarians and animal health technicians; health, safety 
     and biosecurity officers; and develop resources and 
     technologies for the early detection of foreign animal 
     diseases and improved response options.
       The agreement includes $28,000,000 under Wildlife Damage 
     Management for national rabies management, surveillance, and 
     eradication efforts and $2,000,000 for Wildlife Services 
     education and training. The agreement also provides 
     $1,600,000 for combatting wildlife depredation to production 
     aquaculture and an additional $5,000,000 for increased feral 
     swine surveillance.
       The agreement remains concerned about the devastating 
     impact citrus greening disease has had on our nation's citrus 
     production. The agreement maintains increased funding for 
     Huanglongbing Emergency Response within the Specialty Crop 
     Pests line item and provides an additional $5,500,000 to 
     support the Huanglongbing Multi-Agency Coordination (HLB MAC) 
     group. The agreement encourages APHIS to allocate sufficient 
     resources to continue vital management, control, and 
     associated activities to address citrus greening and to 
     support priorities and strategies identified by the HLB MAC 
     group.
       The agreement provides funding for NAHLN through both APHIS 
     and NIFA at approximately $12,000,000 and $4,300,000, 
     respectively, for a total investment of $16,300,000 for 
     fiscal year 2017.
       The agreement expects that USDA will not fully implement 
     the final rule allowing the importation of lemons from 
     Argentina until the Operational Work Plan ensures that 
     Argentina can meet the same phytosanitary risk standards 
     required by the other current countries importing citrus into 
     the United States.

     Marketing Service.
       The National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) has concluded 
     its sunset review process for substances and ingredients on 
     the National List. As USDA reviews the NOSB's 
     recommendations, the agreement directs USDA to fully consider 
     all currently available scientific information and 
     stakeholder comments during the rulemaking process. 
     Substances and ingredients should be evaluated pursuant to 
     the criteria specified in the Organic Foods Production Act (7 
     U.S.C. 6517(c)(1)(A)) and the Agriculture Marketing Service 
     implementing regulations 7 C.F.R. 205.600. The Department is 
     reminded that the spirit of the organic program is to allow 
     for the use of natural processes and materials to the 
     greatest extent practicable.
       The agreement directs the Department to stay within the 
     parameters of the required study mandated by Section 293(c) 
     of the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard (Pub. 
     L. 114-216).

                         Risk Management Agency


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

       The agreement provides $74,829,000 for the Risk Management 
     Agency (RMA), Salaries and Expenses.
       The agreement supports the development of insurance 
     products that recognize and cover livestock products such as 
     milk as `agricultural commodities' separately and distinctly 
     from coverage developed for `livestock.' The statute only 
     refers to livestock and lists types of livestock in the 
     definition (7 U.S.C. 1523(b)), but lists no livestock 
     products. There is no indication that Congress intended for 
     livestock products to fall under the limitation of livestock 
     insurance policies

[[Page H3332]]

     and this restriction has unnecessarily hindered the 
     availability of policies for livestock products like milk. 
     The agreement encourages RMA to present this reinterpretation 
     to the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation board at the next 
     scheduled meeting and develop additional policies for milk to 
     provide dairy farmers with more robust risk management 
     options before the end of the year.

               WATERSHED AND FLOOD PREVENTION OPERATIONS

       The agreement provides $150,000,000 for Watershed and Flood 
     Prevention Operations.
       The agreement recognizes the critical challenges facing 
     rural water resource management and protection and supports 
     needed investments in watershed operations that have been 
     absent since fiscal year 2010. These Federal--State--local 
     partnerships are uniquely positioned to identify critical 
     watershed protection and flood prevention needs in rural 
     communities and implement projects that deliver multiple 
     streams of benefits for homes, businesses, and transportation 
     infrastructure and natural resources. In selecting projects 
     for funding, the agency is expected to balance the needs of 
     addressing the project backlog, remediation of existing 
     structures, and new projects.


                    WATERSHED REHABILITATION PROGRAM

       The agreement provides $12,000,000 for the Watershed

     (RD), Salaries and Expenses.
       The agreement includes a general provision directing that 
     $500,000 made available for `Rural Development, Salaries and 
     Expenses' shall be used to develop an implementation plan for 
     increasing access to education in the fields of science, 
     technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in rural 
     communities through the Distance Learning and Telemedicine 
     program. The agreement directs that the implementation plan 
     also address the availability of, access to, and quality of 
     access to STEM education in rural communities. The agreement 
     further directs that it be developed not later than six 
     months after the date of enactment of this Act and in close

       The agreement provides $2,759,378,000 in new discretionary 
     budget authority and $1,895,711,000 in definite user fees for 
     a total of $4,655,089,000 for Food and Drug Administration 
     (FDA), Salaries and Expenses. This total does not include 
     permanent, indefinite user fees for the Mammography Quality 
     Standards Act; Color Certification; Export Certification; 
     Priority Review Vouchers Pediatric Disease; Food and Feed 
     Recall; Food Reinspection; Voluntary Qualified Importer 
     Program; the Third Party Auditor Program; Outsourcing 
     Facility; and Medical Countermeasure Priority Review 
     Vouchers. The agreement accepts $13,516,000 in proposed 
     administrative savings and expects FDA to continue all 
     projects, activities, laboratories, and programs as included 
     in fiscal year 2016 unless otherwise specified.
       The agreement also includes a general provision providing 
     $10,000,000 for FDA to prevent, prepare for, and respond to 
     emerging health threats, including the Ebola and Zika 
     viruses, domestically and internationally and to develop 
     necessary medical countermeasures and vaccines.
       As part of the increases, the agreement provides an 
     additional $35,675,000 to support the implementation of the 
     Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). Of this amount, 
     $18,672,000 is provided for the National Integrated Food 
     Safety System and $16,913,000 is provided for Import Safety. 
     Funds for import safety should help FDA ensure an even 
     playing field in the application of FSMA regulations as it 
     relates to both domestic and imported producers, processors, 
     and manufacturers of food and animal feed. The agreement 
     notes that FSMA implementation places additional requirements 
     on state governments and private stakeholders, and therefore 
     urges the FDA to provide sufficient resources to State 
     education and inspection programs to address these needs. The 
     agreement continues to require quarterly reports to the 
     Committees with a breakdown on funding allocations, as well 
     as projections for future needs.
       The agreement provides an increase of $10,911,000 for 
     medical product safety initiatives including $2,500,000 for 
     efforts to support the Precision Medicine initiative. This 
     increase should supplement efforts authorized in the 21st 
     Century Cures Act. In addition, an increase of $4,000,000 is 
     provided for Pediatric Device Consortium Grants and 
     postmarket activities within the Medical Device program. 
     Lastly, the agreement provides an increase of $4,411,000 for 
     animal drug and medical device review activities. The 
     agreement continues to include the fiscal year 2016 funding 
     to evaluate over-the-counter sunscreen products.
       The $2,500,000 increase above the amount provided in fiscal 
     year 2016 for foreign high-risk inspections will allow FDA's 
     Office of the Global Regulatory Operations Policy to continue 
     efforts to develop and utilize a targeted, risk-based, and 
     efficient inspection model that incorporates commercially 
     available information on high-risk establishments for onsite 
     verifications. FDA is directed to provide the Committees with 
     an update on these efforts, including estimated efficiencies 
     and concerns, and plans to continue or expand this effort in 
     the future.
       Employees charged with implementing federal programs are 
     expected to carry out their duties in a legal and ethical 
     manner, free from conflicts of interest, without seeking 
     private gain or advancing a private agenda, and without 
     giving preferential treatment to any outside organization or 
     individual. The agency is reminded of its responsibility to 
     ensure that federal employees handle information, including 
     information received from the employees, offices, or 
     Committees of the Congress, in a professional and 
     confidential manner according to the federal government's 
     code of conduct, standards, regulations, and statutes.
       The agreement strongly urges the FDA to continue to work 
     with Congress to address the issues and concerns regarding 
     the regulation of Laboratory Developed Tests.
       The agreement provides $6,000,000 for Pediatric Device 
     Consortia Grants.
       The agreement remains concerned with the draft MOU that the 
     FDA proposed under Section 503A of the FDCA. Section 503A 
     distinguishes between ``distribution'' and ``dispensing'' for 
     the purposes of the MOU. In the DQSA, Congress only allowed 
     the FDA to regulate ``distribution.'' The MOU appears to 
     exceed the authority granted in the statute by redefining 
     ``distribution'' in a manner that includes dispensing. 
     Congress did not intend to include dispensing of compounded 
     drugs over state lines within the scope of the MOU. The MOU 
     should not address dispensing of compounded drugs to a 
     patient over state lines if all other requirements of 503A 
     are met.


                        BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES

       The agreement provides $11,788,000 for the Food and Drug 
     Administration Buildings and Facilities.

       The agreement includes a limitation of $68,600,000 on 
     administrative expenses of the Farm Credit Administration.

     DIVISION B--COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES 
                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017

       Report language included in House Report 114-605 (``the 
     House report'') or Senate Report 114-239 (``the Senate 
     report'') that is not changed by this explanatory statement 
     or this Act is approved. The explanatory statement, while 
     repeating some language for emphasis, is not intended to 
     negate the language referred to above unless expressly 
     provided herein. In cases where both the House report and the 
     Senate report address a particular issue not specifically 
     addressed in the explanatory statement, the House report and 
     the Senate report should be read as consistent and are to be 
     interpreted accordingly. In cases where the House report or 
     the Senate report directs the submission of a report, such 
     report is to be submitted to both the House and Senate 
     Committees on Appropriations (``the Committees'').
       Each department and agency funded in this Act shall follow 
     the directions set forth in this Act and the accompanying 
     explanatory statement, and shall not reallocate resources or 
     reorganize activities except as provided herein. 
     Reprogramming procedures shall apply to: funds provided in 
     this Act; unobligated balances from previous appropriations 
     Acts that are available for obligation or expenditure in 
     fiscal year 2017; and non-appropriated resources such as fee 
     collections that are used to meet program requirements in 
     fiscal year 2017. These procedures are specified in section 
     505 of this Act.
       Any reprogramming request shall include any out-year 
     budgetary impacts and a separate accounting of program or 
     mission impacts on estimated carryover funds. Any program, 
     project or activity cited in this statement, or in the House 
     report or the Senate report and not changed by this Act or 
     statement, shall be construed as the position of the Congress 
     and shall not be subject to reductions or reprogramming 
     without prior approval of the Committees. Further, any 
     department or agency funded in this Act that plans a 
     reduction-in-force shall notify the Committees by letter no 
     later than 30 days in advance of the date of any such planned 
     personnel action.
       When a department or agency submits a reprogramming or 
     transfer request to the Committees and does not receive 
     identical responses, it shall be the responsibility of the 
     department or agency seeking the reprogramming to reconcile 
     the differences between the two bodies before proceeding. If 
     reconciliation is not possible, the items in disagreement in 
     the reprogramming or transfer request shall be considered 
     unapproved. Departments and agencies shall not submit 
     reprogramming notifications after July 1, 2017, except in 
     extraordinary circumstances. Any such notification shall 
     include a description of the extraordinary circumstances.
       In compliance with section 533 of this Act, each department 
     and agency funded in this Act shall submit spending plans, 
     signed by the respective department or agency head, for the 
     Committees' review not later than 45 days after enactment of 
     this Act.

     Department of Homeland Security, shall describe how 
     communities can be supported with resources or technical 
     assistance for immediate recovery efforts as well as for 
     longer-term needs. The plan should identify key points of

       In total, this Act includes $2,393,800,000 for State and 
     local law enforcement and crime prevention programs. This 
     amount includes $2,313,800,000 in discretionary budget 
     authority, of which $326,000,000 is derived by transfer from 
     the Crime Victims Fund and $7,000,000 is contained in Public 
     Law 114-254. This amount also includes $73,000,000 scored as 
     mandatory for Public Safety Officer Benefits.
       House and Senate report language regarding management and 
     administration expenses is adopted by reference, and it is 
     clarified that the Department's methodology for assessing 
     these costs should be both fair and equitable across all 
     grant programs.
       The agreement includes a limitation on obligations from the 
     Crime Victims Fund of $2,573,000,000 as stipulated in section 
     510 of this Act, which is the three-year average of 
     collections into the fund. As the limitation has been 
     significantly increased from $745,000,000 in fiscal year 
     2014, collections have slowed based on the most recent 
     estimate by the Congressional Budget Office, resulting in 
     balances in the fund declining. The agreement to base the 
     limitation on average collections will help ensure solvency 
     of the fund.
       In lieu of providing base funding for Tribal Assistance, 
     Tribal Youth, and Tribal Resources Grant Program, section 213 
     of the agreement includes a 7 percent set-aside, which will 
     provide funding for these programs.
       The Department is directed to submit a report, not later 
     than 90 days after enactment of this Act, detailing the 
     amount of DOJ grant funding for the past three fiscal years 
     allocated for assistance in persistent poverty counties, as 
     defined in section 539 of this Act.

                           TITLE III--SCIENCE

                Office of Science and Technology Policy

       This Act includes $5,555,000 for the Office of Science and 
     Technology Policy.

             National Aeronautics and Space Administration

       This Act includes $19,653,300,000 for the National 
     Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The agreement 
     clarifies that NASA shall continue to provide information to 
     the GAO for its assessment of selected large-scale projects, 
     to include any technology demonstration activities or 
     communications and tracking services and related 
     infrastructure refreshment activities, which have life cycle 
     costs that exceed $250,000,000. The agreement does not 
     include House direction regarding Federally Funded Research 
     and Development Centers. Instead, NASA is encouraged to 
     increase and strengthen partnerships between the NASA Centers 
     and academia.
       Continuity.--Over the past decade, Congress has 
     consistently reaffirmed through both funding and policy its 
     commitment to a balanced NASA portfolio that enhances 
     aeronautics and aerospace, enables breakthrough scientific 
     discoveries, promotes the development of commercial 
     spaceflight, and expands human and robotic exploration 
     through missions only NASA can undertake. NASA's diverse 
     portfolio cannot be undertaken efficiently, effectively, and 
     safely during times of budgetary and policy uncertainty. 
     Maintaining an appropriate funding plan to achieve mission 
     goals is crucial to avoid needless delays and unnecessary 
     additional costs.

     $408,000,000 for the Mars 2020 mission as directed by the 
     House. The agreement adopts House language regarding a Mars 
     helicopter technology demonstration but directs that if this 
     activity will delay the overall Mars 2020 mission, that it 
     not be included as part of Mars 2020.
       Astrophysics.--This Act includes $750,000,000 for 
     Astrophysics. Given the restrained funding in this agreement 
     for Astrophysics, the agreement supports continued 
     appropriate low level exoplanet technology development for a 
     starshade. The recommendation also includes $105,000,000 for 
     the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and retains

     Realize, Integrate, Venture, Educate initiative, the 
     agreement supports continued implementation of this program.
       Education and Public Outreach (EPO).--The recommendation 
     includes $37,000,000 for STEM education programs, to be 
     derived equally from Planetary Science and Astrophysics. This 
     activity shall continue to be administered by the 
     Astrophysics Division.


                              AERONAUTICS

       This Act includes $660,000,000 for Aeronautics. Within 
     these amounts, up to $169,400,000 is provided for the 
     Airspace Operations and Safety Program as described by the 
     House.


                            SPACE TECHNOLOGY

       This Act includes $686,500,000 for Space Technology. Within 
     this amount, $35,000,000 is for nuclear propulsion;

                              EXPLORATION

       Exploration.--This Act includes $4,324,000,000 for 
     Exploration. The agreement directs NASA to continue advanced 
     propulsion; asteroid deflection; and grappling technologies 
     associated with the asteroid redirect mission but that these 
     activities should not distract from the overarching goal of 
     sending humans to Mars. The agreement provides up to 
     $75,000,000 for habitation augmentation activities to support 
     human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.


                            SPACE OPERATIONS

       Space Operations.--This Act provides $4,950,700,000 for 
     Space Operations. The agreement clarifies House language 
     regarding the International Space Station and that efforts 
     should focus on maintaining a U.S. presence in low Earth 
     orbit in order to continue research in a microgravity 
     environment. The recommendation includes up to $20,000,000 
     for 21st Century Space Launch Complex program activities and 
     provides that no less than half of 21st Century Space Launch 
     Complex funding shall be for the Wallops Flight Facility as 
     described in the Senate report.
       Commercial Crew.--This Act provides up to $1,184,800,000 
     for NASA's Commercial Crew program. The Committees are aware 
     that Commercial Crew milestones have slipped and that 
     concerns have been raised with respect to safety and 
     appropriate NASA oversight. The Committees emphasize and 
     underscore House and Senate language regarding human 
     spaceflight safety and direct NASA to notify the Committees 
     if safety concerns are not addressed as directed by NASA.
       Commercial Cargo.--The agreement provides up to the 
     requested amount of $1,028,000,000 to fund domestic cargo 
     resupply flights. Over the past year, both providers under 
     their CRS-1 contracts have returned to flight after 
     experiencing the loss of vehicles and NASA payloads. Despite 
     the successful resumption of cargo flights, NASA has chosen 
     to rely on proven vehicles for delivery of valuable or unique 
     cargo. As regular cargo flights are resumed, NASA is 
     encouraged to continue flights from facilities where NASA has 
     invested significant resources to enable commercial cargo 
     flights.
       Space shuttle closeout costs.--This Act does not include 
     funds for space shuttle closeout costs. The Committees 
     understand that NASA has reached an agreement on amounts 
     necessary for closure of contracts related to the former 
     space shuttle program and has determined that no additional 
     costs will be charged to the government after September 30, 
     2016, and that no additional funds will be required in fiscal 
     year 2017 and beyond.


                               EDUCATION

     Mission Services, including $39,100,000 for Independent 
     Verification and Validation services as directed by the 
     Senate. Given infrastructure revitalization language included 
     in Public Law 115-10, the National Aeronautics and Space 
     Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017, the 
     agreement does not include House language regarding a 
     facilities revitalization plan. The agreement adopts Senate 
     language regarding cybersecurity, strong governance, and 
     information security and provides no less than the fiscal 
     year 2016 level for these activities. The agreement 
     acknowledges that recoveries of prior year obligations are 
     available in this account.

     reprogramming of funds.
       Section 506 provides that if it is determined that any 
     person intentionally affixes a ``Made in America'' label to 
     any product that was not made in America that person shall

     applied to discretionary budget authority balances that were 
     not appropriated with emergency or disaster relief 
     designations.

       DIVISION C--DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017

       The following is an explanation of the effects of this Act, 
     which makes appropriations for the Department of Defense for 
     fiscal year 2017. Unless otherwise noted, references to the 
     House and Senate reports are to House Report 114-577 and 
     Senate Report 114-263, respectively. The language contained 
     in the House and Senate reports warrant full compliance and 
     carry the same weight as language included in this 
     explanatory statement unless specifically addressed to the 
     contrary in the bill or this explanatory statement. While 
     repeating some language from the House or Senate reports for 
     emphasis, this explanatory statement does not intend to 
     negate the language referred to above unless expressly 
     provided herein.


              DEFINITION OF PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND ACTIVITY

       For the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
     Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-177), as amended 
     by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
     Reaffirmation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-119), and by the 
     Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-508), the 
     terms ``program, project, and activity'' for appropriations 
     contained in this Act shall be defined as the most specific 
     level of budget items identified in the Department of Defense 
     Appropriations Act, 2017, the related classified annexes and 
     explanatory statements, and the P-1 and R-1 budget 
     justification documents as subsequently modified by 
     congressional action.
       The following exception to the above definition shall 
     apply: the military personnel and the operation and 
     maintenance accounts, for which the term ``program, project, 
     and activity'' is defined as the appropriations accounts 
     contained in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act.
       At the time the President submits the budget request for 
     fiscal year 2018, the Secretary of Defense is directed to 
     transmit to the congressional defense committees budget 
     justification documents to be known as the ``M-1'' and the 
     ``O-1'' which shall identify, at the budget activity, 
     activity group, and sub-activity group level, the amounts 
     requested by the President to be appropriated to the 
     Department of Defense for military personnel and operation 
     and maintenance in any budget request, or amended budget 
     request, for fiscal year 2018.


                         REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow 
     the reprogramming guidance for acquisition accounts as 
     specified in the report accompanying the House version of the 
     Department of Defense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 
     2008 (House Report 110-279). For operation and maintenance 
     accounts, the Secretary of Defense shall continue to follow 
     the reprogramming guidelines specified in the conference 
     report accompanying H.R. 3222, the Department of Defense 
     Appropriations Act, 2008. The dollar threshold for 
     reprogramming funds shall remain at $10,000,000 for military 
     personnel; $15,000,000 for operation and maintenance; 
     $20,000,000 for procurement; and $10,000,000 for research, 
     development, test and evaluation.
       Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is 
     directed to continue to provide the congressional defense 
     committees annual DD Form 1416 reports for titles I and II 
     and quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports for 
     Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of 
     this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with 
     guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying 
     the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The 
     Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior 
     approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified 
     dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or 
     research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is 
     less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for 
     reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. 
     Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of 
     a military personnel (M-1), an operation and maintenance (O-
     1), a procurement (P-1), or a research, development, test and 
     evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the 
     Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval 
     reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In 
     addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval 
     reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest 
     items are established elsewhere in this statement.


                           FUNDING INCREASES

       The funding increases outlined in the tables for each 
     appropriation account shall be provided only for the specific 
     purposes indicated in the tables.


                  CONGRESSIONAL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS

       Items for which additional funds have been provided or 
     items for which funding is specifically reduced as shown in 
     the project level tables or in paragraphs using the phrase 
     ``only for'' or ``only to'' are congressional special 
     interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming 
     (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD 
     Form 1414 at the stated amount, as specifically addressed in 
     the explanatory statement.


                            CLASSIFIED ANNEX

       Adjustments to classified programs are addressed in the 
     accompanying classified annex.


                  BUDGET LIAISON SUPPORT TO THE HOUSE 
                   AND SENATE DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS 
                             SUBCOMMITTEES

       The House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees 
     rely heavily on offices within the Comptroller organizations 
     of the military departments and the Office of the Secretary 
     of Defense to conduct their oversight responsibilities and 
     make funding recommendations for the Department of Defense. 
     Established in the 1970s in accordance with a recommendation 
     of the Blue Ribbon Defense Panel, these offices facilitate 
     the appropriate flow of information between the House and 
     Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees and the 
     Comptroller of the respective department or agency. In the 
     early 1990s, the House and Senate Defense Appropriations 
     Subcommittees restated the support these organizations 
     provide to the Committees and noted that ``while the various 
     offices of legislative affairs offer great assistance to DoD 
     and the Congress, they do not provide the expertise and the 
     direct relationship to the Comptroller organizations which 
     are essential to the effective communication between DoD and 
     the Committees on Appropriations.''
       Further, the explanatory statement accompanying the 
     Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2016 echoed the 
     imperative to maintain the existing liaison structure to 
     achieve the highest level of communication and trust between 
     the Department of Defense and the House and Senate Defense 
     Appropriations Subcommittees.
       The House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees 
     repeat this support for the budget liaison organizations and 
     reiterate previously stated concerns that efforts to 
     incorporate these organizations into the military and Office 
     of the Secretary of Defense legislative affairs offices would 
     be deleterious to the appropriations process and to the 
     utility of the budget liaison operation. Therefore, the 
     agreement retains a provision in title II of this Act from 
     previous years that prohibits the use of funds in this Act to 
     plan or implement the consolidation of a budget or 
     appropriations liaison office of the Office of the Secretary 
     of Defense, the office of the Secretary of a military 
     department, or the Service headquarters of one of the Armed 
     Forces into a legislative affairs or legislative liaison 
     office.


                         CYBERSPACE ACTIVITIES

       The agreement fully funds the fiscal year 2017 base budget 
     requirement of $6,734,000,000 for the Army, Navy, Marine 
     Corps, Air Force, and the defense agencies cyberspace 
     activities, an increase of $992,000,000 over the fiscal year 
     2016 enacted level.
       While the Service and defense-wide budget justification 
     material, as well as the Department of Defense classified 
     cyberspace activities information technology investments 
     budget justification materials, provide some level of detail, 
     much of the funding is encompassed within larger programs and 
     funding lines, which limits visibility and congressional 
     oversight of requested funding for cyberspace activities 
     specifically.
       Beginning in fiscal year 2018, the Department of Defense 
     Chief Information Officer is directed to modify the 
     cyberspace activities exhibit in order to provide increased 
     visibility and clarity into the cyberspace activities funding 
     requirements and changes to funding requirements from the 
     previous fiscal year enacted levels, to segregate civilian 
     and military pay, and to provide a crosswalk between the 
     cyberspace activities justification books and the Services 
     and defense-wide budget justification material.
       Further, in order to provide additional clarity and to 
     enhance oversight, the Department of Defense Chief 
     Information Officer, in coordination with the Under Secretary 
     of Defense (Comptroller) and the Service Secretaries, is 
     directed to conduct a review of the budget justification 
     material and provide a proposal to the House and Senate 
     Appropriations Committees not later than September 1, 2017, 
     for how to clearly delineate the Department of Defense cyber 
     investment activities requested in the operation and 
     maintenance, procurement, and research, development, test and 
     evaluation accounts as part of the budget justification 
     material beginning with the fiscal year 2019 budget 
     submission. The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and 
     the Chief Information Officer are encouraged to consider 
     establishing a unique cyber sub-activity group for operation 
     and maintenance accounts and individual cost codes, projects, 
     or program elements for procurement and research, 
     development, test and evaluation accounts as part of this 
     review.
       The Department of Defense cyberspace activities table 
     provided shows the amount of funding provided to each Service 
     and defense-wide account in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. 
     Funding appropriated therein may be used only for cyberspace 
     activities as defined by the classified cyberspace activities 
     information technology investment budget request for fiscal 
     year 2017. The Secretary of Defense is directed to use normal 
     prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funding 
     out of any operation and maintenance, procurement, or 
     research, development, test and evaluation accounts as 
     identified in the table titled ``Department of Defense 
     Cyberspace Activities'' for any purpose other than cyberspace 
     activities. The Department of Defense Chief Information 
     Officer shall submit to the House and Senate Appropriations 
     Committees two reports not later than May 30, 2017, and 
     November 30, 2017, which provide the mid-year and end of 
     fiscal year financial obligation and execution data for 
     cyberspace activities of each year.

                  QUARTERLY CYBER OPERATIONS BRIEFING

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide quarterly 
     briefings to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees 
     on all offensive and significant defensive military 
     operations in cyberspace carried out by the Department of 
     Defense not later than 30 days after the end of each fiscal 
     quarter.

                      TITLE I--MILITARY PERSONNEL

                      military personnel overview

       The agreement provides the resources required for an 
     additional 24,000 active forces and 12,000 selected reserve 
     forces, as authorized by current law and above the requested 
     end strength levels, in order to meet operational needs for 
     fiscal year 2017. The agreement also provides the funding 
     necessary to support a 2.1 percent pay raise for all military 
     personnel, as authorized, effective January 1, 2017.


         reprogramming guidance for military personnel accounts

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit the Base for 
     Reprogramming (DD Form 1414) for each of the fiscal year 2017 
     appropriations accounts not later than 60 days after the 
     enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited 
     from executing any reprogramming or transfer of funds for any 
     purpose other than originally appropriated until the 
     aforementioned report is submitted to the House and Senate 
     Appropriations Committees.
       The Secretary of Defense is directed to use the normal 
     prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funds in 
     the Services' military personnel accounts between budget 
     activities in excess of $10,000,000.


               military personnel special interest items

       Items for which additional funds have been provided or have 
     been specifically reduced as shown in the project level 
     tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ``only for'' or 
     ``only to'' in the explanatory statement are congressional 
     special interest items for the purpose of the Base for 
     Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be 
     carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as 
     specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. Below 
     Threshold Reprogrammings may not be used to either restore or 
     reduce funding from congressional special interest items as 
     identified on the DD Form 1414.


                             military bands

       Military bands honor and celebrate warfighters, promote 
     patriotism during community events, inspire servicemembers, 
     and enhance efforts to recruit and retain troops. Band 
     engagements play an important support role for national 
     security and joint operations, opening diplomatic doors for 
     political and military discussions while building trust and 
     confidence with foreign military and civilian authorities. 
     However, the activities of military bands must not detract 
     from the core competencies of the military. The Secretary of 
     Defense should review opportunities to ensure that only the 
     critical functions of military bands are supported while 
     minimizing impacts on funding for essential readiness, 
     military personnel, modernization, and research and 
     development activities.

     REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE ACCOUNTS

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit the Base for 
     Reprogramming (DD Form 1414) for each of the fiscal year 2017 
     appropriation accounts not later than 60 days after the 
     enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited 
     from executing any reprogramming or transfer of funds for any 
     purpose other than originally appropriated until the 
     aforementioned report is submitted to the House and Senate 
     Appropriations Committees.
       The Secretary of Defense is directed to use the normal 
     prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funds in 
     the Services' operation and maintenance accounts between O-1 
     budget activities in excess of $15,000,000. In addition, the 
     Secretary of Defense should follow prior approval 
     reprogramming procedures for transfers in excess of 
     $15,000,000 out of the following budget sub-activities:
       Army:
       Maneuver units
       Modular support brigades
       Land forces operations support
       Force readiness operations support
       Land forces depot maintenance
       Base operations support
       Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization
       Navy:
       Mission and other flight operations
       Aircraft depot maintenance
       Mission and other ship operations
       Ship depot maintenance
       Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization

       Operating forces depot maintenance
       Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization
       Mobilization depot maintenance
       Training and recruiting depot maintenance
       Administration and service-wide depot maintenance
       Air Force Reserve:
       Depot maintenance
       Air National Guard:
       Depot maintenance
       Additionally, the Secretary of Defense should follow prior 
     approval reprogramming procedures for transfers in excess of 
     $15,000,000 into the following budget sub-activity:
       Operation and Maintenance, Army National Guard:
       Other personnel support/recruiting and advertising
       With respect to Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide, 
     proposed transfers of funds to or from the levels specified 
     for defense agencies in excess of $15,000,000 shall be 
     subject to prior approval reprogramming procedures.


            OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS

       Items for which additional funds have been provided or have 
     been specifically reduced as shown in the project level 
     tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ``only for'' or 
     ``only to'' in the explanatory statement are congressional 
     special interest items for the purpose of the Base for 
     Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be 
     carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as 
     specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. Below 
     Threshold Reprogrammings may not be used to either restore or 
     reduce funding from congressional special interest items as 
     identified on the DD Form 1414.


                               READINESS

       The agreement provides additional readiness funds for the 
     Services within the operation and maintenance accounts. This 
     funding shall be used only to improve military readiness, 
     including increased training, depot maintenance, and base 
     operations support. None of the funding provided may be used 
     for recruiting, marketing, or advertising programs. The 
     funding provided is a congressional special interest item. 
     The Secretary of Defense and the Service Secretaries are 
     directed to submit a detailed spending plan by sub-activity 
     group to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees not 
     less than 30 days prior to the obligation of these funds. 
     These transfers may be implemented 30 days after 
     congressional notification unless an objection is received 
     from either the House or Senate Appropriations Committees.


                  ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT

       The agreement does not include a provision included in the 
     House-passed version of H.R. 5293 that referenced the Energy 
     Independence and Security Act of 2007. It is noted that the 
     enforcement of section 526 of the Energy Independence and 
     Security Act of 2007 may lead to higher fuel costs for 
     federal fleets in the absence of competitively priced new 
     generation fuels that emit fewer emissions. In carrying out 
     this statute, the Secretary of Defense and the Service 
     Secretaries should work to ensure that costs associated with 
     fuel purchases necessary to carry out their respective 
     missions should be minimized to the greatest extent possible.


                           CIVILIAN PAY RAISE

       Although the agreement does not include additional funds 
     specifically for the civilian pay increase from 1.6 percent 
     to 2.1 percent, sufficient funding is available within the 
     appropriations accounts to fully fund the increase due to 
     assets created by the civilian hiring freeze and the extended 
     length of H.R. 2028, theFurther Continuing and Security 
     Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017.


                       AQUEOUS FILM FORMING FOAM

       The use of the fire-extinguishing agent Aqueous Film 
     Forming Foam (AFFF) by the Department of Defense has been 
     linked to elevated levels of perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) 
     on military bases and in neighboring communities. According 
     to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the 
     National Institutes of Health, PFCs have adverse impacts on 
     human health. The Navy and Air Force have begun remediation 
     of PFC contamination. The Secretary of Defense is encouraged 
     to require all Services to establish procedures for prompt 
     and cost-effective remediation. In addition, the Secretary of 
     Defense is directed to submit a report to the congressional 
     defense committees not later than 120 days after the 
     enactment of this Act that assesses the number of formerly 
     used and current military installations where AFFF was or is 
     currently used and the impact of PFC contaminated drinking 
     water on surrounding communities. The report should also 
     include plans for prompt community notification of such 
     contamination, when the contamination was detected, and the 
     procedures for timely remediation.

                     READINESS COST ASSESSMENT TOOL

       The recently published Naval Aviation Vision 2016-2025 
     offered strong support for the Readiness Cost Assessment 
     Tool, which is the first phase of the Proficiency 
     Optimization initiative. In lieu of the reporting requirement 
     in House Report 114-577, the Secretary of the Navy is 
     directed to submit a report to the congressional defense 
     committees not later than 60 days after the enactment of this 
     Act that describes the Naval Aviation Enterprise Proficiency 
     Optimization initiative, the current funding profile, and the 
     potential to accelerate or streamline the program strategy.

 NATIONAL GUARD STATE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM LANGUAGE ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM

       For more than twenty years, the National Guard State 
     Partnership Program (SPP) has been successfully building 
     unique security relationships with more than 75 nations 
     around the globe. To build on the success of this program, 
     the agreement recommends that the Chief of the National Guard 
     Bureau encourage the enhancement of individual language 
     skills and prioritize language school appointments of 
     soldiers and airmen within the program to help further 
     strengthen these international relationships. Additionally, 
     servicemembers of the National Guard that participate in, and 
     are from states with units assigned to state partnership 
     activities should strive to attend language schools, both 
     defense-sponsored and otherwise; obtain computer-assisted 
     language-learning software; and use international visits 
     through the SPP as a means of language skill immersion.

            REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow 
     the reprogramming guidance as specified in the report 
     accompanying the House version of the Department of Defense 
     Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110-
     279). Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming 
     funds shall remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and 
     $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation.
       Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is 
     directed to continue to provide the congressional defense 
     committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports 
     for Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of 
     this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with the 
     guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying 
     the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The 
     Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior 
     approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified 
     dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or 
     research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is 
     less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for 
     reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. 
     Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of 
     a procurement (P-1) or research, development, test and 
     evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the 
     Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval 
     reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In 
     addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval 
     reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest 
     items are established elsewhere in this statement.


                           FUNDING INCREASES

       The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be 
     provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the 
     tables.


                   PROCUREMENT SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS

       Items for which additional funds have been provided as 
     shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the 
     phrase ``only for'' or ``only to'' in the explanatory 
     statement are congressional special interest items for the 
     purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of 
     these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated 
     amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory 
     statement.


       JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER BUDGET JUSTIFICATIONS AND CONTRACTING

       Throughout the fiscal year 2017 budget review process, the 
     Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Joint Program Office provided 
     insufficient justification and incomplete information in an 
     untimely manner. It is imperative that requested information 
     is received promptly for proper congressional oversight of 
     this major defense acquisition program.
       It is understood that the Secretary of Defense is reviewing 
     potential alternative management structures for the JSF 
     program as directed by the National Defense Authorization Act 
     for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328). This review will 
     provide an opportunity to improve communication between the 
     JSF Program Executive Officer (PEO), the Services, and the 
     congressional defense committees to ensure the program's 
     funding requirements are fully understood, communicated, and 
     justified.
       Additionally, there is concern that the number of F-35s 
     enacted in annual Department of Defense Appropriations Acts 
     are not being placed on contract by the JSF PEO in a timely 
     manner. Four F-35s included in the Department of Defense 
     Appropriations Act, 2015 and 13 F-35s included in the 
     Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2016 were not part 
     of their respective low rate initial production (LRIP) 
     contracts due to the PEO's contracting strategy. 
     Specifically, only four F-35Cs were included on LRIPs 9 and 
     10, rather than the ten F-35Cs enacted in the Department of 
     Defense Appropriations Acts, 2015 and 2016, impeding 
     production efficiencies. The agreement directs the JSF PEO to 
     use a contracting approach that would award all aircraft 
     included in each Department of Defense Appropriations Act on 
     the respective production contract for that fiscal year. The 
     agreement includes funding for 74 F-35 aircraft. The JSF PEO 
     is directed to brief the congressional defense committees not 
     later than 45 days after the enactment of this Act on the 
     contracting strategy for these aircraft.

                 UH-72 LAKOTA LIGHT UTILITY HELICOPTER

       The agreement provides $187,000,000 to procure 28 UH-72 
     Lakota Light Utility Helicopters for the Army in support of 
     ongoing mission requirements at the Army Aviation Center of 
     Excellence at Fort Rucker, the Combat Training Centers, and 
     the Army Test and Evaluation Center. The agreement notes that 
     this investment is consistent with previous appropriations 
     and was included in the Army's unfunded priority list. The 
     Secretary of the Army is encouraged to request funding for 
     UH-72 Lakota Light Utility Helicopters to address ongoing 
     mission requirements in future budget submissions.

                      ddg-51 flight IIa destroyers

       The Navy currently is procuring DDG-51 Flight IIA 
     destroyers under a fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2017 
     multi-year procurement shipbuilding contract awarded in June 
     2013, as authorized by section 8010 of Public Law 113-6. 
     Additionally, the Navy is addressing increasing ballistic and 
     cruise missile threats through the development and 
     acquisition of an Air and Missile Defense Radar, which is 
     planned for integration on the DDG-51 class of ships through 
     an engineering change proposal, resulting in a new Flight III 
     configuration. However, a recent Government Accountability 
     Office report (GAO 16-613) details concerns regarding a lack 
     of sufficient acquisition and limited detail design knowledge 
     to support the Navy's current Flight III procurement 
     strategy. Further concerns remain regarding the full costs of 
     DDG-51 Flight III destroyers. Therefore, the Secretary of the 
     Navy should award and complete the additional DDG-51 ship, 
     fully funded in fiscal years 2016 and 2017, as an additional 
     DDG-51 Flight IIA ship. The Secretary of the Navy is directed 
     to expeditiously award this ship construction contract.


               polar icebreaker recapitalization project

       The Navy and the Coast Guard are collaborating to refine 
     requirements and an acquisition strategy for procurement of 
     an affordable polar icebreaker. This collaboration continues 
     to refine program costs and requirements in an effort to 
     award a detailed design and construction contract for the 
     lead ship in fiscal year 2019. The agreement supports this 
     effort and provides $150,000,000 in advance procurement 
     funding to buy long-lead time material for the program's 
     initial ship. The Coast Guard is encouraged to budget for 
     follow-on efforts.

            REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow 
     the reprogramming guidance as specified in the report 
     accompanying the House version of the Department of Defense 
     Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110-
     279). Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming 
     funds shall remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and 
     $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation.
       Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is 
     directed to continue to provide the congressional defense 
     committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports 
     for Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of 
     this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with the 
     guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying 
     the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The 
     Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior 
     approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified 
     dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or 
     research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is 
     less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for 
     reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. 
     Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of 
     a procurement (P-1) or research, development, test and 
     evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the 
     Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval 
     reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In 
     addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval 
     reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest 
     items are established elsewhere in this statement.


                           FUNDING INCREASES

       The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be 
     provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the 
     tables.


   RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS

       Items for which additional funds have been provided as 
     shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the 
     phrase ``only for'' or ``only to'' in the explanatory 
     statement are congressional special interest items for the 
     purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of 
     these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated 
     amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory 
     statement.


              JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER FOLLOW-ON MODERNIZATION

       The Joint Strike Fighter Program Executive Officer is 
     directed to comply with the reporting requirement included 
     under the heading ``Joint Strike Fighter Follow-on

         REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR THE DEFENSE HEALTH PROGRAM

       Concerns remain regarding the transfer of funds from the 
     In-House Care budget sub-activity to pay for contractor-
     provided medical care. To limit such transfers and improve 
     oversight within the Defense Health Program operation and 
     maintenance account, the agreement includes a provision which 
     caps the funds available for Private Sector Care under the 
     TRICARE program subject to prior approval reprogramming 
     procedures. The provision and accompanying explanatory 
     statement language should not be interpreted as limiting the 
     amount of funds that may be transferred to the In-House Care 
     budget sub-activity from other budget sub-activities within 
     the Defense Health Program. In addition, funding for the In-
     House Care budget sub-activity continues to be designated as 
     a congressional special interest item. Any transfer of funds 
     from the In-House Care budget sub-activity into the Private 
     Sector Care budget sub-activity or any other budget sub-
     activity requires the Secretary of Defense to follow prior 
     approval reprogramming procedures for operation and 
     maintenance funds.
       The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide written 
     notification to the congressional defense committees of 
     cumulative transfers in excess of $10,000,000 out of the 
     Private Sector Care budget sub-activity not later than 
     fifteen days after such a transfer. Furthermore, the 
     Secretary of Defense is directed to provide a report to the 
     congressional defense committees not later than 30 days after 
     the enactment of this Act that delineates transfers of funds 
     in excess of $10,000,000, and the dates any transfers 
     occurred, from the Private Sector Care budget sub-activity to 
     any other budget sub-activity groups for fiscal year 2016.
       The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) is 
     directed to provide quarterly reports to the congressional 
     defense committees on budget execution data for all of the 
     Defense Health Program budget activities and to adequately 
     reflect changes to the budget activities requested by the 
     Services in future budget submissions.


                 PEER-REVIEWED CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM

       The agreement provides $60,000,000 for the peer-reviewed 
     cancer research program to research cancers not addressed in 
     the breast, prostate, ovarian, kidney, and lung cancer 
     research programs.
       The funds provided in the peer-reviewed cancer research 
     program are directed to be used to conduct research in the 
     following areas: bladder cancer, brain cancer, colorectal 
     cancer, immunotherapy, listeria-based regimens for cancer, 
     liver cancer, lymphoma, melanoma and other skin cancers, 
     mesothelioma, neuroblastoma, pancreatic cancer, pediatric 
     brain tumors, stomach cancer, and cancer in children, 
     adolescents, and young adults.
       The reports directed under this heading in House Report 
     114-577 and Senate Report 114-263 are still required.


                 PEER-REVIEWED MEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM

       The agreement provides $300,000,000 for a peer-reviewed 
     medical research program. The Secretary of Defense, in 
     conjunction with the Service Surgeons General, is directed to

                    ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM

       Concerns remain with the progress being made by the 
     Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to fully develop, 
     procure, and deploy an interoperable electronic health record 
     solution. The two systems must be completely and meaningfully 
     interoperable, and the Under Secretary of Defense 
     (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) is encouraged to 
     focus on the overall goal of seamless compatibility between 
     the two Departments' electronic health record systems.
       For the necessary oversight of this important program, the 
     Program Executive Officer (PEO) for the Defense Healthcare 
     Management Systems (DHMS) is directed to provide quarterly 
     reports to the congressional defense committees and the 
     Government Accountability Office on the cost and schedule of 
     the program, to include milestones, knowledge points, and 
     acquisition timelines, as well as quarterly obligation 
     reports. These reports should also include any changes to the 
     deployment timeline, including benchmarks, for full operating 
     capability; any refinements to the cost estimate for full 
     operating capability and the total lifecycle cost of the 
     program; an assurance that the acquisition strategy will 
     comply with the acquisition rules, requirements, guidelines, 
     and systems acquisition management practices of the federal 
     government; the status of the effort to achieve 
     interoperability between the electronic health record systems 
     of the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, including 
     the scope, cost, schedule, mapping to health data standards, 
     and performance benchmarks of the interoperable record; and 
     the progress toward developing, implementing, and fielding 
     the interoperable electronic health record throughout the two 
     Departments' medical facilities.
       The PEO DHMS is directed to continue briefing the House and 
     Senate Appropriations Committees on a quarterly basis, 
     coinciding with the report submission. Given that full 
     deployment of the new electronic health record is not 
     scheduled until fiscal year 2022, the Department of Defense 
     is expected to continue working on interim modifications and 
     enhancements to the current system to improve 
     interoperability in the near-term. Additionally, the PEO DHMS 
     is directed to provide written notification to the House and 
     Senate Appropriations Committees prior to obligating any 
     contract, or combination of contracts, for electronic health 
     record systems in excess of $5,000,000.
       Additionally, the Director of the Interagency Program 
     Office is directed to continue to provide quarterly briefings 
     on standards development, how those standards are being 
     incorporated by the two Departments, and the progress of 
     interoperability to the House and Senate Appropriations 
     Subcommittees for Defense and Military Construction, Veterans 
     Affairs, and Related Agencies. In an effort to ensure 
     government-wide accountability, the PEO DHMS, in coordination 
     with the appropriate personnel of the Department of Veterans 
     Affairs, is directed to provide the Federal Chief Information 
     Officer of the United States with monthly updates on progress 
     made by the two Departments to reach interoperability and 
     modernize their respective electronic health records.

     report incremental costs for all named operations in the

                  joint improvised-threat defeat fund

       The fiscal year 2017 budget request includes $408,272,000 
     in Overseas Contingency Operations funding for the Joint 
     Improvised-Threat Defeat Fund. To preserve the essential 
     joint capabilities of the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat 
     Organization (JIDO) and eliminate any duplication with 
     Service capabilities, the agreement recommends transferring 
     $62,800,000 to the Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide 
     account in title IX.
       The budget request proposed consolidating the sub-accounts 
     under the appropriation into a single account titled Rapid 
     Acquisition and Threat Response. This flexibility would allow 
     for quick reaction changes in spending; however, it would 
     prevent the congressional defense committees from having any 
     insight into why or when these funding changes occur. 
     Therefore, the agreement provides the following funding 
     levels for JIDO programs: $101,286,000 for Rapid Capability 
     Delivery; $200,886,000 for Assist Situational Understanding; 
     and $37,300,000 for Enable Department of Defense 
     Responsiveness. The Director of the JIDO is directed to 
     provide quarterly reports to the congressional defense 
     committees should funding be shifted between the accounts not 
     later than 15 days after the end of the fiscal quarter.

                    OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

       The agreement provides $22,062,000 for the Office of the 
     Inspector General.

       The agreement modifies a provision proposed by the Senate 
     recommending rescissions and provides for the rescission of

     DIVISION D--ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES 
                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017

       The following statement to the House of Representatives and 
     the Senate is submitted in explanation of the agreed upon Act 
     making appropriations for energy and water development for 
     the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other 
     purposes.
       This explanatory statement, while repeating some report 
     language for emphasis, does not intend to negate the language 
     and allocations set forth in House Report 114-532 and Senate 
     Report 114-236 and that direction shall be complied with 
     unless specifically addressed to the contrary in the 
     accompanying bill or explanatory statement. Additionally, 
     where this explanatory statement states that the ``agreement 
     only includes'' or ``the following is the only'' direction, 
     any direction included in the House or Senate report on that 
     matter shall be considered as replaced with the direction 
     provided within this explanatory statement. In cases where 
     the House or the Senate has directed the submission of a 
     report, such report is to be submitted to the Committees on 
     Appropriations of both Houses of Congress. House or Senate 
     reporting requirements with deadlines prior to or within 15 
     days of the enactment of this Act shall be submitted no later 
     than 60 days after the enactment of this Act. All other 
     reporting deadlines not changed by this explanatory statement 
     are to be met.
       Funds for the individual programs and activities within the 
     accounts in this Act are displayed in the detailed table at 
     the end of the explanatory statement for this Act. Funding 
     levels that are not displayed in the detailed table are 
     identified in this explanatory statement.
       In fiscal year 2017, for purposes of the Balanced Budget 
     and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-
     177), the following information provides the definition of 
     the term ``program, project, or activity'' for departments 
     and agencies under the jurisdiction of the Energy and Water 
     Development Appropriations Act. The term ``program, project, 
     or activity'' shall include the most specific level of budget 
     items identified in the Energy and Water Development 
     Appropriations Act, 2017 and the explanatory statement 
     accompanying the Act.
       National Ocean Policy.--No specific funding was provided in 
     fiscal year 2016 and none was requested by any agencies 
     funded in this Act in fiscal year 2017 to implement the 
     National Ocean Policy. Consequently, no specific funds for 
     National Ocean Policy activities are included for any agency 
     funded in this Act.

                   TITLE I--CORPS OF ENGINEERS--CIVIL

                         DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY

                       Corps of Engineers--Civil

       The summary tables included in this title set forth the 
     dispositions with respect to the individual appropriations, 
     projects, and activities of the Corps of Engineers. 
     Additional items of the Act are discussed below.
       Recent statutory changes regarding the Inland Waterways 
     Trust Fund (IWTF) have resulted in an increase to the size of 
     the capital improvement program that can be supported by the 
     IWTF. The agreement reflects congressional interest in 
     supporting this larger program. The Corps is directed to take 
     the preparatory steps necessary to ensure that new 
     construction projects can be initiated as soon as can be 
     supported under the larger capital program (i.e., as ongoing 
     projects approach completion).
       Concerns persist that the effort to update the Water 
     Resources Principles and Guidelines did not proceed 
     consistent with the language or intent of section 2031 of the 
     Water Resources Development Act of 2007. No funds provided to 
     the Corps of Engineers shall be used to develop or implement 
     rules or guidance to support implementation of the final 
     Principles and Requirements for Federal Investments in Water 
     Resources released in March 2013 or the final Interagency 
     Guidelines released in December 2014. The Corps shall 
     continue to use the document dated March 10, 1983, and 
     entitled ``Economic and Environmental Principles and 
     Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources 
     Implementation Studies'' during the fiscal year period 
     covered by the Energy and Water Development Appropriations 
     Act for 2017.
       Asian Carp.--In lieu of House direction on Asian Carp and 
     Senate direction on Aquatic Nuisance Species, the Corps is 
     expected to release the draft Great Lakes and Mississippi 
     River Interbasin Study (GLMRIS) Brandon Road Study consistent 
     with the urgency of its previous actions. The Corps is 
     directed to adhere to a public and agency review process that 
     is open and transparent. Further, the Corps is directed to 
     provide quarterly updates to the Committees on Appropriations 
     of both Houses of Congress on the progress and status of 
     efforts to prevent the further spread of the carp as well as 
     the location and density of Asian Carp populations, including 
     the use of emergency procedures.
       Aquaculture Activities.--The agreement only includes 
     direction on aquaculture activities in the Regulatory 
     account.

                           Additional Funding

       The fiscal year 2017 budget request significantly 
     underfunds the Civil Works program of the Corps of Engineers. 
     The agreement, however, includes funding in addition to the 
     budget request to ensure continued improvements to our 
     national economy, public safety, and environmental health 
     that result from water resources projects. This funding is 
     for additional work that either was not included in the 
     budget request or was inadequately budgeted. The bill 
     contains a provision requiring the Corps to allocate funds in 
     accordance with only the direction in this agreement. In lieu 
     of all House and Senate report direction regarding additional 
     funding and new starts, the Corps shall follow the direction 
     included in this explanatory statement.
       The Corps again is directed to develop rating systems for 
     use in evaluating studies and projects for allocation of the 
     additional funding provided in this title. These evaluation 
     systems may be, but are not required to be, individualized 
     for each account, category, or subcategory. Each study and 
     project eligible for funding shall be evaluated under the 
     applicable ratings system. A study or project may not be 
     excluded from evaluation for being ``inconsistent with 
     Administration policy.'' The Corps retains complete control 
     over the methodology of these ratings systems. The executive 
     branch retains complete discretion over project-specific 
     allocation decisions within the additional funds provided, 
     subject to only the direction here and under the heading 
     ``Additional Funding'' or ``Additional Funding for Ongoing 
     Work'' within each of the Investigations, Construction, 
     Mississippi River and Tributaries, and Operation and 
     Maintenance accounts.
       The Administration is reminded that these funds are in 
     addition to the budget request, and Administration budget 
     metrics shall not be a reason to disqualify a study or 
     project from being funded. It is expected that all of the 
     additional funding provided will be allocated to specific 
     programs, projects, or activities. The focus of the 
     allocation process shall favor the obligation, rather than 
     expenditure, of funds. With the significant backlog of work 
     in the Corps' inventory, there is no reason for funds 
     provided above the budget request to remain unallocated.
       A project or study shall be eligible for additional funding 
     within the Investigations, Construction, and Mississippi 
     River and Tributaries accounts if: (1) it has received 
     funding, other than through a reprogramming, in at least one 
     of the previous three fiscal years; (2) it was previously 
     funded and could reach a significant milestone, complete a 
     discrete element of work, or produce significant outputs in 
     fiscal year 2017; or (3) as appropriate, it is selected as 
     one of the new starts allowed in accordance with this Act and 
     the additional direction provided below. None of the 
     additional funding in any account may be used for any item 
     where funding was specifically denied or for projects in the 
     Continuing Authorities Program. Funds shall be allocated 
     consistent with statutory cost share requirements.
       Funding associated with each category may be allocated to 
     any eligible study or project, as appropriate, within that 
     category; funding associated with each subcategory may be 
     allocated only to eligible studies or projects, as 
     appropriate, within that subcategory. The list of 
     subcategories is not meant to be exhaustive.
       Work Plan.--Not later than 45 days after the enactment of 
     this Act, the Corps shall provide to the Committees on 
     Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a work plan 
     including the following information: (1) a detailed 
     description of the ratings system(s) developed and used to 
     evaluate studies and projects; (2) delineation of how these 
     funds are to be allocated; (3) a summary of the work to be 
     accomplished with each allocation, including phase of work; 
     and (4) a list of all studies and projects that were 
     considered eligible for funding but did not receive funding, 
     including an explanation of whether the study or project 
     could have used funds in fiscal year 2017 and the specific 
     reasons each study or project was considered as being less 
     competitive for an allocation of funds.
       New Starts.--The agreement includes up to six new study 
     starts and six new construction starts to be distributed 
     across the three main mission areas of the Corps. Of the new 
     study starts, one shall be for a navigation study, one shall 
     be for a flood and storm damage reduction study, three shall 
     be for additional navigation or flood and storm damage 
     reduction studies, and one shall be for an environmental 
     restoration study. Of the new construction starts, one shall 
     be for a navigation project, one shall be for a flood and 
     storm damage reduction project, three shall be for additional 
     navigation or flood and storm damage reduction projects, and 
     one shall be for an environmental restoration project. No 
     funding shall be used to initiate new studies, programs, 
     projects, or activities in the Mississippi River and 
     Tributaries or Operation and Maintenance accounts.
       The Corps is directed to propose a single group of new 
     starts as a part of the work plan. The Corps may not change 
     or substitute the new starts selected once the work plan has 
     been provided to the Committees on Appropriations of both 
     Houses of Congress. Each new start shall be funded from the 
     appropriate additional funding line item. Any project for 
     which the new start requirements are not met by the end of 
     fiscal year 2017 shall be treated as if the project had not 
     been selected as a new start; such a project shall be 
     required to compete again for new start funding in future 
     years. Consideration of studies and projects for selection as 
     new starts shall not be limited to only those proposed in the 
     fiscal year 2017 budget request. As all new starts are to be 
     chosen by the Corps, all shall be considered of equal 
     importance, and the expectation is that future

[[Page H3705]]

     budget submissions will include appropriate funding for all 
     new starts selected.
       There continues to be confusion regarding the executive 
     branch's policies and guidelines regarding which studies and 
     projects require new start designations. Therefore, the Corps 
     is directed to notify the Committees on Appropriations of 
     both Houses of Congress at least 7 days prior to execution of 
     an agreement for construction of any project except 
     environmental infrastructure projects and projects under the 
     Continuing Authorities Program. Additionally, the agreement 
     reiterates and clarifies previous congressional direction as 
     follows. Neither study nor construction activities related to 
     individual projects authorized under section 1037 of the 
     Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) of 2014 
     shall require a new start or new investment decision; these 
     activities shall be considered ongoing work. No new start or 
     new investment decision shall be required when moving from 
     feasibility to preconstruction engineering and design (PED). 
     A new start designation shall be required to initiate 
     construction of individually-authorized projects funded 
     within programmatic line items. No new start or new 
     investment decision shall be required to initiate work on a 
     separable element of a project when construction of one or 
     more separable elements of that project was initiated 
     previously; it shall be considered ongoing work. A new 
     construction start shall not be required for work undertaken 
     to correct a design deficiency on an existing federal 
     project; it shall be considered ongoing work.
       In addition to the priority factors used to allocate all 
     additional funding provided in the Investigations account, 
     the Corps should give careful consideration to the out-year 
     budget impacts of the studies selected and to whether there 
     appears to be an identifiable local sponsor that will be 
     ready and able to provide, in a timely manner, the necessary 
     cost share for the feasibility and PED phases. The Corps is 
     reminded that the flood and storm damage reduction mission 
     area can include instances where non-federal sponsors are 
     seeking assistance with flood control and unauthorized 
     discharges from permitted wastewater treatment facilities.
       In addition to the priority factors used to allocate all 
     additional funding provided in the Construction account, the 
     Corps also shall consider the out-year budget impacts of the 
     selected new starts; legal requirements, including 
     responsibilities to Tribes; and the cost sharing sponsor's 
     ability and willingness to promptly provide the cash 
     contribution (if any), as well as required lands, easements, 
     rights-of-way, relocations, and disposal areas. When 
     considering new construction starts, only those that can 
     execute a project cost sharing agreement not later than 
     September 30, 2017, shall be chosen.
       To ensure that the new construction starts are affordable 
     and will not unduly delay completion of any ongoing projects, 
     the Secretary is required to submit to the Committees on 
     Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a realistic out-
     year budget scenario prior to issuing a work allowance for a 
     new start. It is understood that specific budget decisions 
     are made on an annual basis and that this scenario is neither 
     a request for nor a guarantee of future funding for any 
     project. Nonetheless, this scenario shall include an estimate 
     of annual funding for each new start utilizing a realistic 
     funding scenario through completion of the project, as well 
     as the specific impacts of that estimated funding on the 
     ability of the Corps to make continued progress on each 
     previously funded construction project (including impacts to 
     the optimum timeline and funding requirements of the ongoing 
     projects) and on the ability to consider initiating new 
     projects in the future. The scenario shall assume a 
     Construction account funding level at the average of the past 
     three budget requests.

                             Investigations

       The agreement includes $121,000,000 for Investigations. The 
     agreement includes legislative language regarding parameters 
     for new study starts.
       The allocation for projects and activities within the 
     Investigations account is shown in the following table:

       Updated Capability.--The agreement adjusts some project-
     specific allocations downward from the budget request based 
     on updated information regarding the amount of work that 
     could be accomplished in fiscal year 2017.
       Additional Funding.--The Corps is expected to allocate the 
     additional funding provided in this account primarily to 
     specific feasibility and PED phases, rather than to Remaining 
     Items line items as has been the case in past work plans. The 
     activities funded under Remaining Items address core agency 
     competencies, which means the budget request should reflect 
     sufficient funding. When allocating the additional funding 
     provided in this account, the Corps shall consider giving 
     priority to completing or accelerating ongoing studies or to 
     initiating new studies that will enhance the nation's 
     economic development, job growth, and international 
     competitiveness; are for projects located in areas that have 
     suffered recent natural disasters; or are for projects to 
     address legal requirements. While the additional funding is 
     shown in the feasibility column, the Corps shall use these 
     funds for additional work in both the feasibility and PED 
     phases. The agreement includes sufficient additional funding 
     to undertake a significant amount of feasibility and PED 
     work. The Administration is reminded that a project study is 
     not complete until the PED phase is complete.
       Hydraulic Modeling.--The agreement does not include 
     direction included in the Senate report.
       Water Resources Priorities Study.--No funding shall be used 
     for this study.
       Research and Development, Additional Topic--Urban Flood 
     Damage Reduction and Stream Restoration in Arid Regions.--The 
     agreement supports but includes no specific level of funding 
     for activities included in the Senate report.
       Disposition of Completed Projects.--The agreement includes 
     funding only for reviews included in the budget request.
       National Flood Risk Management Program.--The agreement does 
     not include direction included in the House report.
       Flood Control and Wastewater Treatment Facilities.--The 
     agreement includes direction included in the House report 
     with the further direction that the list be developed using 
     readily available information.
       Puget Sound.--The Corps is encouraged to proceed with the 
     tiered implementation strategy using all existing authorities 
     as outlined in the Puget Sound Nearshore Ecosystem 
     Restoration Project Feasibility Study, Completion Strategy 
     Guidance dated June 2015. The Corps is directed to recognize 
     the Puget Sound Nearshore Study as the feasibility component 
     for the purposes of section 544 of the Water Resources 
     Development Act of 2000.
       Missouri River Projects.--None of the funds made available 
     by this Act may be used for the study of the Missouri River 
     Projects authorized in section 108 of the Energy and Water 
     Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2009 
     (Public Law 111-8).
       Coastal Resiliency Projects.--The agreement only includes 
     language in the Construction account under the heading 
     ``Continuing Authorities Program''.


                              Construction

       The agreement includes $1,876,000,000 for Construction. The 
     agreement includes legislative language regarding parameters 
     for new construction starts.
       The allocation for projects and activities within the 
     Construction account is shown in the following table:

       Updated Capability.--The agreement adjusts some project-
     specific allocations downward from the budget request based 
     on updated information regarding the amount of work that 
     could be accomplished in fiscal year 2017.
       Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal Dispersal Barrier, 
     Illinois.--The budget request includes funding for this 
     project in the Operation and Maintenance account. During the 
     period of the continuing resolution, however, the Corps 
     informed the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of 
     Congress that the budget request is required in the 
     Construction account. The agreement accommodates this shift 
     in funding.
       Additional Funding.--The agreement includes additional 
     funds for projects and activities to enhance the nation's 
     economic growth and international competitiveness. Of the 
     additional funds provided in this account, the Corps shall 
     allocate not less than $12,450,000 to projects with 
     riverfront development components. Of the additional funding 
     provided in this account for flood and storm damage reduction 
     and flood control, the Corps shall allocate not less than 
     $14,000,000 to additional nonstructural flood control 
     projects. Of the additional funds provided in this account 
     for flood and storm damage reduction, navigation, and other 
     authorized project purposes, the Corps shall allocate not 
     less than $10,000,000 to authorized reimbursements for 
     projects with executed project cooperation agreements and 
     that have completed construction or where non-federal 
     sponsors intend to use the funds for additional water 
     resources development activities. Of the additional funding 
     provided in this account for flood and storm damage reduction 
     and flood control, the Corps shall allocate not less than 
     $10,500,000 to continue construction of projects that 
     principally include improvements to rainfall drainage systems 
     that address flood damages.
       When allocating the additional funding provided in this 
     account, the Corps is encouraged to evaluate authorized 
     reimbursements in the same manner as if the projects were 
     being evaluated for new or ongoing construction and shall 
     consider giving priority to the following:
       1. benefits of the funded work to the national economy;
       2. extent to which the work will enhance national, 
     regional, or local economic development;
       3. number of jobs created directly by the funded activity;
       4. ability to obligate the funds allocated within the 
     calendar year, including consideration of the ability of the 
     non-federal sponsor to provide any required cost share;
       5. ability to complete the project, separable element, or 
     project phase with the funds allocated;
       6. for flood and storm damage reduction projects (including 
     authorized nonstructural measures and periodic beach 
     renourishments),
       a. population, economic activity, or public infrastructure 
     at risk, as appropriate; and
       b. the severity of risk of flooding or the frequency with 
     which an area has experienced flooding;
       7. for shore protection projects, projects in areas that 
     have suffered severe beach erosion requiring additional sand 
     placement outside of the normal beach renourishment cycle or 
     in which the normal beach renourishment cycle has been 
     delayed;
       8. for navigation projects, the number of jobs or level of 
     economic activity to be supported by completion of the 
     project, separable element, or project phase;
       9. for projects cost shared with the Inland Waterways Trust 
     Fund (IWTF), the economic impact on the local, regional, and 
     national economy if the project is not funded, as well as 
     discrete elements of work that can be completed within the 
     funding provided in this line item;
       10. for other authorized project purposes and environmental 
     restoration or compliance projects, to include the beneficial 
     use of dredged material; and
       11. for environmental infrastructure, projects with the 
     greater economic impact, projects in rural communities, 
     projects in communities with significant shoreline and 
     instances of runoff, projects in or that benefit counties or 
     parishes with high poverty rates, and projects in financially 
     distressed municipalities.
       The agreement provides funds making use of all estimated 
     annual revenues in the IWTF. The Corps shall allocate all 
     funds provided in the IWTF Revenues line item along with the 
     statutory cost share from funds provided in the Navigation 
     line item prior to allocating the remainder of funds in the 
     Navigation line item. The Corps has indicated that several 
     construction contract options are set to expire in the very 
     near future. If the decision is made by the Administration to 
     fund any of those projects in the work plan, but the funding 
     is not made available in time to exercise the existing 
     options, costs could escalate unnecessarily. Therefore, 
     notwithstanding the work plan deadline established in the 
     title I front matter, the Corps shall allocate the additional 
     funding provided for construction of IWTF projects, and 
     notify the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of 
     Congress of such allocations, not later than 10 days after 
     the enactment of this Act.
       Aquatic Plant Control Program.--Of the funding provided for 
     the Aquatic Plant Control Program, $4,000,000 shall be for 
     nationwide research and development to address invasive 
     aquatic plants; within this funding, the Corps is encouraged 
     to support cost shared aquatic plant management programs. Of 
     the funding provided for the Aquatic Plant Control Program, 
     $5,000,000 shall be for watercraft inspection stations, as 
     authorized by section 1039 of the Water Resources Reform and 
     Development Act of 2014, and related monitoring.
       Continuing Authorities Program (CAP).--The agreement 
     continues to support all sections of the Continuing 
     Authorities Program. Funding is provided for eight CAP 
     sections at a total of $34,500,000, an increase of 
     $31,000,000 above the budget request, which proposed funding 
     for only four sections. This program provides a useful tool 
     for the Corps to undertake small localized projects without 
     the lengthy study and authorization process typical of larger 
     Corps projects. Within the Continuing Authorities Program and 
     to the extent already authorized by law, the Corps is 
     encouraged to consider projects that enhance coastal and 
     ocean ecosystem resiliency. The management of the Continuing 
     Authorities Program should continue consistent with direction 
     provided in previous fiscal years.
       Public-Private Partnerships.--The agreement only includes 
     direction in the Expenses account.
       Reimbursements.--The agreement only includes direction 
     under the heading ``Additional Funding'' in this account.
       Environmental Infrastructure.--The agreement does not 
     include direction included in the Senate report.
       Efficiency Review.--The agreement only includes direction 
     in the Expenses account.


                   MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND TRIBUTARIES

       The agreement includes $362,000,000 for Mississippi River 
     and Tributaries.
       The allocation for projects and activities within the 
     Mississippi River and Tributaries account is shown in the 
     following table:

       Additional Funding for Ongoing Work.--When allocating the 
     additional funding provided in this account, the Corps shall 
     consider giving priority to completing or accelerating 
     ongoing work that will enhance the nation's economic 
     development, job growth, and international competitiveness, 
     or are for studies or projects located in areas that have 
     suffered recent natural disasters. While this funding is 
     shown under remaining items, the Corps shall use these funds 
     in investigations, construction, and operation and 
     maintenance, as applicable. Of the additional funds provided 
     in this account for flood control, the Corps shall allocate 
     not less than $24,300,000 for additional flood control 
     construction projects. Of the additional funds provided in 
     this account for other authorized project purposes, the Corps 
     shall allocate not less than $2,378,000 for operation and 
     maintenance of facilities that are educational or to continue 
     land management of mitigation features.
       Mississippi River Commission.--No funding is provided for 
     this new line item. The Corps is directed to continue funding 
     the costs of the commission from within the funds provided 
     for activities within the Mississippi River and Tributaries 
     project.


                       OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE

       The agreement includes $3,149,000,000 for Operation and 
     Maintenance.
       The allocation for projects and activities within the 
     Operation and Maintenance account is shown in the following 
     table:

       Updated Capability.--The agreement adjusts some project-
     specific allocations downward from the budget request based 
     on updated information regarding the amount of work that 
     could be accomplished in fiscal year 2017.
       Additional Funding for Ongoing Work.--When allocating the 
     additional funding provided in this account, the Corps shall 
     consider giving priority to the following:
       1. ability to complete ongoing work maintaining authorized 
     depths and widths of harbors and shipping channels, including 
     where contaminated sediments are present;
       2. ability to address critical maintenance backlog;
       3. presence of the U.S. Coast Guard;
       4. extent to which the work will enhance national, 
     regional, or local economic development, including domestic 
     manufacturing capacity;
       5. extent to which the work will promote job growth or 
     international competitiveness;
       6. number of jobs created directly by the funded activity;
       7. ability to obligate the funds allocated within the 
     calendar year;
       8. ability to complete the project, separable element, 
     project phase, or useful increment of work within the funds 
     allocated;
       9. risk of imminent failure or closure of the facility;
       10. for harbor maintenance activities,
       a. total tonnage handled;
       b. total exports;
       c. total imports;
       d. dollar value of cargo handled;
       e. energy infrastructure and national security needs 
     served;
       f. designation as strategic seaports;
       g. lack of alternative means of freight movement; and
       h. savings over alternative means of freight movement; and
       11. for other authorized project purposes, authorized 
     activities related to flood and drought monitoring.
       The additional funding provided in this account for donor 
     and energy transfer ports shall be allocated in accordance 
     with 33 U.S.C. 2238c.
       Facility Protection.--The agreement includes direction 
     included in the House report.
       Monitoring of Completed Navigation Projects.--Of the 
     funding provided, $3,700,000 shall be for continued 
     development and field-testing of platforms to enable 
     scalable, cost effective structural health monitoring of 
     critical civil infrastructure and not less than $2,000,000 
     shall be for research described in the Senate report under 
     the heading ``Operations and Maintenance--Fisheries.''
       Water Operations Technical Support.--Funding in addition to 
     the budget request is included for research into atmospheric 
     rivers first funded in fiscal year 2015.
       Great Lakes Navigation System.--The agreement includes 
     funding for individual projects within this System that 
     exceeds the funding level envisioned in section 
     210(d)(1)(B)(ii) of the Water Resources Development Act of 
     1986.


                           REGULATORY PROGRAM

       The agreement includes $200,000,000 for the Regulatory 
     Program.
       Aquaculture Activities.--Since 2007, shellfish growers in 
     the State of Washington have submitted approximately 1,000 
     requests to initiate or expand aquaculture activities. 
     Significant progress has been made in the last year to 
     process permit requests. The Corps of Engineers completed 
     Endangered Species Act consultations with the National Marine 
     Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 
     September 2016. The Corps is directed to expeditiously 
     process the shellfish growers' requests using the final 
     Biological Opinions and in accordance with the recently 
     completed 2017 Nationwide Permit 48. The Corps is encouraged 
     to communicate directly with the regulated industry and other 
     interested stakeholders to ensure all have clarity on 
     permitting requirements.
       Army Corps of Engineers and Underserved Communities.--The 
     Corps is encouraged to take steps to expedite and support 
     economic development projects in underserved urban 
     communities, particularly economically disadvantaged 
     communities with populations of less than 100,000 residents. 
     These communities often are overlooked unintentionally and 
     face complex challenges that impede economic development due 
     to years of neglect, an abundance of abandoned industrial 
     areas, or a lack of consistent local funding sources.


            FORMERLY UTILIZED SITES REMEDIAL ACTION PROGRAM

       The agreement includes $112,000,000 for the Formerly 
     Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program.


                 FLOOD CONTROL AND COASTAL EMERGENCIES

       The agreement includes $32,000,000 for Flood Control and 
     Coastal Emergencies.


                                EXPENSES

       The agreement includes $181,000,000 for Expenses. The 
     agreement includes $1,000,000 for the Corps to initiate the 
     evaluation of project partnership agreements authorized under 
     section 1013 of the Water Resources Reform and Development 
     Act of 2014.
       Public-Private Partnership Program.--As discussed in fiscal 
     year 2016, there is strong support among many Members of the 
     Congress and within the senior leadership of the Corps for 
     public-private partnerships (P3). These arrangements have the 
     potential to be project delivery tools to help sustain the 
     performance of existing infrastructure and construct new 
     infrastructure more quickly. Unfortunately, actions to date 
     will serve to undermine, rather than promote, the use of P3s. 
     For instance, the executive branch selected a P3 project as 
     one of its fiscal year 2016 new starts, yet did not include 
     funding for this project in its fiscal year 2017 budget 
     request, claiming the project did not meet budget criteria. 
     Without a clear signal from the federal government that it 
     will honor its commitments under a P3 arrangement, it is 
     unlikely that communities or private investors will put their 
     resources at risk with a P3 arrangement.
       More broadly, concerns persist that the Corps is attempting 
     to develop individual, project-specific P3 arrangements, 
     rather than developing the policy by which such arrangements, 
     developed by project stakeholders and private investors, will 
     be evaluated. This program will generate stronger interest 
     and allow all interested non-federal sponsors equal 
     opportunity to develop P3 proposals for the Corps to review 
     under established guidelines. An established policy would 
     also ensure that selected projects will meet budget criteria.
       It was for these reasons that the Congress, in fiscal year 
     2016, directed the Corps to develop a policy on how P3 
     proposals will be considered by the Corps and how these 
     partnerships will be incorporated into the budget policy. 
     There has been no indication that the Corps has done any work 
     to comply with this direction. Therefore, due to the concerns 
     detailed above and until such time as a comprehensive policy 
     is established and provided to the Committees on 
     Appropriations of both Houses of Congress, the Corps shall 
     discontinue all work on project-specific public-private 
     partnerships beyond the P3 project selected as a new start in 
     fiscal year 2016.


     OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE ARMY FOR CIVIL WORKS

       The agreement includes $4,764,000 for the Office of the 
     Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. The 
     agreement includes legislative language that restricts the 
     availability of funding until the Secretary submits a work 
     plan that allocates at least 95 percent of the additional 
     funding provided in each account (i.e., 95 percent of 
     additional funding provided in Investigations, 95 percent of 
     additional funding provided in Construction, etc.). This 
     restriction shall not affect the roles and responsibilities 
     established in previous fiscal years of the Office of the 
     Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, the Corps 
     headquarters, the Corps field operating agencies, or any 
     other executive branch agency.
       The Congress counts on a timely and accessible executive 
     branch in the course of fulfilling its constitutional role in 
     the appropriations process. The requesting and receiving of 
     basic, factual information is vital in order to maintain a 
     transparent and open governing process. Some discussions 
     internal to the executive branch are pre-decisional in nature 
     and, therefore, not subject to disclosure. However, the 
     access to facts, figures, and statistics that inform these

  DIVISION F--DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017

       The following is an explanation of Division F, which makes 
     appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 
     for fiscal year 2017. Funding provided in this Act not only 
     sustains existing programs that protect the nation from all 
     manner of threats, it ensures DHS's ability to improve 
     preparedness at the federal, state, and local levels, to 
     prevent and respond to terrorist attacks, and to hire, train, 
     and equip DHS frontline forces protecting the homeland.
       Unless otherwise noted, references to the House and Senate 
     reports are to House Report 114-668 and Senate Report 114-
     264, respectively. The language and allocations contained in 
     the House and Senate reports carry the same weight as 
     language included in this explanatory statement unless 
     specifically addressed to the contrary in the bill or this 
     explanatory statement. While this explanatory statement 
     repeats some language from the House or Senate reports for 
     emphasis, it does not negate the language contained in those 
     reports unless expressly stated. When this explanatory 
     statement refers to the Committees or the Committees on 
     Appropriations, these references are to the House 
     Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security and the 
     Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security.
       This explanatory statement refers to certain laws and 
     organizations as follows: the Implementing Recommendations of 
     the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, Public Law 110-53, is 
     referenced as the 9/11 Act; the Robert T. Stafford Disaster 
     Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, Public Law 93-288, is 
     referenced as the Stafford Act; the Department of Homeland 
     Security is referenced as DHS or the Department; the 
     Government Accountability Office is referenced as GAO; and 
     the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Homeland 
     Security is referenced as OIG. In addition, ``full-time 
     equivalents'' are referred to as FTE; ``full-time positions'' 
     are referred to as FTP; ``Information Technology'' is 
     referred to as IT; the DHS ``Working Capital Fund'' is 
     referred to as WCF; ``program, project, and activity'' is 
     referred to as PPA; and any reference to ``the Secretary'' 
     should be interpreted to mean the Secretary of the Department 
     of Homeland Security.
       On March 16, 2017, the President delivered a budget 
     amendment to the Congress that requested an additional 
     $3,000,000,000 for DHS to strengthen border security and 
     enhance enforcement of immigration laws. Appropriations 
     related to that request are included in title VI of this 
     division.


            Changes to the Structure of the Bill and Report

       Since DHS was established in 2002, the 22 agencies that 
     were consolidated into a single department have formulated 
     and executed their respective budgets using their legacy 
     appropriation account structures and budgeting practices. 
     Within months of being confirmed, then-Secretary Jeh Johnson 
     announced a Unity of Effort campaign with the goal of 
     maturing DHS into an organization that functions in a more 
     integrated and joint fashion. A strategic imperative of that 
     campaign was to develop and institutionalize standard 
     planning, budgeting, acquisition, and resourcing processes 
     that every component would be required to follow.
       The Department's more than 70 disparate accounts were 
     contributing to a lack of transparency and comparability 
     among components and programs, and were adding unnecessary 
     complexity to spending prioritization. To address these 
     issues, the Department recommended that the existing account 
     structure be simplified into four common account categories 
     under which programs and activities could be funded 
     consistently across departmental components based on common 
     assumptions and definitions. The categories are: Operations 
     and Support; Procurement, Construction, and Improvements; 
     Research and Development; and Federal Assistance. In fiscal 
     year 2016, Congress supported the concept of common 
     appropriations accounts for every component and authorized 
     DHS to propose the fiscal year 2017 DHS budget in a structure 
     that incorporated these four account types.
       In accordance with this authority, DHS proposed the fiscal 
     year 2017 budget request in a common format for every 
     organization except the Coast Guard, which requires 
     additional time to coordinate the change as it also 
     transitions to a new financial management system. The 
     appropriations account and PPA structure reflected in this 
     Act is the culmination of that two year effort.
       In addition to incorporating the new standard structure, 
     the fiscal year 2017 Department of Homeland Security 
     Appropriations bill has been re-written, updated, and 
     streamlined. The bill continues to be divided into titles, 
     the first four of which contain appropriations. Each 
     appropriations paragraph begins with a lump sum 
     appropriation, followed by any necessary carve-outs of 
     amounts for specific activities or for multi-year 
     availability, and concludes with spending limitations, when 
     needed. Administrative provisions specific to a single 
     component are included at the end of its respective title, 
     while general provisions that pertain to multiple components 
     are located in title V. This explanatory statement is 
     organized in the same manner.
       Every appropriating paragraph has been scrutinized and 
     drafted to follow the Comptroller General's Federal 
     Principles of Appropriations Law and adheres to a core 
     principal that the purpose of a lump sum appropriation is 
     determined in the context of the agency's enabling and 
     authorizing legislation. As such, appropriations paragraphs 
     do not enumerate every statute that authorizes DHS to act, in 
     order for funding to be available for those purposes.
       Likewise, the appropriating paragraphs do not need, nor is 
     it possible, to explicitly enumerate every item or activity 
     for which the appropriation is available. Accordingly, 
     previously enumerated activities that are considered to be 
     part of a component's necessary expenses are no longer 
     expressly included. Further, the format of the bill has been 
     restructured to move those provisions not organic to the 
     appropriation of funds into administrative or general 
     provisions. Certain language from prior Acts that directed 
     policies or practices was eliminated if its appearance in 
     statute is no longer required, although directives related to 
     such policies or practices are in some cases continued 
     through language in this statement or in the House or Senate 
     reports.
       DHS provided assistance in identifying instances where 
     specificity in appropriations paragraphs was required for 
     funds to be used for certain purposes. As presented, the bill 
     reflects that careful consideration. With regard to expired 
     authorizations, the bill provides explicit extensions where 
     so intended.


   Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives Office

       The fiscal year 2017 budget request proposed the 
     consolidation of the Office of Health Affairs, the Domestic 
     Nuclear Detection Office, the Office of Bombing Prevention, 
     and selected activities of the Science and Technology 
     Directorate, into a new Chemical, Biological, Radiological, 
     Nuclear, and Explosives (CBRNE) Office. As this proposed 
     CBRNE consolidation was not authorized by Congress, the 
     amounts appropriated for these activities for fiscal year 
     2017 are provided to the component for which the funds were 
     appropriated in prior years. The amounts requested for CBRNE 
     are displayed in the table at the end of this statement.


                          Classified Programs

       Recommended adjustments to classified programs are 
     addressed in a classified annex to this explanatory 
     statement.

    TITLE I--DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONS, INTELLIGENCE, AND 
                               OVERSIGHT

            Office of the Secretary and Executive Management


                         OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT

       A total of $137,034,000 is provided for Operations and 
     Support, including not more than $40,000 for official 
     reception and representation (ORR) expenses. A decrease of 
     $5,000 is assessed to the Secretary's ORR funds due to the 
     assumption of $880,000,000 in unauthorized fee revenue in the 
     fiscal year 2017 budget request that artificially reduced the 
     amount of net discretionary appropriations required to fully 
     fund the Transportation Security Administration. DHS should 
     be prepared for additional decrements to ORR funds and other 
     headquarters activities in the future should future requests 
     include similar proposals.
       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as 
     follows:

                        Office of the Secretary

       A total of $18,632,000 is provided for the Office of the 
     Secretary. Instead of including funds for the Office of 
     Community Partnerships within this amount, as proposed by the 
     Senate, funds for that program are included in the Office of 
     Partnership and Engagement PPA, as proposed by the House.
       In lieu of direction provided in the House and Senate 
     reports regarding activities of the Joint Requirements 
     Council (JRC), the Department shall provide status updates on 
     these activities to the Committees on a monthly basis. 
     Specifically, the updates shall include a list of the 
     requirements documents that have been validated as well as 
     those that remain in the analysis phase at the DHS JRC level. 
     Validated documents shall be made available to the Committees 
     upon request.
       The Secretary is directed to convene a Public Complaint and 
     Feedback System working group, as described in the House 
     Report, and to provide briefings to the Committees within 90 
     days and 270 days of the date of enactment of this Act on the 
     group's progress and findings.


                            Office of Policy

       A total of $37,461,000 is provided for the Office of 
     Policy.
       Section 107 of the Act withholds $2,000,000 from the Office 
     of the Secretary until two long-standing required reports are 
     provided to the Congress. First, as described in the Senate 
     report, DHS is legally obliged to submit an annual report 
     estimating the U.S. population of nonimmigrant aliens who 
     have overstayed their visas. The Department submitted such a 
     report for fiscal year 2015, but has not yet submitted a 
     report for fiscal year 2016. DHS is expected to improve upon 
     the scope of the data provided in the fiscal year 2015 report 
     in its forthcoming report.
       Second, under the headings ``Border Security Metrics'' and 
     ``Public Reporting of Operational Statistics,'' the Senate 
     report outlines congressional and public interest in border 
     security metrics and immigration operations data. Recently 
     issued executive orders also require public reporting of such 
     data, which the Department has begun to post. For years, 
     Congress has directed DHS to develop border security metrics 
     that quantify the operational impact of border security 
     investments. Though progress has been made, DHS has still 
     failed to produce these metrics. The Department shall brief 
     the Committees within 90 days of the date of enactment of 
     this Act on its plan to develop and publish the metrics 
     described in the Senate report.
       As directed in the Senate report, $600,000 above the 
     request shall support qualified data analysts in the Office 
     of Immigration Statistics.
       In addition to the House directive to provide a 
     comprehensive review of the number and locations of all DHS 
     personnel deployed overseas, the Office of Policy shall 
     identify where redundant staff are located and explain why 
     they are required.
       As directed in the Senate report, the Department shall 
     report on the deployment and usage of International Mobile 
     Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers and related technologies 
     within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act.


                  Office of Partnership and Engagement

       A total of $15,206,000 is provided for the Office of 
     Partnership and Engagement, which includes $3,514,000 for the 
     Office of Community Partnerships.
       A total of $819,000 is provided for the Blue Campaign, as 
     requested. DHS is directed to fully account for and provide 
     justification material for this program in future budget 
     requests.


              Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties

       A total of $22,571,000 is provided for the Office for Civil 
     Rights and Civil Liberties.
       As directed in the House Report, the increase of $1,168,000 
     above the President's request supports enhancements to 
     programs in the Compliance Branch.

                         Management Directorate


                         OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT

       A total of $597,817,000 is provided for Operations and 
     Support of the Management Directorate. Of this amount, not 
     more than $2,000 is available for official reception and 
     representation expenses. Within the total, $194,092,000 is 
     available until September 30, 2018, to include $4,800,000 for 
     St. Elizabeths, $186,361,000 for the Chief Information 
     Officer (CIO), and $2,931,000 for headquarters operations at 
     the Nebraska Avenue Complex.
       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as 
     follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                    Budget Estimate             Final Bill

        Subtotal, Operations and Support......................             $727,771,000             $597,817,000
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Immediate Office of the Under Secretary for Management

       A total of $3,564,000 is provided for the Immediate Office 
     of the Under Secretary for Management, reflecting a reduction 
     to the request of $194,000 based on updated hiring 
     projections. The requirement from prior years to submit a 
     Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report with future budget 
     requests and quarterly updates is discontinued.


             Office of the Chief Readiness Support Officer

       A total of $54,275,000 is provided for the Office of the 
     Chief Readiness Support Officer, to include $26,180,000 for 
     St. Elizabeths headquarters operations and a reduction of 
     $500,000 from the request based on updated hiring 
     projections.
       In addition to the funding provided under this heading for 
     St. Elizabeths, $13,253,000 is provided in title V of this 
     Act for tenant designs for a new FEMA headquarters and 
     remaining elements of the Center Building Complex.
       For several years, CBP's Air and Marine Operations has been 
     refining a flight hour model similar to that of the Coast 
     Guard to track costs and link them to mission requirements. 
     The Department is directed to review the model to ensure 
     consistency across both CBP and the Coast Guard, and to brief 
     the Committees on a quarterly basis until flight hour costs 
     are captured completely and accurately across the 
     Department's air fleet.


               Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer

       A total of $39,026,000 is provided for the Office of the 
     Chief Human Capital Officer. A reduction of $240,000 is 
     assessed based on an updated hiring projection, and an 
     increase of $2,820,000 is provided to transition the Cyber 
     Student Volunteer Program into a DHS Cybersecurity Internship 
     Program.
       As directed in the Senate and House reports, DHS is 
     directed to continue working with every component to develop 
     metrics on hiring, attrition, the processes used to bring 
     staff on board, and a hiring corrective action plan. DHS 
     shall brief the Committees not later than 90 days after the 
     date of enactment of this Act on its strategy to decrease the 
     number of days it takes to hire new employees. As part of 
     this briefing, DHS shall provide quarterly hiring metrics by 
     component and detail its progress toward monthly metrics 
     reporting. Further, the briefing shall address progress made 
     to establish reciprocity with other agencies on polygraph 
     examinations and security clearances. CBP shall continue 
     monthly reporting of hiring gains and attrition losses.


                  Office of the Chief Security Officer

       A total of $63,102,000 is provided for the Office of the 
     Chief Security Officer, to include an increase of $1,379,000 
     for recurring security needs at the Nebraska Avenue Complex.


                Office of the Chief Procurement Officer

       A total of $98,076,000 is made available for the Office of 
     the Chief Procurement Officer, to include a reduction of 
     $3,347,000 based on an updated hiring projection.


                 Office of the Chief Financial Officer

       A total of $53,700,000 is provided for the Office of the 
     Chief Financial Officer (OCFO). DHS is directed to retain its 
     Appropriations Liaison Office as part of OCFO.
       The Department shall continue submitting obligation plans 
     to the Committees on a quarterly basis, with the first plan 
     due within 45 days of enactment of this Act. These plans 
     shall be consistent with direction provided in the 
     explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 114-113, which 
     required comparisons of planned and actual obligations, by 
     PPA, of all salaries and benefits funding.
       At congressional direction, DHS plans to improve the 
     clarity and completeness of budget justification materials, 
     particularly for procurement accounts. Clarity and 
     completeness is equally important for Operations and Support 
     accounts, given the size of many of these appropriations and 
     the flexibility DHS currently has to move funds among PPAs. 
     Therefore, in future budget justification materials, DHS is 
     directed to include a breakout of each account by cost 
     driver, including cost drivers for any proposed programmatic 
     changes. Additionally, the materials must clearly justify any 
     changes in cost driver assumptions from the prior fiscal year 
     to the budget year.
       Funding provided in this Act shall be obligated in 
     accordance with Section 2.0 of Chapter 2 of the Department of 
     Homeland Security Financial Management Policy Manual, dated 
     October 1, 2016, entitled ``DHS Appropriations Structure.'' 
     The Department is directed to notify the Committees regarding 
     any substantive revisions to this manual.

                Office of the Chief Information Officer

       A total of $286,074,000 is provided for the Office of the 
     Chief Information Officer, to include reductions of 
     $8,002,000 based on an updated hiring projection and 
     $2,100,000 to Legacy Information Technology Services.


              PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS

       A total of $18,839,000 is provided for the Management 
     Directorate for procurement, construction, and improvements.


                        RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

       A total of $2,500,000 is provided for the Management 
     Directorate for research and development.

          Intelligence, Analysis, and Operations Coordination


                         OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT

       A total of $263,551,000 is provided for Intelligence, 
     Analysis, and Operations Coordination, of which $106,115,000 
     is available until September 30, 2018.
       Within the amount, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis 
     (I&A) is directed to implement the Document and Media 
     Exploitation program and to build an Analytic Innovation 
     Cell. Both programs will provide actionable intelligence to 
     DHS's front line, enabling capabilities ranging from the 
     identification of fraudulent passports to the exploitation of 
     information that disrupts transnational criminal 
     organizations. I&A is commended for prioritizing its budget 
     requirements to support DHS's operational components.
       As directed by the Senate, I&A is directed to assess the 
     level of effort it provides to support the Department's 
     critical border security mission.

                      Office of Inspector General


                         OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT

       A total of $175,000,000 is provided for the Office of 
     Inspector General (OIG). The agreement does not include a 
     proposed $24,000,000 transfer to the OIG from the Federal 
     Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund 
     (DRF). Instead, the OIG is directed to allocate not less than 
     $20,856,000 to disaster-related investigations and audits. 
     Additionally, the recommendation includes a decrease of 
     $3,000,000 from the request based on updated hiring 
     projections.

              TITLE I--ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS--THIS ACT

       Section 101. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued requiring the Secretary to submit the Future 
     Years Homeland Security Program at the time of the 
     President's budget proposal for fiscal year 2018.
       Section 102. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued and modified requiring the Chief Financial 
     Officer to submit monthly budget execution and staffing 
     reports within 30 days after the last day of each month.
       Section 103. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued requiring the Inspector General to review grants 
     and contracts awarded by means other than full and open 
     competition and report the results to the Committees.
       Section 104. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued directing the Secretary to require contracts 
     providing award fees to link such fees to successful 
     acquisition outcomes.
       Section 105. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued requiring the Secretary, in conjunction with the 
     Secretary of the Treasury, to notify the Committees of any 
     proposed transfers from the Department of Treasury Forfeiture 
     Fund to any agency at DHS. No funds may be obligated prior to 
     such notification.
       Section 106. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued related to the official travel costs of the 
     Department's Secretary and Deputy Secretary.
       Section 107. A provision proposed by the Senate is 
     continued and modified requiring the Secretary to submit a 
     report on visa overstay data and to post border security 
     metrics on the Department's website. The House proposed no 
     similar provision.
       Section 108. A new provision is included requiring the 
     Secretary to certify whether U.S. Immigration and Customs 
     Enforcement is administering and executing its Enforcement 
     and Removal Operations activities consistent with available 
     budgetary authority.

          TITLE II--SECURITY, ENFORCEMENT, AND INVESTIGATIONS

                   U.S. Customs and Border Protection


                         OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT

       A total of $10,900,636,000 is provided for Operations and 
     Support, of which $681,441,500 is made available for two 
     years to provide flexibility in the year of execution. The 
     total includes increases of $3,000,000 for the Border 
     Security Deployment Program; $4,000,000 for small unmanned 
     aerial systems (UAS); and $15,000,000 for UAS fleet upgrades. 
     Reductions to the request include: $236,430,000 due to the 
     denial of the requested transfer of the Office of Biometric 
     Identity Management (OBIM) into CBP; and to support a 
     realistic number of FTE, $200,633,000 from pay and benefits 
     and $10,000,000 for non-pay and benefit funding.
       The bill reduces funding for staffing by $200,633,000 based 
     on technical assistance provided by CBP in March of 2017 
     indicating it would hire 3,000 fewer staff than originally 
     projected. Analysis of this revised hiring projection, 
     however, indicates a further problem with CBP's funding 
     estimates for personnel, because a reduction of 3,000 
     personnel should translate into savings of at least 
     $450,000,000. CBP is directed to provide greater details 
     underlying its personnel costs and FTE model in the fiscal 
     year 2018 request, and to revise its hiring projections at 
     least quarterly to ensure the Committees have timely, 
     accurate projections while formulating the funding levels for 
     CBP's fiscal year 2018 appropriations.
       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as 
     follows:

                       Border Security Operations

       Although the agreement does not include a provision from 
     prior years mandating a workforce floor for Border Patrol 
     Agents (BPA), CBP is directed to continue working to develop 
     a fully justified workforce staffing model that will provide 
     validated requirements for all U.S. borders and to brief the 
     Committees on its progress in this regard not later than 30 
     days after the date of enactment of this Act.
       Prior to completion of a BPA workforce staffing model, CBP 
     is directed to maintain a minimum staffing presence of 2,212 
     agents

[[Page H3810]]

     along the northern border, and is expected to increase that 
     number as warranted by ongoing assessments of risk.
       Within 120 days of the date of enactment of this Act, CBP 
     shall brief the Committees on actions taken to track the 
     costs and measure the effectiveness of consequence delivery 
     systems. In addition, CBP and the Science and Technology 
     Directorate shall jointly brief the Committees on 
     requirements and a concept of operations for small UAS, as 
     directed in the House report.


                      Trade and Travel Operations

       As directed in the House report, CBP shall provide a 
     detailed expenditure plan for biometric exit activities 
     within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act. To the 
     extent practicable, the plan should outline how innovative 
     technology and effective collaboration with airports and 
     airlines will minimize the need for additional CBP staffing.
       Within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act, CBP 
     shall provide an updated resource allocation model for the 
     Office of Field Operations detailing specific staffing, 
     overtime, hours of operation, and funding for and 
     implementation of planned enforcement initiatives, delineated 
     by field office.
       As directed in the House and Senate reports, CBP shall 
     provide a multi-year investment plan for Non-Intrusive 
     Inspection equipment with the fiscal year 2019 budget.
       CBP recently implemented its Electronic Visa Update System 
     (EVUS) before securing authority from Congress to impose fees 
     that would cover its costs. As a result, U.S. taxpayers are 
     left to foot a bill of $27,800,000 for activities that are 
     more appropriately borne by visitors to the United States who 
     use the system. The Committees caution that providing 
     appropriated resources for a program benefitting a selected 
     group of travelers is not sustainable. CBP shall provide 
     monthly updates on its efforts to secure statutory authority 
     for fee collections.


                         Integrated Operations

       An increase of $15,000,000 above the request is provided to 
     upgrade the UAS fleet to a single configuration. CBP is 
     directed to use any contract savings associated with the UAS 
     reconfiguration to implement high-priority improvements to 
     UAS operations. CBP is also directed to utilize any contract 
     savings from other programs for the deployment, operation, 
     and maintenance of modern DoD-Reuse aerostats to help 
     modernize and enhance surveillance capability, including 
     increased maritime domain awareness of the littoral borders 
     and the integration of data from deployed aerostats into the 
     Air and Marine Operations Center network for analysis and 
     information sharing. An increase of $8,000,000 above the 
     request is provided for facilities improvements, buildout, 
     and other enhancements necessary to ensure continuity of UAS 
     training programs.


                            Mission Support

       In the fiscal year 2018 request, CBP is directed to detail 
     all of the costs associated with operating Enterprise 
     Services, including all staffing and administrative support, 
     planned contract awards, and efficiencies realized by 
     establishing this new organizational unit.
       CBP is directed to provide quarterly briefings on progress 
     in implementing each of the 39 recommendations made by the 
     CBP Integrity Advisory Panel, as detailed in the Senate 
     report, and on the status of implementing other 
     recommendations on the use of force and employee misconduct, 
     as described in the House report.
       CBP continues to struggle in hiring and retaining funded 
     levels of Border Patrol agents and CBP officers, particularly 
     at remote locations along the northern and southern borders. 
     CBP is directed to work with the Office of Personnel 
     Management as necessary to identify and utilize incentives to 
     improve retention in hard to fill locations and to evaluate 
     the potential impact of offering additional career path 
     enhancements to personnel who choose those locations. CBP is 
     encouraged to work with community, local, and tribal colleges 
     to assist with recruitment efforts. In addition, CBP should 
     continue collaborating with DOD, as required by the Border 
     Jobs for Veterans Act (Public Law 114-68), to facilitate the 
     recruitment of personnel exiting the military.
       Within 120 days of the date of enactment of this Act, CBP 
     shall brief the Committees on a comprehensive recruitment and 
     retention strategy, including an assessment of options to 
     address agency human capital requirements. In addition, CBP 
     is directed to include the most critical components of this 
     strategy in the fiscal year 2018 budget request, and to 
     continue providing monthly data to the Committees on 
     frontline staffing levels.
       CBP continues performing capabilities gap (C-GAP) analyses, 
     and more than one year after inquiries on how the analyses 
     fit together, has not articulated how CBP leadership will use 
     the reviews to improve CBP and DHS-wide collaboration and 
     coordination. Within 90 days of the date of enactment of this 
     Act, CBP shall brief the Committees on coordination and 
     results of the requirements analysis process, as detailed in 
     the Senate report.
       CBP's finalization of the Single Window streamlined certain 
     manual and automated processes, but more work remains to 
     ensure that industry and Partner Government Agencies 
     communicate efficiently and effectively. Within 90 days of 
     the date of enactment of this Act, CBP shall brief the 
     Committees on the prioritization of development efforts, as 
     well as estimated timelines and costs for refining the 
     Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). CBP is directed to 
     ensure that the rescission of prior year funding included in 
     this Act does not impact the development or operation and 
     maintenance of ACE.


              PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS

       A total of $273,617,000 is provided for Procurement, 
     Construction, and Improvements. The bill includes increases 
     of $15,941,000 for an additional multi-role enforcement 
     aircraft, $31,500,000 for additional light enforcement 
     helicopters, and $43,459,000, as requested, for continued 
     deployment of Integrated Fixed Towers, including replacement 
     of SBInet Block 1. The bill also includes the following 
     reductions to the request: $11,000,000 from Non-Intrusive 
     Inspection equipment due to planned carryover of funds into 
     fiscal year 2018; $19,000,000 associated with a proposed 
     construction project for which insufficient funds were 
     requested; and $56,507,000 due to the denial of the request 
     to transfer OBIM from NPPD to CBP.
       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as 
     follows:

                         OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT

       A total of $6,168,532,000 is provided for Operations and 
     Support. ICE is directed to brief the Committees on its 
     obligation plan for the use of these funds, as specified 
     under title I of this statement.
       ICE continues to struggle with financial management across 
     the agency. The underlying problems stem, in large part, from 
     the limited authority and organizational placement of the ICE 
     Chief Financial Officer (CFO) position, which is subordinated 
     to the Executive Associate Directors of the operational 
     units--Homeland Security Investigations and ERO.
       The Director of ICE has an inherent fiduciary 
     responsibility to ensure that funding provided by taxpayers 
     to the agency is executed in the most efficient and effective 
     manner possible. As the senior resource manager, the CFO has 
     a vital role as a neutral advisor to the Director on 
     financial management issues. Unless the CFO reports directly 
     to the Director, that individual is not positioned to provide 
     the Director with unfiltered financial information, provide 
     advance warning of concerns, or recommend resource-conscious 
     alternatives. In essence, this lack of information denies the 
     Director full knowledge of resource issues and the ability to 
     make sound decisions based on all relevant information. The 
     Director of ICE is strongly urged to elevate the position of 
     CFO within the organization and to expand the CFO's 
     responsibilities to include agency-wide resource management 
     activities and funds control.
       Financial management weaknesses have been a particular 
     problem within ERO, as discussed below under the Custody 
     Operations heading. The lack of fiscal discipline and 
     cavalier management of funding for detention operations, 
     evidenced by inaccurate budget formulation and uneven 
     execution, seems to be the result of a perception that ERO is 
     funded by an indefinite appropriation. This belief is 
     incorrect. ICE has a duty and responsibility to the 
     Department, the Congress, and to taxpayers to be forthright 
     in the identification of its requirements and the proper 
     execution of its funding. It must manage-to-budget and cannot 
     operate under the false perception that Congress will provide 
     a bailout if financial controls fail or are simply ignored.
       To begin to address these concerns, a provision in this Act 
     requires the Secretary or the DHS CFO to certify to the 
     Committees on a monthly basis whether ERO is operating 
     consistently with the annual funding levels provided in this 
     Act. The first certification will occur not later than 30 
     days after the date of enactment of this Act.
       Another obstacle to sound financial management at ICE has 
     been its approach to paying for service-wide costs (SWC), 
     such as

[[Page H3811]]

     rent, overtime, utilities, and security. Instead of budgeting 
     transparently for these costs, ICE has historically relied on 
     post-enactment assessments against the appropriations of 
     agency components and programs to support them. Burying SWC 
     in mission budgets makes oversight by ICE leadership and 
     Congress significantly more difficult, leading to unchecked 
     cost growth. In Custody Operations, for instance, SWC funding 
     within the bed rate grew by 40 percent between fiscal year 
     2015 and fiscal year 2016; it is estimated to increase by 
     another 33 percent in fiscal year 2017.
       OMB Circular A-76 sets a standard of 12 percent as the 
     estimated federal agency overhead factor. Given that ICE also 
     budgets for these types of costs in its Mission Support PPA, 
     it is likely that the agency's overhead total significantly 
     exceeds the OMB standard. For the fiscal year 2018 budget, 
     ICE is directed to provide separate budget estimates and 
     detailed justifications for SWC in appropriate Mission 
     Support sub-PPAs or through one or more new SWC PPAs.
       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as 
     follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    Homeland Security Investigations

       Domestic Investigations. A total of $1,834,017,000 is 
     provided for Domestic Investigations to support activities 
     outlined in the House and Senate reports. ICE is directed to 
     maintain increased levels of effort for all high-priority 
     mission areas, including overstay enforcement and efforts to 
     combat human trafficking and child exploitation, as detailed 
     in the statement accompanying Public Law 114-113.
       Not less than $305,000 is to promote public awareness of 
     the child pornography tip line and for activities to counter 
     child exploitation, and not less than $15,770,000 is for 
     investigations of forced labor law violations, to include 
     forced child labor. ICE is directed to submit an annual 
     report on expenditures and performance metrics associated 
     with forced labor law enforcement activities.
       Of the total amount provided, $10,000,000 is for continuing 
     expanded overstay enforcement investigations and 
     investigative support. ICE is expected to target such 
     investigations on individuals who pose a risk to the public, 
     and shall brief the Committees on the proposed use of these 
     funds and on its overall overstay enforcement efforts, 
     including its support of Department-wide activities as 
     described in Senate Report 114-264, within 60 days of the 
     date of enactment of this Act.
       In addition, not less than $10,000,000 is for expanding 
     investigations into severe forms of human trafficking and 
     against suspected human traffickers.
       Within the total for Domestic Investigations, $5,000,000 is 
     provided above the request to fully fund ICE's implementation 
     of International Megan's Law, including the Angel Watch 
     Center. In addition, $3,000,000 above the request is provided 
     for enhancements at the Child Exploitation Investigations 
     Unit (CEIU) at the Cyber Crimes Center, including $2,000,000 
     for the Child Victim Identification Section and $1,000,000 
     for CEIU operations.
       The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) 
     was launched in 2002 to mitigate critical vulnerabilities 
     exploited by the 9/11 hijackers. ICE is urged to make use of 
     the full $171,000,000 in anticipated fee revenue for SEVIS, 
     $26,000,000 more than the estimate included in the budget 
     request, to expedite system development and dedicate 
     additional investigative hours to ensuring that students who 
     fail to comply with the terms of their visas face appropriate 
     consequences.
       International Investigations. A total of $159,035,000 is 
     provided for International Investigations, including 
     $18,000,000 above the request for the Visa Security Program 
     to annualize the costs of the previously funded program 
     expansion and for expansion to additional high priority 
     locations. ICE is directed to use the risk-based 
     methodologies and enforcement metrics outlined in the Senate 
     report to continue to plan and budget for Visa Security 
     Program expansion to at least two high-threat locations per 
     year in future budget requests. Efforts to combat the 
     smuggling and trafficking of children from Central America 
     shall be continued in fiscal year 2017 at not less than the 
     fiscal year 2016 level.
       ICE shall allocate not less than $5,300,000 for war crime 
     investigations, including but not limited to training, 
     transportation, and hiring additional personnel at the OPLA 
     Human Rights Law Section and the HSI Human Rights Violators 
     and War Crimes Unit.


                   Enforcement and Removal Operations

       A total of $3,471,806,000 is provided for Enforcement and 
     Removal Operations.
       ICE's sex offender notifications are not consistently 
     reaching the appropriate law enforcement agencies, despite 
     prior direction from the Senate to remediate this problem. 
     The agreement includes an additional $2,000,000 to enhance 
     and augment current efforts to apprise local law enforcement 
     agencies of offender releases. This funding shall be used for 
     contracts with entities to notify the appropriate local law 
     enforcement agencies in real time based on an address given 
     by offenders upon their release from ICE. Notifications 
     should include specific crime code information so that they 
     can be properly handled and received by the assigned 
     personnel within the local law enforcement agencies.
       Custody Operations. A total of $2,557,542,000 is provided 
     for Custody Operations, an increase of $378,579,000 over the 
     requested amount. This additional funding reflects the surge 
     in the number of aliens placed into removal proceedings and 
     detention after crossing our southern border during the first 
     quarter of fiscal year 2017.
       Even without the increased flow of aliens into the country, 
     ICE's fiscal year 2017 budget request negligently and 
     knowingly used a flawed projection of the Average Daily 
     Population (ADP) based on a seasonally low data point, 
     despite knowing full well that historical trends supported a 
     higher annual detention bed requirement. Further, the daily 
     bed rate used to calculate the funding requirement for family 
     detention was almost half of the actual rate because ICE 
     assumed substantial but unrealistic savings that were not 
     based on a validated cost estimation methodology.
       For the past several years, the agency's forecast for the 
     required number of detention beds and its cost estimates have 
     resulted in budget requests that missed the mark by wide 
     margins. In fiscal years 2014 and 2015, ICE reprogrammed a 
     combined total of $83,000,000 out of Custody Operations 
     because of a lower than planned ADP, only to reprogram 
     $127,000,000 into Custody Operations in fiscal year 2016 
     because the estimated number of beds needed and the average 
     daily cost used in the budget request were grossly 
     insufficient.
       Accurately formulating the budget request for detention 
     beds depends on two key variable--the cost per bed and the 
     number of beds needed, as determined by the ADP. While ICE 
     has the tools to develop reliable and detailed cost estimates 
     for detention beds, it does not consistently use those tools 
     in the formulation of the budget request. Even with more 
     accurate estimates of bed rates, however, ICE simply has no 
     model for estimating ADP. While there are factors beyond 
     ICE's control that affect the size of the ADP in detention, 
     such as the number of apprehensions by CBP, a model better 
     informed by historical averages and seasonal trends would be 
     a more prudent approach for forecasting the number of beds 
     needed in the next fiscal year.
       It is apparent that additional oversight and audit work in 
     this area is needed. Therefore, the Government Accountability 
     Office (GAO) is directed to review ICE's current 
     methodologies for determining detention resource 
     requirements, including its approach to estimating the ADP 
     requirement; evaluate ICE's efforts to improve the accuracy 
     of its cost estimates and projections; and report to the 
     Committees within 180 days of the date of enactment of this 
     Act on GAO's conclusions, including any appropriate 
     recommendations.
       To ensure costs are estimated using sound methodology, in 
     the fiscal year 2018 Congressional Budget Justification, ICE 
     shall fully detail the methodology used to determine the bed 
     rate, including the bed model output costs assumed for each 
     area of responsibility and facility type. All changes in the 
     various cost categories must be fully explained, rather than 
     generally justified as an increase in the bed rate. The 
     inclusion of indirect, service-wide costs into the 
     calculation for beds obscures the actual cost for detention 
     beds and allows ICE to increase overhead costs

[[Page H3812]]

     without identifying the true nature of the increase. 
     Therefore, ICE shall no longer include indirect costs in the 
     calculation for detention beds.
       ICE must also improve its contracting process for detention 
     beds. The agency has approximately 400 contracts with more 
     than 200 detention facilities, each having varying services, 
     costs, terms, and conditions. While contracts for detention 
     beds are negotiated by the Office of Acquisition Management 
     (OAQ), the Field Offices notify OAQ when more beds are needed 
     and are responsible for reviewing vendor invoices for 
     accuracy before submitting them for payment. However, there 
     is neither a standard template for contracts nor a consistent 
     method for Field Offices to validate invoices. ICE is 
     directed to brief the Committees on actions it has taken to 
     improve this process not later than 30 days after the date of 
     enactment of this Act.
       Also within 30 days of the date of enactment of this Act, 
     and quarterly thereafter, ICE shall provide an update on its 
     oversight of adult and family detention facilities. These 
     updates shall include information on the number of detention 
     facility inspections conducted, detailed results of the 
     inspections, and the estimated costs of such reviews. 
     Additionally, updates on family facilities are to incorporate 
     recommendations for improvements made by the Advisory 
     Committee on Family Residential Centers or as a result of 
     ICE's community liaison office.
       Within 45 days after the date of enactment of this Act, ICE 
     shall report on its progress in implementing the 2011 
     Performance Based National Detention Standards, including the 
     2016 revisions, and requirements related to the Prison Rape 
     Elimination Act, as detailed in the House report.
       Fugitive Operations. A total of $151,795,000 is provided 
     for Fugitive Operations. ICE is directed to continue support 
     for Mobile Criminal Alien Teams and to target individuals who 
     pose a threat to the public, as described in the Senate 
     report.
       Criminal Alien Program. A total of $312,350,000 is provided 
     for the Criminal Alien Program, including support for 287(g) 
     memoranda of agreement and $34,500,000 for resources and 
     full-time law enforcement personnel at the Law Enforcement 
     Support Center (LESC). As discussed in the Senate report, ICE 
     shall avoid duplicating LESC activities in other parts of the 
     country. While ICE has expanded its enforcement priorities, 
     it is expected that the agency will continue to emphasize the 
     apprehension and removal of individuals posing the greatest 
     threat to the safety and security of communities.
       Section 10 of Executive Order 13768, Enhancing Public 
     Safety in the Interior of the United States, directed the 
     Secretary to terminate the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) 
     and reinstate the Secure Communities program. The essential 
     distinction between the two programs is the manner in which 
     ICE seeks the transfer of individuals into its custody from 
     local law enforcement agencies (LEA). Under Secure 
     Communities, ICE issues detainers to LEAs, requesting that 
     they maintain custody of individuals identified by ICE as 
     enforcement priorities for up to 48 hours beyond the time the 
     individuals would otherwise be released. Under PEP, ICE 
     primarily issued requests that law enforcement agencies 
     notify ICE prior to when such individuals would normally be 
     released, although detainers were still issued under some 
     circumstances.
       In 2016, ICE reported that PEP's notification alternative 
     was effective in eliciting cooperation from most 
     jurisdictions that, by 2015, had stopped honoring ICE 
     detainers. Before Secure Communities was replaced by PEP, 377 
     jurisdictions refused to comply with some or all ICE 
     detainers. By the end of 2016, 280 of those jurisdictions (74 
     percent) had reestablished some level of cooperation with ICE 
     by responding to requests for notification, honoring 
     detainers, or both, including 21 out of the largest 25 such 
     jurisdictions. ICE should ensure that the reinstatement of 
     the Secure Communities program does not undermine the 
     progress it made through PEP in 2015 and 2016. Specifically, 
     ICE should continue to work with LEAs that are willing to 
     notify ICE prior to releasing individuals who are enforcement 
     priorities. To the extent that notifications from LEAs have 
     not always provided ICE with enough advance warning to take 
     custody of criminal aliens, ICE should continue working with 
     LEAs to ensure that notifications are made in a more timely 
     fashion.
       Within 60 days of the date of enactment of this Act and 
     quarterly thereafter, ICE shall provide a report to the 
     Committees on the number of detention requests issued and 
     actual custody transfers to ICE by state and local law 
     enforcement jurisdiction, criminal category, immigration 
     status, gender, country of citizenship, and enforcement 
     priority. In addition, the report shall detail the same 
     information for criminal aliens released by non-participating 
     jurisdictions, and should describe ICE's efforts to solicit 
     the cooperation of such jurisdictions.
       ICE is actively planning to expand participation in the 
     287(g) program to several jurisdictions. A state or local law 
     enforcement entity selected for the program receives 
     specialized training in immigration law and other topics at 
     the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers and enters into 
     a joint Memorandum of Agreement with ICE in order to receive 
     delegated authority to enforce immigration laws within their 
     jurisdictions. Upon arrest of a suspect, the local law 
     enforcement partner enters identifying information into both 
     criminal and immigration databases during booking. 
     Historically, this approach, used in penitentiaries, jails, 
     or other dentition facilities, has proven effective in 
     identifying and removing criminal aliens while reducing 
     allegations of racial profiling more common in the task force 
     model. The specific funding level provided for the program 
     has been eliminated from the bill, as the level was outdated 
     and did not reflect the current, let alone the proposed, 
     level of resources dedicated to this program. ICE is directed 
     to brief the Committees on proposed expansion and metrics 
     used to evaluate participation within 90 days of the date of 
     enactment of this Act.
       Alternatives to Detention. A total of $125,883,000 is 
     provided for the Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program. ICE 
     shall prioritize ATD participation for vulnerable 
     populations, including families, as appropriate.
       Transportation and Removal Program. A total of $324,236,000 
     is provided for the Transportation and Removal Program, an 
     increase of $1,542,000 above the amount requested.


                            Mission Support

       A total of $364,533,000 is provided for Mission Support. 
     Within the total, $82,000,000 is for the Office of 
     Professional Responsibility and $6,000,000 is provided to 
     develop and execute a comprehensive plan for immigration data 
     improvement, as detailed in the Senate report. To ensure 
     high-level engagement in support of this critical endeavor, 
     the Act withholds $25,000,000 from obligation under ICE's 
     Operations and Support account until the Director submits a 
     comprehensive plan to the Committees.


              PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS

       A total of $29,800,000 is provided for Procurement, 
     Construction, and Improvements. Within the total, $16,000,000 
     is for TECS Modernization, a funding level in line with 
     projected fiscal year 2017 obligations. ICE is directed to 
     brief the Committees on the development of this system as 
     specified in the Committee reports.
       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as

                         OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT

       A total of $7,105,047,000 is provided for Operations and 
     Support, an amount that is partially offset by $2,130,000,000 
     in estimated aviation security fee collections that are 
     credited to this appropriation, as authorized, resulting in a 
     net appropriation of $4,975,047,000. In addition, a mandatory

                     Aviation Screening Operations

       A total of $4,751,716,000 is provided for Aviation 
     Screening Operations.
       In fiscal year 2016, the air travel industry experienced 
     significant growth, resulting in passenger volume at TSA 
     checkpoints that exceeded the capacity supported by the 
     agency's budgeted resources. In response, Congress swiftly 
     approved three requests to reprogram and transfer funds to 
     address immediate staffing needs and other urgent operational 
     requirements to reduce wait times and increase security at 
     TSA checkpoints, including the hiring of additional 
     Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) and the procurement 
     of critical screening equipment and canines. The total 
     provided for fiscal year 2017 reflects increases to annualize 
     the costs of these actions and address the continued growth 
     in passenger volume, including: $136,592,000 for an 
     additional 1,396 FTE; $38,591,000 for additional overtime and 
     other unanticipated screener costs; $3,451,000 for training 
     for TSOs; $22,528,000 to annualize the cost of 50 additional 
     canine teams and associated requirements; and $4,443,000 for 
     support costs associated with the hiring of new TSOs and 
     canine teams. An increase of $7,600,000 is also provided to 
     fully fund fiscal year 2017 requirements for the Screening 
     Partnership Program. The total also reflects decreases to the 
     request totaling $6,040,000 due to projected under execution 
     of proposed FTE in non-screener programs.
       As directed in the House and Senate reports, TSA shall 
     brief the Committees not later than 30 days after the date of 
     enactment of this Act on a comprehensive assessment of 
     operational requirements to improve the security and 
     efficiency of passenger and baggage screening, including 
     long-term efforts and contingency plans to predict and 
     respond to changing passenger volumes without compromising 
     security.
       TSA is directed to brief the Committees on its canine 
     requirements and future plans for expanding the National 
     Explosives Detection Canine Team Program not later than 30 
     days after the date of enactment of this Act. TSA shall 
     consider passenger volume and risk assessments when 
     determining the deployment of the 50 new canine teams and the 
     re-deployment of existing teams.
       In lieu of the funding and direction in the House and 
     Senate reports, the bill includes $3,400,000 to establish a 
     program whereby third parties can perform air cargo screening 
     services using canines. TSA shall work with the air cargo 
     industry and canine providers, as well as any relevant law 
     enforcement organizations to identify initial locations for 
     implementing the program. Based on lessons learned at the 
     initial sites, TSA shall work with stakeholders to outline 
     minimum criteria for future entrance to the program. The 
     criteria should consider the potential benefits of using 
     third-party canine teams in the air cargo environment. 
     Further, in assessing the right model for canine team 
     certification, TSA shall ensure that costs to taxpayers are 
     minimized and that scalability to meet industry demand is 
     maximized. TSA is directed to brief the Committees not later 
     than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act on a 
     timeline for implementation of the program.
       Sufficient funds are included to support TSA's training 
     activities at the Glynco Campus of the Federal Law 
     Enforcement Training Centers, which now provides a basic 
     training program for all new screeners. Before TSA moves 
     forward with permanent investments in the campus related to 
     this training, it must develop a business case to justify the 
     cost of such training, including metrics related to increased 
     TSO performance, improved morale, and better managed 
     attrition. Further, TSA must assess the appropriate timing in 
     a screener's onboarding process for such basic training to 
     occur. TSA shall brief the Committees within 30 days of the 
     date of enactment of this Act on the business case.
       In lieu of the direction in the Senate report, TSA shall 
     implement a pilot program for airports that procure, install, 
     and operate exit lane breach control (ELBC) systems on a non-
     reimbursable basis that, for the duration of the pilot, 
     reallocates any resulting FTE savings to address screening 
     capacity challenges at the same airport where the exit lane 
     pilot is being conducted. The reallocated personnel shall be 
     in addition to existing screening staff assigned to the 
     airport checkpoint prior to the deployment of ELBC 
     technology. The procurement of ELBC systems shall be 
     consistent with TSA's Airport Exit Lane toolbox and exit lane 
     security guidelines, including technologies in use at 
     airports today.


                    OTHER OPERATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT

       A total of $1,407,491,000 is provided for Other Operations 
     and Enforcement. Within the total are decreases totaling 
     $21,130,000 due to projected under execution of proposed FTE. 
     Also within the total is an increase of $2,500,000 for the 
     Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) and Flight Crew Training 
     Program, including $2,000,000 to ensure training slots are 
     available to interested pilots and $500,000 to conduct an 
     analysis of training facility requirements for the FFDO 
     Program.
       TSA has convened appropriate stakeholders to initiate a 
     national partnership framework for public area security in 
     airports. This effort is overdue, given long-acknowledged 
     threats and tragic incidents in the U.S. and around the 
     globe, and stakeholders should be commended for their active 
     participation. TSA shall brief the Committees within 180 days 
     of the date of enactment of this Act on its progress in 
     establishing principles and developing the framework.


                            MISSION SUPPORT

       A total of $945,840,000 is provided for Mission Support, 
     which accounts for the annualized support costs associated 
     with the hiring and training of additional TSOs and canine 
     teams, as well as the projected under execution of proposed 
     FTE and other administrative savings.


              PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS

       A total of $206,093,000 is provided for Procurement, 
     Construction, and Improvements (PC&I).
       Under the new DHS appropriations structure, all components 
     are expected to use common, standardized appropriations and 
     PPAs to fund activities and other spending items that are 
     based on a consistent definition. As defined in the DHS 
     Financial Policy Manual, the PC&I appropriation is intended 
     to fund the ``costs associated with buying, building, or 
     improving end items--tools, assets, systems, and facilities--
     prior to sustainment.'' However, TSA's proposed fiscal year 
     2017 PC&I budget included numerous spending items that are 
     not appropriately funded within this appropriation. TSA is 
     directed to adhere to the guidance in the DHS Financial 
     Policy Manual in its fiscal year 2018 budget request.
       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as 
     follows:

                                vessels

       Survey and Design--Vessels and Boats. A total of $9,500,000 
     is provided in support of survey and design, including 
     $2,000,000 for initial survey and design work associated with 
     the acquisition of icebreaking capacity on the Great Lakes, 
     as detailed in the Senate report, and $1,000,000 for the 
     Inland River Tender fleet.
       National Security Cutter. A total of $255,400,000 is 
     provided for the National Security Cutter (NSC) program. The 
     total includes $95,000,000 for procurement of long lead time 
     materials associated with a tenth National Security Cutter, 
     and $3,400,000 for post-delivery activities for the ninth 
     NSC. In addition, $30,000,000 is included to support a 
     necessary Structural Enhancement Dry-dock Availability (SEDA) 
     for the second NSC.
       Offshore Patrol Cutter. The policy requiring the Coast 
     Guard to obtain appropriations for the total acquisition cost 
     of a vessel, including long lead time materials, production 
     costs, and post-production costs, before a production 
     contract can be awarded has the potential to create 
     shipbuilding inefficiencies, force delays in the obligation 
     of production funds, and require post-production funds far in 
     advance of when they will be used. The Office of Management 
     and Budget is expected to give the Coast Guard the 
     flexibility to acquire vessels, including the Offshore Patrol 
     Cutter (OPC), in the most efficient manner within the 
     guidelines of strict governance measures.
       Fast Response Cutter. A total of $325,000,000 is provided 
     for the Fast Response Cutter program for the acquisition of 
     six cutters.
       Polar Ice Breaker. To support the procurement of a heavy 
     ice breaker, $25,000,000 is provided for a new joint 
     acquisition strategy developed by the Coast Guard and the 
     U.S. Navy through a Polar Ice Breaking Vessel Integrated 
     Program Office (IPO). These funds are in addition to 
     $30,000,000 already reprogrammed to this effort in fiscal 
     year 2017. Under the new strategy, the IPO will obtain 
     detailed industry feedback through trade-off analyses to 
     further refine and validate operational requirements. A 
     report on polar icebreaker requirements, preferred design, 
     overall acquisition strategy, and a breakout of funds 
     necessary to support the acquisition shall be submitted to 
     the Committees not later than 90 days after the date of 
     enactment of this Act.


                                aircraft

     aircraft.


                            shore facilities

       Within the AC&I total, $44,519,000 is for construction of 
     shore facilities, including $10,000,000 for addressing needs 
     on the Unfunded Priorities List and $15,005,000 to begin 
     repairs on facilities damaged by Hurricane Matthew.
       The Senate report encouraged the Coast Guard to explore the 
     use of water purification systems free of bromine. Within 90

       A total of $36,319,000 is provided for Research, 
     Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E). The Coast Guard is 
     directed to examine the feasibility, costs, and benefits of 
     conducting intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance 
     missions in transit zones using long range/ultra-long 
     endurance, land based, unmanned aerial systems. Within the 
     total provided for RDT&E, $18,000,000 is included for the 
     Coast Guard, in collaboration with CBP and S&T to perform an

                         OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT

       A total of $1,821,451,000 is provided for Operations and 
     Support, including the following increases above the request: 
     $13,000,000 for additional overtime pay; $28,500,000 for 
     additional agent relocation costs; $8,000,000 for retention 
     efforts; an additional $9,000,000 for the electronic crimes 
     special agent training program; and $6,000,000 for missing 
     and exploited children investigations. The recommendation 
     includes a decrease to the President's budget request of 
     $21,044,000 to fund a realistic and achievable number of FTE. 
     Within the total, $42,966,000 is available until September 
     30, 2018, to include $6,000,000 for investigations related to 
     missing and exploited children; $5,557,000 for the James J.

       The recommendation includes $13,000,000 to implement new 
     overtime payment authority for agents and officers authorized 
     by Public Law 114-31. Due to the heavy demands of the 2016 
     presidential campaign, and also as a result of the attrition 
     and hiring challenges that have plagued the United States 
     Secret Service (USSS) over the last several years, many 
     agents and officers exceeded the previous legislative cap on 
     overtime pay. This additional funding supports compensation 
     for overtime, combined with basic pay, up to the annual rate 
     of basic pay for level II of the Executive Schedule.
       Increases to the request are also included to fully support 
     permanent change of station requirements and for necessary 
     retention initiatives. The USSS is directed to fully budget 
     for all known requirements in future years for these efforts. 
     Congress should not be forced to fund known requirements 
     purposely omitted from the budget request.
       The agreement includes $13,869,000 to enhance current USSS 
     investigative initiatives, including the Electronic Crimes 
     Special Agent Program and Electronic Crimes Task Force 
     missions, and basic and advanced computer forensics training. 
     The Secret Service shall provide periodic briefings to the 
     Committees on the status of investigations and ensure that 
     the associated funding and personnel resources continue to be 
     identified in future budgets.
       The bill sustains the fiscal year 2016 funding level of 
     $2,366,000 for forensic and investigative support related to 
     missing and exploited children and $6,000,000 for grants 
     related to investigations of missing and exploited children.
       In addition, the bill continues to provide $4,500,000, as 
     requested, to defray costs specific to Secret Service 
     execution of its statutory responsibilities to direct the 
     planning and coordination of NSSEs. A general provision in 
     the Act prohibits the use of funds to reimburse any federal 
     department or agency for its participation in an NSSE. The 
     Secret Service is directed to provide periodic updates to the 
     Committees on NSSEs planned for fiscal year 2017 prior to and 
     following each event.


              PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS

       A total of $90,627,000 is provided for Procurement, 
     Construction, and Improvements, including reductions of 
     $10,000,000 from protection infrastructure and $10,000,000 
     from investments in Information Integration and Technology 
     Transformation programs due to carryover of prior year funds.

     Identity Management (OBIM). Based on under-execution of 
     funding for personnel, the Act reduces the request by 
     $37,781,890 and 386 FTE. To help address the need to retain 
     and hire personnel with the requisite cybersecurity skills, 
     however, the total includes all funding requested for special 
     cyber pay and bonuses.
       In lieu of the briefing required in Senate Report 114-264, 
     NPPD is directed to include with the fiscal year 2018 budget 
     request a five-year plan to ensure appropriate office space 
     for headquarters, regional, and field staff. The plan shall 
     ensure headquarters staff is appropriately consolidated and 
     whenever possible regional offices are collocated with other 
     components to maximize mission collaboration.
       Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this 
     Act, NPPD shall provide a report to the Committees describing 
     the definition and process used to categorize each amount in 
     the NPPD PPAs as either defense or non-defense.
       In lieu of the requirement in the Senate report regarding 
     strategic documentation for proposed increases for Protective 
     Security Advisors or Cyber Security Advisors, NPPD shall 
     include detailed justifications in the budget request.
       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as 
     follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             Cybersecurity

       A total of $669,414,000 is provided for Cybersecurity, 
     including $9,500,000 for the Multi-State Information Sharing 
     and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) to support its updated 
     requirement for fiscal year 2017, and $12,970,000 for Cyber 
     Security Advisors. The National Cybersecurity and 
     Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) is funded at 
     $196,904,000, including $147,975,000 for Computer Emergency 
     Response Teams (CERT).
       Within 120 days of the date of enactment of this Act, NPPD 
     shall brief the Committees on the types of assistance, 
     including technical and formal ongoing engagement, available 
     to state and local governments, including law enforcement 
     agencies, to protect their networks. The Department shall 
     also work to include state and local law enforcement agencies 
     in the National Cybersecurity Review, and shall continue 
     raising awareness among these agencies on the need to 
     strengthen their own cyber-defenses and on the resources 
     available for such purposes.
       Cybersecurity Education and Awareness. The bill includes a 
     total of $14,133,000 for cybersecurity education, of which 
     $13,698,000 is provided through the Cyber Infrastructure 
     Resilience PPA and $435,000 is provided through the Mission 
     Support PPA. Any future proposed funding reductions to 
     cybersecurity education will not be considered unless the 
     Directorate provides a clear plan for how the funded 
     activities would be fully realigned within other agencies in 
     a manner that sustains the objectives of this critical 
     effort.
       Federal Cybersecurity. NPPD continues efforts to find 
     common strategies and security solutions across the federal 
     government for cybersecurity, such as Einstein and Continuous 
     Diagnostics and Mitigation. Funds appropriated to DHS, 
     however, should supplement but not supplant appropriations of 
     other federal departments and agencies. NPPD is directed to 
     develop a strategic plan, in conjunction with OMB and partner 
     departments and agencies, for securing civilian federal 
     networks. The plan shall include an effective cost model 
     whereby departments and agencies assume responsibility for 
     the costs of their own systems while also using NPPD subject 
     matter expertise and bulk-buying capabilities when it 
     enhances security and is cost effective. NPPD shall provide 
     the strategic plan to the Committees not later than 250 days 
     after the date of enactment of this Act, including a proposed 
     governance structure, roles and responsibilities of 
     departments and agencies, responsibilities inherent to NPPD, 
     and a model for ensuring a long-term and sound financing 
     structure for federal cybersecurity needs.


                       Infrastructure Protection

       A total of $186,292,000 is provided for Infrastructure 
     Protection, including the requested level of funding for the 
     National Infrastructure Coordination Center and $39,723,000 
     for Protective Security Advisors. Reductions to the request 
     reflect adjustments to hiring projections.


                        Emergency Communications

       A total of $102,041,000 is provided for Emergency 
     Communications, including $2,000,000 to continue projects 
     supporting the development of the National Emergency 
     Communications Plan.


                         Integrated Operations

       A total of $109,684,000 is provided for Integrated 
     Operations, of which $1,679,000 is for Stakeholder Engagement 
     and Requirements to continue the Software Assurance Program.


                Office of Biometric Identity Management

       A total of $235,429,000 is provided for OBIM, $11,600,000 
     below the amount requested due to delays in the Homeland 
     Advanced Recognition Technology (HART) program and $8,000,000 
     in contract savings. Although the fiscal year 2017 request 
     proposed the transfer of OBIM from NPPD to CBP, in the 
     absence of authorizing legislation directing such a 
     realignment, this Act continues to fund OBIM through NPPD.
       Until the Secretary or his designee briefs the Committees, 
     as specified in section 301 of this Act, on how OBIM is 
     addressing stakeholder concerns regarding requirements and 
     priorities, $20,000,000 is withheld from obligation.


                       FEDERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICE

       A total of $1,451,078,000 is made available for the Federal 
     Protective Service (FPS), as requested. This funding is 
     generated by collections of security fees from federal 
     agencies based on security services provided by FPS. The 
     Secretary and the Director of OMB shall certify in writing to 
     the Committees, not later than 60 days after the date of 
     enactment of this Act, that FPS operations will be fully 
     funded in fiscal year 2017 through the collection of security 
     fees. Should sufficient revenue not be collected to fully 
     fund operations, an expenditure plan is required describing 
     how security risks will be adequately addressed. In lieu of 
     direction in the Senate bill regarding a strategic human 
     capital plan, the Director of FPS shall provide a semi-annual 
     briefing to the Committees detailing the alignment of 
     staffing resources with mission requirements based on a 
     current threat assessment.
       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as 
     follows:

              PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS

       A total of $440,035,000 is provided for Procurement, 
     Construction, and Improvements.
       Within the total is $52,800,000 for OBIM's continued HART 
     acquisition, which reflects savings realized by not 
     transferring the program to CBP. As noted above, the Act 
     includes a withholding of funds under Operations and Support 
     until OBIM provides a plan to accelerate the multi-modal 
     biometric capabilities of HART Increment 2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 Grants

       A total of $2,709,531,000 is provided for Grants. FEMA 
     grantees shall continue to provide reports on their use of 
     funds, as determined necessary by the Secretary.
       FEMA preparedness grants are primarily designed to build 
     core capabilities to address terrorist attacks. Because the 
     threat environment has become more dynamic, however, it has 
     created a tension between sustaining current capabilities and 
     addressing changes in the threat landscape. The FEMA risk 
     formula, which determines the distribution of homeland 
     security preparedness grants, should evolve with the changing 
     threat environment while also maintaining capabilities for 
     traditional and known threats. While FEMA updates data points 
     for incorporation, and considers comments from grantees on 
     how the risk formula might be improved, it is not clear that 
     there is a comprehensive process for re-evaluating the risk 
     formula as part of the larger strategic context. FEMA is 
     directed to brief the Committees not later than 180 days 
     after the date of enactment of this Act on how developing and 
     maintaining core capabilities addresses current and emerging 
     threats; how FEMA adjusts the risk formula and training needs 
     for emerging threats; and on innovative ways to increase 
     responsiveness of the annual grant allocation process to 
     address current threats.
       Urban Area Security Initiative. Consistent with the 9/11 
     Act, FEMA shall conduct risk assessments for the 100 most 
     populous metropolitan statistical areas prior to making UASI 
     grant awards. It is expected that UASI funding will be 
     limited to urban areas representing up to 85 percent of the 
     cumulative national terrorism risk to urban areas and that 
     resources will continue to be allocated in proportion to 
     risk.
       Countering Violent Extremism. The fiscal year 2016 
     Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $50,000,000, 
     available until September 30, 2017, for emergent threats from 
     violent extremism and from complex, coordinated terrorist 
     attacks, like the 2015 incident in Paris, France. Of this 
     total, $10,000,000 was dedicated specifically for countering 
     violent extremism (CVE) to explore ways to prevent 
     radicalization and deter recruitment of vulnerable people who 
     could be inspired to commit acts of terror. Although grant 
     awards were announced in accordance with congressional intent 
     on January 13, 2017, Congress has learned the grants have so 
     far been withheld from obligation. The Department is reminded 
     of the requirements set forth in the Impoundment Control Act 
     (ICA). If the Administration is withholding this budget 
     authority from obligation--temporarily or permanently--it is 
     required under the ICA to send a ``special message'' to 
     Congress and the Comptroller General of the United States 
     that specifies why the funds are being withheld from 
     obligation. Importantly, funds cannot be deferred for policy 
     reasons. Given the current impasse and the currently 
     available funds, no additional funds are provided for CVE 
     grants in this Act. The Secretary is directed to fulfill 
     congressional intent by releasing the fiscal year 2016 
     funding without delay.
       Flood Hazard Mapping and Risk Analysis. A total of 
     $177,531,000 is provided for Flood Hazard Mapping and Risk 
     Analysis. FEMA shall ensure data collection and modeling 
     processes are transparent from beginning to end and involve 
     the active participation of local jurisdictions to ensure 
     maps accurately reflect local conditions and minimize costs 
     to local communities.
       Emergency Food and Shelter Program. A total of $120,000,000 
     is provided for the Emergency Food and Shelter Program 
     (EFSP). Once again, the budget request included a provision 
     allowing the FEMA Administrator to transfer EFSP to the 
     Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). While this 
     proposal may have merit, Congress and other stakeholders have 
     not been properly consulted in developing support for such a 
     transfer. If future budget requests again propose moving EFSP 
     to HUD, they should do so directly within the HUD budget, 
     including the justification for moving the program; a plan 
     for funds transfer, including previously obligated amounts 
     and recoveries; a five-year strategic outlook for the program 
     within HUD; a timeline for an interagency agreement effecting 
     the transfer; and a description of efforts to consult with 
     the EFSP National Board on the proposed move.


                   Education, Training, and Exercises

       A total of $273,927,000 is provided for Education, 
     Training, and Exercises. Within the total, $8,000,000 is for 
     Continuing Training, including $3,500,000 for rural first 
     responder training.

[[Page H3820]]

       A total of $44,000,000 is provided for the United States 
     Fire Administration, including $42,500,000 under this heading 
     and $1,500,000 under the Procurement, Construction, and 
     Improvements appropriation. Funding described in the Senate 
     report for facilities at the Center for Domestic Preparedness 
     is also included as part of the Procurement, Construction, 
     and Improvements appropriation.


                          DISASTER RELIEF FUND

       A total of $7,328,515,000 is provided for the Disaster 
     Relief Fund (DRF), of which $6,713,000,000 is designated as 
     being for disaster relief for major disasters pursuant to 
     section 251(b)(2)(D) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
     Deficit Control Act of 1985. In lieu of transferring funding 
     from the DRF to the OIG for audits of disaster-related grant 
     awards, as proposed in the budget and directed in prior 
     appropriations Acts, funding for DRF audits is provided 
     directly to the OIG for better congressional oversight.
       As directed in Senate Report 114-264, FEMA shall provide a 
     report, not later than 180 days after the date of enactment 
     of this Act, outlining specific actions and timeframes for 
     state and local governments to better share information about 
     fiscal preparation for disaster costs.


                     NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE FUND

       A total of $181,799,000 is provided for the National Flood 
     Insurance Fund.

        TITLE IV--RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TRAINING, AND SERVICES

               U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services


                         OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT

       A total of $103,912,000 is provided in discretionary 
     appropriations for E-Verify. DHS is continuing to evaluate 
     tools to analyze relevant social media in vetting for certain 
     types of immigration benefits. It is crucial that DHS 
     efficiently, effectively, and appropriately examine all 
     relevant social media data sources from both conventional 
     networks and the ``dark web,'' with special emphasis on those 
     networks used outside the U.S. where most of the postings are 
     in languages other than English. In addition, DHS must 
     maintain persistent access to these sources throughout the 
     adjudication process. Until DHS is able to incorporate social 
     media more comprehensively into its vetting processes, USCIS 
     is directed to work with the Department of State to ensure 
     appropriate social media vetting for the highest risk persons 
     seeking admission into the United States or seeking benefits 
     while in the United States.


              PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS

       A total of $15,227,000 is provided in discretionary 
     appropriations for E-Verify.


                           FEDERAL ASSISTANCE

       In lieu of a discretionary appropriation for the 
     Citizenship and Integration Grant Program, and consistent 
     with prior years, an administrative provision is included at 
     the end of title IV to permit USCIS to obligate not more than 
     $10,000,000 from user fee revenue to support grants to 
     benefit individuals who are lawfully admitted into the United 
     States. In addition to the fee revenue made available for 
     this purpose, the Department has the authority to accept 
     private donations that will support activities that promote 
     citizenship and integration. To facilitate the acceptance and 
     use of such donations by USCIS, the bill establishes a 
     Treasury account for that purpose.

                Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers


                         OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT

     enforcement basic training and $27,553,000, made available 
     for three years, for minor alterations and maintenance of 
     facilities. FLETC shall provide to the Committees quarterly 
     plans for the obligation of funds, as specified in the 
     explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 114-113, and 
     include a review of FLETC's hiring campaigns and attrition 
     levels.
       FLETC shall detail in its annual budget submission how data 
     supports its core business decision-making processes, 
     including its facility utilization processes, and shall 
     provide semi-annual updates on this ongoing initiative, 
     beginning within the first 90 days of the date of the 
     enactment of this Act.
       FLETC is encouraged to support continued testing and 
     evaluation of both prototype and proven active shooter 
     response technologies and to share its findings with its 
     partner organizations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Research, Development, and Innovation

       A total of $430,124,000 is provided for Research, 
     Development, and Innovation (RD&I). In lieu of the 
     $12,000,000 transfer from BioWatch proposed by the Senate, 
     the bill allows up to $2,000,000 to be transferred from OHA 
     to S&T for the advancement of next generation biosurveillance 
     tools. In addition, $3,900,000 is included for S&T RD&I to 
     initiate long-term research in leap-ahead technologies that 
     can be applied across more varied operational biosurveillance 
     environments. This work includes the establishment of key 
     performance parameters for biodetection, while leveraging the 
     bioterrorism research investments of other federal agencies, 
     most notably the Department of Defense.

[[Page H3821]]

       S&T is directed to brief the Committees on the proposed 
     allocation of RD&I funds by not later than 60 days after the 
     date of enactment of this Act.
       In lieu of the direction in the Senate report, S&T is 
     directed to brief the Committees not later than 90 days after 
     the date of enactment of this Act on how external peer review 
     is incorporated into its current processes.
       As directed in the House report, DHS shall issue a 
     Management Directive formalizing the Integrated Product Team

     institutionalizing repeatable processes within S&T.
       S&T has formalized relationships with academic partners on 
     UAS research, testing, and development, as directed in the 
     Senate report. S&T is directed to expeditiously execute 
     agreements for activities necessary to mature and 
     institutionalize DHS's efficient, effective use of UAS.
       As directed in the Senate report, S&T shall update the 
     Committees on the outcome of the feasibility study for 
     installing grid reliability technology not later than 30 days 
     after its completion. In the event of a favorable outcome 
     from the study, S&T is encouraged to continue development of 
     the Resilient Electric Grid in partnership with the relevant 
     utility companies.


                          University Programs

             TITLE IV--ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS--THIS ACT

       Section 401. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued allowing USCIS to acquire, operate, equip, and 
     dispose of up to five vehicles under certain scenarios.
       Section 402. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued prohibiting USCIS from granting immigration 
     benefits unless the results of background checks are 
     completed prior to the granting of the benefit and the 
     results do not preclude the granting of the benefit.
       Section 403. A provision proposed by the Senate is 
     continued limiting the use of A-76 competitions by USCIS. The 
     House proposed no similar provision.
       Section 404. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued and modified making immigration examination fee 
     collections explicitly available for immigrant integration

                      TITLE V--GENERAL PROVISIONS


             (INCLUDING TRANSFERS AND RESCISSIONS OF FUNDS)

       Section 501. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued directing that no part of any appropriation 
     shall remain available for obligation beyond the current year 
     unless expressly provided.
       Section 502. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued providing authority to merge unexpended balances 
     of prior appropriations with new appropriation accounts, to 
     be used for the same purpose, subject to reprogramming 
     guidelines.
       Section 503. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued and modified limiting reprogramming authority 
     for funds within an appropriation and providing limited 
     authority for transfers between appropriations. The 
     Department must notify the Committees on Appropriations prior 
     to each reprogramming of funds that would reduce programs, 
     projects, activities, or personnel by more than ten percent. 
     Notifications are also required for each reprogramming of 
     funds that would increase a program, project, or activity by 
     more than $5,000,000 or ten percent, whichever is less. The 
     Department must submit these notifications to the Committees 
     on Appropriations at least 15 days in advance of any such 
     reprogramming.
       For transfers, accounts may not be reduced by more than 
     five percent or increased by more than ten percent. The 
     Committees on Appropriations must be notified 30 days in 
     advance of any transfer.
       Transfer authority is provided to give the Department 
     flexibility in responding to emerging requirements and 
     significant changes in circumstances, but is not primarily 
     intended to facilitate the implementation of new programs, 
     projects, or activities that were not proposed in a formal 
     budget submission. To avoid violations of the Anti-Deficiency 
     Act, the Secretary shall ensure that any transfer of funds is 
     carried out in compliance with the limitations and 
     requirements of section 503(b). In particular, the Secretary 
     should ensure that any such transfers adhere to the opinion 
     of the Comptroller General's decision in The Matter of: John 
     D. Webster, Director, Financial Services, Library of 
     Congress, dated November 7, 1997, with regard to the 
     definition of an appropriation subject to transfer 
     limitations.
       For purposes of reprogramming notifications, ``program, 
     project, or activity'' is defined as an amount identified in 
     the detailed funding table located at the end of this 
     statement or an amount directed for a specific purpose in 
     this statement.
       Also for purposes of reprogramming notifications, the 
     creation of a new program, project, or activity is defined as 
     any significant new activity that has not been explicitly 
     justified to the Congress in budget justification material 
     and for which funds have not been appropriated by the 
     Congress. For further guidance when determining which 
     movements of funds are subject to section 503, the Department 
     is reminded to follow GAO's definition of ``program, project, 
     or activity'' as detailed in GAO's A Glossary of Terms Used 
     in the Federal Budget Process. Within 30 days of the date of 
     enactment of this Act, the Department shall submit to the 
     Committees a table delineating PPAs subject to section 503 
     notification requirements, as defined in this paragraph.
       All agencies funded by the Department of Homeland Security 
     Appropriations Act, 2017, must comply with these 
     reprogramming requirements. In addition, the Department shall 
     submit requests on a timely basis and provide complete 
     explanations of the proposed reallocations, including 
     detailed justifications for the increases and offsets, and 
     any specific impact the proposed changes would have on the 
     budget request for the following fiscal year and future-year 
     appropriations requirements. Each notification submitted to 
     the Committees should include a detailed table showing the 
     proposed revisions to funding and FTE--at the account, 
     program, project, and activity level--for the current fiscal 
     year, along with any funding and FTE impacts on the budget 
     year.
       The Department shall manage its PPAs within the levels 
     appropriated, and should only submit reprogramming or 
     transfer notifications in cases of unforeseeable and 
     compelling circumstances that could not have been predicted 
     when formulating the budget request for the current fiscal 
     year. When the Department submits a reprogramming or transfer 
     notification and does not receive

[[Page H3822]]

     identical responses from the House and Senate Committees, it 
     is expected to reconcile the differences before proceeding.
       The Department is not to submit a reprogramming or transfer 
     notification after June 30 except in extraordinary 
     circumstances that imminently threaten the safety of human 
     life or the protection of property. If an above-threshold 
     reprogramming or a transfer is needed after June 30, the 
     notice should contain sufficient documentation as to why it 
     meets this statutory exception.
       The section 503(a)(5) limitation on reprogramming funds for 
     the purpose of reorganizing components is not intended to 
     apply to routine or small reallocations of personnel or 
     functions within components. Instead, this language is 
     directed at larger reorganizations of the Department, to 
     include the allocation or reallocation of functions across 
     components and the establishment, consolidation, alteration, 
     or discontinuation of organizational units authorized 
     pursuant to section 872 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. 
     A notification under this subsection is not required for a 
     change of homeport for USCG vessels.
       Deobligated funds are also subject to the reprogramming and 
     transfer limitations and requirements set forth in this 
     section.
       Section 503(e) authorizes the Secretary to transfer up to 
     $20,000,000 to address immigration emergencies after 
     notifying the Committees of such transfer at least five days 
     in advance.
       Section 504. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued prohibiting funds appropriated or otherwise made 
     available to the Department to make payment to the Working 
     Capital Fund (WCF), except for activities and amounts allowed 
     in the President's fiscal year 2017 budget request. Funds 
     provided to the WCF are available until expended. The 
     Department can only charge components for direct usage of the 
     WCF and these funds may be used only for the purposes 
     consistent with the contributing component. Any funds paid in 
     advance or for reimbursement must reflect the full cost of 
     each service. The Department shall submit a notification 
     prior to adding a new activity to the fund or eliminating an 
     existing activity from the fund. For activities added to the 
     fund, such notifications shall detail the source of funds by 
     PPA. In addition, the Department shall submit quarterly WCF 
     execution reports to the Committees that include activity-
     level detail.
       Section 505. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued and modified providing that not to exceed 50 
     percent of unobligated balances from prior year 
     appropriations for each Operations and Support appropriation, 
     the Coast Guard's Operating Expenses appropriation, and 
     amounts for salaries and expenses in the Coast Guard's 
     Reserve Training and Acquisition, Construction, and 
     Improvements accounts, shall remain available through fiscal 
     year 2018, subject to section 503 reprogramming requirements.
       Section 506. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued that deems intelligence activities to be 
     specifically authorized during fiscal year 2017 until the 
     enactment of an Act authorizing intelligence activities for 
     fiscal year 2017.
       Section 507. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued requiring notification to the Committees at 
     least three days before DHS executes or announces grant 
     allocations; grant awards; contract awards, including 
     contracts covered by the Federal Acquisition Regulation; 
     other transaction agreements; letters of intent; a task or 
     delivery order on multiple award contracts totaling 
     $1,000,000 or more; a task or delivery order greater than 
     $10,000,000 from multi-year funds; or sole-source grant 
     awards. Notifications shall include a description of projects 
     or activities to be funded and their location, including 
     city, county, and state.
       Section 508. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued prohibiting all agencies from purchasing, 
     constructing, or leasing additional facilities for Federal 
     law enforcement training without advance notification to the 
     Committees.
       Section 509. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued prohibiting the use of funds for any 
     construction, repair, alteration, or acquisition project for 
     which a prospectus, if required under chapter 33 of title 40, 
     United States Code, has not been approved.
       Section 510. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued and modified that includes and consolidates by 
     reference prior-year statutory provisions related to a 
     contracting officer's technical representative training; 
     sensitive security information; and the use of funds in 
     conformance with section 303 of the Energy Policy Act of 
     1992.
       Section 511. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued prohibiting the use of funds in contravention of 
     the Buy American Act.
       Section 512. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued regarding the oath of allegiance required by 
     section 337 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
       Section 513. A provision proposed by the House is continued 
     prohibiting funds for the Principal Federal Official during a 
     Stafford Act declared disaster or emergency, with certain 
     exceptions. The Senate proposed no similar provision.
       Section 514. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued and modified extending other transactional 
     authority for DHS through fiscal year 2017.
       Section 515. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued prohibiting funds for planning, testing, 
     piloting, or developing a national identification card.
       Section 516. A provision proposed by the House and Senate 
     is continued directing that any official required by this Act 
     to report or certify to the Committees on Appropriations may 
     not delegate such authority unless expressly authorized to do 
     so in this Act.

     that would otherwise have been expended by a jurisdiction, 
     and shall not be available to reimburse the cost of 
     equipment.

  TITLE VI--DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY--ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATIONS

               SECURITY, ENFORCEMENT, AND INVESTIGATIONS

       A total of $1,520,242,000 is provided for enhanced border 
     security, including $1,140,121,000 in this title and 
     $380,121,000 in title II of this Act. As directed in title I 
     of this Act, DHS shall provide obligation plans to the 
     Committees for these funds not later than 45 days after the 
     date of enactment of this Act.

                   U.S. Customs and Border Protection


                         OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT

       An additional appropriation of $274,813,000 is provided for 
     Operations and Support.
       The Anti-Border Corruption Act (ABCA) of 2010 requires U.S. 
     Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to administer polygraph 
     examinations to all law enforcement applicants prior to their 
     hiring. As an alternative to its current polygraph exam, the 
     Law Enforcement Pre-employment Test (LEPET), CBP is 
     considering adopting a shorter, alternative test, the Test 
     for Espionage, Sabotage, and Corruption (TES-C). As a 
     precursor to adopting any alternative to the LEPET, CBP is 
     directed to first carry out a trial implementation of the 
     alternative standard for a subset of Border Patrol applicants 
     for no longer than a six month period. After completing the 
     trial, CBP shall submit a detailed report to the Committees 
     on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of 
     Representatives, the Committee on Homeland Security and 
     Government Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee on 
     Homeland Security of the House of Representatives describing 
     the trial and its results, including the rationale for 
     considering an alternate standard; changes in hiring 
     efficiencies; comparisons between the results of the LEPET 
     and the alternative standard; an analysis of risks that would 
     be associated with adopting the alternative standard and 
     planned efforts to mitigate such risk; and the costs of 
     implementation.
       The additional amount provided for this appropriation by 
     PPA is as follows:

                U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement


                         OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT

       An additional appropriation of $236,908,000 is provided in 
     this title for Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO). This 
     amount augments the $380,121,000 above the fiscal year 2017 
     budget request for custody operations and transportation 
     provided in title II for ERO. The total ERO increase of 
     $617,029,000 supports custody and related transportation 
     requirements, along with an increase in the average daily 
     number of participants in the Alternatives to Detention 
     program.
       U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) shall 
     refrain from entering into new contracts or other agreements, 
     or changing or significantly modifying existing contracts or 
     other agreements, to detain individuals unless such contracts 
     or agreements meet or exceed the Performance Based National 
     Detention Standards (PBNDS) 2011, as revised in 2016 and 
     which were in effect on January 1, 2017, unless the Secretary 
     submits a report to the Committees on Appropriations of the 
     Senate and the House of Representatives at least 30 days in 
     advance justifying the rationale for requiring changed 
     standards.
       Within 45 days after the date of enactment of this Act, ICE 
     shall report on its progress in implementing the 2011 PBNDS 
     and requirements related to Public Law 108-79 (PREA). This 
     report shall include a list of detention facilities 
     delineated by the detention standards with which they are 
     obligated to comply; a plan and schedule for bringing into 
     compliance each facility that is not currently obligated to 
     comply with PBNDS 2011 and PREA requirements; and estimated 
     costs for fiscal year 2017 and future years for bringing all 
     such facilities into compliance. If ICE does not plan to 
     bring certain facilities or categories of facilities into 
     compliance with PBNDS 2011, the plan shall include the 
     rationale for such decision.

   DIVISION G--DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED 
                   AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017

       The following statement is an explanation of the effects of 
     Division G, which makes appropriations for the Department of 
     the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the 
     Forest Service, the Indian Health Service, and related 
     agencies for fiscal year 2017. Report language contained in 
     House Report 114-632 and Senate Report 114-281 providing 
     specific guidance to agencies regarding the administration of 
     appropriated funds and any corresponding reporting 
     requirements carries the same emphasis as the language 
     included in this explanatory statement and should be complied 
     with unless specifically addressed to the contrary herein. 
     This explanatory statement, while repeating some language for 
     emphasis, is not intended to negate the language referred to 
     above unless expressly provided herein.
       In cases where the House report, Senate report, or this 
     explanatory statement directs the submission of a report, 
     such report is to be submitted to both the House and Senate 
     Committees on Appropriations.-- Where this explanatory 
     statement refers to the Committees or the Committees on 
     Appropriations, unless otherwise noted, this reference is to 
     the House Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related 
     Agencies and the Senate Subcommittee on Interior, 
     Environment, and Related Agencies.
       The Committees direct each department and agency funded in 
     this Act to follow the directions set forth in this Act and 
     the accompanying statement, and not reallocate resources or 
     reorganize activities except as provided herein or otherwise 
     approved by the Committees through the reprogramming process 
     as described in this explanatory statement. This explanatory 
     statement addresses only those agencies and accounts for 
     which there is a need for greater explanation than provided 
     in the Act itself. Funding levels for appropriations by 
     account, program, and activity, with comparisons to the 
     fiscal year 2016 enacted level and the fiscal year 2017 
     budget request, can be found in the table at the end of this 
     division.
       Unless expressly stated otherwise, any reference to ``this 
     Act'' or ``at the end of this statement'' shall be treated as 
     referring only to the provisions of this division.
       Recreation Fee Authority.--The one-year extension of 
     recreation fee authority for the Department of the Interior 
     and U.S. Forest Service contained in the budget request and 
     included in both fiscal year 2017 House and Senate Interior, 
     Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bills was 
     included in the Continuing Appropriations and Military 
     Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies 
     Appropriations Act, 2017 and Zika Response and Preparedness 
     Act (Public Law 114-223).
       Making Litigation Costs Transparent.--The Department of the 
     Interior, EPA, and the Forest Service are directed to provide 
     to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, and to 
     make publicly available no later than 60 days after enactment 
     of this Act, detailed Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) fee 
     information as specified in the explanatory statement 
     accompanying Division G of the Consolidated Appropriations 
     Act, 2016 (Public Law 114-113).
       State Wildlife Data.--The Department of the Interior and 
     U.S. Forest Service are expected to prioritize continued 
     coordination with other Federal agencies and State fish and 
     wildlife agencies to recognize and fully utilize State fish 
     and wildlife data and analyses as a primary source to inform 
     land use, planning, and related natural resource decisions. 
     Federal agencies should not unnecessarily duplicate raw data, 
     but when appropriate, evaluate existing analysis of data 
     prepared by the States, and reciprocally share data with 
     State wildlife managers, to ensure that the most complete 
     data set is available for decision support systems.
       Paper Reduction Efforts.--The Committees urge each agency 
     funded by this Act to work with the Office of Management and 
     Budget (OMB) to reduce printing and reproduction costs and 
     direct each agency to report to the Committees as part of its 
     fiscal year 2018 budget request on specific management 
     actions taken to achieve this goal and estimated cost savings 
     created by these actions.
       Land Grants, Acequias and Community Ditches.--The 
     Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture are urged to 
     recognize the traditional use of State-recognized community 
     land grants, acequias, and community ditches in the American 
     Southwest during the land use planning process.
       Executive Order #13783.--On March 28, 2017, Executive Order 
     #13783 established policies for domestic energy production. 
     The Order directs executive branch departments and agencies 
     to immediately review all actions with respect to domestic 
     energy resources. The Committees note that several specific 
     directives apply to entities under the jurisdiction of the 
     Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, 
     including a review of the Clean Power Plan and related rules, 
     and a review of methane and other regulations related to oil 
     and gas development. The Committees also note that the 
     Secretary of the Interior signed two secretarial orders on 
     March 29, 2017, to overturn the moratorium on all new coal 
     leases on Federal land, and to take additional steps to 
     immediately comply with the Executive Order. The Committees 
     expect the Department of the Interior and the Environmental 
     Protection Agency to keep the Committees fully apprised of 
     any actions taken to comply with the directives specified in 
     the Executive Order or related secretarial orders.
       Transparency of Information--The Committees expect that 
     Federal agencies funded under this Act shall, to the extent 
     practicable, clearly state within materials used for 
     advertising or educational purposes that the communication is 
     funded by taxpayer dollars.
       Fleet Management Practices.--Agencies shall provide 
     supporting documentation on their methods for determining 
     their optimal fleet inventories and justification for any 
     deviation from the General Services Administration's Federal 
     Property Management Regulations upon request of the 
     Committees on Appropriation. Agency inspectors general shall 
     provide results from audits of fleet management practices and 
     make them publicly available.
       Land and Water Conservation Fund.--The agreement includes 
     $400,000,000 derived from the Land and Water Conservation 
     Fund (LWCF) for programs consistent with chapter 2003 of 
     title 54 of the United States Code, as identified in the 
     table below.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       The Committees urge each of the agencies to comply with any 
     Congressional requests for full and accurate accounting of 
     cost, acreage, and location data of lands acquired with LWCF 
     funds. In future budget justifications, the agencies are 
     directed to include a detailed explanation on the use of 
     prior year funds for recreational access projects and 
     inholdings.
       The Committees direct the agencies to continue to consider 
     and rank Federal land acquisition projects consistent with 
     the process used in prior years, and upon request, to provide 
     a prioritized project list for any funding levels above the 
     budget request being considered by the House or Senate 
     Committees.
       The Committees believe increasing access to our public 
     lands for hunting, fishing, and other recreational activities 
     is important and again include funding for these projects. 
     The Committees expect the same factors used to determine 
     suitability of listed projects will apply to recreational 
     access projects and the agencies should work through their 
     respective regions, State offices, and/or management units to 
     consider projects that may not rise to the level of listed 
     projects. The agencies are directed to include an explanation 
     of the process and criteria used for allocating funds for 
     recreational access in future budget justifications. Further, 
     the Committees are to be informed about the selection process 
     and how the agencies are meeting the outlined objectives 
     prior to proceeding with projects.
       Public Access.--The Department of the Interior and the 
     Forest Service are directed to notify the House and Senate 
     Committees on Appropriations in advance of any proposed 
     project specifically intending to close an area to 
     recreational shooting, hunting, or fishing on a non-emergency 
     basis of more than 30 days.
       National Ocean Policy.--The President's budget submission 
     for fiscal year 2018 shall identify by agency and account all 
     funding and associated actions proposed for the 
     implementation of the coastal and marine spatial planning and 
     ecosystem-based management components of the National Ocean 
     Policy developed under Executive Order 13547.
       Harassment-Free Workplace.--The Committees believe all 
     Federal employees have the right to a harassment-free 
     workplace and

[[Page H3875]]

     continue to be deeply concerned about reports of harassment 
     and hostile work environments at some of the agencies funded 
     through this Act, especially the long-term pattern of 
     unacceptable behavior at several national park system units. 
     The Committees direct the Department of the Interior to 
     report to the Committees regarding: 1) what specific 
     corrective actions the National Park Service is taking to 
     preclude additional incidents from occurring in the future, 
     and 2) what steps the Department is taking to ensure that all 
     of its bureaus and offices have strong and consistent anti-
     harassment policies in place. The Forest Service is also 
     directed to provide a report that describes in detail the 
     policy and process changes it has made to address past 
     incidents. Finally, the EPA Office of Inspector General is 
     directed to provide a report describing existing EPA policy, 
     procedure and training regarding harassment at the Agency and 
     any policy and process changes it has made. The reports shall 
     be provided to the Committees within 120 days of enactment of 
     this Act.
       Access for Inspectors General.--Consistent with the 
     Inspector General Act of 1978, the Committees expect 
     departments and agencies funded by this Act to provide their 
     respective Inspectors General access to all appropriate 
     records, documents, and other materials in a timely manner. 
     Accordingly, agencies and departments shall not prevent or 
     impede access to records, documents or materials unless 
     otherwise provided by law.
       Restrictions on lobbying with appropriated funds.--The 
     Committees remind the entities and employees funded under the 
     jurisdiction of this bill that no part of the money 
     appropriated by any enactment of Congress shall, in the 
     absence of express authorization by Congress, be used in a 
     manner inconsistent with 18 U.S.C 1913.

                        REPROGRAMMING GUIDELINES

       The agreement retains the reprogramming guidelines 
     contained in the joint explanatory statement of Division G of 
     the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Public Law 114-
     113).

                  TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR


                       BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT

                   MANAGEMENT OF LANDS AND RESOURCES

       Bureau of Land Management Directives.--The Bureau is 
     reminded of the importance of the directives included in 
     House Report 114-632 and Senate Report 114-281 not addressed 
     herein, as well as the new directives in this statement, 
     including the front matter.
       The agreement provides $1,095,375,000 for Management of 
     Lands and Resources. In addition to the funding allocation 
     table at the end of this explanatory statement, the agreement 
     includes the following instructions:
       Rangeland Management.--The Bureau is directed, to the 
     greatest extent practicable, to make vacant grazing 
     allotments available to a holder of a grazing permit or lease 
     when lands covered by the holder of the permit or lease are 
     unusable because of drought or wildfire.
       Wild Horses and Burros.--The Committees are aware of 
     proposals to overhaul the program to ensure the humane 
     treatment of animals in holding and on the range, improve the 
     use of annual appropriations, and continue implementing the 
     reforms recommended by the 2013 National Academy of Sciences' 
     report. The Bureau is expected to review all serious 
     proposals from non-governmental organizations, to keep the 
     Committees informed throughout its decision-making process, 
     and to transmit to Congress within 180 days of enactment of 
     this Act a plan to achieve long-term sustainable populations 
     on the range in a humane manner.
       Greater Sage-grouse Conservation.--The agreement provides a 
     total of $68,900,000 for greater sage-grouse conservation 
     activities, including the implementation of the National Seed 
     Strategy, which is an increase of $8,900,000 above the fiscal 
     year 2016 enacted level. The Committees direct that the funds 
     provided for greater sage-grouse be used for on-the-ground 
     conservation measures as indicated in the fiscal year 2017 
     budget justification and House and Senate reports.
       The Committees believe conservation is most successful when 
     all partners trust and work cooperatively together. The 
     Committees expect the Secretary and the Bureau to work 
     collaboratively with States, communities, industry, and 
     partners to address concerns with the Resource Management 
     Plans and related Land Use Planning Amendments. The 
     Committees remind the Bureau of the concerns noted in the 
     House and Senate reports and direct the Bureau to report 
     within 60 days of enactment of this Act how it has addressed 
     each issue.
       Internet Oil and Gas Leasing.--The Bureau is directed to 
     provide the House and Senate Appropriations Committees with a 
     plan to achieve cost-savings and efficiencies by 
     transitioning to Internet-based oil and gas leasing within 
     180 days of enactment of this Act.
       BLM and ONRR Coordination.--The Bureau and Office of 
     Natural Resources Revenue are encouraged to better coordinate 
     their respective leasing and revenue collection databases to 
     increase efficiency and improve customer service.
       Abandoned Mine Lands.--The agreement provides that funds 
     may be used for projects included on the Bureau's high-
     priority mine reclamation list, such as the Red Devil Mine.
       Pipeline Safety.--The Bureau is encouraged to continue to 
     share standardized pipeline safety data, when appropriate, to 
     enhance pipeline safety.
       Law Enforcement.--The Bureau is encouraged to focus on 
     visitor safety and archaeological resource protection, and 
     work with the Department of Justice and the Department of 
     Homeland Security on other matters of Federal law not unique 
     to Bureau lands or property.
       Cooperative Efforts in Alaska.--The Bureau, as the largest 
     Federal landowner in the State of Alaska's Arctic region, is 
     directed to work cooperatively with local stakeholders to 
     enhance economic opportunities for the people who live and 
     work in the region. The Bureau also is reminded of the 
     directions contained in the Senate report regarding Legacy 
     Wells, and Alaska Native lands in need of remediation. The 
     Bureau is instructed to review recently executed land 
     management plans to determine whether decisions to retain 
     certain mineral closures are consistent with Federal law, 
     including the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act 
     and the Federal Land Policy Management Act, including a 
     determination whether sufficient notice was provided prior to 
     the creation of Areas of Critical Environmental Concern. 
     Further, the Bureau is encouraged to work cooperatively with 
     the State of Alaska to lift Public Land Orders that no longer 
     serve their original purpose.
       Bureau of Land Management Foundation.--The agreement 
     provides for the creation of a Bureau of Land Management 
     Foundation, the purpose of which is to undertake, conduct, 
     and encourage programs and activities that support the 
     mission of the Bureau. This should include educational, 
     technical, scientific, and other assistance or activities to 
     assist the Bureau with wild free-roaming horses and burros; 
     recreation, cultural, and historic resources; protection of 
     Native American archaeological and cultural sites; and 
     activities that support the reclamation and remediation of 
     abandoned mine lands, contaminated Native lands, legacy and 
     orphaned oil and gas well sites, and public lands affected by 
     development connected to mineral exploration and development 
     activities. Reclamation activities should include, but not be 
     limited to, the remediation of soil and water contamination, 
     the restoration of wildlife habitat in order to restore the 
     natural, scenic, historic, cultural, and ecological values of 
     such areas, or the promotion of the economic potential of 
     such areas.


                            LAND ACQUISITION

                   OREGON AND CALIFORNIA GRANT LANDS

       The agreement provides $106,985,000 for Oregon and 
     California Grant Lands, to be distributed as displayed in the 
     funding allocation table at the end of this explanatory 
     statement.


                           RANGE IMPROVEMENTS

       The agreement provides $10,000,000 to be derived from 
     public lands receipts and Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act 
     lands grazing receipts.


               SERVICE CHARGES, DEPOSITS, AND FORFEITURES

       The agreement provides an indefinite appropriation 
     estimated to be $31,050,000 for Service Charges, Deposits, 
     and Forfeitures.


                       MISCELLANEOUS TRUST FUNDS

       The agreement provides an indefinite appropriation 
     estimated to be $24,000,000 for Miscellaneous Trust Funds.


                UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE

                          RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

       The bill provides $1,258,761,000 for Resource Management. 
     In addition to the funding allocation table at the end of 
     this explanatory statement, the agreement includes the 
     following details and instructions. The Service is also 
     reminded of the guidance and reporting requirements contained 
     in House Report 114-632 and Senate Report 114-281 that should 
     be complied with unless specifically addressed to the 
     contrary herein, as explained in the front matter of this 
     explanatory statement.
       Listing.--The agreement does not include the critical 
     habitat directive contained in the House report. The Service 
     is urged to follow the guidance contained in House Report 
     114-170 regarding the yellow-billed cuckoo.
       Planning and Consultation.--The agreement includes: 
     $2,859,000 as requested for activities in the Bay Delta; 
     $4,000,000 as requested to handle the Service's increased 
     permitting workload in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the 
     2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill; and a $1,000,000 general 
     program increase to be distributed in accordance with the 
     backlog of requests from outside the Service for technical 
     assistance and consultations, including habitat conservation 
     planning and hatchery genetic management planning. The House 
     directive regarding the Gulf of Mexico is not included.
       Conservation and Restoration.--The agreement includes: 
     $1,390,000 as requested to implement the Coastal Barrier 
     Resources Act; $3,471,000 for the national wetlands 
     inventory; and $3,250,000 as requested for the sagebrush 
     steppe ecosystem.
       Recovery.--The agreement includes: $1,659,000 as requested 
     for activities in the Bay Delta; $2,500,000 for the annual 
     State of the Birds assessment; $3,000,000 to reduce the 
     delisting and downlisting backlog, a $1,016,000 general 
     program increase; $1,000,000 to implement the wolf-livestock 
     demonstration program as authorized by Public Law 111-11; 
     $2,000,000 to recover native bat species exposed to white-
     nose syndrome; and $500,000 for multi-partner recovery 
     actions. The Service is directed to prioritize the recovery 
     of the California condor and northern aplomado falcon and 
     provide the necessary funding to enable the longstanding 
     public-private partnerships to continue to support the wild 
     populations through captive propagation, releases, and 
     management, as the Service and the States work to address the 
     continued environmental threats to these species.
       The Committees urge the Service to focus on only those ESA 
     mandates which are inherently Federal, and not to engage in 
     other activities such as implementing recovery actions unless 
     the costs are at least matched by partners outside the 
     Service. The Service is urged to complete all status reviews 
     within the five-year period required by law, and, for any 
     determination on the basis of such review whether a species 
     should be delisted, downlisted, or uplisted, promulgate an 
     associated regulation prior to initiating the next status 
     review for such species. So that trends in the endangered 
     species recovery program may be observed, the Service is 
     encouraged to include in its next such report to Congress 
     ``species status'' and all categories from the report 
     entitled, ``Report to Congress on the Recovery of Threatened 
     and Endangered Species, Fiscal Years 2009-2010''.
       The agreement contains the directive in Senate Report 114-
     281 that, should a status review of the American Burying 
     Beetle make a finding that delisting or downlisting is 
     warranted, the Service is directed to prioritize this 
     rulemaking and move forward with a delisting or downlisting 
     proposal as soon as is practicable.
       The Service is urged to address consultations and 
     permitting of public and private projects related to the 
     Preble's meadow jumping mouse and the New Mexico meadow 
     jumping mouse as one of the highest priorities.
       Regarding exotic wildlife, the Committees acknowledge the 
     important role private landowners play in conserving some 
     exotic wildlife species. The Committees recognize current 
     permitting practices by the Service regarding the following 
     exotic U.S. bred wildlife: Red Lechwe, Barasingha, Arabian 
     Oryx, Eld's Deer. Prior to changing current permitting 
     practices, the Committees encourage the Service to engage 
     stakeholders and brief the Committees about the outcome of 
     such engagement.
       On April 26, 2017, the Service announced its intention to 
     take the final administrative step necessary to delist 
     recovered gray wolves in the State of Wyoming. This action 
     occurred as the result of a unanimous ruling in the Court of 
     Appeals upholding the Service's 2012 rule delisting wolves in 
     Wyoming. The Committees note that the Service's 2012 final 
     rule delisting gray wolves in the western Great Lakes region 
     remains in litigation. The Service has determined that the 
     wolf population in the western Great Lakes region exceeds 
     recovery goals in that region, and the Committees remain 
     supportive of science-based decisions. If the court upholds 
     the Service's 2012 rule, the Service is urged to reissue the 
     rule.
       Partners for Fish and Wildlife.--The agreement includes 
     $1,285,000 as requested for regional fisheries enhancement.
       National Wildlife Refuge System.--The agreement includes: 
     $2,835,000 as requested to manage subsistence fishing and 
     hunting; $9,726,000 as requested for invasive species; 
     $1,500,000 for the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National 
     Monument; a $500,000 increase for maintenance support; and a 
     $500,000 increase to reduce the maintenance backlog. The 
     agreement also continues funding for volunteers and for urban 
     wildlife refuge partnerships at not less than the fiscal year 
     2016 enacted levels. Budget justifications are the vehicles 
     for the Administration to clearly explain how they propose to 
     expend the funds they are requesting. This information should 
     not be difficult to discern and future justifications should 
     note base funding that will be used to enhance any program 
     increases requested.
       The Committees support the directive in the House report 
     instituting signage on any individual refuge where trapping 
     occurs and establishing guidance to be included in the refuge 
     manual. The Committees understand that different authorities 
     creating Waterfowl Production Areas, easements, and 
     Coordination Areas will influence the signage at these 
     locations.
       The agreement includes the directive in Senate Report 114-
     281 for the Service to prepare a formal compatibility 
     determination to determine whether nutrient enrichment in 
     Karluk Lake for fish rehabilitation is compatible with the 
     Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge's Comprehensive Conservation 
     Plan. In addition, if the Service determines the enrichment 
     is compatible with the refuge's Comprehensive Conservation 
     Plan, the Service is directed to engage with interested 
     stakeholders and publish a list of approved tools to 
     accomplish such rehabilitation.
       The Service is reminded that solutions to recreational-use 
     conflicts in national wildlife refuges should begin with 
     refuge managers engaging their local communities and 
     collaborating with local officials and other representatives 
     of recreational users to find mutually-agreeable solutions to 
     conflicts. Failure to do so can result in significant public 
     backlash, as happened with boating restrictions at Havasu 
     National Wildlife Refuge.
       The Committees urge the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service not 
     to place stricter environmental or financial standards on oil 
     and gas operators on national wildlife refuges than oil and 
     gas operators on other Federal lands set aside for 
     conservation purposes.
       Migratory Bird Management.--The agreement includes: 
     $1,738,000 as requested for aviation management; $350,000 to 
     minimize predation on livestock; and $3,371,000 to issue 
     permits.
       The Service is directed to expedite the review process to 
     authorize take of double-crested cormorants, ensuring they 
     have satisfied the NEPA requirements and addressed the 
     court's concerns, and should include an analysis of the 
     economic impacts of cormorant control activities on several 
     stakeholder groups, including aquaculture producers. While 
     advancing this review, the Service should explore any and all 
     viable alternatives to assist impacted aquaculture producers, 
     including through the issuance of individual predation 
     permits.
       Law Enforcement.--The agreement includes $75,053,000 as 
     requested for law enforcement, including $7,500,000 to fight 
     wildlife trafficking.
       International Affairs.--The agreement includes $15,816,000 
     as requested for international affairs, including $550,000 to 
     support the Arctic Council and $1,920,000 to fight wildlife 
     trafficking.
       Fish and Aquatic Conservation.--Within National Fish 
     Hatchery System Operations, the agreement includes: a 
     $2,000,000 general program increase; $1,475,000 for the mass 
     marking program; $800,000 for the Aquatic Animal Drug 
     Approval Partnership; and $1,430,000 for the national wild 
     fish health survey program. None of the funds may be used to 
     terminate operations or to close any facility of the National 
     Fish Hatchery System. None of the production programs listed 
     in the March, 2013, National Fish Hatchery System Strategic 
     Hatchery and Workforce Planning Report may be reduced or 
     terminated without advance, informal consultation with 
     affected States and Tribes. The Service is commended for 
     recommitting to the National Fishery Artifacts and Records 
     Center and the Collection Management Facility in South 
     Dakota, and for sharing the costs nationwide.
       The agreement includes the directive in the Senate report 
     related to the continued operation of mitigation hatcheries. 
     The agreement requires that future budget requests ensure 
     Federal partners have committed to sufficiently reimbursing 
     the Service for mitigation hatcheries before the Service 
     proposes to eliminate funding for mitigation hatcheries.
       Within Maintenance and Equipment, the agreement includes a 
     $3,000,000 increase as

[[Page H3877]]

     requested to reduce the maintenance backlog.
       Within Aquatic Habitat and Species Conservation, the 
     agreement includes: $13,998,000 for the National Fish Passage 
     Program; $3,000,000 to continue implementing the Klamath 
     Basin Restoration Agreement; $9,554,000 as requested to 
     manage subsistence fishing; and $16,660,000 to manage aquatic 
     invasive species, of which $8,400,000 is for Asian carp, 
     $2,000,000 is for quagga and zebra mussels, $711,000 is for 
     sea lamprey, $2,038,000 is for other prevention efforts 
     nationwide, and $2,566,000 is for State plans, National 
     Invasive Species Act implementation, and coordination.
       Cooperative Landscape Conservation.--The agreement includes 
     $12,988,000, of which $700,000 is for Gulf Coast ecosystem 
     restoration as requested.
       Science Support.--The agreement includes $931,000 as 
     requested to restore the Gulf Coast ecosystem and $2,500,000 
     as requested to continue to search for a cure for white-nose 
     syndrome in bats.
       General Operations.--The agreement includes the requested 
     $153,000 transfer from External Affairs to Recovery and the 
     requested $2,600,000 increase for maintenance of the National 
     Conservation Training Center.


                              CONSTRUCTION

       The bill provides $18,615,000 for Construction. The 
     detailed allocation of funding by activity is included in the 
     table at the end of this explanatory statement. The Service 
     is expected to follow the project priority list in the table 
     below. When a construction project is completed or terminated 
     and appropriated funds remain, the Service may use those 
     balances to respond to unforeseen reconstruction, 
     replacement, or repair of facilities or equipment damaged or 
     destroyed by storms, floods, fires and similar unanticipated 
     events.

                            LAND ACQUISITION

       The bill provides $59,995,000 for Land Acquisition. The 
     amounts recommended by this bill compared with the budget 
     estimates by activity and project are shown in the table 
     below, listed in priority order pursuant to the budget 
     request for fiscal year 2017. Further instructions are 
     contained under the Land and Water Conservation Fund heading 
     in the front of this explanatory statement.
       In a time when budgetary constraints allow for only a 
     limited number of new land acquisition projects, the 
     Committees are encouraged by programs that leverage public/
     private partnerships for land conservation like the Highlands 
     Conservation Act, which has a record of more than a 2 to 1 
     ratio in non-Federal matching funds. Therefore, the 
     Committees include $10,000,000 for the Highlands Conservation 
     Act Grants and direct the Fish and Wildlife Service to work 
     with the Highlands States regarding priority projects for 
     fiscal year 2017.

                         National Park Service


                 OPERATION OF THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM

       The agreement provides $2,425,018,000 for the Operation of 
     the National Park System. The detailed allocation of funding 
     by program area and activity is included in the table at the 
     end of this division.
       Operation of the National Park System. The agreement 
     includes $55,422,000 in new discretionary funding within the 
     Operation of the National Park System (ONPS) account which 
     support the Centennial Initiative and related efforts 
     including 50 percent of the fixed costs included in the 
     budget request to cover the balance of the fiscal year 
     remaining.
       Specifically, the agreement includes $11,000,000 in new 
     funds within the Park Support line item to support the 
     Centennial, which fully funds the budget request to support 
     new areas and critical responsibilities across the System 
     including, but not limited to, the 2017 Presidential 
     inauguration; operations at sites associated with the Civil 
     Rights Movement; and the Manhattan Project National 
     Historical Park. Funds are also provided to support new park 
     units including the Pullman and Honouliuli units as well as 
     critical operating needs as described in further detail 
     below. The recommendation also provides requested funding for 
     the Valles Caldera National Preserve and the Belmont-Paul 
     Women's Equality National Monument. The agreement provides 
     discretionary funding to address deferred maintenance needs 
     including a $25,000,000 increase for repair and 
     rehabilitation projects and a $13,689,000 increase to address 
     cyclic maintenance needs. These funds are supplemented by 
     $20,000,000 provided within the Centennial Challenge matching 
     grant program account dedicated to funding joint public-
     private investments in parks. The agreement continues 
     directives provided within the Visitor Services line item 
     contained in House Report 114-632. The final allocation of 
     funds supporting the Centennial Initiative, including

[[Page H3878]]

     the detailed allocation of new areas and critical 
     responsibilities funding described above, shall be provided 
     to the Committees as part of the Service's annual operating 
     plan for the ONPS account no later than 60 days after 
     enactment of this Act. Such plan shall be subject to the 
     reprogramming guidelines contained in this explanatory 
     statement.
       Quagga and Zebra Mussel Control.--The Committees remain 
     concerned about the spread of quagga and zebra mussels in the 
     West and, consistent with fiscal year 2016, have provided 
     $2,000,000 for continued containment, prevention, and 
     enforcement efforts.
       White-Nose Syndrome in Bats.--The Committees provide funds 
     as requested to support monitoring and surveillance 
     activities associated with white-nose syndrome in bats.
       Eastern Legacy Study (Lewis and Clark Trail Study).--The 
     Eastern Legacy Study, authorized to determine the feasibility 
     of extending the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, is 
     now three years overdue. The Committees direct the Service to 
     complete the study expeditiously.
       Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area.--The 
     Committees urge the Service to identify and assess the 
     potential costs of visitor experience improvements including 
     year-round restroom facilities and campsite enhancements at 
     Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area.
       Death Valley National Park.--The Committees urge the 
     Service to provide in its fiscal year 2018 budget 
     justification a detailed estimate of funds necessary to 
     complete repairs to Scotty's Castle, a historic national 
     landmark in Death Valley National Park, which has been closed 
     to the public since flash floods damaged the visitor center, 
     museum, and nearby roads in 2015. The Committees further 
     direct the Service to take steps to ensure the security and 
     protection of Scotty's Castle, and the contents of the 
     museum, from theft and trespassing.
       Mississippi National River and Recreation Area.--The 
     Committees direct the Service to report, within 180 days of 
     enactment of this Act, on progress in identifying potential 
     site options and associated costs for the development of a 
     permanent headquarters and visitor use facility, in 
     collaboration with suitable governmental and non-governmental 
     partners, at the Mississippi National River and Recreation 
     Area as described in the explanatory statement accompanying 
     Public Law 114-113.
       James A. Garfield Memorial.--The Committees direct the 
     Service to expeditiously complete its ongoing reconnaissance 
     study to assess the eligibility of the James A. Garfield 
     Memorial at Lake View Cemetery for designation as an 
     affiliated area of the national park system.
       Biscayne National Park.--The Committees are aware of the 
     considerable controversy relating to natural resource 
     management actions at Biscayne National Park, including the 
     decision to implement a new marine reserve zone as outlined 
     by the park's new General Management Plan (GMP). These issues 
     are articulated in House Report 114-632, including concerns 
     raised by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation 
     Commission (FWC) and local anglers and recreational and 
     boating-dependent businesses regarding limitations on fishing 
     within the park. The Committees recognize that it was the 
     intent of the Service to create the marine reserve zone to 
     protect the park's natural coral reef ecosystem, as mandated 
     by the legislation creating the park. Nonetheless, the 
     Committees are concerned that adequate consideration was not 
     given to the economic impact of this action nor to data 
     provided by the FWC. However, the Committees are pleased with 
     recent efforts by Biscayne National Park to re-establish open 
     dialogue and productive coordination with Congress and the 
     FWC regarding special rulemaking for the marine reserve zone. 
     The Committees understand the importance of preparing an 
     economic analysis and baseline scientific monitoring report 
     for the proposed marine reserve zone as required by the 
     record of decision on the park's GMP. The Service is directed 
     to make these documents available to the House and Senate 
     Committees on Appropriations and to the public no less than 
     90 days before proposing any special rule to designate the 
     marine reserve zone. The Committees understand that the park 
     is moving forward, in partnership with FWC, to implement some 
     non-controversial, common sense elements of the plan without 
     unnecessary delay, including the installation of mooring 
     buoys to help protect coral reefs from anchors and markers to 
     indicate shallow waters and manatee zones. The Committees 
     recognize the State of Florida's openness toward partnering 
     on these initiatives and believe a close working partnership 
     between the Park and the FWC may serve as an important step 
     toward future cooperation on other areas of the GMP. 
     Consistent with the record of decision, the Service is also 
     expected to defer enforcement actions related to the marine 
     reserve zone until the agency has finalized this special 
     rule.
       Arlington Memorial Bridge.--The Memorial Bridge 
     rehabilitation and reconstruction effort requires the active, 
     bipartisan support of Federal, State, and local leaders. The 
     Committees are aware of the recent approval of a $90 million 
     Department of Transportation grant for bridge repairs and 
     urge the Service to work with Federal, State, and local 
     entities to build coalitions and partnerships to leverage and 
     secure additional necessary funding to complete this critical 
     project in a timely manner.-- The Committees further direct 
     the Service to provide a funding plan and construction 
     schedule for completion of this work as part of the fiscal 
     year 2018 budget request.
       Bottled Water.--The Committees note continued expressions 
     of concern relating to a bottled water ban implemented under 
     Policy Memorandum 11-03. The report provided to the 
     Committees in April 2016, in response to a directive in the 
     explanatory statement accompanying Division G of the 
     Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, did not provide 
     sufficient data to justify the Service's actions. The 
     Committees understand that the Service plans to reconsider 
     this policy and therefore directs the incoming National Park 
     Service Director to review Policy Memorandum 11-03 and to 
     report to the Committees on the results of this evaluation. 
     Accordingly, the Committees direct the Service to suspend 
     further implementation of Policy Memorandum 11-03 and urge 
     the Service to examine opportunities to partner with non-
     governmental entities in developing a comprehensive program 
     that uniformly addresses plastic waste recycling system-wide.
       Ozark National Scenic Riverways.--The Service is directed 
     to work collaboratively with affected parties to ensure that 
     implementation of the General Management Plan for the Ozark 
     National Scenic Riverways addresses the concerns of affected 
     stakeholders including, but not limited to, local communities 
     and businesses.
       Point Reyes National Seashore.--The Committees have noted 
     the importance of historic dairying and ranching operations 
     within the Point Reyes National Seashore and reiterate the 
     directives contained in House Report 114-632 and Senate 
     Report 114-281 regarding the completion of planning and use 
     authorizations related to ranching operations.
       Leasing of Historic Buildings.--The agreement maintains the 
     directive related to Leasing of Historic Buildings contained 
     in House Report 114-632.
       Ste. Genevieve Special Resource Study.--With regard to the 
     Ste. Genevieve Special Resource Study, the Service shall 
     follow the guidance contained in Senate Report 114-281.
       Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park.--The 
     agreement includes requested funding for the Blackstone River 
     Valley National Historical Park with the expectation that the 
     Service will continue to make funds available to the local 
     coordinating entity to maintain staffing and capacity to 
     assist in management of the park as authorized in Public Law 
     113-291.
       Nicodemus, Kansas.--The Committees are encouraged by 
     discussions between the Service and the Nicodemus Historic 
     Society regarding a new or enhanced cooperative agreement 
     that will increase visitor interaction and transfer greater 
     control of the on-site interpretive services of the Nicodemus 
     National Historic Site to descendants of Nicodemus and local 
     community members. The Committees urge the Service to work in 
     an expedited manner with local community leaders to finalize 
     such agreement.
       Golden Gate National Recreation Area.--The Committees 
     understand that the Service has placed a hold on the proposed 
     rule for dog management at the Golden Gate National 
     Recreation Area. The Service is directed to conduct an 
     independent assessment of the planning process used to 
     develop the proposed rule and report back to the Committees 
     on its findings within 90 days of enactment of this Act.


                  NATIONAL RECREATION AND PRESERVATION

       The agreement provides $62,638,000 for National Recreation 
     and Preservation with the following specific directives:
       Chesapeake Gateways and Trails Program.--As requested, the 
     agreement includes $2,020,000 for the Chesapeake Gateways and 
     Trails Program.
       Heritage Partnership Program.--The agreement provides 
     $19,821,000 for the Heritage Partnership Program. In order to 
     provide stable funding for all national heritage areas, the 
     agreement continues funding for longstanding areas at fiscal 
     year 2016 levels; provides a total of $300,000 to areas with 
     recently approved management plans, known as tier 2 areas; 
     and provides $150,000 to each tier 1 area that has been 
     authorized and is still in the process of having its 
     management plan approved. The Committees believe that the 
     current method used to allocate funding for individual 
     heritage areas is likely to be unsustainable given the fiscal 
     environment and the need for areas with more recent 
     Congressional authorizations to build program capacity. The 
     Committees expect participating heritage areas to reach 
     agreement and propose a new funding allocation model to the 
     Committees and the Service within 90 days of enactment of 
     this Act that maintains the core services of the more 
     established areas but allows for more resources to newer 
     areas to expand and provide additional economic and cultural 
     opportunities in the communities they serve.
       Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area (MPNHA).--The Service 
     and the Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area are encouraged 
     to work cooperatively with Snow College's Mormon Pioneer 
     Heritage Institute to ensure the long-term viability of the 
     MPNHA.
       Feasibility Study.--The Committees understand that the 
     Service has no intent to initiate or conduct a feasibility 
     study to establish a national heritage area in Baca, Bent, 
     Crowley, Huerfano, Kiowa, Las Animas, Otero, Prowers, and 
     Pueblo counties, Colorado. In the event the Service alters 
     its intentions, the Committees direct the Service

[[Page H3879]]

     to notify the Committees 120 days in advance of initiating 
     such a study.
       American Battlefield Protection Program Assistance 
     Grants.--The Committees are aware of increased workload and 
     associated delays in grant processing due to the program's 
     expansion of eligibility to sites associated with the 
     Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, and have provided 
     funds within the Land Acquisition and State Assistance 
     account to allow for timely review and processing of grants.


                       HISTORIC PRESERVATION FUND

       The agreement provides $80,910,000 for the Historic 
     Preservation Fund. Within this amount, $47,925,000 is 
     provided for grants to States and $10,485,000 is provided for 
     grants to Tribes. The recommendation also includes 
     $13,500,000 for competitive grants of which $500,000 is for 
     grants to underserved communities and $13,000,000 is for 
     competitive grants to document, interpret, and preserve 
     historical sites associated with the Civil Rights Movement. 
     The agreement also includes $4,000,000 for competitive grants 
     to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and 
     $5,000,000 for the Save America's Treasures competitive grant 
     program for preservation of nationally significant sites, 
     structures, and artifacts. Prior to execution of these funds, 
     the Service shall submit a spend plan to the Committees on 
     Appropriations of the House and Senate.


                              CONSTRUCTION

       The agreement provides $209,353,000 for Construction with 
     the following specific directive:
       Line Item Construction.--The agreement provides 
     $131,992,000 for line item construction projects in the 
     fiscal year 2017 budget request as revised by the Service and 
     provided to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations 
     on April 6, 2017, and shown in the table below. Increases 
     above fiscal year 2016 base funds support the Centennial 
     Initiative, particularly deferred maintenance needs 
     nationwide, and construction projects as described in Senate 
     Report 114-281. Requests for reprogramming will be considered 
     pursuant to the guidelines in the front of this explanatory 
     statement.

                          CENTENNIAL CHALLENGE

       The agreement provides $20,000,000 for the Centennial 
     Challenge matching grant program, a key component of the 
     Service's Centennial Initiative. The program provides 
     dedicated Federal funding to leverage partnerships for 
     signature projects and programs for the national park system. 
     The Committees expect these funds to be used by the Service 
     to address projects which have a deferred maintenance 
     component in order to alleviate the sizeable deferred 
     maintenance backlog within the national park system. A one-
     to-one matching requirement is required for projects to 
     qualify for these funds. The Service is urged to give 
     preference to projects that demonstrate additional leveraging 
     capacity from its partners.

                    United States Geological Survey


                 SURVEYS, INVESTIGATIONS, AND RESEARCH

       The agreement provides $1,085,167,000 for Surveys, 
     Investigations, and Research of the U.S. Geological Survey 
     (USGS). The detailed allocation of funding by program area 
     and activity is included in the table at the end of this 
     explanatory statement. The Survey is directed to report to 
     the Committees within 180 days of enactment of this Act on 
     what new studies and projects over $1,000,000 have been 
     initiated within the last three fiscal years.
       Ecosystems.--The bill provides $159,732,000, which includes 
     an increase of $250,000 to address white-nose syndrome in 
     bats and $250,000 as requested, for Great Lakes Fisheries 
     Assessments. The Committees expect Great Lakes Restoration 
     Initiative (GLRI) funds to be allocated in accordance with 
     the funding allocation methodology used in fiscal year 2016, 
     and provide $5,620,000 for the Survey to address Asian Carp 
     issues in the Great Lakes and Upper Mississippi River. The 
     Committees remain concerned about

[[Page H3880]]

     new and emerging invasive species and expect the Survey to 
     continue to focus on early detection and rapid response as a 
     way to address the threats posed by invasive plants and 
     animals.
       Climate and Land Use Change.--The agreement provides 
     $149,275,000, which includes the Senate directive for Arctic 
     research, and $85,794,000 for the Land Remote Sensing 
     program. The Survey is directed to apply carryover balances 
     from the satellite operations account so that Landsat-9 is 
     fully funded.
       Energy, Minerals, and Environmental Health.--The bill 
     provides $94,311,000 for Energy, Minerals, and Environmental 
     Health. The Committees do not accept the proposed decrease of 
     $1,500,000 for geophysical and remote sensing activities, and 
     expect this work to continue in the Yukon-Tanana Upland. The 
     Committees understand that the Survey is spending 
     approximately $3,000,000 on studies related to oil and gas 
     resources in low-permeability reservoirs and expect this work 
     to continue. Further, the Committees direct the Survey to 
     consult with State geological surveys to conduct the initial 
     research needed for new assessments in the Artic petroleum 
     province. The Committees support the Survey's comprehensive 
     research on cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms within the 
     Toxic Substances Hydrology program and expect this work to 
     continue at the fiscal year 2016 enacted funding level.
       Natural Hazards.--Funding for the Natural Hazards program 
     includes $64,303,000 for earthquake hazards, of which 
     $10,200,000 is provided for continued development of an 
     earthquake early warning system. The bill also provides an 
     additional $800,000 as requested for the Central and Eastern 
     U.S. Seismic Network (CEUSN) and an increase of $1,000,000 
     for regional seismic networks to work with the Survey to meet 
     ANSS standards by incorporating data from active Earthscope 
     earthquake monitoring instruments. The Committees understand 
     that the cost benefit analysis as required by P.L. 114-113 is 
     complete; therefore, the Survey is directed to report back to 
     the Committees within six months of enactment of this Act 
     with an implementation plan, including cost estimates, for 
     the adoption of future seismic stations.
       The bill provides $28,121,000 for volcano hazards. A 
     $1,000,000 increase over enacted is provided for the repair 
     and upgrade of analog systems on high-threat volcanos, and an 
     additional $1,000,000 is provided for next-generation lahar 
     detection systems.
       Water Resources.--The bill provides $214,754,000 for Water 
     Resources, with $59,927,000 directed to activities associated 
     with the Cooperative Matching Funds for the highest priority 
     work in WaterSMART: Water Use Research, Tribal cooperative 
     funding, and critical Enhanced Cooperative Activities and 
     Urban Waters work. Specifically, the bill provides 
     $45,052,000 for the Water Availability and Use Science 
     program, including an additional $1,000,000 for Water Use 
     Research and $2,000,000 for groundwater resource studies in 
     the Mississippi River Alluvial Plain; $72,673,000 for the 
     Groundwater and Streamflow Information program, including 
     increases of $500,000 for the groundwater network, $700,000 
     for streamgages, and $160,000 to reestablish a transboundary 
     river streamgage affected by discharges caused by mines 
     across the Canadian border; $90,529,000 for the National 
     Water Quality program, including a $717,000 increase for 
     Enhanced Cooperative Activities and Urban Waters and 
     $63,000,000 for NAWQA Cycle 3; and $6,500,000 for the Water 
     Resources Research Act program.
       Core Science Systems.--The bill provides $116,050,000, 
     including increases to the 3D Elevation Program (3DEP), of 
     which: $1,500,000 is for National Enhancement; $2,500,000 is 
     for Alaska Mapping and Map Modernization; and $500,000 is for 
     Landscape Level Assessments--Chesapeake Bay.
       Facilities.--It has come to the Committees' attention that 
     additional resources may be needed for facilities challenges 
     in Menlo Park, California; Lakewood, Colorado; and Madison, 
     Wisconsin. The Survey is expected to expeditiously move 
     forward on innovative proposals for resolving these issues, 
     to address funding needs in the fiscal year 2018 budget 
     submission, and to keep the Committees informed of 
     developments related to these facilities.
       Prohibition on Destruction of Records.--The Office of 
     Inspector General's report on Scientific Integrity at the 
     USGS Energy Geochemistry Laboratory in Lakewood, Colorado, 
     concluded the incident ``has had numerous real and potential 
     adverse impacts on customers, products, and the 
     organizational integrity of USGS.'' While the Survey has 
     taken action and closed the laboratory involved, it is 
     critical the Survey adhere to Federal records management 
     requirements and abide by the prohibitions against unlawful 
     removal or destruction of Federal records, specifically those 
     regarding, related to, or generated by the Inorganic Section 
     of this laboratory while USGS and Congressional assessments 
     of the incident are ongoing.

                   Bureau of Ocean Energy Management


                        OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT

       The bill provides $169,560,000 for Ocean Energy Management 
     to be partially offset with the collection of rental receipts 
     and cost recovery fees totaling $94,944,000, for a net 
     discretionary appropriation of $74,616,000. The request did 
     not include any funds for coastal marine spatial planning and 
     accordingly the bill provides no funds for such activities. 
     The agreement includes the following additional guidance:
       Air Quality Studies.--The Committees expect the Bureau to 
     complete ongoing air quality modelling studies and consult 
     with affected coastal States prior to finalizing any new 
     requirements.
       Financial Assurance.--The Committees understand that the 
     Bureau has extended the implementation timeline for changes 
     to its Risk Management and Financial Assurance Program to 
     allow for continued stakeholder input.
       Five-year lease plan.--The Committees are aware that the 
     Department is reviewing the 2017-2022 offshore lease plan and 
     expect the review to proceed expeditiously and to carefully 
     consider updates for the plan consistent with stakeholder 
     input.
       Offshore Revenues.--The Committees expect the Department 
     will distribute revenues from Gulf of Mexico operations in a 
     manner consistent with the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act 
     of 2006 (P.L. 109-432).
       Offshore Wind Energy Development.--The Committees 
     understand that the Bureau is continuing to work in North 
     Carolina with local stakeholders, industry, and State task 
     forces and that there will be no lease sales in the 
     Wilmington Wind Energy Area during fiscal year 2017.
       Renewable Energy.-- The Bureau should follow the direction 
     under this heading in Senate Report 114-281.

       The bill provides $189,772,000 for Offshore Safety and 
     Environmental Enforcement to be partially offset with the 
     collection of rental receipts, cost recovery fees and 
     inspection fees totaling $96,530,000 for a net discretionary 
     appropriation of $93,242,000. The bill also includes a 
     $25,000,000 rescission of unobligated balances.
       Blowout Preventer Systems and Well Control Rule.--The 
     Committees encourage the Bureau to evaluate information 
     learned from additional stakeholder input and ongoing 
     technical conversations to inform implementation of this 
     rule. To the extent additional information warrants revisions 
     to the rule that require public notice and comment, the 
     Bureau is encouraged to follow that process to ensure that 
     offshore operations promote safety and protect the 
     environment in a technically feasible manner.
       Other.--The Committees direct the Bureau to review its 
     current policy concerning the acquisition of helicopter fuel 
     in the Gulf of Mexico from third parties and submit a report 
     to the Committees within 90 days of enactment of this Act. 
     The report should include an analysis of how frequently fuel 
     is acquired by the agency and the criteria used to determine 
     compensation for fuel owned by third parties.

     greatest amount of unfunded needs and $30,000,000 shall be 
     distributed in equal amounts to the three Appalachian States 
     with the subsequent greatest amount of unfunded needs. Such 
     grants shall be distributed to States in accordance with the 
     goals, intent and direction provided under this heading in 
     House Report 114-632.


        BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS AND BUREAU OF INDIAN EDUCATION

                      OPERATION OF INDIAN PROGRAMS

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

       The bill provides $2,339,346,000 for Operation of Indian 
     Programs. In addition to the funding allocation table at the 
     end of this explanatory statement, the agreement includes 
     requested fixed costs and transfers, and the following 
     details and instructions. The Bureaus are reminded of the 
     guidance and reporting requirements contained in House Report 
     114-632 and Senate Report 114-281 that should be complied 
     with unless specifically addressed to the contrary herein, as

       Tribal Government.--The agreement includes $308,185,000 for 
     Tribal government programs, of which $160,000 is for new 
     Tribes. If additional Tribes are recognized during fiscal 
     year 2017 beyond those contemplated in the budget request, 
     the Bureau is urged to support their capacity building 
     efforts to the extent feasible. The Small and Needy Tribes 
     program is funded at $4,448,000, ensuring that all Tribes 
     receive the maximum base level provided by the Bureau to run 
     Tribal governments.

[[Page H3881]]

       Road maintenance is funded at $30,307,000. The Bureau is 
     urged to focus the program increase on roads and bridges in 
     poor or failing condition, particularly along school bus 
     routes. The Bureau is directed to consolidate the reporting 
     requirements for road maintenance contained in the House and 
     Senate reports and to report back to the Committees within 60 
     days of enactment of this Act.
       Human Services.--The Bureau is directed to report back to 
     the Committees within 90 days of enactment of this Act on the 
     performance measures being used to monitor and track the 
     Tiwahe initiative's effectiveness in Indian Country.
       Trust--Natural Resources Management.--The agreement 
     includes $11,266,000 for the Tribal Management/Development 
     Program and a $2,000,000 program increase for Alaska 
     subsistence programs as requested, including consideration of 
     funding for the projects and pilot programs referenced in the 
     budget submission including the Ahtna Subsistence Cooperative 
     Management Project and the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal 
     Fisheries Commission. Forestry is funded at $54,155,000 and 
     includes a $2,000,000 program increase for forest thinning 
     projects. The Fish, Wildlife, and Parks program is funded at 
     $15,203,000 and includes program increases of $545,000 for 
     Tribal hatcheries currently not receiving BIA hatchery 
     operations funding as outlined in the Senate report, and 
     $1,000,000 for fish hatchery operations. The ongoing Seminole 
     and Miccosukee water study is funded at $390,000 as 
     requested.
       The Bureau is directed to enter into a formal partnership 
     with local Tribes and the United States Geological Survey to 
     help develop a water quality strategy for transboundary 
     rivers affected by discharges caused by mines across the 
     Canadian border.
       Trust--Real Estate Services.--The agreement includes 
     $123,092,000 for real estate services and includes the 
     following program changes: a decrease of $6,893,000 as 
     requested from trust services; a $400,000 increase for the 
     historical places and cemetery sites program, including ANCSA 
     sites; and a $1,500,000 increase for settlement negotiations 
     and implementation related to water rights and Tribal trust 
     fishery resources in the Klamath Basin. The agreement does 
     not include the directive contained in the House report 
     regarding reservation boundary recognition.
       The Committees are concerned that the Bureau does not 
     adequately maintain rights-of-way records. The Bureau is 
     encouraged to develop a plan to update and digitize its 
     inventory of records and to make the records publicly 
     available in a commonly used mapping format, consistent with 
     the guidance provided in Senate Report 114-281.
       Bureau of Indian Education.--The agreement includes 
     $891,513,000 for the Bureau of Indian Education, of which: 
     $400,223,000 is for ISEP formula funds; $2,500,000 is for the 
     development and operation of Tribal departments or divisions 
     of education (TEDs) as authorized by 25 U.S.C. 2020; 
     $55,995,000 is for student transportation; $18,659,000 is for 
     early child and family development and should be used to 
     expand the Family and Child Education (FACE) program; 
     $80,165,000 is to fully fund Tribal grant support costs, 
     based upon updated information provided by the Bureau; 
     $66,219,000 is for facilities operations; $59,043,000 is for 
     facilities maintenance; $7,414,000 is for Tribal technical 
     colleges; $22,117,000 is for the Bureau-owned and operated 
     Haskell Indian University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic 
     Institute (SIPI), as requested; $34,783,000 is for 
     scholarships and adult education; $2,992,000 is for special 
     higher education scholarships; $24,763,000 is for education 
     program management; $10,287,000 is for information 
     technology; and $12,201,000 is for education program 
     enhancements, which shall be supplemented by the use of 
     $2,000,000 in prior year unobligated balances.
       The Committees support efforts to revitalize and maintain 
     Native languages and expand the use of language immersion 
     programs and have provided $2,000,000 within education 
     program enhancements for capacity building grants for Bureau 
     and tribally operated schools to expand existing language 
     immersion programs or to create new programs. Prior to 
     distributing these funds, the Bureau shall coordinate with 
     the Department of Education and Department of Health and 
     Human Services to ensure that Bureau investments compliment, 
     but do not duplicate, existing language immersion programs. 
     The Committees also direct the Bureau to submit a report to 
     the Committees within 180 days of enactment of this Act 
     regarding the distribution of these funds and the status of 
     Native language classes and immersion programs offered at 
     Bureau-funded schools.
       The Johnson O'Malley program is funded at the fiscal year 
     2016 enacted level. The Committees remain concerned that the 
     distribution of funds is not an accurate reflection of the 
     distribution of students. The Bureau is directed to 
     consolidate the program reporting requirements contained in 
     the House and Senate reports and to report back to the 
     Committees within 60 days of enactment of this Act.
       The one-time increase of $5,100,000 provided in fiscal year 
     2016 to forward fund Tribal technical colleges has been 
     transferred to forward fund the Institute of American Indian 
     Arts in fiscal year 2017. The Bureau is encouraged to forward 
     fund Haskell and SIPI in future budget requests so that all 
     Tribal colleges are on the same funding schedule.
       The Committees remain concerned about recent Government 
     Accountability Office (GAO) reports detailing problems within 
     the K-12 Indian education system at the Department of the 
     Interior, in particular as they pertain to organizational 
     structure, accountability, finance, health and safety, and 
     ultimately student performance. As the Department takes steps 
     to reform the system, the Secretary is reminded that future 
     support from Congress will continue to be based in large part 
     upon successful implementation of GAO report recommendations. 
     In particular, consistent with GAO report 13-774, the 
     Secretary is urged to reorganize Indian Affairs so that 
     control and accountability of the BIE system is consolidated 
     within the BIE, to present such reorganization proposal in 
     the fiscal year 2018 budget request, and to submit to the 
     Committees a corresponding updated workforce plan. Consistent 
     with GAO testimonies 15-389T, 15-539T, 15-597T, and any 
     subsequent reports, the Secretary is urged to personally 
     oversee immediate actions necessary to ensure the continued 
     health and safety of students and employees at BIE schools 
     and facilities.
       Public Safety and Justice.--The agreement includes 
     $385,735,000 for public safety and justice programs, of 
     which: $202,000,000 is for criminal investigations and police 
     services and includes a $1,000,000 program increase to 
     implement the Native American Graves Protection and 
     Repatriation Act; $96,507,000 is for detention/corrections; 
     $10,319,000 is for law enforcement special initiatives; and 
     $30,753,000 is for Tribal courts.
       Funding for Tribal justice support is restored to 
     $17,250,000, of which not less than $10,000,000 is to address 
     the needs of Tribes affected by Public Law 83-280. The 
     Committees remain concerned about Tribal court needs as 
     identified in the Indian Law and Order Commission's November 
     2013 report, which notes Federal investment in Tribal justice 
     in ``P.L. 280'' States has been more limited than elsewhere 
     in Indian Country. The Committees expect the Bureau to work 
     with Tribes and Tribal organizations in these States to fund 
     plans that design, promote, sustain, or pilot courts systems 
     subject to jurisdiction under Public Law 83-280. The Bureau 
     is also directed to formally consult and maintain open 
     communication throughout the process with Tribes and Tribal 
     organizations on how this funding supports the technical 
     infrastructure and future Tribal court needs for these 
     jurisdictions.
       Community and Economic Development.--The agreement includes 
     $41,844,000 for community and economic development, of which: 
     $12,504,000 is for job placement and training; $25,304,000 is 
     for minerals and mining; and $2,235,000 is for community 
     development central oversight.
       Executive Direction and Administrative Services.--The 
     agreement provides $228,824,000 for executive direction and 
     administrative services, of which: $10,006,000 is for 
     Assistant Secretary Support, $2,970,000 is for safety and 
     risk management; $23,060,000 is for human capital management; 
     $23,552,000 is for intra-governmental payments. The 
     reductions from Assistant Secretary Support and human capital 
     management reflect a transfer of school-related 
     responsibilities, personnel, and budget to the Bureau of 
     Indian Education.
       Tribal Recognition.--The Committees acknowledge concerns 
     expressed by certain Tribes, States, and bipartisan members 
     of Congress regarding effects of recent changes in Tribal 
     recognition policy on standards that have been applied to new 
     applicants since 1978. Federal acknowledgement of a Tribe 
     impacts the Federal budget, other Tribes, State and local 
     jurisdictions, and individual rights. The Committees expect 
     the Administration to maintain rigorous recognition standards 
     while implementing a more transparent, efficient, and 
     workable process.


                         CONTRACT SUPPORT COSTS

       The bill provides an indefinite appropriation for contract 
     support costs, consistent with fiscal year 2016 and estimated 
     to be $278,000,000.


                              CONSTRUCTION

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

       The bill provides $192,017,000 for Construction. In 
     addition to the funding allocation table at the end of this 
     explanatory statement, the agreement includes the following 
     instructions:
       Education.--The agreement includes $133,257,000 for schools 
     and related facilities within the Bureau of Indian Education 
     system, equal to the fiscal year 2016 enacted level after 
     accounting for a one-time funding surge in 2016 to reduce the 
     backlog of critical deferred maintenance projects. The Bureau 
     is directed to submit an allocation plan to the Committees 
     for campus-wide replacement and facilities replacement within 
     30 days of enactment of this Act.
       Indian Affairs is directed to reallocate $2,000,000 from 
     prior year unobligated balances in order to accelerate 
     advance planning and design of replacement schools and school 
     facilities as proposed. Of these unobligated balances, 
     $1,000,000 shall be from the Construction Management activity 
     and $1,000,000 shall be from the General Administration 
     activity.
       The agreement does not include an authorizing provision in 
     the House bill to reconstitute the National Fund for 
     Excellence in American Indian Education. The Committees 
     continue to strongly support innovative financing options to 
     supplement annual appropriations and accelerate repair and 
     replacement of Bureau of Indian Education schools, including 
     through the use of construction bonds, tax credits, and grant 
     programs. The Department is urged to revise

[[Page H3882]]

     and resubmit its proposal to reconstitute the Fund and to 
     include authority for the Fund to facilitate public-private 
     partnership construction projects.

                                INDIANS

       The bill provides $45,045,000 for Indian Land and Water 
     Claims Settlements and Miscellaneous Payments to Indians. In 
     addition, the Bureau shall reallocate $5,916,000 in prior-
     year unobligated funds that remain after completion of 
     settlement requirements, for a total program level of 
     $50,961,000. The Department is directed to submit an 
     allocation plan for these funds to the Committees within 90 
     days of enactment of this Act.


                 INDIAN GUARANTEED LOAN PROGRAM ACCOUNT

       The bill provides $8,757,000 for the Indian Guaranteed Loan 
     Program Account to facilitate business investments in Indian 
     Country.


                       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

                    (INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)

       The bill includes a rescission of $3,400,000 from prior 
     year unobligated balances within the Operation of Indian 
     Programs account. The Bureau is directed to take the 
     rescission from no-year funds within the Executive Direction 
     and Administrative Services activity.

                        OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

     Offices, Office of the Secretary, Departmental Operations. 
     The detailed allocation of funding by program area and

     statement.
       Increases above the fiscal year 2016 enacted level within 
     the Leadership and Administration activity are outlined 
     within Senate Report 114-281 and include $225,000 as 
     requested for equipment associated with monitoring classified 
     computers and communications devices supporting the Office of 
     the Secretary and the intelligence community in light of 
     ongoing terrorist threats to national icons. Within the 
     Management Services activity, an additional $110,000 is 
     provided for law enforcement and investigative activities, 
     including combatting counterfeit activities and enforcement 
     functions related to Indian art and craftwork. The agreement 
     provides $11,000,000 for the Office of Valuation Services.

     importance of world-class scientific research conducted at 
     the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and direct the

     actions that could affect the future operation of the 
     facility.
       Energy and Minerals Programs and Management.--The 
     Committees are aware that the Department is administratively 
     addressing many of the energy-related provisions and 
     directives contained in the House and Senate bills and 
     reports with the goal of increasing responsible and 
     sustainable energy development on Federal lands, while 
     providing economic benefits to States, Tribes, communities, 
     and the economy.
       Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation.--The

     during formulation of the fiscal year 2017 President's 
     Budget, over 20 months before enactment of the appropriation. 
     This estimate was overstated because it was predicated on the 
     relevant inflation rate at the time--nearly twice the current 
     rate. Additionally, the initial estimate presumed average 
     historical prior-year payment information, which has now been 
     updated with current data from States and counties.

               TITLE II--ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

       The bill provides $8,058,488,000 for the Environmental 
     Protection Agency (EPA).
       Congressional Budget Justification.--The Agency is directed 
     to continue to include the information requested in House 
     Report 112-331 and any proposals to change State allocation 
     formulas that affect the distribution of appropriated funds 
     in future budget justifications.
       Reprogramming.--The Agency is held to the reprogramming 
     limitation of $1,000,000 and should continue to follow the 
     reprogramming directives as provided in the front of this 
     explanatory statement. It is noted that such reprogramming 
     directives apply to proposed reorganizations, workforce 
     restructure, reshaping, transfer of functions, or downsizing, 
     especially those of significant national or regional 
     importance, and include closures, consolidations, and 
     relocations of offices, facilities, and laboratories. 
     Further, the Agency may not use any amount of deobligated 
     funds to initiate a new program, office, or initiative, 
     without the prior approval of the Committees.
       Within 30 days of enactment of this Act, the Agency is 
     directed to submit to the House and Senate Committees on 
     Appropriations its annual operating plan for fiscal year 
     2017, which shall detail how the Agency plans to allocate 
     funds at the program project level.
       Other.--It is noted that the current workforce is below the 
     fiscal year 2016 level, therefore, the agreement includes 
     rescissions in the Science and Technology and Environmental 
     Programs and Management accounts that capture expected 
     savings associated with such changes. The Agency is directed 
     to first apply the rescissions across program project areas 
     to reflect routine attrition that will occur in those program 
     project areas in fiscal year 2017 and then to reflect 
     efficiency savings in a manner that seeks, to the extent 
     practicable, to be proportional among program project areas. 
     Amounts provided in this Act are sufficient to fully fund 
     Agency payroll estimates. The Committees understand that the 
     Agency routinely makes funding payroll requirements a top 
     priority, and the Committees expect the Agency will continue 
     to do so as it executes its fiscal year 2017 appropriation 
     and applies the rescissions. The Committees do not expect the 
     Agency will undertake adverse personnel actions or incentive 
     programs to comply with the rescissions. As specified in the 
     bill language, the rescissions shall not apply to the 
     Geographic Programs, the National Estuary Program, and the 
     National Priorities funding in the Science and Technology and 
     Environmental Programs and Management accounts. The Agency is 
     directed to submit, as part of the operating plan, detail on 
     the application of such rescissions at the program project 
     level.


                         SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

                    (INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)

       For Science and Technology programs, the bill provides 
     $713,823,000 to be partially offset by a $7,350,000 
     rescission for a net discretionary appropriation of 
     $706,473,000. The bill transfers $15,496,000 from the 
     Hazardous Substance Superfund account to this account. The 
     bill provides the following specific funding levels and 
     direction:
       Research: National Priorities.--The bill provides 
     $4,100,000 which shall be used for extramural research 
     grants, independent of the Science to Achieve Results (STAR) 
     grant program, to fund high-priority water quality and 
     availability research by not-for-profit organizations who 
     often partner with the Agency. Because these grants are 
     independent of the STAR grant program, the Agency should 
     strive to award grants in as large an amount as is possible 
     to achieve the most scientifically significant research. 
     Funds shall be awarded competitively with priority given to 
     partners proposing research of national scope and who provide 
     a 25 percent match. The Agency is directed to allocate funds 
     to grantees within 180 days of enactment of this Act.
       Additional Guidance.--The agreement includes the following 
     additional guidance:
       Computational Toxicology.--The Agency shall follow the 
     direction under this heading in Senate Report 114-281.
       Enhanced Aquifer Use.--The Agency shall follow the 
     direction under this heading in Senate Report 114-281.
       Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS).-- The Committees 
     are aware of efforts to implement the 2011 National Academy 
     of Science's (NAS) Chapter 7 and 2014 NAS report 
     recommendations for the IRIS program, including six specific 
     recommendations. These recommendations include objective 
     evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of critical 
     studies, the need for weight of evidence evaluation and 
     integration, and clearer rationale for selecting studies to 
     calculate toxicity values. Additionally, the NAS identified 
     specific recommendations and considerations when evaluating 
     the hazards of formaldehyde. The Committees believe that EPA 
     should contract with the NAS to conduct the peer review of 
     the revised draft IRIS assessment of formaldehyde, should it 
     be released in fiscal year 2017, to verify the 
     recommendations from the previous NAS report of 2011 have 
     been fully resolved scientifically.


                 ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS AND MANAGEMENT

                    (INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)

       For Environmental Programs and Management, the bill 
     provides $2,619,799,000 to be partially offset by a 
     $21,800,000 rescission for a net discretionary appropriation 
     of $2,597,999,000. The bill provides the following specific 
     funding levels and direction:
       Environmental Protection: National Priorities.--The bill 
     provides $12,700,000 for a competitive grant program to 
     provide technical assistance for improved water quality or 
     safe drinking water to rural and urban communities or 
     individual private well owners. The Agency is directed to 
     provide on a national or multi-State regional basis, 
     $11,000,000 for grants to qualified not-for-profit 
     organizations, including organizations authorized by Section 
     1442(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C.300j-
     1(e)(8)), for the sole purpose of providing on-site training 
     and technical assistance for water systems in rural or urban 
     communities. The Agency is also directed to provide 
     $1,700,000 for grants to qualified not-for-profit 
     organizations for technical assistance for individual private 
     well owners, with priority given to organizations that 
     currently provide technical and educational assistance to 
     individual private well owners. The Agency shall require each 
     grantee to provide a minimum 10 percent match, including in-
     kind contributions. The Agency is directed to allocate funds 
     to grantees within 180 days of enactment of this Act.
       Geographic Programs.--The bill provides $435,857,000, as 
     distributed in the table at the end of this division, and 
     includes the following direction:
       Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.--The bill provides 
     $300,000,000 and the Agency shall continue to follow the 
     direction as provided in House Report 112-589. In addition, 
     as EPA distributes funds across the five focus areas, Tribal 
     related activities shall be maintained at not less than the 
     fiscal year 2016 level.
       Chesapeake Bay.--The bill provides $73,000,000 and the 
     Agency shall allocate funds consistent with the direction 
     under this heading in Senate Report 114-281.
       Water: Ecosystems.--The agreement includes $47,788,000. The 
     Committees recognize that Public Law 114-161 created a 
     competitive grant program to help prioritize challenging 
     issues within estuaries. Passage of this law occurred after 
     the Agency's budget submission. After the Agency provides 
     $600,000 to each of the 28 national estuaries in the program, 
     the Committees urge the Agency to fund a competitive grant 
     program using available resources, and consistent with House 
     report 114-632. In addition, the Committees direct EPA to use 
     the funds provided to accelerate the processing of mining 
     permits with the Corps of Engineers. Further, the Committees 
     direct EPA, in consultation with the Corps of Engineers, to 
     continue to report monthly on the number of Section 404 
     permits under EPA's review, consistent with the direction 
     under this heading in House Report 114-170.
       Additional Guidance.--The agreement includes the following 
     additional guidance:
       Accidental Release Prevention Requirements.--The Committees 
     note that EPA has postponed the effective date for 
     implementation by 90 days as it reviews and reevaluates the 
     rule. The Committees expect EPA to work with State 
     regulators, facility managers, small businesses, and other 
     stakeholders as it reevaluates the rule.
       Agricultural Operations.--The Committees note that Congress 
     never intended the Solid Waste Disposal Act to govern animal 
     or crop waste, manure, or fertilizer, or constituents derived 
     from such sources. The Agency's longstanding regulations 
     accurately reflect Congress' intent not to regulate manure 
     and crop residues under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, and the 
     Committees support legislative efforts to clarify and codify 
     the treatment of agricultural byproducts under the Solid 
     Waste Disposal Act.
       Clean Air Act Economic Analysis.--The Committees note that 
     Section 321(a) of the Clean Air Act states that the EPA 
     ``shall conduct continuing evaluations of potential loss or 
     shifts of employment''. On October 17, 2016, a Federal 
     district court opinion found that the Agency has a non-
     discretionary duty to compile such evaluations, and ordered 
     the Agency to develop a plan for compliance. In January 2017, 
     the Federal district court directed the EPA to develop an 
     economic analysis of the effects of regulations on the coal 
     mining and power generation industries by July 1, 2017. EPA 
     has also been directed to demonstrate by the end of the year 
     that it has measures in place to monitor employment shift as 
     a result of its regulations. The Committees expect the Agency 
     will keep the Committees apprised of progress to comply with 
     the recent court orders.
       Coal Combustion Residuals.--Section 2301 of the WIIN Act 
     (P.L. 114-322) amended the Solid Waste Disposal Act to 
     authorize the Agency to review and approve, as appropriate, 
     State programs for permits or other systems of prior approval 
     and conditions under State law for the regulation of coal 
     combustion residuals. To expedite the process for reviewing 
     and approving such State

[[Page H3884]]

     programs, the Agency should establish, as expeditiously as is 
     practicable, streamlined procedures for prompt approval of 
     those State programs.
       Combined Sewer Overflows.--Senate Report 114-281 included 
     language directing the EPA to report to Congress, within 60 
     days of enactment of this Act, the plan and timeline for the 
     implementation of public notice requirements for treatment 
     works discharging sewage into the Great Lakes as required by 
     the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. The Committees 
     remind the Agency that the bill language in the Consolidated 
     Appropriations Act, 2016, specifically defined the term 
     ``Great Lakes'' for purpose of the public notice 
     requirements. Additionally, the Committees note that the bill 
     language did not require immediate public notice. As such, 
     the Committees recommend the Agency give utilities 
     flexibility to ensure that the ratepayers are not severely 
     impacted by the cost of implementing this public notice 
     requirement.
       Ecolabels for Federal Procurement.--The agreement includes 
     the direction in Senate Report 114-281 to provide a report on 
     the Agency's Ecolabel program within 60 days of enactment of 
     this Act. The Committees are aware that the Agency has been 
     developing guidelines to evaluate ecolabels that are used in 
     Federal purchasing for building construction and other uses 
     and recommend that any process be fair, transparent, and 
     consistent with other product requirements.
       Exempt Aquifers.--The Committees are aware that EPA has 
     received and will be receiving exempt aquifer applications 
     from the State of California for processing and approval. The 
     Committees continue to support protecting underground sources 
     of drinking water and promoting robust economic development. 
     Accordingly, the Committees continue to urge EPA to work 
     expeditiously to process exempt aquifer applications and use 
     the existing regulatory framework to process these 
     applications as provided in House Report 114-170 and House 
     Report 114-632.
       Integrated Planning.--The Committees strongly support 
     efforts to use an integrated planning approach to help 
     municipalities meet Clean Water Act obligations. The 
     Committees urge the Agency to work with communities in fiscal 
     year 2017 to develop elements of integrated plans for 
     municipal wastewater and stormwater management.
       Lead Test Kit.--The Committees reiterate support for 
     activities that result in safe and proper reduction of lead 
     paint in homes and the protection of sensitive populations. 
     Such support along with concerns about implementation 
     challenges were expressed in House Report 114-632 and Senate 
     Report 114-281. Consistent with the concerns outlined in the 
     Committee reports, EPA should identify options to remedy 
     implementation challenges that have persisted since 2009.
       National Ambient Air Quality Standards.--Concerns remain 
     about potentially overlapping implementation schedules 
     related to the 2008 and 2015 standards for ground-level 
     ozone. Because the Agency did not publish implementing 
     regulations for the 2008 standard of 75 parts per billion 
     [ppb] until February 2015, and then revised the standard to 
     70 ppb in October 2015, States now face the prospect of 
     implementing two national ambient air quality standards for 
     ozone simultaneously. It is likely that, based on Agency 
     data, a number of counties will be in non-attainment with 
     both the 2008 standard and the 2015 standard. Additionally, 
     Agency data suggests that a number of marginal non-attainment 
     counties will meet the 2015 standard by 2025 due to other air 
     regulations. In an effort to find the most sensible path to 
     reduce ground level ozone, some flexibility must be granted 
     to States that face the burden of implementing these 
     potentially overlapping standards. Within 90 days of the date 
     of enactment of this Act, the Agency is directed to provide 
     the Committees with a report examining the potential for 
     administrative options to enable States to enter into 
     cooperative agreements with the Agency that provide 
     regulatory relief and meaningfully clean up the air.
       Pesticides Registration Improvement Act.--In addition to 
     the direction under this heading in Senate Report 114-281,--
     the Agency is directed to provide the Committees with a 
     quarterly report detailing the amount of previously collected 
     maintenance fees that are currently unavailable for 
     obligation.
       Science Advisory Board.--Regarding language under both the 
     Science and Technology account and the Environmental Programs 
     and Management account, the Committees are aware that EPA did 
     not fulfill the fiscal year 2016 directive to provide updated 
     policy statements to GAO for review.
       Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) Program.--The 
     Committees reiterate the concern expressed in Senate Report 
     114-281 with respect to the proposed timeframes for 
     delistings. Historical experience indicates that 
     manufacturers often need several years to modify 
     manufacturing processes in order to transition between new 
     materials. Since EPA's deadlines are not driven by statutory 
     mandates, additional transition time is allowable, and 
     warranted, in order to avoid unintended consequences. To 
     allow manufacturers to fully integrate new chemicals into 
     their product lines following rigorous efficacy and safety 
     testing, EPA is directed to consider harmonizing the status 
     of any previously approved refrigerant or foam-blowing agent 
     with other domestic and international programs for 
     refrigeration and commercial air conditioning applications, 
     and corresponding deadlines for military, space- and 
     aeronautics-related applications.
       Small and Art Glass Manufacturers.--The Committees note 
     there are significant concerns in the small and art glass 
     manufacturing industry over potential changes to the 
     definitions and standards for National Emission Standards for 
     Hazardous Air Pollutants requirements. The Committees 
     recommend that the Agency maintain current thresholds and 
     definitions particularly related to operators that produce 
     less than 50 tons per year or use non-continuous furnaces in 
     their operations.
       Small Refinery Relief.--The agreement includes the 
     directive contained in Senate Report 114-281 related to small 
     refinery relief.
       Spill Prevention Requirements.--The WIIN Act (P.L. 114-322) 
     modified the applicability of EPA's Spill Prevention, Control 
     and Countermeasure regulations with respect to smaller 
     containers on farms. The Committees urge EPA to continue to 
     explore options for additional flexibilities for farmers and 
     ranchers subject to the rule.
       Toxic Substances Control Act Modernization.--The agreement 
     includes bill language that will enable the EPA to collect 
     and spend new fees to conduct additional chemical reviews, as 
     authorized by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 
     21st Century Act (P.L. 114-182). Since collections will begin 
     partway through the year, the Congressional Budget Office 
     estimates that fee collections will total $3,000,000 for 
     fiscal year 2017 and are estimated to increase to $25,000,000 
     per year once the program is fully implemented. Finally, this 
     bill includes language ensuring that new fee collections will 
     supplement, not supplant, appropriated resources for these 
     activities.
       Uranium.--The Committees note that EPA has decided to re-
     propose the Part 192 rule and solicit additional public 
     comment. As the Agency works through the public comment 
     process, the Committees encourage EPA to work with State 
     regulators, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the 
     uranium recovery industry to collect sufficient data to 
     determine if any updates are needed to the existing generally 
     applicable standards.
       Worker Protection Standards.--The Committees note that the 
     process for developing and providing guidance, educational 
     materials, and training resources to the States has not 
     followed the schedule originally envisioned in the rule. 
     Accordingly, the Agency has received petitions requesting 
     extensions of implementation dates until January 2018 that 
     would allow for a smoother transition to new requirements. 
     The Agency should consider extending implementation deadlines 
     until 2018, and whether further engagement with stakeholders 
     regarding implementation issues would be beneficial.


            HAZARDOUS WASTE ELECTRONIC MANIFEST SYSTEM FUND

       The bill provides $3,178,000 for the Hazardous Waste 
     Electronic Manifest System Fund.


                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

       The bill provides $41,489,000 for the Office of Inspector 
     General.


                        BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES

       The bill provides $34,467,000 for Buildings and Facilities.


                     HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE SUPERFUND

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

       The bill provides $1,088,769,000 for the Hazardous 
     Substance Superfund account and includes bill language to 
     transfer $8,778,000 to the Office of Inspector General 
     account and $15,496,000 to the Science and Technology 
     account. The bill provides the following additional 
     direction:
       Financial Assurance.--The Committees are aware of concerns 
     raised by States, stakeholders, and the Small Business 
     Administration's Office of Advocacy regarding the Agency's 
     proposed rule on financial assurance for hardrock mining. The 
     Agency has extended the comment period on the proposed rule 
     for hardrock mining until July 11, 2017. It is expected that 
     the Agency will take those comments into account in 
     recommending its course of action to finalize the rule.

       Sediment Guidance.--The Committees note that the Agency 
     completed a report on sediment guidance in February 2017. The 
     Committees urge the Agency to ensure compliance with the 
     Agency's Contaminated Sediment Guidance.


          LEAKING UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK TRUST FUND PROGRAM

       The bill provides $91,941,000 for the Leaking Underground 
     Storage Tank Trust Fund Program.


                       INLAND OIL SPILL PROGRAMS

       The bill provides $18,209,000 for Inland Oil Spill 
     Programs.


                   STATE AND TRIBAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS

       The bill provides $3,527,161,000 for the State and Tribal 
     Assistance Grants program and includes the following specific 
     funding levels and direction:
       Targeted Airshed Grants.--The bill provides $30,000,000 for 
     targeted airshed grants to reduce air pollution in non-
     attainment areas. These grants shall be distributed on a 
     competitive basis to non-attainment areas that EPA determines 
     are ranked as the top five most polluted areas relative to 
     annual ozone or particulate matter 2.5 standards as well as 
     the top five areas based on the 24-hour particulate matter 
     2.5 standard where the design values exceed the 35 mg/
     m3 standard. To determine these areas, the Agency 
     shall use

[[Page H3885]]

     the most recent design values calculated from validated air 
     quality data. The Committees note that these funds are 
     available for emission reduction activities deemed necessary 
     for compliance with national ambient air quality standards 
     and included in a State Implementation Plan submitted to EPA. 
     Not later than the end of fiscal year 2017, EPA should 
     provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations that 
     includes a table showing how fiscal year 2016 and 2017 funds 
     were allocated. The table should also include grant 
     recipients and metrics for anticipated or actual results.
       Animas River Spill.--The Gold King Mine spill into the 
     Animas River significantly impacted areas in New Mexico, 
     Colorado, Arizona, Utah, and the Navajo Nation. As authorized 
     by P.L. 114-322, the bill provides $4,000,000 for a long-term 
     water quality monitoring program, and EPA is directed to 
     continue to work in consultation with affected States and 
     Tribes on that effort. The Agency is strongly encouraged to 
     follow the requirements detailed in House report 114-632 
     regarding the temporary water treatment plant and in Senate 
     Report 114-281 regarding reimbursements for State, local and 
     Tribal costs related to the spill. Finally, a recent legal 
     decision has left many stakeholders concerned that they will 
     not be compensated for property damage, business losses, and 
     other negative financial impacts. EPA should further explore 
     all legal and financial recourses that could compensate 
     individuals for such damages and, if available, should ensure 
     that recourses will be extended to individuals located in all 
     areas impacted by the spill in New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, 
     Utah, and the Navajo Nation. The Agency is required to report 
     to the Committees within 60 days of enactment of this Act on 
     the details and timeline for such efforts, including plans 
     for stakeholder engagement in all areas affected by the 
     spill.
       Categorical Grants.--The bill provides $1,066,041,000 for 
     Categorical Grants and funding levels are specified in the 
     table at the end of this division. The Agency shall allocate 
     radon grants in fiscal year 2017 following the direction in 
     House Report 114-632. The amount also includes $228,219,000 
     for the State and Local Air Quality Management grant program, 
     and the Agency is directed to allocate funds for this program 
     using the same formula as fiscal year 2015. The Committees 
     understand the Office of Air and Radiation was able to 
     provide some additional funds to the States in fiscal year 
     2016 using balances. The Committees encourage the Agency to 
     do the same in fiscal year 2017 and to provide those 
     additional funds to the regions with the highest need.
       Use of Iron and Steel.--The bill includes language in Title 
     IV General Provisions that stipulates requirements for the 
     use of iron and steel in State Revolving Fund projects, and 
     the agreement includes only the following guidance. The 
     Committees acknowledge that EPA may issue a waiver of said 
     requirements for de minimis amounts of iron and steel 
     building materials. The Committees emphasize that any coating 
     processes that are applied to the external surface of iron 
     and steel components that otherwise qualify under the 
     procurement preference shall not render such products 
     ineligible for the procurement preference regardless of where 
     the coating processes occur, provided that final assembly of 
     the products occurs in the United States.


      WATER INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE AND INNOVATION PROGRAM ACCOUNT

       This bill provides an additional $10,000,000 for the WIFIA 
     program. When combined with funds provided under Sec. 197 of 
     P.L. 114-254, the WIFIA program is funded at a total 
     $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2017, which has the ability to be 
     leveraged for a total of $3,049,000,000 in loans. Of the 
     amounts provided in this bill and in P.L. 114-254, EPA may 
     use up to $5,000,000 for administrative expenses to 
     administer the program and issue loans. The Committees note 
     that $2,200,000 had previously been provided in other 
     accounts for staffing and administrative needs in order to 
     establish the program. The agreement concurs with the budget 
     consolidation of those resources into this new account.


 ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS--ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (INCLUDING 
                   TRANSFERS AND RESCISSION OF FUNDS)

       The bill continues several administrative provisions from 
     previous years.
       Rescission.--The bill rescinds $61,198,000 of unobligated 
     balances from the State and Tribal Assistance Grants account. 
     The Agency shall calculate the requisite percent reduction 
     necessary to rescind such amounts from new obligational 
     authority and apply it across program areas by formula. The 
     Agency is directed to submit, as part of the operating plan, 
     detail on the application of such rescissions by program 
     project area.

                      TITLE III--RELATED AGENCIES

                       Department of Agriculture


                             FOREST SERVICE

       Forest Service Directives.--The Forest Service is reminded 
     of the importance of the directives included in House Report 
     114-632 and Senate Report 114-281 not addressed herein, as 
     well as the new directives in this statement, including the 
     front matter. The Service is expected to provide the research 
     report, as required by the House report, within 30 days of 
     enactment of this Act.
       Forest Service Accounting, Budgeting, and Management.--The 
     agreement includes bill language and directives to increase 
     transparency and confidence in the Service's management of 
     its programs and activities.
       The agreement includes a new administrative provision 
     requiring the Service to report within 30 days after the 
     close of each quarter, through the Office of Budget and 
     Program Analysis, its current and prior year unobligated 
     balances to the House and Senate Committees on 
     Appropriations. The Service is directed to provide this 
     report for all mandatory and discretionary funds, including 
     receipts and permanent appropriations, as well as funds 
     subject to notification requirements and transfers of 
     unobligated balances.
       Although the agreement does not include reprogramming 
     guidelines in bill language, as proposed by the House, the 
     Committees expect the Service to follow the letter and spirit 
     of the reprogramming requirements in this explanatory 
     statement and direct the Service to submit requests through 
     the Office of Budget and Program Analysis.
       The agreement assigns fiscal-year limits to certain Forest 
     Service accounts. This modification will require funds to be 
     tracked by year, budget line item, and account, and encourage 
     the Service to expeditiously award contracts, settle 
     reimbursable agreements, and conduct forest management 
     activities. The agreement also establishes a non-recurring 
     expenses account that will allow certain unobligated funds to 
     be captured and used for fuel reduction and post-fire 
     rehabilitation purposes. The Committees believe that fiscal-
     year limits will not impede the Service's ability to 
     effectively fight wildfire or meet wildfire obligations 
     relating to agreements with Federal, State, or other 
     partners.
       To further support the Service's efforts in centralizing 
     and standardizing budgeting and accounting practices among 
     the Regions and program offices, the Service is directed to 
     improve and better manage its procurement and financial 
     management processes to ensure funds are spent in an 
     appropriate and timely manner. The Service should also make 
     certain that sufficient internal controls are in place to 
     ensure that unliquidated obligations are consistently and 
     systematically evaluated for validity, and that unliquidated 
     obligations found unnecessary are promptly adjusted to make 
     funds available for authorized purposes.
       According to the information provided as required by Senate 
     Reports 114-82 and 114-70, the Service has significantly 
     higher costs of printing for public distribution compared to 
     other Department of Agriculture agencies. The Service is 
     directed to update the information provided in the report to 
     the Committees within 30 days of enactment of this Act, and 
     to significantly reduce its printing expenditures.


                     FOREST AND RANGELAND RESEARCH

       The agreement provides $288,514,000 for Forest and 
     Rangeland Research, including $77,000,000 for Forest 
     Inventory and Analysis.
       Forest Products Laboratory.--Of the funds available to the 
     Forest Products Laboratory, no less than $1,000,000 is to 
     sustain funding with existing academic partners focused on 
     research and technology development to create new and 
     expanded markets and to advance high-value, high-volume wood 
     markets from restorative actions on the Nation's public and 
     private forests.
       Joint Fire Science Research.--The agreement accepts the 
     proposal to shift the Joint Fire Science Research program 
     into the Forest and Rangeland Research account and provides 
     no less than $3,000,000 for the program.
       Forest Research Priorities.--The Committees are concerned 
     that the research program is not well aligned with the needs 
     of the National Forest System. When assessing the value of 
     new proposals, significant weight should be given to projects 
     whose findings could be incorporated into management and 
     decision-making.


                       STATE AND PRIVATE FORESTRY

                    (INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)

       The agreement provides $216,921,000 for State and Private 
     Forestry. The following directions are also provided:
       Federal and Cooperative Lands.--The Committees understand 
     the Service has obligated $5,000,000 in prior year balances 
     to address the forest health crisis in Region 5.
       Forest Legacy.--The bill provides $62,347,000 for the 
     Forest Legacy program. This includes $6,400,000 for program 
     administration and $55,947,000 for projects. The Service 
     should fund projects in priority order according to the 
     competitively selected national priority list submitted by 
     the Forest Service as part of its fiscal year 2017 budget 
     request. In lieu of the direction included in the House 
     report, the Committees expect the Forest Service to prudently 
     track unobligated and deobligated balances and to provide the 
     Committees with prompt notification of such changes to avoid 
     accumulating large balances within the Forest Legacy account. 
     The Committees include a rescission of $12,002,000 in Forest 
     Legacy funds. This funding rescission is from cost savings of 
     some projects and funds returned from failed or partially 
     failed projects.


                         NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

       The agreement provides $1,513,318,000 for the National 
     Forest System. The following directions are also provided:
       The agreement accepts the proposal to consolidate the Land 
     Management Planning and Inventory and Monitoring accounts 
     into a Land Management Planning, Assessment, and Monitoring 
     account.
       Integrated Resource Restoration (IRR).--The agreement 
     continues the IRR pilot in Regions 1, 3, and 4, as proposed 
     by the Senate.

[[Page H3886]]

     The Service is directed to require standardized, integrated 
     planning and budgeting for all of its programs, projects, and 
     activities in order to improve priority-setting and 
     cooperation, and to continue to improve its integrated 
     performance measures.
       Rangeland Management.--The Service is directed, to the 
     greatest extent practicable, to make vacant grazing 
     allotments available to a holder of a grazing permit or lease 
     when lands covered by the holder of the permit or lease are 
     unusable because of drought or wildfire.
       Forest Products.--The additional funds provided for forest 
     products are directed to be used to build the timber program 
     capacity by facilitating the necessary planning work and the 
     hiring and training of timber management personnel to deliver 
     increased volume levels.
       Forest Product Outputs.--The Service is directed to include 
     information on the amount of firewood removed for personal 
     use in its reports on the forest products program.
       Recreation, Heritage and Wilderness.--The agreement 
     provides $264,595,000 for recreation, heritage and 
     wilderness. Of the funds provided for recreation management, 
     $750,000 shall be for the maintenance of rural airstrips.
       Minerals and Geology Management.--The Committees understand 
     that the Service has obligated $5,500,000 in prior year 
     balances to address the Service's cleanup liabilities, 
     pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
     Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, associated with 
     historic uranium mining at the Ross-Adams Mine Site on Bokan 
     Mountain.
       Bighorn and Domestic Sheep.--The Committees direct the 
     Forest Service to continue the quantitative, science-based 
     analyses of the risk of disease transmission between domestic 
     and bighorn sheep required in the fiscal year 2016 
     explanatory statement.


                  CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

       The agreement provides $364,014,000 for Capital Improvement 
     and Maintenance programs offset by a $16,000,000 scoring 
     credit related to the road and trail fund.


                            LAND ACQUISITION

       The agreement provides $54,415,000 for Land Acquisition. 
     The amounts recommended by this bill compared with the budget 
     estimates by activity and project are shown in the table 
     below, listed in priority order pursuant to the budget 
     request for fiscal year 2017. The Committees have provided 
     additional funding for the updated appraisal of projects, as 
     requested, for the fiscal year 2017 project list. The Service 
     is expected to use the Critical Inholdings/Wilderness account 
     to acquire high priority lands, such as wilderness and lands 
     of significant value in designated conservation units, to 
     consolidate Federal ownership. Further instructions are 
     contained under the Land and Water Conservation Fund heading 
     in the front of this explanatory statement.
       The Committees continue to encourage the Forest Service to 
     explore all funding avenues to resolve the long-standing 
     management challenges related to school trust lands within 
     the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Superior National Forest.

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

       The agreement provides $342,000,000 for the FLAME Wildfire 
     Suppression Reserve Fund, which is designated as emergency 
     spending.


                DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

                         INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE

                         INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES

       The agreement provides $3,694,462,000 for Indian Health 
     Services. In addition to the funding allocation table at the 
     end of this explanatory statement, the agreement includes 
     specified fixed costs and transfers, as well as the following 
     instructions and program changes to fiscal year 2016 enacted 
     levels. The Service is also reminded of the guidance and 
     reporting requirements contained in House Report 114-632 and 
     Senate Report 114-281 that should be complied with unless 
     specifically addressed to the contrary herein, as explained 
     in the front matter of this explanatory statement.
       Current Services.--The agreement includes $50,269,000 to 
     partially maintain current levels of service, of which 
     $13,164,000 is for pay costs and $37,105,000 is for 
     inflation. Except as otherwise provided, the agreement 
     includes an increase equal to 50 percent of pay and inflation 
     costs requested in the fiscal year 2017 President's Budget 
     for each program to cover the balance of the fiscal year 
     remaining.
       Staffing for New Facilities.--The agreement includes 
     $14,323,000 for staffing newly opened health facilities, 
     which is the full amount based upon updated estimates 
     provided to the Committees. Funds for the staffing of new 
     facilities are limited to facilities funded through the 
     Health Care Facilities Construction Priority System or the 
     Joint Venture Construction Program that have opened in fiscal 
     year 2016 or will open in fiscal year 2017. None of these 
     funds may be allocated to a facility until such facility has 
     achieved beneficial occupancy status.
       Accreditation Emergencies.--The Committees consider the 
     loss or potential loss of a Medicare or Medicaid agreement 
     with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) at 
     any facility to be an accreditation emergency. The agreement 
     includes a total of $29,000,000 for accreditation emergencies 
     at an alarming number of facilities over the past year. Funds 
     may be used for personnel or other expenses essential for 
     sustaining operations of an affected service unit, including 
     but not to exceed $4,000,000 for Purchased/Referred Care. 
     These are not intended to be recurring base funds. The 
     Director should reallocate the funds annually as necessary to 
     ensure that agreements with CMS are reinstated, and to 
     restore third-party collection shortfalls. Shortfalls should 
     be calculated as described in the House report.
       Hospitals and Health Clinics.--The agreement includes: 
     $4,000,000 as requested for domestic violence prevention; a 
     total of $11,000,000 for operations and maintenance of 
     tribally leased clinics, of which $2,000,000 is transferred 
     from Direct Operations; $1,000,000 for prescription drug 
     monitoring as described in the House report; and $29,000,000 
     for accreditation emergencies as discussed above, of which 
     $2,000,000 is transferred from Direct Operations, as 
     requested.
       Dental Health.--The agreement includes $3,914,000 for 
     current services and a transfer of $800,000 to Direct 
     Operations in order to

[[Page H3887]]

     backfill vacant dental health positions in headquarters. The 
     Service is urged to establish a centralized credentialing 
     system.
       Mental Health.--The agreement includes $6,946,000 for 
     behavioral health integration and $3,600,000 for the zero 
     suicide initiative.
       Alcohol and Substance Abuse.--The agreement includes: 
     $6,500,000 for the Generation Indigenous initiative; 
     $1,800,000 for the youth pilot project; and $2,000,000 to 
     fund essential detoxification and related services provided 
     by the Service's public and private partners to IHS 
     beneficiaries.
       The Committees are aware that the community of Gallup, 
     N.M., continues to face significant demand for substance 
     abuse treatment, residential services and detoxification 
     services to address an ongoing crisis of alcohol-related 
     deaths of Tribal members, and continues to depend on the non-
     profit Na' Nizhoozhi Center to provide an important safety 
     net to help prevent these deaths. Consistent with the 
     guidance in Senate Report 114-281, the Committees expect the 
     Service to use funds provided in this Act to continue its 
     partnership with the Center and to work with the Center and 
     other Federal, State, local, and Tribal partners to develop a 
     sustainable model for the Center to enhance its clinical 
     capacity.
       Purchased/Referred Care.--The agreement includes 
     $14,691,000 for current services. The agreement does not 
     include the directive in the House report regarding the 
     allocation of funds.
       Immunization.--The agreement includes $91,000 for current 
     services.
       Urban Indian Health.--The agreement includes $1,800,000 for 
     current services and a $1,137,000 program increase.
       Indian Health Professions.--The agreement includes a 
     $500,000 program increase. The agreement does not include the 
     House report language pertaining to the definition of health 
     profession; instead the Service is urged to consider making 
     health administrators a higher priority for loan repayments, 
     in consultation with Tribes.
       Direct Operations.--The agreement includes $1,282,000 for 
     current services, and transfers as discussed above.
       Governing Board.--The agreement does not include the House 
     provision authorizing a pilot program for an alternate 
     governing board model at direct service facilities. The 
     accreditation crisis in the Great Plains and the subsequent 
     House provision have highlighted the need for IHS facilities 
     to be significantly more inclusive of Tribes in the decision-
     making process. The Committees are encouraged by the IHS's 
     own recent initiative to reform its governing boards, but 
     reforms are limited under existing statutes. The Committees 
     are aware that the authorizing committees of jurisdiction are 
     examining this issue and support these efforts to improve the 
     communication and collaboration between the IHS and Tribes at 
     direct service facilities.


                         CONTRACT SUPPORT COSTS

       The bill provides an indefinite appropriation for contract 
     support costs, consistent with fiscal year 2016 and estimated 
     to be $800,000,000.


                        INDIAN HEALTH FACILITIES

       The agreement provides $545,424,000 for Indian Health 
     Facilities. In addition to the funding allocation table at 
     the end of this explanatory statement, the agreement includes 
     the following details and changes relative to fiscal year 
     2016 enacted levels:
       Current Services.--The agreement includes $9,274,000 to 
     partially maintain current levels of service, of which 
     $1,220,000 is for pay costs and $8,054,000 is for inflation. 
     Except as otherwise provided, the agreement includes an 
     increase equal to 50 percent of pay and inflation costs 
     requested in the fiscal year 2017 President's Budget for each 
     program to cover the balance of the fiscal year remaining.
       Staffing for New Facilities.--The agreement includes 
     $1,659,000 for staffing newly opened health facilities, which 
     is the full amount based upon updated estimates provided to 
     the Committees. The stipulations included in the ``Indian 
     Health Services'' account regarding the allocation of funds 
     pertain to this account as well.
       Maintenance and Improvement.--The agreement fully funds 
     inflation costs and provides a program increase of $259,000 
     to reduce the maintenance backlog.
       Sanitation Facilities.--The agreement fully funds inflation 
     costs.
       Health Care Facilities Construction.--The agreement 
     includes $6,000,000 for quarters and $5,000,000 for small 
     ambulatory facilities. The committees encourage the Service 
     to give strong consideration to utilizing the new resources 
     provided for the small ambulatory clinic program to assist 
     with infrastructure improvements at remote sites such as 
     Gambell and Savoonga on St. Lawrence Island, Alaska.
       The Committees remain dedicated to providing access to 
     health care for IHS patients across the system. The IHS is 
     expected to aggressively work down the current Health 
     Facilities Construction Priority System list, as well as work 
     with the Department and Tribes to examine alternative 
     financing arrangements and meritorious regional demonstration 
     projects authorized under the Indian Health Care Improvement 
     Act that that would effectively close the service gap. Within 
     60 days of enactment of this Act, the Service shall submit a 
     spending plan to the Committees that details the project-
     level distribution of funds provided for healthcare 
     facilities construction.
       The IHS has no defined benefit package and is not designed 
     to be comparable to the private sector health care system. 
     IHS does not provide the same health services in each area. 
     Health services provided to a community depend upon the 
     facilities and services available in the local area, the 
     facilities' financial and personnel resources (42 CFR 136.11 
     (c)), and the needs of the service population. In order to 
     determine whether IHS patients across the system have 
     comparable access to healthcare, the IHS is directed to 
     conduct and publish a gap analysis of the locations and 
     capacities of patient health facilities relative to the IHS 
     user population. The analysis should include: facilities 
     within the IHS system, including facilities on the Health 
     Facilities Construction Priority System list and the Joint 
     Venture Construction Program list; and where possible 
     facilities within private or other Federal health systems for 
     which arrangements with IHS exist, or should exist, to see 
     IHS patients.


                     NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH

          NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES

       The agreement provides $77,349,000 for the National

            TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH

       The agreement provides $74,691,000 for the Agency for Toxic

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

       The agreement provides $11,000,000 for the Chemical Safety 
     and Hazard Investigation Board and includes the direction in 
     the House report that funding has not been provided for 
     organizing an annual symposium. The Board is directed to 
     develop internal guidance over its annual budget process and 
     provide it to the Committees within 90 days of enactment of 
     this Act. Additionally, the Board is directed to provide a 
     report and briefing to the Committees dealing with the scope 
     of and justification for a study on land use and facility 
     siting prior to expending any funds on the study.
       The Committees remind the Board they are to avoid any 
     communication with outside groups that would jeopardize their 
     impartiality.-- The Committees continue to closely monitor 
     Inspector General reports on Board activities and expect 
     expeditious implementation of any recommendations on internal 
     controls, governance, operations, and management challenges. 
     The Board should focus on its statutory jurisdiction and 
     refrain from conducting official business over personal 
     email.


              OFFICE OF NAVAJO AND HOPI INDIAN RELOCATION

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

       The agreement provides $15,431,000 for the Office of Navajo 
     and Hopi Indian Relocation, as requested. The Committees have 
     directed the Office to begin to communicate with Congress, 
     the affected Tribes, and the Department of the Interior about 
     what will be required to ensure relocation benefits and 
     necessary support services are provided in accordance with 
     the specifications in Public Law 93-531 and to initiate 
     closure of the Office. The Committees request continuation of 
     the quarterly reports and a comprehensive plan for closing 
     the Office, as outlined in the House report. The 
     comprehensive plan is to be submitted with the fiscal year 
     2018 budget request. Legal analysis on whether any enacting 
     legislation is required to transfer or maintain any 
     identified functions to another agency or organization should 
     also be included. The Office should be transparent about the 
     path forward and should actively consult with all affected 
     parties and agencies.


         INSTITUTE OF AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE CULTURE

                          AND ARTS DEVELOPMENT

                        PAYMENT TO THE INSTITUTE

       The bill provides $15,212,000 for the Institute of American 
     Indian Arts. The increase provided shall be used to complete 
     the Institute's transition to forward funding during fiscal 
     year 2017. Amounts provided for fiscal year 2017 shall be 
     supplemented by $2,000,000 in prior-year carryover funds, for 
     a total operating level of $9,835,000. Requested increases 
     for fixed costs and academic program requirements are 
     included within the agreement.

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

       The agreement provides a total of $863,347,000 for all 
     Smithsonian Institution accounts, of which $729,444,000 is 
     provided for salaries and expenses. The Committees maintain 
     their longstanding commitment to the preservation of 
     priceless, irreplaceable Smithsonian collections and have 
     provided funds as requested for collections care and 
     preservation. The recommendation provides sufficient funds 
     for staffing and maintenance needs at the National Museum of 
     African

[[Page H3888]]

     American History and Culture in 2017. The Committees have 
     provided funds, as requested, to address security needs at 
     the Smithsonian's highest risk facilities. The Committees 
     provide funds as requested for the Institution's Latino 
     initiatives and support the Smithsonian Latino Center's goal 
     of promoting the inclusion of Latino contributions in 
     Smithsonian Institution programs, exhibitions, collections, 
     and public outreach. The Committees continue to urge 
     collaboration between the Smithsonian Latino Center and 
     appropriate Federal and local organizations in order to 
     advance these goals and expand the American Latino presence 
     at the Institution. Further, the Committees provide funds as 
     requested for the Institution's Asian Pacific American 
     initiatives and continue to support the Institution's efforts 
     of developing programs and expanding outreach to promote a 
     better understanding of the Asian Pacific American 
     experience. The Committees also include funds as requested 
     for the preservation of cultural heritage affected by natural 
     and manmade disasters in the United States and around the 
     world. The recommendation supplements funding from other 
     government partners and leverages support for cultural 
     recovery efforts from numerous private sources.


                           FACILITIES CAPITAL

       The agreement provides $133,903,000 for the Facilities 
     Capital account. The recommendation includes funding for the 
     construction of the Dulles Storage Module at the National Air 
     and Space Museum's Udvar-Hazy Center.
       National Air and Space Museum Revitalization. The 
     Committees recognize the critical need to replace the facade 
     and the internal building systems of the National Air and 
     Space Museum on the National Mall.-- However, the Committees 
     are also deeply concerned that the multi-year cost estimates 
     for the revitalization project in future fiscal years are 
     approaching $700 million, an amount nearly five times the 
     size of the Institution's entire annual construction budget. 
     Given the scale of the project and its potential impact on 
     other critical funding priorities in this Act, it is 
     imperative that the Institution make available to the 
     Committees on a timely basis the most updated and 
     comprehensive information on project requirements. It is 
     essential that the Committees have sufficient, reliable 
     information about specific funding requirements and any 
     additional costs that may arise in future fiscal years. 
     Therefore, no later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, 
     the Institution is directed to provide a report to the 
     Committees that outlines the expected scope, scheduling, 
     phasing, and overall projected costs for the project. The 
     Government Accountability Office is also directed to review 
     and analyze the Institution's cost estimates and report to 
     the Committees on whether these estimates are comprehensive, 
     accurate, and credible.
       The Institution is directed to submit to the House and 
     Senate Committees on Appropriations, within 60 days of 
     enactment of this Act, a detailed list and description of 
     projects funded within the Facilities Capital account.

     Maintenance account.


                     CAPITAL REPAIR AND RESTORATION

     and Restoration account.


            WOODROW WILSON INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR SCHOLARS

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

       The agreement provides $10,500,000 for the Woodrow Wilson 
     International Center for Scholars.


           NATIONAL FOUNDATION ON THE ARTS AND THE HUMANITIES

                    NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS

                       GRANTS AND ADMINISTRATION

       The agreement provides $149,849,000 for the National 
     Endowment for the Arts (NEA). The Committees commend the NEA 
     for its work through its Healing Arts Partnership program 
     with Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Fort 
     Belvoir Community Hospital, and the new clinical sites 
     included in the initiative to incorporate arts therapy into 
     the treatment of active-duty military patients and their 
     families. The Committees continue to support the expansion of 
     this successful program to assist service members and their 
     families in their recovery, reintegration, and transition to 
     civilian life. The Committees also urge State arts agencies, 
     which have a longstanding collaborative relationship with the 
     NEA, to explore providing arts therapy programs to service 
     members and their families at the local level. The Committees 
     direct that priority be given to providing services and grant 
     funding for projects, productions, or programs that encourage 
     public knowledge, education, understanding, and appreciation 
     of the arts. The Committees maintain support for the 40 
     percent allocation for State arts agencies as proposed in the 
     NEA's budget. Any reduction in support to the States for arts 
     education should be no more than proportional to other 
     funding decreases taken in other NEA programs.


                 NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES

                       GRANTS AND ADMINISTRATION

       The agreement provides $149,848,000 for the National 
     Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). The Committees commend 
     the NEH for its support of grant programs to benefit wounded 
     warriors and to ensure educational opportunities for American 
     heroes transitioning to civilian life. The Committees commend 
     the NEH for its ongoing support to American Indian and Alaska 
     Native communities in preserving their cultural and 
     linguistic heritage through the Documenting Endangered 
     Languages program and a variety of preservation and access 
     grants that enable American Indian and Alaska Native 
     communities to preserve cultural artifacts and make them 
     broadly accessible. The Committees also commend the NEH 
     Federal/State partnership for its ongoing, successful 
     collaboration with State humanities councils in each of the 
     50 States as well as Washington, DC, the Commonwealth of 
     Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth 
     of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. The 
     Committees urge the NEH to provide program funding to support 
     the critical work of State humanities councils consistent 
     with guidance provided in the Consolidated Appropriations 
     Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113).

               ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HISTORIC PRESERVATION

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

     on Historic Preservation.


                  NATIONAL CAPITAL PLANNING COMMISSION

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

                UNITED STATES HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM

                       HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM

       The agreement provides $1,600,000 for the Salaries and 
     Expenses account. The Committees support the construction of 
     a permanent memorial to Dwight D. Eisenhower and are pleased 
     that concerns over the memorial's design have now been 
     addressed. It is the Committees' expectation that, following 
     necessary approvals from the Commission of Fine Arts and the 
     National Capital Planning Commission, the Commission will use 
     prior-year unobligated construction funds to begin site 
     preparation in anticipation of memorial construction 
     commencing in 2017. The agreement includes in Section 419 of 
     Title IV General Provisions bill language extending the 
     memorial's site authority.

     Suffrage Centennial Commission as authorized in this Act. The 
     Commission shall plan, execute, and coordinate programs and 
     activities in honor of the 100th anniversary of the passage 
     and ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. 
     Constitution, which guaranteed women the right to vote.

                      TITLE IV--GENERAL PROVISIONS
