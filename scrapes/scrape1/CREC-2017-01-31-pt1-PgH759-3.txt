                   HONORING THE LIFE OF STANLEY RUSS

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
one of Arkansas's great leaders and a dear friend, former State Senator 
Stanley Russ, who passed away earlier this month at the age of 86.
  Born and raised in Conway, Arkansas, Stanley served in the U.S. Army 
during the Korean war before becoming a State senator for 25 years.
  Stanley received numerous awards for his work, including being named 
of one of the Ten Outstanding State Legislators in the United States by 
the Assembly of State Governmental Employees. He also received the 
Distinguished Service Award from the Conway Chamber of Commerce and was 
elected into the Arkansas Tech University Hall of Distinction as well 
as the Arkansas Agriculture Hall of Fame.
  Our State and Faulkner County will miss Stanley's smile, his 
enthusiasm and ability to get things done to enrich the lives of all 
Arkansans.
  I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his family and loved 
ones.
