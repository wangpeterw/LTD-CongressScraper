                    TODAY IS WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY

  (Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, today is World Press Freedom Day, a day 
that deserves commemoration now more than ever.
  Undermining the credibility of the free press and attempting to turn 
the American people against the media is reminiscent of authoritarian 
tactics, not the conduct of the leader of the free world. Yet the 
President has referred to the press as the ``enemy of the people'' for 
simply doing their job: reporting the facts and holding all of us 
accountable.
  He has also dismissed distinguished publications as fake news, again, 
for simply doing their job and has threatened to change libel laws that 
will weaken the First Amendment, making it easier for him to attack and 
sue the press.
  This antagonistic relationship between the President and the press is 
not only beneath the dignity of the office, it is also dangerous for 
our democracy. We have seen strongmen and autocratic countries suppress 
the media through intimidation and by discrediting the integrity of the 
very institution of journalism.
  It is hard to believe that I have to say this in this country at this 
point in our history, but as Thomas Jefferson said: ``Our liberty 
cannot be guarded but by the freedom of the press, nor that be limited 
without danger of losing it.''
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Harper). Members are reminded to refrain 
from engaging in personalities toward the President.
