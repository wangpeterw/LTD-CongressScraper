                      PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN

  (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.)
  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, it is ironic 
today that we are celebrating the international success and celebration 
of women when we are also working to repeal affordable quality health 
care for women and families.
  I am reminded, in fact, of my own mother, who fought during a time in 
the 1960s and 1970s to ensure that my sister, who was very sick and 
disabled, would have access to a quality public education and also to 
affordable health care. Quite frankly, it was not available. My mother 
and father were financially destitute. Today, as a result of trying to 
provide that health care, I am my mother's caregiver.
  Today, I am reminded of all of the women primarily--49 million of 
us--providing more than $500 billion worth of long-term care and 
caregiving support to our families, that this is a day to really 
celebrate that leadership, that support, and the efforts made by women. 
Congress, as a body, should do much, much more to preserve and protect 
those rights of women and their families all across America.
