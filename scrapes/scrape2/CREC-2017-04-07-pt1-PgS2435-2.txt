                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, lest we forget that our work on 
Capitol Hill matters to Your Kingdom.
  Lord, with the military response against Syria, we are reminded again 
that eternal vigilance is the price for freedom. Continue to provide 
our lawmakers with opportunities to serve Your purposes on Earth.
  May they take seriously the responsibilities entrusted to them in 
their stewardship of the legislative branch. Remind them that You know 
the pressures they must confront as they strive to serve You and 
country. Bestow upon them the blessing of Your presence that will guard 
their hearts with Your peace.
  Lord, give them the confidence that, in following You, they can be 
certain of ultimate triumph.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
