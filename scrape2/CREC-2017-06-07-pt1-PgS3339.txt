                                 STATES

  Mr. BOOZMAN (for himself and Mr. Cotton) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural 
Resources:

                              S. Res. 186

       Whereas the Aviation Cadet Museum was founded in 1994 by 
     former aviation cadet and Air Force First Lieutenant Errol 
     Severe;
       Whereas, from 1917 until 1965, the flying cadet and 
     succeeding aviation cadet programs served as the primary 
     production source for nearly 500,000 joint service pilots, 
     navigators, and bombardiers;
       Whereas the bravery, courage, dedication, and heroism of 
     aviators and supporting ground crews from the Army Air Corps 
     and the Army Air Forces were critical factors in defeating 
     the enemies of the United States during World War I and World 
     War II;
       Whereas the Aviation Cadet Museum in Eureka Springs, 
     Arkansas, is the only museum in the United States that exists 
     exclusively to preserve and promote an understanding of the 
     role of aviation cadets in the 20th century; and
       Whereas the Aviation Cadet Museum is dedicated to--
       (1) celebrating the spirit of the United States; and
       (2) recognizing the teamwork, collaboration, patriotism, 
     and courage of the men who trained for and fought in, as well 
     as those individuals on the home front who mobilized and 
     supported, the national aviation effort: Now, therefore, be 
     it
       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the Aviation Cadet 
     Museum in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, as the national aviation 
     cadet museum of the United States.
