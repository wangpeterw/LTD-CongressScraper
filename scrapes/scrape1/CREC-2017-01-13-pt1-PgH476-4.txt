                       NOT ATTENDING INAUGURATION

  (Mr. GRIJALVA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to tell my constituents that 
I will not be attending the inauguration of DonaldTrump as our next 
President.
  My absence is not motivated by disrespect for the office or motivated 
by disrespect for the government that we have in thisgreat democracy 
but as an individual act, yes, of defiance at the disrespect shown to 
millions and millions of Americans by thisincoming administration and 
by the actions we are taking in this Congress.
  The majority of voters rejected Trump. They deserve respect. The 20 
million-plus Americans threatened by the repeal of theAffordable Care 
Act without a replacement deserve respect. The millions who did not 
vote because they blame both parties deserverespect.
  I will be at home in Arizona meeting with seniors, the immigrant 
community, folks who care about the environment and climatechange, 
healthcare providers, and marching in Tucson with folks who will demand 
respect. I will be talking about the need todefend and protect the 
future for all Americans.
  Rather than participate in the inauguration, I will be participating 
in my district and reaffirming and renewing thisdemocracy and the 
people that are part of it.
