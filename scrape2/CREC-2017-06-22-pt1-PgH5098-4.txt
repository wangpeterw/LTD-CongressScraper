              LET'S FIGHT TO SAVE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, healthcare should not be partisan.
  I have on my jacket a sign that says ``Restore the Vote'' to give 
opportunities to Americans to vote because Republicans have decided 
that TrumpCare and healthcare is partisan. We need to be able to ensure 
that everyone has the right to vote.
  Today, they issued a mean healthcare bill that is meaner than the 
House bill. Trillions of dollars are cut from Medicaid, from children 
and senior citizens. Subsidies are not given to all of those given 
under the Affordable Care Act. Hospitals will crumble; federally 
qualified clinics will close; and emergency room doctors, of whom I had 
the chance to speak to just a few hours ago, indicated 140 million 
Americans go to emergency rooms, or have gone, for their healthcare. 
The Affordable Care Act eased that.
  But, now with this monstrosity of a bill that undermines and throws 
Americans off healthcare--23 million and growing--then it really does 
say that elections do matter and that this is a sinister Republican 
plan to undermine the American people.
  It is time for us to come together, not partisan, but nonpartisan, to 
fight for our lives and fight for our children and fight to save the 
Affordable Care Act.
  Let's do it now.
