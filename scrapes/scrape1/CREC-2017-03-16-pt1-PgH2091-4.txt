                            DEFEAT TRUMPCARE

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 24 million Americans will lose 
their health insurance. They will become uninsured. We call it 
TrumpCare, as it should be called.
  For 7 years, Republicans have said they have a better alternative to 
the Affordable Care Act. President Trump promised on the campaign trail 
that Republicans would put forward a plan that would have insurance for 
everybody which would be far less expensive and far better for the 
American people.
  We now know the Congressional Budget Office report says that 24 
million people will lose their health insurance, including 7 million 
who will lose their insurance they currently have through their 
employers.
  Older Americans waiting to get on Medicare would be charged five 
times what they pay now. It reduces the Medicare trust fund, and it 
cuts 25 percent in Medicaid, a program that provides care for children 
and senior citizens.
  Mr. Speaker, this plan is both heartless and financially unsound. 
This repeal bill does not lower premiums or out-of-pocket costs nor 
does it expand access to care, and it provides a huge tax cut poorly 
disguised as a healthcare bill.
  We need to defeat this bill.
