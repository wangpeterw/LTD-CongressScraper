305,topic-id,526,"Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the Louisiana National Guard Youth Challenge Program, a wonderful program that is changing young people's lives and making Louisiana a better place.  Youth Challenge accepts high-risk students 16 to 18 years of age, and offers them the education, training, and emotional support they need to finish their high school equivalency requirements, and gives them the life skills that they need to be productive adults.  These students face challenges completing their education in traditional classroom settings. Some come from troubled homes, some are victims of severe bullying, some have their own discipline and anger issues, some have fallen so far behind in the coursework that they feel they cannot finish, and some have already dropped out of high school. Youth Challenge offers them the second chance that they need to get back on the path to success.  The Youth Challenge Program lasts 17 months, 5 months of which are at residential sites. We have three camps in Louisiana: Camp Minden near Shreveport, Camp Beauregard in central Louisiana, and the Gillis Long Center near Baton  While there, students learn from the structure and discipline offered by the military. They drill early in the morning and pursue coursework and job training in the afternoon. They also learn life skills and hear from motivational speakers and anti-substance abuse experts.  I recently had the privilege of speaking at a graduation ceremony in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and there are fewer things that are more inspiring than seeing the faces of these young people who have worked hard to turn their lives around and successfully complete the program.  Youth Challenge students also give back to the community. They complete at least 40 hours of community service that usually is focused on helping veterans, working with children, and volunteering with Special  While Youth Challenge Programs exist in States across the Nation, none has been more successful than in According to the Louisiana National Guard, more than 1,400 students graduate per year, which is more than any other State, and 83 percent of these pass the GED, which is the highest rate in the  After completing the program, graduates can continue their education, join the military, or get full-time employment. Many businesses in Louisiana recognize the value of these hardworking students and actively seek to employ them.  The Youth Challenge Program relies largely on Federal support, and it is an endeavor we in Congress should all support.  Youth Challenge is also asking Congress to consider pilot programs aimed specifically at job training and apprenticeship programs. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I look forward to discussing this request with my colleagues as we consider the fiscal year 2019 Defense Appropriations bill.  In conclusion, I want to thank the Louisiana National Guard instructors who give so much of themselves to this program and make it a wonderful success. It is because of their dedication that these students do have a second chance to succeed and become thriving, productive adult members of our society.  Madam Speaker, I look forward to seeing where the future of this program goes and the lives it has yet to change.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-04-10-pt1-PgH3065-4.txt,2244,STRESS TEST IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2017,2018.0,10.0,February

He has been cutting hair in the House for 47 years. Joe embodies the principles of hard work, dedication, and humility. He has cut the hair of the most powerful people in Washington, including: President Gerald Ford; President George Bush, Sr.; Vice President Al Gore; and almost every single Speaker of the He has cut hair in hospital rooms, before inaugurations, and even for foreign Presidents and ambassadors.  Joe grew up in Reggio Calabria, Italy, and came to the United States in 1952. He served as an Italian translator with the American Air Force during the Korean war. Along with an honorable discharge, Joe received his American citizenship upon leaving the In 1960, Joe came to D.and held a number of jobs before cutting hair in the He even worked construction on the Rayburn House Office  Emigrating from Italy, Joe is so proud of his American citizenship. Growing up in Italy, Joe was first introduced to America when American troops flew over his town during World War He said they would get so close to the town that he even made eye contact with the pilots flying those planes. When American troops came through his city, Joe remembers waving a small American flag, along with his family, welcoming them to his hometown.  After serving with the Air Force, in 1955 he joined the Metropolitan D.Police Force, where he was active for 25 years. When you speak to Joe, you see the pride and joy he takes in his job and his country reflected in his attitude.

No one should have to wonder where their next meal will come from.  In 2015, I founded the Adams Hunger Initiative to bring together a coalition of advocates in Mecklenburg to end hunger in our community.  For over 3 years, we fought to protect important anti-hunger programs like SNAP, expand public-private partnerships, and find creative ways to the systemic issues that leave families hungry.  The coalition will visit Capitol Hill to continue advocating for our priorities.  During National Nutrition Month, we sent a letter to the chairman and ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee urging protection for SNAP benefits in the upcoming farm bill.  Thirty-five thousand households in Mecklenburg and 20.3 million nationwide rely on SNAP to put food on their family's table.  As Congress considers the next farm bill, we must protect nutrition programs for those who need them most and ensure that no one in Mecklenburg or in America goes hungry.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-04-11-pt1-PgH3104-4.txt,2201,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2018.0,11.0,February
1475,topic-id,390,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Illinois (Mr.Hultgren) for arranging this opportunity for us to remember the life and legacy of Billy Graham, although I have to say it is not an easy task to find words that sum up his life, not because Billy Graham is not worthy, but because words and a few sentences seem incapable of describing a life that had such a large impact on, literally, the entire world.  I had the great opportunity to meet Graham just a few feet from here several years ago at one of the many Presidential inaugurations he attended.                              {time}  1830  While I only had that chance to meet him one time, Billy Graham was one of those people whom you felt like you knew. His honesty and his openness in preaching the gospel made him seem like a close, personal friend.  I have fond memories growing up in my hometown of Haleyville, Alabama, of being at my grandparents' home, and if a Billy Graham Crusade was being televised, you can rest assured that we were watching it around their television, regardless of what was on the other networks.  He was very clear in how he presented the gospel, that whosoever believeth in the son would have eternal life.  He will be greatly missed by a world that desperately needs more people like Billy Graham, but we can take great comfort in knowing that he has now made it home with his  Author James Allan Francis, in writing about the impact of Jesus Christ on the world, wrote this: ``All the armies that ever marched, all the navies that were ever built; all the parliaments that ever sat and all the kings that ever reigned, put together, have not affected the life of man upon this Earth as powerfully as has that one solitary life.''  That one solitary life, of course, is of Jesus Christ, who brought salvation to the world through faith in Him and in Him alone.  While no one could ever come close to having an impact on the world like Christ did, I believe the late Billy Graham was one of those great messengers, probably the best that we have seen any time in recent history, and he will long be remembered for the message that he gave about a personal salvation in Jesus  ",CREC-2018-02-27-pt1-PgH1322-2.txt,1460,REPUBLICAN TAX BILL,2018.0,27.0,February
338,topic-id,559,"Mr.President, today the Senate will vote on the confirmation of John Ring to be a member of the National Labor Relations Board, I am glad that we are voting on this nomination because, once Mr.Ring is confirmed, we will once again have a full five-member National Labor Relations  Created in 1935, the NLRB administers the National Labor Relations Act, which seeks to mitigate and eliminate labor-related impediments to the free flow of commerce. The 5 board members have 5-year, staggered terms, and the general counsel has a 4-year term.  The NLRB should be a neutral umpire in labor disputes. While Board partisanship did not start under President Obama, it became worse under him. An overly partisan Board creates instability in our Nation's workplaces and does not serve the intent of the law, which is to create stable labor relations and the free flow of commerce.  The NLRB under President Obama took two particularly harmful actions that are still in place today. First, the joint employer decision threatens the American dream for owners of the Nation's 780,000 franchise locations. Under that decision, companies could find it much more practical to own all their stores and restaurants and daycare centers themselves, rather than encourage more franchisee-owned small businesses.  Second is the ambush election rule, which can force a union election before employers and employees have a chance to figure out what is going on. The rule also forces employers to provide union organizers with a list of employees' work locations, shifts, job classifications, personal email addresses, and home and cellular telephone numbers. This information is highly personal, and employees may not want it shared, but workers do not have a choice. I am pleased the Board is accepting comments on whether this rule should be revised.  A fully staffed board is vital to both employees and employers, and I am not the only one who thinks that is important. At a Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, HELP, hearing in September 2014, then-Chairman Harkin said, ``Keeping the NLRB fully staffed and able to do its work will send a strong message to the American people that yes, Washington can work, and our government can function.''  While attending the Catholic University Columbus School of Law in the evening, Mr.Ring worked for the International Brotherhood of After law school, he joined the law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, where he has worked since 1988. Mr.Ring flourished at the firm, where he worked his way up from summer associate to coleader of the firm's labor and management relations practice.  Mr.Ring was nominated to be a member of the NLRB on January 18, 2018. The HELP Committee held Mr.Ring's hearing on March 1, 2018, and he completed all paperwork in accordance with the committee's rules, practices, and procedures. We received Mr.Ring's HELP Committee paperwork and his Office of Government Ethics paperwork on January 24, 2018, 36 days before his hearing. Mr.Ring offered to meet with all HELP Committee members and met with five of them, including two Following his hearing, Mr.Ring responded to 97 questions for the record, or 158, if you include subquestions. These responses were provided to Senators prior to the markup, and the HELP Committee favorably reported Mr.Ring's nomination on March 14, 2018.

755,topic-id,1440,"Mr.President, 16 years ago President George Bush announced that tariffs would be imposed on steel imports from several countries. The goal was to help protect the domestic steel industry. It was a good goal by a well-intentioned President whom I supported, but it backfired.  Last week President Trump announced that he intends to impose new tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum for the same reasons. It is a good goal by a well-intentioned President, but I am afraid it will backfire, just as it did for President Bush 16 years ago.  Here is the problem: Tariffs are big taxes, and they are big taxes that raise consumer prices. These new tariffs may temporarily save a few jobs in plants that produce steel and aluminum, but they will destroy many more jobs in auto plants that use steel and aluminum.  This is especially bad news for Tennesseans because one-third of our State's manufacturing jobs are auto jobs, with more than 900 plants in 87 of our 95 counties. Anything that threatens to destroy or damage auto jobs is of grave concern to It will now be cheaper for some Tennessee auto parts suppliers to move outside the United States, buy steel and aluminum there, and then ship finished parts back to this country.  These new tariffs will hurt more than U.auto manufacturers. The President indicated this morning that a final decision hasn't been made. I hope that before he makes a final decision, he will take into consideration the choices that companies such as Electrolux are making, which demonstrate that broad tariffs are bad for American workers and will cost Americans jobs, not just auto jobs.  Here is one example of the damage the proposed steel tariff would do in Tennessee to a home appliance manufacturer that uses 100 percent American steel. Immediately after the tariff was announced last week, Electrolux--Europe's largest home appliance manufacturer--announced that it was putting on hold a $250 million expansion in Springfield, TN, just outside of Electrolux has made multiple investments in Tennessee, with plants in Memphis, as well as Electrolux employs more than 1,000  The company said: ``Unfortunately, this decision gives foreign appliance manufacturers a cost advantage that is[[Page S1334]]hard to compete against.'' Note that Electrolux says that it gives foreign manufacturers an advantage. Electrolux buys all of the carbon steel it uses in its Tennessee plants from American steel mills. Let me say that again. Electrolux, which employees 1,000 people in Tennessee making home appliances, buys all of the carbon steel it uses in Tennessee plants from American steel mills. Yet it has put its expansion on hold because it believes the tariff will make it difficult for Tennessee plants to compete with plants overseas. Why? Because the new tariff is expected to cause American steel mills to raise their prices to match the newer, higher price of imported steel. The result of the tariff, therefore, will be higher costs for Electrolux and fewer jobs in Springfield, TN, making home appliances with 100 percent American steel. Instead, there will be more jobs overseas making home appliances with 100 percent foreign steel.  The new U.tariffs on imported steel will raise the price of all steel sold in our country, so appliance manufacturers with plants in the United States will have a hard time competing with plants outside of our country.  We should learn the lesson from 2002 when President Bush imposed similar tariffs--again, a good goal, a well-intentioned President, but it backfired. According to one widely cited independent study, the tariffs raised consumer prices and ``[m]ore American workers lost their jobs in 2002 to higher steel prices than the total number employed by the U.steel industry itself.'' President Bush's tariffs also led to retaliation, as other countries threatened to impose new tariffs on American exports, which would have cost even more U.jobs.  On Friday, the Wall Street Journal editorial board reminded readers: ``Steel using industries in the U.employ some 6.5 million Americans, while steel makers employ about 140,000. Transportation industries, including aircraft and autos, account for about 40% of domestic steel consumption, followed by packaging with 20% and building construction with 15%. All will have to pay higher prices, making them less competitive globally and in the U.S.''  That was the Wall Street  The backlash to the 2002 tariffs was so strong that President Bush terminated them early.  I want to give President Trump credit for listening. He invited a number of us who disagree with his advisers on trade to the White He has listened carefully. So far, we haven't persuaded him. I hope we still can. I thank him for listening. I hope he will continue to listen.  It is unusual to have a lesson in American history so much like the action he is proposing to take that was not good for the country no matter how well-intentioned the President was or how good an idea it seemed.  Since history can often serve as a guide, I refer my colleagues to two addresses I delivered on the U.Senate floor on September 2, 2003, and November 11, 2003, summarizing the disastrous effect President Bush's proposed steel tariffs had on U.jobs.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the Wall Street Journal's March 2 editorial on tariffs.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         [From the Wall Street Journal, Updated March 1, 2018]                          Trump's Tariff Folly                        (By the Editorial Board)       Donald Trump made the biggest policy blunder of his      Presidency Thursday by announcing that next week he'll impose      tariffs of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminum. This      tax increase will punish American workers, invite retaliation      that will harm U.exports, divide his political coalition      at home, anger allies abroad, and undermine his tax and      regulatory reforms. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell      1.7% on the news, as investors absorbed the self-inflicted      folly.       Mr.Trump has spent a year trying to lift the economy from      its Obama doldrums, with considerable success. Annual GDP      growth has averaged 3% in the past nine months if you adjust      for temporary factors, and on Tuesday the ISM manufacturing      index for February came in at a gaudy 60.8. American      factories are humming, and consumer and business confidence      are soaring.       Apparently Mr.Trump can't stand all this winning. His      tariffs will benefit a handful of companies, at least for a      while, but they will harm many more. ``We have with us the      biggest steel companies in the United They used to be      a lot bigger, but they're going to be a lot bigger again,''      Mr.Trump declared in a meeting Thursday at the White House      with steel and aluminum executives.       No, they won't. The immediate impact will be to make the      U.an island of high-priced steel and aluminum. The U.     companies will raise their prices to nearly match the tariffs      while snatching some market share. The additional profits      will flow to executives in higher bonuses and shareholders,      at least until the higher prices hurt their steel- and      aluminum-using customers. Then U.steel and aluminum makers      will be hurt as well.       Mr.Trump seems not to understand that steel-using      industries in the U.employ some 6.5 million Americans,      while steel makers employ about 140,000. Transportation      industries, including aircraft and autos, account for about      40% of domestic steel consumption, followed by packaging with      20% and building construction with 15%. All will have to pay      higher prices, making them less competitive globally and in      the U.      Instead of importing steel to make goods in America, many      companies will simply import the finished product made from      cheaper steel or aluminum abroad. Mr.Trump fancies himself      the savior of the U.auto industry, but he might note that      Ford Motor shares fell 3% Thursday and GM's fell 4%. U.     Steel gained 5.8%. Mr.Trump has handed a giant gift to      foreign car makers, which will now have a cost advantage over      How do you think that will play in Michigan in 2020?      The National Retail Federation called the tariffs a ``tax on      American families,'' who will pay higher prices for canned      goods and even beer in aluminum cans. Another name for this      is the Trump voter tax.       The economic damage will quickly compound because other      countries can and will retaliate against U.exports. Not      steel, but against farm goods, Harley-Davidson motorcycles,      Cummins engines, John Deere tractors, and much more. Foreign      countries are canny enough to know how to impose maximum      political pain on Republican Senators and Congressmen in an      election year by targeting exports from their states and      districts. Has anyone at the White House political shop      thought this through?

Mr.Speaker, I am proud to have helped pass this historic tax relief for the American people and deliver on a promise that we would grow this economy, we would create jobs, and we would improve the overall quality of life for all I represent hardworking, God-fearing, freedom-loving people in rural west They produce the food, fuel, and fiber for this great country. They feed and clothe the American people, and they fuel this great American economy.  The burden of high taxes and regulations hurt all of our job creators, but they have a disproportionate negative impact on the little guys in rural Our small businesses, our community banks, our family farmers and ranchers are independent energy producers. I can say with great confidence--having been back to the district, having talked to numerous people from all over those 29 counties I represent in the broad swath of land in west Texas--this tax cut and reform package is proenergy, it is proagriculture, and it is prorural  Back in my district, we hosted some roundtables with small businesses and chambers of commerce. We had various events that I participated in. We even conducted surveys. According to our survey, over 80 percent of the people I represent say that this tax reform package has helped everybody.  At one of our roundtable events, we had a veteran-owned agribusinessman who said that he had had 600 new customers this January over last year. He said that the effects of that was that he converted some of his part-time workers to full-time workers and gave folks a raise.  At the Happy State Bank, the employees are happy, and there are happy days for that organization because they are saving $5 million and plowing it back into their human capital. Six hundred out of 700 of Happy State Bank employees will receive an increase in their pay and benefits. Some will receive over a 50 percent pay increase.  Now, this is not crumbs to the folks whom I represent in west This is real cash in the pockets of real Americans who work hard every day to make ends meet.  There has been a change in west Texas, and, for once, it is not the weather. There is a renewed optimism. You can hear it in their voices; you can see it in their faces.  Mr.Speaker, we are witnessing a great American comeback, and the formula hasn't changed from the beginning of this great experiment.

This is especially true in the great State of Texas and the nine counties that I represent from Houston to the Louisiana State line, which has more petrochemical refining facilities than any district in the entire United States, and their employees benefitting from lower taxes. But the gains and the headlines that we have seen say so much more than that. The gains extend far beyond just employees benefitting from lower taxes. I am also hearing from hundreds of individuals and families about how their tax bills are being cut and what they plan to do with their larger paychecks.  ExxonMobil has announced a $50 billion investment in its U.operations and employees over the next 5 years. Walmart has already boosted hourly wages and provided employees with a bonus. Boeing, Incorporated, has announced $300 million in employee-related investments and charitable giving.  Let's break this down even further to the stories that aren't making the headlines of major papers but which are improving lives and growing businesses all across southeast  Juan and Leigh both owned small businesses in Houston and were able to hire additional employees with the money that they are saving from their tax cuts. That is putting Americans to work immediately.  Amy in Polk County shared with me that she was able to purchase new equipment to run her business much more efficiently. Helen in Tyler County took her tax savings and plowed it back into her business to help it grow. Julie in Orange shared that she will save enough from the tax cuts to purchase a larger inventory for her business.  Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and I am hearing story after story just like this about small businesses growing and hiring our friends and our neighbors. The individual tax rate cuts are making a huge difference for east Texans as over 90 percent of Americans are getting a tax cut.  Robert from Highlands wrote to tell me that he is using his tax savings to help his daughter get a college degree. Alan in Houston has decided to put his tax cut into savings for his retirement.

He was the youngest state attorney general in American history ever elected to the office. As attorney general, he was a champion for consumer protection and served as chair of President Lyndon Johnson's Consumer Advisory  In 1968, Bronson became the Democratic Party's nominee for Governor of Wisconsin, an election he lost to incumbent Governor Warren In 1974, Bronson was again elected as attorney general of Wisconsin, vowing to make the department of justice live up to its name. To Bronson, that meant taking on an activist role, hiring a bright young progressive team, and not being afraid to tackle new ideas and sensitive subjects head on. Wisconsinites will recognize some of the attorneys who made up that bright, young team because two of them have become iconic progressives in their own right. Ed Garvey and Kathleen Falk spent a portion of their early careers in Bronson La Follette's department of justice.  In 1978, Bronson married the love of his life, He was also blessed with a son, a daughter, two grandchildren, and two great-randchildren.  In 1987, Bronson retired from public service and joined a prominent law firm where he continued to advocate for criminal justice reform and government transparency.  Bronson was also a passionate advocate for children. He founded the Dane County Project for the Prevention of Child Abuse and became the chairman of the National Campaign for Missing and Exploited  No tribute to Bronson La Follette would be complete without a nod to his wonderful sense of humor. Together with his friend, State treasurer Charles Smith, he campaigned in a camper, bringing their unique blend of politics and fun to communities throughout the He cherished his reputation as a talented washboard player and percussionist. His most remembered antics involved his Irish Setter ``Cutter.'' When Bronson was cited with allowing Cutter to run at large in Maple Bluff, he hired Madison attorney and prankster Edward Ben Elson to defend the dog. Elson demanded that the dog be tried by a jury of his peers: 12 Irish In his next campaign, Bronson had buttons featuring Cutter with the slogan ``Bronson dog gone it.''  A colorful spectrum of words is necessary to capture the essence of Bronson La Follette, some of which may seem contradictory. Those words include progressive, irreverent, bipartisan, entertaining, passionate, fair, outspoken, just, funny, service-minded, champion, fun-loving, defender, activist, committed, blunt, values-driven, but what I will remember most about Bronson is how vigorously he embraced his personality, how sweetly he loved his family, and how passionately he fought for justice. Wisconsin owes a debt of gratitude to this extraordinary man who brought equality and justice to so many.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-04-11-pt1-PgS2069.txt,1558,RECOGNIZING THE LEGACY OF GWEN YORK,2018.0,11.0,February
59,topic-id,528,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for the recognition and the author of this legislation, Mr.Zeldin, for his leadership on the Stress Test Improvement Act, which I strongly support.  Mr.Speaker, the Federal Reserve administers two stress tests that they believe analyze the ability of U.firms to weather various forms of economic turbulence. While the Fed failed to sound the alarm prior to the last financial crisis, the thought is that, with these tests, one of which was instituted by the Dodd-Frank financial control law in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the Fed can prevent or at least mitigate the severity of the next crisis.  I believe that stress tests can be very productive and useful, but there is such a thing as overkill. When a relatively healthy patient goes to the doctor, the doctor typically doesn't say: And you need to go to another doctor, and you need to come see me again every month. That is really not required. It adds costs, it is redundant, it is duplicative, and it doesn't materially benefit the patient in terms of better health outcomes.  The analogy applies to banks. Stress testing is good, but overkill is costly, and it costs the financial system and doesn't materially add to financial stability. Certainly there is merit to stress testing, but there is no doubt that the cloud of secrecy surrounding these tests confounds the ability of financial firms to correctly identify systemic risks, to take corrective action, to chart a more sustainable or profitable path for the future. As a result, financial firms, many of them banks, are left trying to anticipate these Fed models, wasting valuable time and resources that could be used to actually address risks that threaten our economy.  So this environment of regulatory uncertainty actually, I would argue, undermines financial stability because it distracts from the mission of the institution, and it certainly is costly in terms of driving up costs and taking away access to capital for productive activities that actually strengthen the economy. For these reasons, I am a proud supporter of this bill, which is a great first step to clean up some of the regulatory uncertainties surrounding these tests.  The bill does a few things. First, it reduces the frequency of the required company-run stress tests to once per year. One is enough to identify risks, instead of two. Second, it eliminates one of the supervisory scenarios that must be run, leaving just two, again eliminating redundancy and superfluous, costly activities. Finally, it prohibits the Federal Reserve from objecting to a bank holding company's capital plan based on unknown qualitative reasons.  These institutions need to know what the Fed is looking for in order to satisfy the stress testing that is applied to them. Again, I applaud Congressman Zeldin and Chairman Hensarling for their hard work on this commonsense regulatory improvement bill. It is not deregulation. It is better regulation. It is more effective regulation to not only unleash greater capital under the economy but actually enhance financial stability.  For those reasons, Mr.Speaker, on behalf of the American economy and for financial stability, I urge my colleagues to vote for the Stress Test Improvement  ",CREC-2018-04-11-pt1-PgH3112-3.txt,2238,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4296, OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL",2018.0,11.0,February

122,topic-id,1100,"Mr.President, I come to the floor as we, as Americans, continue to see the regular reminders that the world is a very dangerous place. The horrendous reports out of Syria over the weekend show us there are leaders in the world who will test the rules that define civilized nations. They will exploit any crack that they see in our resolve.  President Trump has consistently responded to these kinds of challenges by showing that he is resolute and that he is unshakable. He has a foreign policy that always puts America first. To continue to do this, the President needs to have a full national security team on the job and working for The Secretary of State is a very important part of that team.  Tomorrow, the Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to have a hearing on Mike Pompeo's nomination to do this very important job. Mike Pompeo understands that if we want safety and security at home, we need a world that is peaceful and stable. I expect he is going to talk about all of these things at the confirmation hearing, and I look forward to his testimony.  We have all heard about Mike Pompeo's impressive qualifications for the job to which he has been nominated--first in his class at West Point; Harvard Law School; a Member of Congress; and the Director of the Central Intelligence He has the integrity, and he has the experience to serve as America's Secretary of As a former Member of Congress, he certainly understands how policy decisions get made and the key importance of congressional oversight. As head of the CIA, he clearly understands the crucial role that the intelligence community plays in preserving America's national security. As a soldier, he understands the consequences of decisions that get made in Washington,  I have traveled with Mike Pompeo to meet with world leaders and to attend national security conferences. He knows the issues, and he knows the people. He is the right person for this job. I met with him just last month after he was nominated. We talked about some of the specific issues going on around the world and how they affect our Nation's national security. It was a very good conversation, and I am extremely confident that he is the right person for this job.  I expect many more people will come away from these hearings tomorrow with great confidence in Mike He will be an excellent representative for our Nation, and he will be a strong hand to implement President Trump's foreign policy. So I look forward to voting on this nomination as soon as possible after the hearings.  It was just a little over a year ago that he was confirmed by a very large, bipartisan majority for his current job as the CIA It was right here on this Senate floor where that confirmation occurred. Fifteen Senators from the other side of the aisle agreed that Mike Pompeo was the right choice for that position. As the nominee for the job he now holds, he drew bipartisan praise for his qualifications. Two Democratic Senators actually came to the floor and spoke in favor of his nomination--Senators Feinstein and They are the current vice chair of the Intelligence Committee and the former chair of the Intelligence Since that time, Mike Pompeo has done an excellent job at the Even Hillary Clinton has come out and praised his time in heading that  I expect that this can be a short process to confirm him in the new job for which he has been nominated, that of Secretary of There is certainly no good reason for Democrats to slow things down or to attempt to slow things down.  We need to restore America to a position we once held as the most powerful and respected Nation on the face of the For 8 years, the previous administration had us going in the wrong direction. The Obama administration followed a policy that it called strategic patience. That meant watching while the Assad regime in Syria crossed one redline after another. Then the redline became a green light. The result is that Syria continues to use chemical weapons today in attacking its own people. Strategic patience did not work.  The Obama administration's policy also meant that North Korea was allowed to get away with too much for far too long. North Korea continued to test nuclear weapons, continued to test missiles, and continued to use hostages as a way of getting what it wanted from other countries. Strategic patience did not work with North  The Trump administration has said very clearly that the era of strategic patience is over. The leaders of these countries need to understand that their belligerence will not succeed. They need to get the clear message that America has a new foreign policy. It is a policy to secure America's national interests and demonstrate America's leadership around the world. Part of this leadership is to stand up to show that there is a limit to the patience of the civilized countries of the world. The previous administration too often placed international opinion ahead of what was actually best for That only made the world a more dangerous place. The Trump administration has begun to get us back on the right track, and Mike Pompeo will ensure that we stay on the right track.  When it comes to issues like the upcoming discussions with North Korea, Mike Pompeo understands the risks of dealing with these kinds of aggressive adversaries. He also understands the opportunities that we now have because of President Trump's forceful stand for American interests.  Democrats should commit to allowing this nomination to move as quickly as possible. We will have a hearing tomorrow. We need to have a thorough discussion about what is happening around the world, and then we need to vote. Let's not have any more of the deliberate delays that we have been seeing by the Democrats in this body--no more pointless and partisan obstruction.

That is a huge raise. This report said that more than 4 million workers are also getting one-time cash bonuses and other benefits. These one-time cash bonuses mean a great deal to American families. It says that so far, over $2 billion in cash bonuses have been given.  Today in Wyoming, we heard another great report that Taco John's--an establishment at which I frequently ate lunch when I was in the Wyoming Legislature, as did so many members of the Wyoming They are providing bonuses for employees. That is another case in point. The reason they say they are doing it is the tax relief tax cut benefits that people all across the country are receiving as a result of the tax law we passed.  If you remember, a lot of Democrats predicted gloom and doom if we were to pass this piece of legislation. Nancy Pelosi actually said it was She said it was the end of the world. Well, with all of these workers getting bigger paychecks and more take-home pay, Democrats have now started to panic. Nancy Pelosi said all the benefits people are getting under the tax law are ``crumbs.'' That is what she called them, but that is not what people across the State of Wyoming are calling them.  I received a note the other day from a man who said he heard all the rhetoric from Nancy Pelosi and the He said: ``Here is what the crumbs mean to a fellow working in Casper, Wyoming.'' He said that the first thing he noticed was that his take-home pay was higher in his latest paycheck. He figures that the tax cut works out to about a 2-percent raise for him. He and his wife decided to put that money straight into his retirement savings plan and invest it. He figures that over time, as those investments grow, it could add up to an extra $97,000 by the time he is ready to retire. He said: ``A few crumbs over time really do matter.''  There was a second part of his story about what the Republican tax relief means for him and his family, and that is the bonus. Because of the tax cuts, his employer gave him a bonus of $1,500. He said: ``I plan to enjoy the summer just a little bit more with this surprise income.'' He said he is investing the tax cut in his retirement, and he is investing the bonus in creating additional memories with his family today. He said that it means they are going to take an extra camping trip to Yellowstone this summer. They will enjoy ``a few more cookouts with families and friends this summer to savor the memories that this tax reform is providing.''  That is what it means for people across the country--memories, family activities, vacation, and a better retirement--all of those things because of the tax law and tax relief passed for the American people. They are going to do things they like doing, everything from going on vacation to going out for ice cream.  Tax reform has been very good for people in Casper, It is good for his family. He wrote to tell me about it. It is good for the local businesses that he will be supporting, where he will be spending his money, traveling around the State, going on vacation, camping trips, cookouts, and making memories. They are not crumbs.  I don't know why Democrats who voted against the tax cuts even came to Washington in the first place. I do know that Republicans came here with a purpose--a purpose to give families more opportunities to invest in their futures like this man is doing.  There was another new survey that came out last week. They talked with heads of companies across America, and they talked about the confidence index that we are seeing nationwide. That is because of the tax relief law. The survey found that 89 percent of these business leaders are confident in the U.economy's prospects this year. It is at an alltime high.  Look at 2016--the last year of the Obama administration--and 2017 and 2018. That is an enormous jump from the 39 percent that business leaders were feeling in terms of confidence back in 2016. It is even bigger than last year, when 80 percent said they were confident. The reason for the jump is simple. When we look at what has changed since 2016, there were a couple of very big things.  First is the way that Republicans have been cutting back on Washington's burdensome, punishing, and destructive regulations. It is going to save Americans a lot of money and a lot of time.  The second thing that happened is that Republicans in Congress passed the tax relief law. That is why millions of Americans are getting a pay raise. That is why Americans are more confident about our economy. The business leaders are right. They should be confident about the state of America's economy because Republicans are just getting started.  Our economy should have been growing much more quickly ever since the recession ended almost 9 years ago, but it didn't during the last administration because the politics and the policies of the Democrats in Washington held our economy back. Now we have Republican policies, and the economy is much stronger. America's economy grew by just 1.8 percent in 2016. That is tepid growth compared to what we expect and what we are used to. Last year, it grew by 2.5 percent. We added 2.2 million jobs in 2017. Confidence is soaring.  Democrats don't want to hear about it. They don't want to talk about it. They don't want to hear from their constituents who are getting a raise and getting more money in their paychecks. They consider it crumbs. They almost appear to be rooting for the economy to stall. Some may want the economy to look more like it did when they were in charge.  The American people are going to look at what the Democrats did and realize that what the Republicans did made a huge difference in their lives. People are going to look at the fact that every Democrat in the Senate voted against the tax cuts. Then people are going to look at what Republicans have done and what it means for people's take-home pay. That is why Republicans are here. It is what we promised to do. That is what we are going to continue to do.                         Energy Infrastructure  Mr.President, I would like to speak about energy infrastructure. President Trump has shown that he intends to be a champion for upgrading our country's aging highways, bridges, and water infrastructure. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, I will be working with President Trump to modernize our infrastructure. This includes working to upgrade America's energy infrastructure, things such as electric transmission lines and natural gas pipelines. These facilities need to be repaired and modernized, and we need to build new facilities as well.  Often, these investments can be made without any taxpayer funding. People get the benefit of new jobs, economic growth, and the affordable and reliable energy that these projects supply. It is good for everybody, including the taxpayers. We just need to make sure the government doesn't get in the way.  Recently, there was an important reminder of the need for energy infrastructure development. It was that blast of cold weather and heavy snow that hit the Northeast part of the country earlier this year. Normally, natural gas accounts for about 48 percent of the power generated in New During this big winter storm in January, gas accounted for only 16 percent. That is because there aren't enough natural gas pipelines in the region to deliver all of the gas they needed for heating and for power. This shouldn't happen in America, where we are the 1 natural gas producer in the world.  To meet the demand in New England, powerplants and utilities have had to take the drastic step of importing liquefied natural gas from Can you imagine such a thing? This is a tanker, and it carried gas from a Russian company called Yamal LNG--liquefied natural gas. The gas came from a facility in Siberia, and they were taking it right into the Boston Harbor last month. This is the location of the Boston Tea Party, and we are bringing in Russian  You might think that local leaders in the region would want to avoid importing gas from our adversaries, like You might think they would want more American pipelines to power our communities. That is not what is happening in the Northeast part of this[[Page S1273]]country. Instead, leaders in that region have been vocal opponents of new pipelines. They blocked the pipelines.  People who have been vocal opponents of the new pipelines include some of the Democrats who represent that part of the country right here in the They refused to allow responsible and safe energy development to give people in the Northeast the natural gas the families and businesses need. These Democrats claim they are protecting the environment. That is simply not true.  There was a headline in the Boston Globe a couple of weeks ago. The headline was ``Our Russian pipeline, and its ugly toll.'' That was in the Boston The article pointed out that Russia actually has much lower standards than the United States when it comes to protecting the environment. Democrats are just playing the old game of ``not in my backyard.'' We see the same thing so often when it comes to energy infrastructure projects.  We should be looking for ways to make energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without raising costs for American families. When it comes to actually producing the energy, Democrats put up roadblocks to keep it from happening.  If we are going to build America's infrastructure, we need to streamline the process, and we need to start cutting the redtape. We need to build faster, better, cheaper, and smarter. It is true for roads and bridges and also true for our energy infrastructure.  Let me conclude by telling you that this article in the Boston Globe called on leaders in the Northeast to stop prioritizing short-term political gains at the expense of energy security and the environment. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to do the same. We should be talking about not just energy security and energy independence and not being dependent on foreign sources of energy from our enemies but focus on American energy, U.energy, and American jobs. We certainly shouldn't put America in a position of being dependent on Russia or others to heat our homes and power our economy. We should all support responsible energy infrastructure development so American communities can run on American energy.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

369,topic-id,449,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of 128, Supporting Respect for Human Rights and Encouraging Inclusive Governance in Ethiopia, and I want to thank our committee chair, Mr.Smith, for his many years of effort in this direction.                              {time}  1730  The resolution calls on the government of Ethiopia to take clear, decisive steps towards becoming more inclusive, more democratic, and more respectful of the basic human rights of its citizens.  Ethiopia is an important partner of the U.in many arenas, including regional security, especially through its contributions to international peacekeeping.  Over the past few years, Ethiopia has made significant strides in addressing poverty and expanding economic development. The country has also addressed significant challenges in global health and food security. These are extremely important gains.  We are here today, however, because the country continues to have a way to go, especially in the arenas of inclusive governance and respect for human rights.  Since November 2015, there have been ongoing protests in Ethiopia's largest region of These protests expanded to the Amhara region in August 2016. In response, security forces have used live ammunition to disperse largely peaceful protests, killing hundreds and arresting tens of thousands.  Activists, journalists, and others have also faced repeated arrests.  The Ethiopian Government has responded by imposing a state of emergency that included curfews and restrictions on the assembly, expression, and movement of its citizens. Meanwhile, earlier this year, the government began releasing prisoners, including opposition leaders, journalists, and protesters. The government also focused on an infamous detention center. Of course, this is a step in the right direction.  We are also encouraged by the recent transfer of power. The new prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, recently delivered a speech where he highlighted that the government plans to address unity and national reconciliation as well as good governance based on the rule of law. It also seeks to crack down on corruption.  Again, this is encouraging and it could be an important turning point for the country that could provide an opportunity to widen the political space, but what remains concerning, however, is that Ethiopia is still under a state of emergency, and just last month, the defense minister announced the arrest of a number of individuals who they say were linked to protests.  We encourage the Government of Ethiopia to keep the positive momentum going by lifting the state of emergency, ensuring freedom of expression and assembly, and opening up democratic space.  The current challenges facing Ethiopia are best addressed through inclusive discourse and political processes rather than through the imposition of restrictions.  Mr.Speaker, I therefore encourage Members to vote in favor of this resolution that supports respect for human rights and encourages inclusive governance in  ",CREC-2018-04-10-pt1-PgH3069.txt,1996,OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKING ORGANIZATIONS,2018.0,10.0,February

507,topic-id,470,"Mr.Chair, I would like to thank Congresswoman Jackson Lee not only for yielding me time, but for all her scholarship and all of her commitment to making a difference against sex trafficking.  Mr.Chair, today is a proud day for me. I am proud to stand here on this House floor to urge the support and passage of the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, known as FOSTA, as well as the Walters amendment.  Human trafficking and sex trafficking is happening in all areas: big cities, little cities, rural and suburban areas, Democratic districts, Republican districts. It happens in every congressional district in America, regardless of whether that district is red or blue.  Trafficking, Mr.Chair, is a nonpartisan issue, and that requires bipartisan solutions. And if Congressman Poe were still here, I would add, ``And that is just the way it is.''  I am so honored to be joined today with so many colleagues. I also want to thank Congresswoman Roby for her leadership in managing the time. What an honor it is for me to join the leadership of Congresswoman Ann Wagner, not only the sponsor of this bill, but a friend, a colleague, someone who is my classmate. And early on, she started talking about human trafficking, and we shared our mutual interest; and we have been, so to say, joined at the hip ever since. And I could not thank her enough for all of her leadership.  Mr.Chair, it tells you that we must work together. Congresswoman Wagner has done that with this legislation and more. So I am very honored to be the lead You have heard what the Fighting Online Sex Trafficking Act will do, so I won't go in great details with that again. But I will tell you, it will address a critical problem.  Our laws have not kept pace with how technology has been used to exploit the innocent. The internet has changed how humans are trafficked. It has taken something that was once done in the streets and made it easier and more anonymous. Trafficking online is a well-documented problem, yet we have seen a few websites turn a blind eye, even as they profit on the buying and the selling of children, women, and men.  FOSTA will help solve this in many ways, as you have heard. On this last point, I would like to say FOSTA is targeted in a way that will not only affect websites engaged in the online trafficking trade; it will recognize some of the concerns that some of the tech communities initially raised. But I think that the process that FOSTA has gone through in the Judiciary Committee and now with the Walters amendment shows how the legislative process can be used.

983,topic-id,343,"Mr.Speaker, I thank our ranking member, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, for yielding me time and also for her steadfast leadership in opposing the Financial CHOICE Act and many of the provisions included in the bill, including the one that we are considering on the floor today.  Mr.Speaker, this bill flies in the face of the old maxim: Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.  This bill would effectively blindfold our regulators when calculating operational risk capital at our largest institutions--it is worth repeating again: not our community banks, but our largest financial institutions--by precluding them from looking at an institution's historic losses as an indicator of possible future losses.  Now, earlier, the ranking member injected an example of asking about our credit scores. I think it is worth elaborating on this, Mr.Imagine if I go to a bank for a mortgage loan and they ask me for my credit score, and I simply told them they couldn't look at my past financial behavior in order to decide whether or not they are going to give me the loan.  So when you talk about good or commonsense regulation, we all know the answer to that question, Mr. Well, this bill would effectively do just that to our regulators. Instead of a credit score, which determines creditworthiness, operational risk determines the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems.  I would tell our regulators, when determining the appropriate level of capital a financial institution needs to hold against operational risk, you cannot look at an institution's past losses, especially if they got out of that business.  Mr.Speaker, I think this is common sense. I think whether you are a banker or a regulator, you clearly understand that we need to make sure that we don't blindfold our regulators.  So I oppose this bill, which would reduce capital in our country's largest financial institutions and blindfold our regulators' ability to safeguard the stability of our economy. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no.''                              {time}  1615  ",CREC-2018-02-27-pt1-PgH1308.txt,2153,THE JOURNAL,2018.0,27.0,February

If I went to the bank and wanted to put my house up for collateral but I hadn't paid the payment on it in 4 months and it was getting ready to be foreclosed on, I think they would want to know that. And that would be maybe a better analogy on it, because what we are trying to say to the people who are out there watching and listening to this: You cannot let our larger banks put us at risk, what we know also happened in 2008.  So that was the point I was making. So let's say the analogies don't work so we don't have to go back and forth. Let me just say that I am voting ``no'' on this because I don't want to blindfold or tie the hands of the regulators' being able to do their jobs.

He abducted the children and took them to a remote part of the reservation, where he abused Ashlynne, slaughtered her, and left her brother to fend for himself in the desert. Ashlynne died alone.  Ashlynne had been abducted around 4 p.m. Her father filed a missing person report at 6:53 p.m., within 3 hours. Unfortunately, authorities did not send an AMBER Alert until 2:30 a.m. on Tuesday, almost 10 hours after Ashlynne went missing.  According to law enforcement records, Tom Begay, Jr., Ashlynne's perpetrator, admitted that Ashlynne was alive when he left her stranded in the desert.  Mr.Speaker, had Indian Country been included as partners in the AMBER Alert plans, law enforcement might have rescued Ashlynne in time. She might still be alive and with us today.  When a child is abducted, action in those first hours is crucial to their safe return. The AMBER Alert program has proven effective at instantly providing information to the public to assist in the effort.  According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, of the AMBER Alerts issued in 2016, 94 percent of the recovered children were found within the first 72 hours, including 47 percent who were found within the first 3 hours.  Between 1997 and February 2017, the AMBER Alert program has been credited with the safe recovery of 868 children. AMBER Alerts save lives.  Today, we have the opportunity to ensure all children may benefit from the AMBER Alert program if necessary, no matter where they reside.  This bill will reauthorize the Department of Justice grant program that assists State and local governments in developing and implementing AMBER Alert communications plans. It will explicitly require the Department of Justice to perform a needs assessment of AMBER Alert capabilities on Indian reservations.  It will also, for the first time, require funds be used to integrate Tribal AMBER Alert systems with those of neighboring jurisdictions to ensure that AMBER Alerts reach as many people as swiftly as possible.  Mr.Speaker, I again thank House leadership and Chairman Goodlatte for bringing this bill forward and acknowledging the importance of filling a gap in our AMBER Alert system that might have prevented the death of  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

This bill is truly a bipartisan effort, worked on by Members of both parties. It is because of its importance.  The particular case that both of us have cited today does focus the attention on the massive hole where there are more than 500 Indian Tribes that do not have access to the AMBER Alert system. It is the only part of this Nation and its territories that is not covered by the AMBER Alert system. This will solve that problem.

This research will help us learn more about demographic factors such as age, race, gender, or ethnicity.  In addition, the legislation emphasizes the need for continued biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of  NIH will further research into the causes of congenital heart defects, including genetic causes, and study long-term outcomes in individuals with CHD of all ages. Also, NIH may study data to identify effective treatments and outcomes and identify barriers to lifelong care for individuals with congenital heart defects  CHD is the most common birth defect and the leading cause of birth defect-related infant mortality. For the Down syndrome community, about half of the children born with Down syndrome have It is a true public health issue and, as late-night show host Jimmy Kimmel noted, it does not discriminate by race, gender, or socioeconomic status.  The road ahead may be scary and uncertain for any parent with a newborn who has CHD, but this bill helps give hope to those coping with the diagnosis. Nearly 1 in 100 babies are born with CHD, and more than 5 percent will not live to see their first birthday, unfortunately. We have to change that.  Even for those who receive successful intervention, it is not a cure. We have to change that.  Children and adults born with CHD require ongoing, costly, specialized cardiac care and face a lifelong risk of permanent disability and premature death. We must change that.  As a result, healthcare utilization among the CHD population is significantly higher than the general population. It is estimated that, compared to their peers, the medical costs for individuals with congenital heart defects are 10 to 20 times greater.  Hospitalization costs for pediatric patients alone total more than $5.6 billion each year, which is 15 percent of[[Page H1240]]all hospitalization costs for patients 20 years of age and younger.  Despite its prevalence and significance, there are still gaps in research and standards of care for CHD patients. But for the sake of the estimated 40,000 babies, Mr.Speaker, who will be born in the next year with CHD, there is more work to be done.  Mr.Speaker, I began this journey almost 10 years ago, when then-Congressman Zack Space and I first introduced the Congenital Heart Futures Last Congress, Congressman Schiff and I reintroduced the reauthorization of the original bill. During that time, I met a lot of patients with congenital heart defects along the way, and I have been touched by their stories.  There are people like Trey and Nicole Flynn, a young Floridian couple who lost their son, Holden, while waiting for a heart transplant. He was only 2 years old.  This bill supports the essential research necessary to make sure another family doesn't have to leave the hospital without their child in their arms.  There is also Lucas Iguina, a young man born with a complex congenital heart disease that essentially left him with half a heart.                              {time}  1730  Despite having three open-heart surgeries, Mr.Speaker, and countless doctor visits and medical procedures, Lucas has hopes and dreams like every other child.

126,topic-id,2076,"Mr.President, over the last couple of weeks, many of us have had an opportunity to spend more time at home than we do just going back and forth a few days a week.  While I was there, I had the opportunity to talk to small business owners, employees--people who are seeing their paychecks for the first time reflecting what we have done with the tax bill. Both in my hometown of Springfield, MO, and around our State, I also heard a level of optimism that was very encouraging.  One of the people I talked to was on the national board of manufacturers. A recent poll of the manufacturers looking at their confidence level reflected that it was the highest it has ever been in all of the time they have been polling on how they see the future.  Mr.President, where you and I live, in an economy that makes things and grows things, we always do better. We are a productive part of the country. We don't do quite as well in an advice economy, but we are not opposed to an advice-giving economy. We have people who give advice. But, frankly, if you put that on top of truly productive capacity and a marketplace that meets that capacity, we always do very well.  As I talked to people, I heard consistently two reasons that people feel their optimism is justified and understandably growing. One reason is the Tax Cuts and Jobs No matter what was said about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, people who were told it wouldn't help them are finding out, when they get their first paychecks, that it is helping them. People who were told that the[[Page S2062]]investment opportunities that would encourage them to grow their small businesses wouldn't be there for them are finding out that they are there for them, and they see those things coming. The economy is generally seeing money stay where we live that otherwise would have gone to Washington, Forty-three different entities have come to our offices with ideas about what they are doing.  The 53,000 State employees in our State--the payroll deduction would indicate that this year, $32\1/2\ million from just that group of employees that was sent to Washington, DC, last year--it will stay in Missouri this year.  I mentioned on the floor not too long ago that one of our counties had reported that their county payroll--that the average county employee would take home $1,800 more this year, with the same paycheck to start with. That is beyond what they would have taken home last year. For all of those county employees put together, in Boone County, MO, it would mean that $946,000 will stay in Boone County that previously would have gone to Washington, That makes a difference in the economy of the county because there are a lot of other people beyond those 485 employees who see the same kinds of things happening to them, but it really makes a difference for families. That take-home pay difference that some people here in the Senate and other places in this building would suggest won't matter to families--it turns out it matters a lot. And I will say again that it particularly matters a lot if you don't have it. If you have all kinds of money, it is easy to say: Well, $200 a month--what difference does that make? Let me assure you, it makes a difference if you don't have it. Lots of families and individuals are beginning to see the ability to do more things with their own money.  The second thing I consistently heard about was just the difference in the regulation atmosphere. Earlier this week, a dozen Federal agencies came together in an effort to improve the environmental review process to allow infrastructure projects to go on more quickly--not only to diminish the time it takes to get a project started but also to be able to, with more certainty, go out and start the process of bidding and acquiring and the things you need to do to make that happen.  There were a dozen Federal agencies working together with a common purpose, asking: What can we do to make this system work better? We have had up to 29 statutes and 5 Executive orders that resulted in a number of different decisions under Federal law that allow those projects to move forward more quickly.  We had a discussion in the Commerce Committee this morning with one of the nominees for the Surface Transportation Board who had been instrumental in helping put together a more streamlined way to get things done if, for instance, you were putting something back exactly where it had been. It makes sense to everybody in America that if you are building a bridge where there was a bridge, it should take less of an environmental impact study than if you are building a bridge where there has never been a bridge before. But until right now, those two things were not treated in a significantly different way; they were treated in the same way. Now, because of legislation that we passed and the President signed, they will be treated in a different way, as they should have been.  Location is a great advantage to our whole country. Again, in the middle of the country, where I live, I have seen--I think it may be our greatest competitive advantage--access not only to the national marketplace but to the world marketplace. Generally, we have the same things in Things that allow us to put infrastructure in place more readily and make it more affordable to get it done in a quicker way are all good things.  This week, one of the nominees we will be voting on is the Deputy Administrator for the Environmental Protection Over the last decade, based on theirs own estimate, the Environmental Protection Agency imposed somewhere between $43 and $51 billion in regulatory costs annually. You have to be an incredibly strong economy to absorb another $50 billion in regulatory costs from one agency. And that is their estimate; you could get other estimates that say: Oh, no, it is going to be a lot more costly than that. These are the costs they are willing to admit to.  The current administration has turned the page. I hope that the new Deputy Administrator becomes an active part of that. I think the EPA has been on the forefront of really looking at the kinds of things that are holding back the economy and trying to do things that make sense.  The EPA Administrator, Administrator Pruitt, quickly got on the job of dismantling two of the most costly and burdensome regulations that may have ever been proposed by any Federal agency. One is the waters of the United States, where the EPA decided that virtually all of the water in the country was somehow related to navigable water. Some of it might eventually run into navigable water, but the law says that the EPA has the authority to regulate navigable water.  The EPA said: Oh, no, that means any water that could ever run into any water that could ever run into any water that could ever run into navigable water.  In our State, that meant that 99.7 percent of the State would have been under the EPA authority, if they wanted to exercise it, for things that would have slowed down the economy, made it harder to resurface your driveway or dig a utility pole or put fertilizer on your field or get a building permit.  It was a ridiculous proposal, and Administrator Pruitt and the EPA understood that it is ridiculous--just as, by the way, the courts did. The reason this had not gone into effect yet is largely because the courts basically said to the EPA, in many instances: You don't have the authority to do that. This change was made because the EPA realized that they didn't have the authority. Frankly, if they did have the authority, it would have been a bad idea.  There was a power plan that would have been so excessive that, in the State where I live, the utility bill would have doubled in about 10 or 12 years--a power plan that would have added up to $39 billion in compliance costs, every single penny of which would have been passed along in your utility bill and mine, all of it added to the utility bill in ways that just, frankly, didn't make sense.  The EPA has moved away from that but not away from the idea of regulation or environmental control. In fact, Administrator Pruitt came to the Thomas Hill Energy Center in our State in April of last year to hear directly from workers, from the electric co-op members that provide electricity to many of our rural residents, and from ag leaders about the impact of that. He listened to that and went back--I am sure he did that in other places--and withdrew that rule but at the same time proposed a solution for West Lake Landfill, which has been on the critical ``we need to take care of this'' list for 30 years.  The job of the EPA is not to strangle the economy. The job of the EPA is to make the environment more protected by doing the things that the EPA was designed to do. I think that is what they have been doing--looking at the rules that don't make sense, trying to be sure that we don't do things at the Federal level that cost people their jobs, their livelihood, and their opportunities for no reason at all.  I had a meeting this week--it was Friday a week ago--at the Missouri State University, where the head of the Missouri Department of Agriculture, Chris Chinn, and the Missouri Farm Bureau president, Blake Hurst, and I answered questions for about 45 minutes from a crowd there to talk about agriculture and the future of agriculture. Not a single question was asked about the farm bill. The questions were basically about trade, rural broadband, and regulation. I think you could go to lots of other places and say: What do you want to talk about that you are most concerned about with the Federal Government, and two or three of those topics would come up again.  Last year the Senate used the Congressional Review Act to block 15 new major rules that had come up late in the previous administration. That act had been used exactly one time since it was put into law, in 1995 or 1996. It had been used exactly one time during the entire life of the law until we were able to look at it and use it 15 times last year to eliminate rules that would[[Page S2063]]have cost our economy $36 billion in compliance costs. They were not rules that we had before. In the case of the last administration, the country had gone along without these rules even being proposed for 7\1/2\ years but, suddenly, on the way out the door, there were all these new things that would have held the economy back in a way that, frankly, nobody would want to have to do if they were still there to take responsibility for it. So we are looking at what we can do in regulation, looking at what we can do in transportation, looking at what we can do to make us more competitive and allow things to happen so the taxpayers have the benefit of a process that works for them instead of a process that works with them.  Rolling back unnecessary redtape isn't just important for infrastructure. It isn't just important for individuals. It is also important for strengthening our economy. I think we are seeing that happen. These people who are willing to serve, like some of the individuals we will be voting on this week, are people who are willing to give of themselves and their time, their effort, and their energy to work for the citizens of our country. We should be grateful to them, but we should also be sure that we are watching carefully to be sure that they continue to do the kinds of things that create opportunity and competition.

1450,topic-id,2034,"Mr.President, I want to spend a few minutes talking about your fellow North Carolinian, Billy It is very appropriate that you are in the Chair as I do this--and some of my colleagues are going to follow--as we honor the life and legacy of Billy  He was sometimes called America's Preacher, and sometimes called America's Pastor, but he went to Heaven last week. And what a 99 years he had while he was here.  He lies in honor today. You and I were over there earlier today in the Rotunda of the Only three private citizens prior to today have been granted that honor: civil rights champion Rosa Parks in 2005 and two U.Capitol police officers who died in the line of duty in 1998, Officer Jacob Chestnut, Jr., and Detective John  Somebody observed this morning while we were in the Rotunda of the Capitol that he is surrounded there by friends he made during his life. President Eisenhower, President Ford, President Reagan, Martin Luther King all are memorialized with statues and a bust in the So Billy Graham is right at home today with people he made friends with during his life, gave advice to during his life, but never really saw as uniquely his ministry. His ministry was for people everywhere.  I might mention that President Truman--and I stand right here behind one of the desks he used when he was a Senator from He was the first President that Billy Graham met with, in 1950. President Truman, like lots of us midwesterners, closely held with his faith. When Billy Graham, at the end of their meeting, said ``Can we pray?'' President Truman said ``I guess it wouldn't hurt anything.'' That was the first opportunity Billy Graham had to pray with the many Presidents he prayed with and, I am sure, prayed for after that.  Billy Graham's mom and dad were dairy farmers like mine. He was born in Charlotte, President Trump said this morning that there was a prayer meeting in 1934 on the Graham farm. Billy Graham's father made the place available to have a prayer meeting. The focus of that prayer group of leaders from the Charlotte, NC, area was to pray that God would send a leader who would take the Gospel around the world. Probably nobody at that prayer group had any sense how close they were to somebody who was just about to begin the process to do that.  That was the year Billy Graham became a From that point on, he would say: ``My one purpose in life is to help people find a personal relationship with God, which, I believe, comes through knowing Christ.'' That is the end of a quote on his view. For so many times and in so many different ways, that was a simple statement that defined his life.  Five years after that, in 1939, he was ordained and became a pastor. He was pastoring at a church in Illinois while he went to college at Wheaton His Wheaton College education was important, but I am sure he would say that the best thing that happened there was that he met his wife, Ruth They were married for 64 years. It was a partnership. As one person went all over the world, the other person raised their five children and took care of things at home and on rare occasions was able to go with him. Her mom and dad were missionaries. This was clearly a committed life that she understood.  All five of their children were in the Rotunda of the Capitol today and in their own way, in each case, have pursued the work their parents thought was so important.  Reverend Graham didn't just preach the Gospel from inside the four walls of the church; in fact, I think it was a rare occasion when he preached in a church as opposed to the places that he preached all over the world.  In 1949, he spoke to 350,000 people over 8 weeks in Los He began to call those efforts crusades, and eventually over 200 million people would hear the message from him directly, in person. Millions more would hear the message from television, print, and movies.  By the way, I read recently that Billy Graham--a young, handsome guy--was offered a movie contract not too long after that 1949 Los Angeles crusade. He said that was not his job and that he wouldn't do it for $1 million a day. His work was clearly understood by him.  He shared Christianity with more people directly than any other person in the history of the world.  He led his first crusade in Louis, MO, in our State, in 1953. He returned in 1973 for another Louis crusade and to celebrate his 55th birthday. The Post-Dispatch reported that the revival's opening night had 20,000 people, and 4,000 people were in the choir most of the nights at that revival in  He made several trips to Kansas In 1967, the Heart of America crusade in Kansas City drew 364,000 people. The then-mayor of Kansas City, Ilus Davis, made Reverend Graham an honorary citizen and gave him a key to the city. He returned to Kansas City, MO, many times doing that work.  In 1959, he came to my hometown of Springfield, I was pleased to read just recently that he said that the Ozarks reminded him of his native North  In 1982, he spoke to a crowd at Evangel University--and this was inside--of 2,200 people.  For seven decades, Billy Graham brought the Gospel to nearly 215 million people. Despite his widespread recognition, he was always known for his humility. Whether speaking with a person on the street or the President, his main purpose was for them to share his sense of the importance of knowing his Lord, Jesus He had a message of grace, not justice; that God could forgive anything, God would forgive anything; and that nobody gets to Heaven based on their works, they get to Heaven based on their understanding of the grace of  He defended civil rights for African He insisted from the early 1950s on--actually, from the beginning of his crusades--that they would be integrated. He was a friend of Martin Luther King's. In 1957, he invited King to speak at one of his revival meetings. He later bailed King out of jail. King said: ``Had it not been for the ministry of my good friend Billy Graham, my work in the civil rights movement would not have been as successful as it has been.''  Reverend Graham spoke about critical issues. His faith inspired him to build bridges for decades. He was included in the Gallup organization's 10 most admired men in the world 61 times--more than anyone else in the history of that poll. He led a remarkable, faith-filled life. He touched many lives.  I ask unanimous consent that the February 23 Wall Street Journal article be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, 23, 2018]                    How Billy Graham Changed My Life                          (By George Bush)       Billy Graham was, with C.Lewis, one of the 20th      century's most influential figures in evangelicalism. I never      had the honor of meeting Lewis, but I did know Billy, who      died last week at 99. He changed my life.       I first met him on my grandmother's porch in Kennebunkport,      Maine, in 1985. In her 80s, she was frail but sharp. They sat      together and Billy held her hand while talking about the      Later she described it as one of the most peaceful      days of her life.       Soon after, I had my own personal encounter with As      I wrote in ``Decision Points,'' he asked me to go for a walk      with him around Walker's I was captivated by him. He      had a powerful presence, full of kindness and grace, and a      keen mind. He asked about my life in I talked to him      about Laura and our little girls.       Then I mentioned something I'd been thinking about for a      while--that reading the Bible might help make me a better      person. He told me about one of the Bible's most fundamental      lessons: One should strive to be better, but we're all      sinners who earn God's love not through our good deeds, but      through His grace. It was a profound concept, one I did not      fully grasp that day. But Billy had planted a seed. His      thoughtful explanation made the soil less hard, the brambles      less thick.       Shortly after we got back to Texas, a package from Billy      arrived. It was a copy of the[[Page S1265]]     Living He had inscribed it and included a reference to      Philippians 1:6: ``And I am certain that God, who began the      good work within you, will continue his work until it is      finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns.''       God's work within me began in earnest with Billy's      outreach. His care and his teachings were the real beginning      of my faith walk--and the start of the end of my drinking. I      couldn't have given up alcohol on my own. But in 1986, at 40,      I finally found the strength to quit. That strength came from      love I had felt from my earliest days and from faith I didn't      fully discover until my later years.       I was also fortunate to witness Billy's remarkable capacity      to minister to everyone he met. When I was governor of Texas,      I sat behind Billy at one of his crusades in San His      powerful message of God's love moved people to tears and      motivated hundreds to come forward to commit themselves to      I remember thinking about all the crusades Billy had      led over the years around the world, and his capacity to open      up hearts to This good man was truly a shepherd of the            Perhaps his most meaningful service came on 14, 2001.      After the 9/11 attacks, I asked Billy to lead the ecumenical      service at Washington National It was no easy      task. America was on bended knee--frightened, angry,      uncertain. As only Billy Graham could, he helped us feel      God's arms wrapped around our mourning country.       ``We come together today,'' he began, ``to affirm our      conviction that God cares for us, whatever our ethnic,      religious or political background may be. The Bible says that      he is `the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our      troubles.' '' God comforted a nation that day through a very      special servant.       In a difficult moment, Billy reminded me--and us all--where      we can find strength. And he helped us start to heal by      offering three lessons: the mystery and reality of evil, our      need for each other, and hope for the present and future.      ``As a Christian,'' Graham said at the 9/11 service, ``I have      hope, not just for this life, but for heaven and the life to      come.''       A final story: One night while dad was away on a trip      during his presidency, mother and I had dinner at the White      Eventually we got to talking about religion and who      gets to go to heaven. I made the point that the New Testament      says clearly that to get to heaven, one must believe in      Mother asked about the devout who don't believe in      Jesus but do God's work by serving others. She then took      advantage of one of the benefits of being first lady. She      picked up the phone and asked the White House operator to      call Reverend       It wasn't long before his reassuring Southern voice was on      the line. He told us, as I recall, ``Barbara and George, I      believe what is written in the New But don't play      He decides who goes to heaven, not you.'' Any doctrinal      certitude gave way to a calm trust that God had this figured      out better than I did.       Those of us who were blessed to know Billy Graham benefited      from his deep convictions and personal example, his wisdom      and humility, his grace and purity of heart. We knew that his      life was a gift from the And I rejoice that he is      now in the company of God, whom he loved so much and served      so well.

206,topic-id,503,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize the important contributions of the Sikh community in New Jersey and across the country. New Jersey is enriched by the diversity of its residents who have promoted a climate of social tolerance and intellectual pluralism that has sustained our State throughout its history. Since first immigrating to the United States from Punjab, India, over 100 years ago, the Sikh community has played a critical role in enhancing and contributing to New Jersey and our  This month, Sikhs in New Jersey and across the country will celebrate their most significant annual event, Vaisakhi, the Sikh New Year; providing the Sikh community the time to remember history, celebrate collectively, and recommit to their religious traditions.  The New Jersey Sikh community has demonstrated a strong commitment to public service. Every Gurdwara, the Sikh place of worship, has a Langar, a free community kitchen that serves all visitors regardless of religion, caste, gender, economic status, or ethnicity. The Langar instills the notion of equality and the brotherhood for all. Every November, the New Jersey Sikh community expands on this tradition and organizes the ``Let's Share a Meal'' event that distributes meals to homeless shelters in the area. In 2017, 275 Sikh community members prepared, packed, and delivered meals to 84 shelters over 2 days. This served more than 15,000 New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania residents.  New Jersey also recently welcomed three Sikh Americans as new public officials. On January 1, 2018, Ravi Bhalla became Hoboken's 30th mayor and the State's first Sikh mayor. Bhalla had previously served two terms on Hoboken's city council. Although Bhalla experienced periodic hateful attacks during his mayoral campaign, voters resoundingly rejected such divisive rhetoric when they elected him mayor.  In addition to electing its first Sikh mayor, New Jersey also elected Balvir Singh as a member of the Burlington County Board of Chosen Freeholders, making him the first Sikh American to win a countywide election in New Singh, who served for nearly 2 years as a member of the Burlington Township Board of Education, was sworn into office on January 3, 2018.  New Jersey is also home to the Nation's first Sikh State attorney general, Gurbir Grewal had previously served as the Bergen County prosecutor. The State Senate unanimously approved his appointment by a 29-0 vote on January 16. Grewal will enforce the law in a manner that protects all New Jersey residents.  The broad support that these three individuals garnered is a testament to New Jersey's culture of inclusion of individuals of all ethnicities and religious backgrounds.  However, we know that Sikh Americans across the country continue to endure discrimination and hateful attacks, from school bullying to verbal assaults to violence.  I invite my colleagues to join me in recognizing the important contributions of the Sikh community across the country as it celebrates its New Year festival. May we join with Sikh Americans in rejecting discrimination of any kind and embracing the rich diversity that makes each of our States strong and whole.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-04-11-pt1-PgS2069-2.txt,2194,BILL'' VARN,2018.0,11.0,February

Prior to the passage of the law and its subsequent amendments, it was legal for Americans to be denied access to housing based on their race, color, national origin, religion, gender, disability, or familial status. African-American soldiers returning from fighting for their country on foreign shores would come home to find that they couldn't purchase a house in certain neighborhoods because of the color of their skin. The Fair Housing Act was a bold commitment to eradicating this kind of discrimination, which still continues to this day.  When my own parents moved to New Jersey, illegal racial real estate steering efforts nearly kept them from buying a house in an all-White neighborhood. It took a sting operation coordinated by the local Fair Housing Council with a White couple posing as my parents to break the cycle of segregation in the town in which I would eventually grow up. The Fair Housing Act empowered my parents and their advocates and lawyers to press for their right to fair and quality housing, and it stands today as one of the seminal pieces of legislation passed in our country's history.  Today, as we recognize the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, we remember that this landmark civil rights law was not meant to be the end of our efforts to make housing in this country more fair and more just, but just the beginning.  We know we have so much work left to do when it comes to expanding access to affordable, safe, and fair housing in America, and we must remain committed to protecting and expanding on the progress made 50 years ago today by the Fair Housing  Thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-04-11-pt1-PgS2068.txt,2194,NOMINATION OF MARVIN QUATTLEBAUM,2018.0,11.0,April
617,topic-id,1348,"Mr.President, I appreciate the remarks of my senior Senator from New His passion and his commitment to this issue, not just after this mass shooting, has been consistent in fighting for commonsense gun safety for years, and I am grateful for his leadership as my senior  It has now been 2 weeks since a gunman took the lives of 17 children, teachers, and school administrators in Parkland, In the days and weeks since, we have seen young people from that community lead a movement for change that is growing in our country, standing up to special interests, standing up to the small minority of folks who seem to want to let the status quo continue, standing up to the NRA and the gun industry and making clear the fierce urgency of now, of this moment, of this day. These young people are showing what true courage is. They are showing it at a time of great grief, of great pain in their lives.  I know what they are fighting for. It is not a fringe issue. I know what they are fighting for. It is not representative of some small minority; they are fighting for the majority of Americans who agree with them, the majority of Americans who want commonsense gun safety in Those folks who own guns and those who don't want background checks for all gun buyers, including those between private dealers and gun shows.  The majority of Americans don't want people who are suspected terrorists to be able to go to a gun show and go to a private seller and drive off with a trunkful of weapons. The majority of Americans know that we should be keeping people with a history of domestic violence from getting their hands on a gun. The majority of Americans want to choke the pipeline of illegal guns that are flooding American communities from sea to shining sea, from the Great Lakes to the gulf coast.  The overwhelming majority of Americans know that we can do more to prevent gun violence. Sure, we can't stop everyone, but we can do things that will reduce the violence, reduce the[[Page S1278]]number of deaths, and save lives. These are commonsense things that the majority of Americans--gun owners, non-gun owners, Republicans and Democrats--a majority of Americans support these policies that are proven.  For example, we know it is true that in States like Connecticut, when they instituted commonsense background checks, they saw firearm homicides drop by 40 percent. And we know that States that implement laws blocking perpetrators of domestic violence from getting guns see a significant reduction--upward of 10 percent--in homicides by people's intimate partners.  We know that between 2009 and 2013, States that have required background checks on handguns saw 35 percent fewer gun deaths per capita than States that didn't.  This is fact. We know that commonsense gun safety, supported by over 80 percent of gun owners and over 90 percent of Americans, will save lives.  King once said--and I am paraphrasing here--that morality can't be legislated, but behavior can be regulated; that the law can't make someone love me, but it stop them from lynching me; that the law can't change the heart, but it can restrain the heartless.  We know we have the power to make the change.  This is no panacea. These ideas will not solve all of the problems, but they can make a difference, and they can save lives.  The time to act is right now. To not act is to be complicit in the continued levels of violence in our communities.  Every day that passes with no action--every single day we see, on average, 96 Americans in this country killed by a gun, including children. Every day that we do not act in this body, dozens and dozens of our American fellow citizens are dying due to gun violence, much of it preventable. Too many families in this country, too many fellow Americans know the pain and the grief and the agony of what we see in the faces of the children from  Gun violence isn't just manifested in uniquely horrifying mass shootings in our schools and in our churches and in our movie theaters; it is a pervasive, everyday public health epidemic. It is an everyday reality for Americans across the country. It is an everyday reality for women in Fifty women every single month are shot to death by intimate partners in this country, making the United States the most dangerous country in the developed world when it comes to gun violence against women. We know that over half of all women killed by an intimate partner are killed with a gun. We know that when a gun is involved in a situation of domestic violence, a woman is five times more likely to be killed. We can do something to lower this kind of carnage.  Gun violence is an everyday reality for children and for young people in this country. On an average day in America, 7 children and teens will be killed with a gun, and 40 more children will be shot and survive, often being crippled or severely wounded, often costing American taxpayers millions of dollars for their healthcare. We can lower this rate of carnage.  Gun violence is an everyday reality for people living in cities, like where I live. In the last year there was a shooting on my block. We know that for Black Americans living in a city or urban area in this country, they are almost 500 times more likely to be killed by gun violence than they are by terrorism. This is an urgent problem. It is an everyday problem. This is pressing on us every single day to act, and every day that we don't, our inaction will cost lives.  Since the tragedy in Parkland, in New Jersey alone we have seen children, young people, the elderly, women, Black and White Americans killed by gun violence. I have a stack of examples of this right here--news reports of the violence in my  One week ago, it was a 10-year-old boy. Yovanni Banos-Merino was killed with a gun, and his mother was wounded in Asbury Park,  The day before that, on February 20, an elderly man killed his wife--domestic violence. He killed her with a gun and then took his own life, a suicide.  Just 6 days ago, a teenager in my city of Newark, NJ, Ishmail Anthony, was killed with a gun.  Every single day we do not act, dozens and dozens of Americans are killed.  Look at this chart. We can't even read the font. Look at these American citizens--young people, old people, Black people, White people, men, women, Republicans,  Look at this chart. We know that right now, in the past 2 weeks since the tragedy, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which compiled this list from news reports, 477 Americans have been killed with a gun--in the past 2 weeks alone, 477 American citizens.  This government was formed with a purpose. It says clearly in our founding documents ``for the common defence.'' In 2 weeks, there were 477 people who we did not defend--477 people whom we could have done more to save. Again, 477 people, 2 weeks since Parkland, and we have a nation that speaks to the purpose of ensuring life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. They lost their lives.  We may not have the power to stop all gun violence, but gun owners and non-gun owners, Republicans and Democrats, and our Nation as a whole agree, with a chorus of consent, that we should do things like commonsense background checks. Our inaction, our unwillingness to do the will of the people is costly, not just to the integrity of this body, not just for the purpose of this body, but it is costly in the most grievous of ways every day. Every day, dozens die; in 2 weeks, 477.  We must do better. We can do better. With the help of God almighty, we will.  I yield the floor.

733,topic-id,1131,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss the impact that tax reform is having in my home State of  Despite what you may have heard from those who opposed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including House Minority Leader Pelosi's infamous description of the tax plan's benefits as ``crumbs'' and the passage of the plan as ``the end of the world, Armageddon,'' the economy is responding incredibly well to the changes we made to the Tax  I have long believed our economy has struggled under the weight of an outdated, inefficient, and ineffective tax system. Now, businesses are beginning to do the math and are realizing that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will mean more savings. As a result, many have announced they are passing some of these savings on to their employees or will now be seeking to grow and expand operations.  As of today, more than 350 companies have announced pay raises, bonuses and/or 401(k) increases, benefiting over 4 million According to a recent National Federation of Independent Business survey, 32 percent of small businesses believe now is a good time to expand--the highest level ever recorded by this survey.  This is happening across the country and in Here are just a few examples of the companies headquartered in Arkansas, with a sizable presence in the State, that are passing along savings to their employees through wage increases, bonuses, and other benefits, are giving to charity, and/or making investments to grow their businesses and better serve customers:  BancorpSouth Bank is giving pay increases and/or one-time bonuses to nearly all noncommissioned employees. The investment of over $10 million in 2018 will benefit 96 percent of the company's noncommissioned workforce. Pay increases were effective as of January 1, 2018.  Home Bancshares, Inc., of Conway, AR, is distributing a one-time bonus of $500 to more than 850 full-time, tenured employees. Home Bancshares' chairman, John Allison, said ``investing in these individuals is an important step to help support them, their families and the communities in which we operate.''  People's Bank of Magnolia, AR, provided a $500 bonus to employees and contributed $50,000 to its charitable endowment.  Little Rock, Arkansas-based Bank of the Ozarks is giving up to $1,200 annual bonuses. Approximately 2,300 employees will be eligible under the plan.  Walmart, whose headquarters is located in Bentonville, AR, is a significant economic force not only in our State but nationwide, is increasing starting hourly wage rates in the United States to $11 an hour, expanding maternity and parental leave benefits, and providing one-time cash bonuses of up to $1,000. It also has created a new benefit to assist associates with adoption expenses.  Regions Bank is increasing its minimum wage to $15, contributing $40 million to the company's charitable foundation, and increasing the company's capital expenditures budget by approximately $100 million, or 50 percent over the 2017 level.  Springdale, AR, is home to Tyson Foods' headquarters. The company recently announced that it is giving bonuses to more than 100,000 employees whose compensation does not include an annual bonus. Eligible full-time team members will receive a bonus of $1,000, and eligible part-time team members will receive $500.  In addition, Tyson will use savings resulting from tax reform to improve training and education opportunities for employees, including teaching English as a second language and general education development classes, and it will also be accelerating capital projects.  FedEx, whose freight headquarters is located in Arkansas and which employs over 3,500 Arkansans, is investing more than $3.2 billion in growing its business, including raising wages and investing $1.5 billion in pension plans.  Finally, UPS is investing $12 billion to expand the company's Smart Logistics Network, and it also made a $5 billion tax-qualified contribution to the company's three UPS-sponsored U.pension plans. This represents about $13,000 per participant. The company has more than 2,200 active employees in Arkansas in addition to around 390 retirees who reside in the  The numbers speak for themselves. Clearly, when Washington helps to create an environment that makes businesses more globally competitive, it benefits Arkansas, and it benefits the entire country.  The law is already helping hard-working Arkansans keep more of their money in their own pockets. By nearly doubling the standard deduction, lowering rates, eliminating loopholes, and creating a climate that incentivizes business to boost wages and give employees bonuses as a result of the reduction in the corporate tax rate, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is providing much needed tax relief to  Additionally, our Governor, Asa Hutchinson, has instructed the Arkansas Public Service Commission to examine how the new lower tax rates will benefit utility providers in He is encouraging the commission to instruct utilities to pass savings down to ratepayers, which could mean possible lower utility rates for those in the Natural  That is not all. Arkansas-based companies like ArcBest and Murphy USA are already reaping the benefits of the new tax system with higher revenues and incomes.  This is only the beginning. I believe we will continue to see positive trends and reactions to the tax law that will help grow our economy and spur even more investment in Arkansas and across the country.  One provision included in the law that I believe can have an enormous impact on average Arkansans is a new incentive for employers to offer paid family leave benefits to their employees. Now employers can offer 12 weeks of paid family leave in exchange for a tax credit.  My friend and colleague from Nebraska Senator Fischer fought to get this idea included in the bill. Thanks to her vision and perseverance, families in Arkansas and across the country who most need access to this type of benefit will now have that chance. This is just one more example of tax reform delivering results that will help the middle class.  I want to reiterate how well tax reform is working for my We are seeing growth, higher wages, and other positive benefits. Employees are getting bigger paychecks and businesses are investing in their workforces and[[Page S1212]]expanding their operations. Those are not ``crumbs.'' It is ``not Armageddon.'' It isn't an attack on working It is opportunity, it is upward mobility, and it is what Americans deserve. I am proud to have cast my vote for tax reform.  Learning about how it is helping our economy and benefiting American families just confirms what we predicted would happen if we made American businesses more competitive and let average individuals and families keep more of what they earn.  Moving forward, I am committed to ensuring that the changes we made to the Tax Code help increase economic activity and spur growth, address our national debt, and create jobs. I am confident it will have lasting, positive effects on our economy.  With that, I yield the floor.

But most of all, he understood the commission that was given at the end of Matthew: Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy  Billy Graham understood this. He understood it, and he was also very, very humble. I want to take, if I can, just a moment to go over something that was written by the author Max Lucado about a meeting that Michael Smith and his pastor had. I will just read it:  ``A few hours before the event,'' where Michael Smith and Max Lucado were going to go on stage together, ``Michael and I met to go over the weekend's schedule. But Michael was so moved by what he had just experienced, he could hardly discuss the retreat. He had just met with Billy Graham for the purpose of planning Reverend Graham's funeral. The famous evangelist was, at the time, 94 years old. He was confined to a wheelchair, on oxygen. His mind was sharp and spirits were high. But his body was seeing its final days. So he called And he called for his pastor. He wanted to discuss his funeral. He told them that he had a request.''  They both said: Of course, anything. What is it?

112,topic-id,1186,"Mr.President, thank you.  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, who has been a great advocate for moving this country forward on everything from campaign finance rules to labor, to justice, and to keeping our planet as clean as possible.  During his campaign, Candidate Trump made a lot of big promises to workers in Ohio and across the country. He told them he would put American workers first, but too often the people he has put in charge have a record of doing exactly the opposite. That is certainly true of the two nominees to the Department of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board whom we will consider this week, Patrick Pizzella and John  Think about this. They have spent their careers working to strip workers of their rights, defending corporations that are accused of mistreating workers, and trying to undermine collective bargaining rights.  Mr.Pizzella worked for disgraced former lobbyist and convicted felon, Jack They worked on the same lobbying team at the law firm of Preston Gates, trying to keep workers from being protected by Federal labor laws. These are the candidates the President of the United States, who talked about empowering workers and being on the side of workers, has nominated, one for the Department of Labor and one for the National Labor Relations They have been busy through their professional careers--and very well paid doing it--trying to keep workers from being protected by Federal labor laws.  I know everyone is entitled to representation, but when you devote your life to keeping workers from having collective bargaining, keeping workers from working in a safe workplace, and defending companies who are accused of mistreating workers, it makes you wonder.  Mr.Pizzella also previously served at the Department of Labor, but his record there gives us no reason to rehire him at the Department of He worked at the Wage and Hour He was supposed to look out for workers being cheated by their bosses out of the paychecks they had earned.  All over my State, from Cleveland to Cincinnati, from Ashtabula to Lima, from Marietta to Bryan and Toledo, I[[Page S2030]]hear stories of workers who simply couldn't fight back when their employers would occasionally cheat them out of a paycheck or overtime or misclassify them. We know most employers don't do that, but we know it happens with some regularity in communities all over my State and all over our country. That is why it is so important to have someone at the Department of Labor who looks out for the worker who doesn't often have a strong voice, as opposed to always siding with the employer on every issue.  Instead, an independent review by the Government Accountability Office found that when he was in his Department, the Wage and Hour Division was ineffective and actually discouraged workers from lodging complaints to get their hard-earned money back. So when a worker felt that he or she was cheated in the workplace, when Mr.Pizzella was in the Wage and Hour Division, those workers were reluctant to lodge complaints to get their money back because the Department of Labor was not on their side in those days.  This is the man who wants to be Deputy Secretary of He would be the second highest ranking official in charge of looking out for working men and women. His record indicates he would be more interested in looking out for corporations that want to take advantage of their workers. Isn't there enough of that in this country without the government siding with the richest, most privileged people in the country, the large corporations in the country against workers who simply don't have much of a voice? We are going to put government on the side of those corporations against those workers.  John Ring's nomination to the NLRB may be even worse. He has been nominated to be on the National Labor Relations He is supposed to be a neutral arbiter between workers and management. He has spent his career representing employers. He has attacked the agency he is seeking to join. So much is at stake with this nomination. It will likely result in a 3-to-2 anti-worker and anti-labor majority on a board that has enormous influence over American workers. It will mean big advances in the decades-long campaign to chip away at workers' power in the workplace.  We need someone in both of these jobs--Mr.Pizzella at the Department of Labor and Mr.Ring at the NLRB--who wakes up every day thinking: How do I help American workers? How do I help American workers have a safer workplace? How do I help American workers get paid fairly? How do we make sure companies do the right thing as they treat their workers? That is what they should wake up every day thinking. Instead, President Trump has nominated and is hiring two people who have spent their careers trying to push those workers down. What these folks don't seem to understand is that it is not corporations that drive the economy; it is workers.  There is a problem in this institution. The leaders in this institution--the majority leader down the hall, Senator McConnell--think you grow the economy from the top down. They think you give the richest people in the country tax cuts, you give the largest corporations in the country tax breaks, and it will trickle down and help workers.  No, that is not how you grow the economy. You grow the economy from the middle out. That is why we had greater job growth with President Obama after the auto rescue in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. More jobs were created in almost every one of those years than in 2017--President Trump's first year in office.  If work isn't valued, if corporations shortchange workers with the help of lawyers like Mr.Ring and Mr.Pizzella, then Americans can't earn their way to a better life for their families, no matter how hard they work.  In my hometown of Mansfield or where Connie and I live in Cleveland or in Cranston, RI--Senator Whitehouse's hometown, where my daughter and son-in-law and two grandchildren live--how many times do I hear people in these communities say: You know, I am working harder than ever, and I have less to show for it.  President Trump is going to put two lawyers in key places in the Federal Government who are going to stack the deck even more against those workers. The last thing we need is more people serving in Washington who don't value work and who don't respect the Americans who do it.  I urge my colleagues to listen a little more to the Americans we serve. As President Lincoln said: Go out and get your public opinion bath. Listen to workers--not just employers, not just lawyers, not just to country clubs. Go to where workers hang out. Listen a little more to the workers we serve and a little less to big corporations, which it seems these days are trying to squeeze every last penny out of their workers.

124,topic-id,1982,"Mr.President, 50 years ago today, Congress enacted the Fair Housing Act, exactly 1 week after the assassination of Martin Luther King as he fought for economic justice for sanitation workers in It also came just weeks after the Kerner Commission issued its report on the origins of urban unrest in the 1960s. This report contained the now famous warning that ``our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white--separate and unequal.''  In the wake of these events, the Fair Housing Act made discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing illegal for the first time. For generations, redlining, restrictive covenants, and outright discrimination kept families of color locked out of entire neighborhoods, often far from where jobs were, and they created segregated communities that linger to this day. They denied these families the opportunity to build wealth through home ownership. Many of these exclusionary practices were carried out by private entities and local governments. But as Richard Rothstein reminds us in his new book, ``The Color of Law''--and I recommend to everybody listening that they read that book--Federal policies also played a significant role in reinforcing segregation.  From 1934 through 1962--30 years, three decades--98 percent of all FHA mortgages went to White homeowners. In a country that in those days was about 10 percent African American, 98 percent of mortgages went to White homeowners. The Fair Housing Act made this despicable discrimination illegal. It required that Federal housing and urban development grants be administered in a way that would ``affirmatively further'' fair housing--not in a reactive way but in a way that would affirmatively further fair housing. State and local governments and public housing authorities were required to use their Federal funds in ways that would reverse, rather than accelerate or reinforce, segregation in their communities.  April 11, 1968, however, was not the end of our work to ensure fair housing and equal opportunities. Fifty years later, we haven't had the progress we should have had, and so much more needs to be done.  A new report this year from the Center for Investigative Reporting analyzed tens of millions of mortgage records and found that all across the country people of color are far more likely--even holding constant for economic situations--to be turned down for a loan, taking into account factors like their income and the size of the loan. We know that the 2008 housing crisis hit communities of color particularly hard.  In the run-up to the crisis, faulty mortgages were targeted to people of color. Even those who qualified for a no-frills, no-surprises prime mortgage were often instead steered into a subprime, much riskier loan. Even African-American and Hispanic borrowers with higher incomes than other borrowers found themselves in risky, subprime, designed-to-fail products. These practices of discrimination stripped a generation's worth of equity from communities that had fought hard for equal access to home ownership.  I know in my community in Cleveland, on the southeast side of Cleveland in the Broadway, Harvard area of that community, so much wealth has been lost. As people finally began to gain in home ownership and in wealth accumulation, what happened in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 devastated these communities. As a number of my colleagues have heard me say, in my ZIP Code of 44105, in Cleveland, OH, in the first half of 2007, there were more foreclosures than any ZIP Code in the United States of  The household wealth of communities of color still hasn't recovered. My neighborhood hasn't, my community hasn't, and my State hasn't. Middle-class Black and Hispanic families lost half their wealth from 2007 to 2013--half their wealth. Middle-income Black household wealth was $63,000 in 2007. A decade later, it was $38,000. The numbers are similar for Hispanic households--$85,000 down to $46,000.  Borrowers with these higher cost loans were foreclosed on at about triple the rate of borrowers with standard, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages. Over a recent 8-year period, 9.3 million homeowners lost their homes through foreclosure, distress sales, or surrendering their home to the lender.  After the crisis, we took steps to fight this discrimination. We created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to look after bank customers and to help root out discrimination. We required lenders to report more detailed data so that we can more easily spot modern-day redlining.  In 2015, HUD also issued the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule. This rule would have given clearer guidelines to communities to help them assess their own fair housing needs and provided them with the data they needed to inform their decisions. It would have allowed them to set their own goals and timelines.  Some of the questions communities would ask during these assessments would demand they think in new ways about how to create housing and economic opportunities for all of their residents--no matter their color, no matter family size, no matter their disability if they have one. These are the types of questions this body told the country to ask when it enacted the fair housing bill five decades ago.  But instead of recommitting ourselves to the promise we made 50 years ago, too many Washington politicians are trying to take us backward. Earlier this year, HUD suspended implementing the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule. That will not reverse the requirements of the Fair Housing Instead, it hurts communities, which will once again be left to comply with the law without the technical assistance they need.  Remember that new data that banks were going to report to make it easier to spot lenders who discriminate? The bill the Senate passed last month right here would exempt 85 percent of banks from reporting the data they are collecting and reporting today. So we are not even going to know what happened. This body has scaled back the amount of data we are trying to gather to stop discrimination. Without it, we can't monitor trends in mortgage lending. It will be harder to see who has access to affordable mortgage credit and, importantly, who does not have access.  HUD is even thinking about changing its mission statement in ways that diminish the importance of combating housing discrimination. The administration's actions over the past year make it clear they are already wavering in that commitment. For example, in 2017, HUD withdrew guidance requiring equal access for transgender people in homeless shelters. Let's pick on them even more. According to a report in the New York Times, Carson's HUD has suspended several anti-discrimination investigations, including an investigation of discriminatory housing advertisements on The administration proposed a 14-percent cut to the HUD budget, including affordable housing and community development programs aimed at creating housing and opportunity for low-income communities.  We know that one-fourth of renters in this country spend at least 50 percent of their income on housing. If one thing goes wrong in their lives, they are evicted or they lose their homes. One-fourth of people in this country who rent are paying at least half their income in housing costs. In Cuyahoga County, the second most populous county in Ohio, one-fourth of all family units, one-fourth of all residents, homeowners or renters, spend one-half of their income on housing, so it is not just renters, but it is often homeowners too.  We are deciding in this body because the President wants to--the far right in this body wants to cut spending on housing even more. We have enough money to do a huge tax cut for the[[Page S2061]]richest people in the country. The richest 1 percent will get 81 percent of that tax cut. I was talking to an accountant the other day in Elyria, It is tax season, of course, and he is busy. He said: When people come and see me, they ask inevitably when I am doing their taxes ``Well, how does this tax bill affect me?''  He asks: Are you a billionaire?  They laugh and say: Of course not.  He then says: Well, only if you are a billionaire will it affect you, and then you will save millions of dollars on your taxes.  That is a bit of an exaggeration, but that is what that tax bill is all about. So if you are a billionaire, if you are a decamillionaire, if you made a million dollars last year, you are going to save a whole lot on your taxes this year. But if you are living in working-class housing, if you can't afford much more than the very basic kind of housing or even worse than that, you are going to see your budget cut. You are going to see fewer vouchers. You are going to see less funding for housing.  What kind of government is this, this mean-spiritedness? There are more tax cuts for the richest in this country, but let's stick it to people who are barely making it. These are people who make $10 to $12 an hour. They make $10 to $12 an hour, and we are going to cut their They are making $10 to $12 an hour, and we are going to scale back their SNAP benefits. They are making $10 to $12 an hour, and we are going to undermine their housing subsidies. What is all of that about in this new government that we are living in now?  The last thing we ought to do at a time when a quarter of all renter households--400,000 families in my State of almost 12 million, 400,000 families pay half of their income in housing costs. Again, if one thing goes wrong, if their car breaks down going to work, could they come up with $500 to fix their car? Probably not. Then what happens? Then they are evicted, and then everything goes upside down because they can't pay their rent, so they get evicted. The kid has to go to a new school district. They lose most of the things they have. They have to find a place to live. They probably don't have the money for the downpayment that a landlord charges.  A few years ago, I hosted a discussion with some of my colleagues and invited Matthew Desmond, the author of the book ``Evicted.'' In the front of the book, he scribbled the phrase ``Home = Life.'' If you don't have decent housing, it is pretty hard to put a stable life together for you and your family. One of the things he said in that book is that when you get your paycheck every 2 weeks or once a month, the rent eats first. You have to pay your rent. If you can't afford to pay your rent or you can barely afford to pay your rent, you can't do much else. That simple statement captures so much--a safe, stable home is the foundation for opportunities.  This government is going to give tax cuts to the richest people in the country, and we are pulling the rug out from under people who are working every bit as hard as we do in this body--and many of them work harder than we do--just trying to get along on $8 or $10 or $12 an hour. We are denying people the opportunity of living in a safe, stable home. That is why we must redouble our commitment to fair housing. That is why we must take real, proactive steps.  My colleagues and I have legislation, the Fair and Equal Housing Act of 2017, that would add gender identity and sexual orientation to those protected from discrimination under the Fair Housing Rather than take us backward, we must take these sorts of actions to give more Americans the opportunity to have a safe, stable home and to build wealth through home ownership. We must constantly work toward King's vision--killed 50 years ago this month--of equality and equal opportunity for all.  I yield the floor.

687,topic-id,583,"Mr.President, earlier today I talked to a server who worked in a restaurant in Northeast Ohio, in Trumbull County, north of Youngstown, and she is concerned, as I am, about a proposal from the U.Department of Labor that pretty much legalizes wage theft.  We know, in this country right now, servers, or tipped workers, can be the person who pushes the wheelchair in the airport. I spoke to somebody the other day who drove one of those airport carts in the Cleveland airport. She makes $5 an hour because she is supposed to rely on tips to get up to the minimum wage, but she doesn't always get tips, or a server who works in a restaurant, in a diner in Garfield Heights or in Chillicothe, OH, and makes sometimes only $2.10 an hour and relies on tips. That is enough of a problem--that companies that employ tipped workers can pay such low wages--but that is compounded by this rule that comes out of the White House and the Department of Labor that really is tantamount to wage theft. The rule simply says the tips you put on the table at a Denny's or at a Bob Evans, the management--the employer--can take those tips and distribute them however he or she wants to other workers in the restaurant.  Now, plenty of waitresses and plenty of waiters and servers give out some of their tips, distribute them to the bartender or others, and that is their choice, but for the employer to be able to take the tips from a worker, from a server, and decide whom to give it to in the back office or in the kitchen--someone they are not paying enough to anyway; to make up for that--or for the employer to just take the money and put it in their pockets, under this rule coming out of the Department of Labor--this is the Secretary of Labor and a government that is supposed to represent workers, supposed to advocate for labor. This administration has turned that upside down, where the Secretary of Labor is advocating for employers and basically legalizing wage theft--taking that money from tipped workers who work so hard.  We know how hard everybody at a diner works. They are not making a lot of money. They rely on those tips. We are going to say--the U.Government, the Department of Labor, the President of the United States--is going to say: Oh, it is all right to take some of these tip dollars and put them in my pocket as the employer. Give it to the workers in the kitchen whom the company underpays because they are going to supplement their underpaid wages with tips. It is mean-spirited, it is legitimatizing wage theft, and we have no business doing it. There are 24 of us who have sent a letter to Secretary of Labor Acosta condemning his decision.  First of all, they did a study and found that this would take literally billions of dollars from the pockets of workers. They buried that study. We are saying, at least let that study out. Let people comment. Almost $6 billion in tips every single year will be lost because of this decision. It is a really bad idea. It is mean-spirited, and it frankly legalizes wage theft. It should be defeated.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Lee). Under the previous order, all postcloture time is expired.

730,topic-id,3053,"Mr.President, this month, Ohio laid to rest two remarkable public servants, Westerville Police[[Page S1209]]Officers Eric Joering and Anthony Together, these men dedicated decades of their lives to the police force, giving the ultimate sacrifice to keep their fellow Ohioans safe.  Officer Joering and Officer Morelli were doing their jobs, responding to a desperate 9-1-1 call when they were tragically shot and killed earlier this month. In the days since their passing, we have heard stories of their incredible service to their community, their fellow officers, and their families.  Both men were married with children. Officer Joering was 39 and had three young daughters. His pastor, Reverend Hammond, spoke to the local news about Officer Joering's dedication to his family. He said that Officer Joering would do anything for his daughters. He let them style his hair. He let them paint his nails. Reverend Hammond quipped: ``I heard he drew the line at makeup.''  Officer Morelli was a 30-year veteran of the Westerville police force. Westerville is a Columbus suburb. He had two children. His daughter is getting married this summer. His colleagues remembered his infectious smile and his passion for life. Westerville Police Chaplain James Meacham said Officer Morelli ``went to heaven and partied.''  These two heroes were laid to rest 10 days ago with services at Paul Catholic Church in Westerville, drawing thousands of Ohioans and fellow officers to pay their respects. Thousands of people waited in line in the cold and rain to enter the church. Officers from around the country came to honor these men, as they so often do. The church parking lot filled with patrol cars from Illinois, Texas, West Virginia, Michigan, and so many other They had to use a TV at a gym next door as an overflow room to accommodate everyone. After the services, a long procession of police vehicles wound its way through Ohioans lined the streets, waving American flags and wearing blue ribbons pinned to their raincoats.  The tribute to these officers won't end with that memorial service. In times of tragedy, Ohioans always rise to the occasion. A donation page for the families set up by the local Fraternal Order of Police has raised more than half a million dollars. The city of Westerville will honor Officers Morelli and Joering with a permanent memorial in First Responders The Westerville City Council voted unanimously to retire Officer Joering's K-9 partner, Officer Sam, and send him home with Officer Joering's family. They were there last week to take Sam home. One of Joering's daughters wore Sam's badge around her neck. Otterbein University, the local 4-year, private, distinguished university very nearby, will offer full-tuition scholarships to each of the three Joering girls.  While none of these gestures can ever repay them or their loved ones for their service and sacrifice, today we honor these heroes' memories and lift up the entire Westerville community and all those who knew them.  The best way for the public to honor these public servants is by supporting all Ohio officers and working to give law enforcement the resources they need to do their jobs. From the bipartisan legislation we passed last year to speed up claims processing for the families of fallen officers, to getting local police officers the resources they need to protect themselves as they fight the opioid epidemic, we must do all we can to support these women and men who sacrifice so much.  Let's honor the memory of Officer Joering and Officer Morelli by recommitting ourselves to protecting and supporting their fellow officers and the families who sacrifice alongside them.                  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  Mr.President, this month, the toy company Hasbro announced that it is introducing a new version of the board game In this version--imagine this--players get rewarded, not punished, for cheating. It is Wall Street 2018.  It might be fun to be the banker in this new, rigged version of Monopoly when you are playing with game pieces and pretend money, but it is not so fun when you are a Wells Fargo employee. It is not so fun if you have been victimized by It is not so fun if you are one of the millions of people who have had to go through the process to get restitution from their banks. Families get ripped off by shady payday lenders and by big banks. Families lose real money, not Monopoly money.  When you think about getting away with cheating and even rewarding cheaters, pretty soon, you might not have to use much imagination at all. There have always been shady corporations trying to get away with ripping off consumers. The difference is that now they have an ally in charge of the watchdog that is supposed to be policing them. It is called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau--a bureau that has done yeomen's work to protect consumers, to get restitution for consumers when they have been cheated by Wall Street, when they have been cheated by a payday lender, and when they have been cheated by some shady financial service operator.  In his short time heading the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Mick Mulvaney has done the opposite of what we used to see and the opposite of what we should expect of the person whose job it is to look out for consumers. It is called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, not the ``let's protect Wall Street in one more way'' bureau.  This month, NPR reported that in a new memo, Mulvaney laid out a ``revised mission and vision of the consumer bureau.'' What is that vision? That vision is to dismantle it and stop all the work it does to hold banks accountable. These are NPR's words: He is ``making radical changes to deter the agency from aggressively pursuing its mission''--a mission designed to protect hard-working people from banks and payday lenders who look to cheat them.  In his memo, Mulvaney actually said that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau should be ``acting with humility and moderation.'' He is saying that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau should be acting with humility and moderation, but does he ever admonish Wall Street to act with humility and moderation? It would be laughable because of the way Wall Street so often acts. We shouldn't want moderation when it comes to going after big banks and corporations who are cheating consumers. We should want aggressive actions.  Those two words, ``humility'' and ``moderation,'' are not the first two that come to mind when you think of the administration. To the surprise of many, the White House now looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives. When you talk about humility and moderation with regard to this administration, when translated in this context, it seems as though they mean to go easy on the fraudsters who are ripping off the American people.  This is the Consumer Financial Protection This isn't a Wall Street regulator who is captured by Wall Street, where you see people from Citibank and other big Wall Street entities--the $1 trillion, $2 trillion, $2 trillion-plus banks--going in and out of the revolving door, working for the regulators, and working for the banks.  This is the Consumer Financial Protection Its job was created 8 or 9 years ago to fight just as hard for American families as Wall Street lobbyists fight for their big banks. Believe me, these lobbyists don't exactly act with humility and moderation. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can't afford to.  Since it was created, this consumer bureau has returned $12 billion--that is $12,000 million--to 29 million Americans who were cheated by banks and who were cheated by payday lenders, and moderating that now is literally taking money out of the pockets of working families. Because the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been so effective, the administration has now put the fox in charge of the chicken coop--the chicken house.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which helped 29 million Americans return $12 billion because the banks were cheating them, is now run by Mick Mulvaney, who clearly doesn't even think the Bureau should exist. Nothing in this memo that he wrote should surprise anyone who has watched Mr.Mulvaney over the past few months or, frankly, his career. Although he has been running the CFPB on a part-time basis, he is supposed to be overseeing the Federal budget, so I am a little curious that the full-time Budget Director--my friend from my State of Ohio, Senator Portman, used[[Page S1210]]to run that, so he knows it is a full-time job. The administration scooped up Mr.Mulvaney and said: Well, you keep doing that, but you are going to run the Consumer Financial Protection  Mr.Mulvaney had no real interest, apparently, in running the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but he has managed to do a lot on behalf of Wall Street cheaters. His first action was to freeze payments from the Civil Penalty Fund to families who were scammed by big banks and other financial institutions. Think about that. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has levied these actions against people who cheated consumers. Mulvaney walks in the door on the first day, assembles a staff, and says: Freeze those payments. We are not going to pay them. These were actions taken by people who were looking out for consumers. They were actions they took to penalize these banks and to get restitution from these financial institutions that had cheated the public. So on his first week on the job, on his first day, he took back the hard-earned money of Americans who had been ripped off. He followed that by delaying a rule that protects consumers from predatory payday lenders, dismissing a lawsuit against those shady loan sharks.  Senator Jack Reed was out in Ohio the other day. Senator Reed and I sit on the Banking He is a West Point graduate. He is the senior Democrat on the Armed Services He talked about what happens at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base right outside of Dayton, where the payday lenders prey on these men and women who are young and perhaps not as experienced as some in having the financial sophistication to deal with some of these loan sharks, and he knows that payday lenders and others prey on these generally low-paid and underpaid men and women who have sacrificed for their country. Sometimes they initiate foreclosures on the homes of people who are overseas serving our country. But the new Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau doesn't seem all that interested in any of this.  After delaying the rule that protects consumers from predatory payday lenders, after dismissing a lawsuit against these shady loan sharks--we are talking about lenders who have been accused of deceiving customers, sometimes with payday lenders charging 9 percent interest and trying to collect debts people don't even owe. Those people should be protected. You don't protect Wall Street; you protect people who have been defrauded by Wall  It is not that complicated, but apparently at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, it is now. Most payday lenders are getting an even better return on their campaign donations than they are on their predatory loans.  Mulvaney has put on ice another case that has been pending against Wells Fargo, this time for wrongly charging borrowers fees when they took out a mortgage.  At his day job running another Federal agency, Mulvaney proposed a budget earlier this month that would defund the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau entirely for a year--defund it--basically saying: We are spending no more money on this Consumer Financial Protection  Philosophically, he just doesn't like the idea of somebody standing up for customers, standing up for consumers, standing up against Wall Street, standing up against the payday lenders, and standing up against the loan sharks that he seems to be in alliance with.  We shouldn't be surprised by any of this. Mr.Mulvaney, the person heading the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau now, is a man who doesn't even think the Bureau should exist. He said some time ago that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is ``a sick, sad joke.'' He sponsored legislation to repeal it.  How do you explain to 29 million Americans who have gotten $12 billion in restitution because they were cheated that this is a sad, sick joke and it shouldn't exist? It is no joke to the servicemembers who rely on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to fight for them against bank abuse. It is no joke to the 3\1/2\ million--3\1/2\ million--victims of Wells Fargo's fake account scam or the 145 million Americans, with 5 million in my State alone--145 million Americans, that is pretty much half the adult population in our country--who had their data breached by The Equifax executives had little contrition and didn't apologize much, and they are skating free. What is Mick Mulvaney doing to help roughly half of the adult population in this country who were the victims of the Equifax breach to make sure it doesn't happen again? Absolutely nothing.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was investigating this massive breach, but Mulvaney ordered them to close the investigation. This is malpractice or worse. We are talking about a data breach that exposed birthdays, Social Security numbers, and addresses. People's identities could be stolen and their credit scores ruined. Did Mr.Mulvaney care? Apparently not. He was on the side of Equifax when he wasn't on the side of Wall Street, when he wasn't on the side of payday lenders, when he wasn't on the side of scam artists--and maybe he is on the side of all of them. But apparently he thinks it is more important to protect the corporations that let it happen than it is to protect the American people he is supposed to serve. I guess we shouldn't be surprised.  Once again, Mick Mulvaney and this administration are making it clear whose side they are on. Over and over, they side with Wall They side with the largest corporations. They side with companies that shut down production in Gallopolis, Mansfield, and Zanesville and move their companies overseas. They side with them instead of with hard-working Americans who are struggling. We see it at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with Mulvaney's determination to protect corporate special interests. We see it with other bank watchdogs who are putting Americans at risk of another financial crisis just to help Wall Street pad their pockets.  Mr.President, as you know, America's financial system has had a really, really, really good couple of years, even though we bailed them out. Ten years ago, this Congress bailed out these huge banks--$1 trillion, $2 trillion banks. We bailed them out.  Congress passed a tax bill in which 81 percent of the benefits go to the richest 1 percent of people in this country. It is believed that the financial services industry did better under that tax bill than anyone else in the country--any other industry. Now we see Mick Mulvaney and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau doing even more for the banks by representing them instead of representing workers and consumers.  As I said, it is increasingly clear whose side the administration is on. We have seen it with the rollback of rules that protect Americans from the fine print in contracts, the fine print that few of us read and even fewer of us could understand. When we sign up for a credit card, when we sign up for a car loan, when we get a job and we sign a contract with our employer, these fine print, forced administration clauses--you know what they did? They denied customers and employees who were cheated their day in court. So when you sign up for a credit card and you sign a bank document and then you want to sue because they did something to you that you thought was against the law, you are out of luck. You have lost your right because you signed that document.  We see it right here in the Senate with bills to dismantle Wall Street reform, to make it easier for big banks to take big risks that could wreck the economy all over again.  At the 10-year anniversary of the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression, there is already a collective amnesia that has settled over this town. The Republican leaders in Congress, people down the hall in the office of the majority leader, Senator McConnell--over and over, they side with Wall Street instead of with workers.  Ten years ago we saw what Wall Street and the financial services industry, particularly Wall Street, did to our country. My wife and I live in Cleveland, Our ZIP Code is 44105. Our ZIP Code 10 or 11 years ago had more foreclosures in the first half of that year than any other ZIP Code in the United States of I still see the blight because of the Wall Street abuse in the loss of retirement[[Page S1211]]savings, the lost jobs, the closed factories, and the foreclosed homes. I see all of that in my neighborhood. I see all of that throughout my We all see it in all 50 Yet there is this collective amnesia in this body, as if none of that ever happened to this country. This administration and Republican leaders, again and again and again, side with Wall Street over workers, side with Wall Street over customers.  The lessons of a decade ago are clear. You don't grow the middle class by letting big banks take massive risks or by letting shady lenders prey on hard-working That is why we passed Wall Street reform, and that is why we created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau--to hold big banks and other bad actors accountable when they cheat, to deter them from bad and risky behavior in the first place.  We need a new permanent Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who will protect the consumers instead of handing big corporations a ``get out of jail free'' card. A cheater's version of Monopoly might sound like fun on game night, but we have already seen what it looks like in real life. Powerful special interests on Wall Street win big every single time, and everybody else loses.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

154,topic-id,3096,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation.  The rule makes in order one bill reported favorably by the Committee on Financial The committee held several hearings on the topics within this bill in the spring of 2017.  Additionally, it was marked up in committee, and a Democrat amendment in the nature of a substitute was adopted by voice. The bill was reported by a strong, bipartisan vote of 50-10. The rule makes in order no amendments to the bill. Why? Because there were none offered.  Additionally, the rule provides the opportunity for this House to consider a balanced budget amendment and more than quadruples the time for debate on the floor than it would otherwise be provided.  Mr.Speaker, once again, I have the opportunity to come down to the floor and manage debate for a Financial Services bill. Thinking of the process that I just referenced a moment ago, one thing routinely strikes me: so many of these Financial Services bills are overwhelmingly bipartisan within the Committee on Financial  There always seems to be a common theme and political rhetoric that Republicans are shills for the banking industry. Setting a rebuttal to that aside for now, the underlying bill before us contains a wholly bipartisan piece of legislation.  That a committee run by Republicans would have a process whereby we bring to the floor a major piece of reform legislation offered by both a Republican and a Democrat is a real testament to the fact that this House can work. I commend Chairman Hensarling for running the committee in such a way.  Mr.Speaker, our small town and community banks are a much bigger part of our lives than many may realize. Often here in Washington, we get caught up in big players in industry. We talk about Wall Street and Silicon We speak of countries and international relations. However, all across this great land, Americans in small, medium, and large communities go about their business and conduct their day-to-day affairs without any of the issues that consume Washington touching their lives.  Most Americans just simply want Washington to leave them in peace, to allow them to live their lives without politics and government intruding at every step. This Financial Services bill before us speaks to those concerns. This is legislation for Main Streets all across this  Mr.Speaker, there are nearly 6,000 community banks across this country with 52,000 locations. These banks are the backbone of our communities' finances. Collectively, they hold more than $3.2 trillion in loans to consumers. They provide nearly 50 percent of all small business loans and nearly 80 percent of all agriculture loans.  How is it that they claim such a huge portion of loans within our communities? It is simple. They are also part of the community that they serve, and they extend credit based on personal knowledge of their neighbors and their local economy.  But they are more than just organizations that lend and offer banking services. They are small businesses that employ more than 750,000 Clearly, community banks are key partners in our communities. They are particularly important lenders in rural towns and counties, such as the ones I represent in eastern  Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen summed it best when she said: ``We know that community banks serve many customers that large banks do not and provide services that are not offered by large banks in many communities. This circumstance is especially true in rural areas and other small communities, where community banks are sometimes the only retail financial institutions.''  However, even with their importance to Americans, they have borne the brunt of regulation under Dodd-Each new regulation drives up costs and forces personnel resources to be diverted to compliance efforts. Even if a particular institution is not ultimately subject to a rule, it must spend resources on each new regulation released to verify whether any part of its operations are impacted or not.  These costs place a drain on operations which consumes resources that otherwise would be used for growth.  The Federal Reserve Board recently released data that showed that small bank lending in rural areas had declined by 46 percent since 2005. According to the Independent Community Bankers of America, a 2014 survey of community banks revealed that 78 percent of banks reported adding personnel just to deal with increased regulation.  By consuming resources that could otherwise be placed into serving customers and increasing lending, community banks are many times forced to consolidate just to remain alive. Today, there are 1,700 fewer community banks than there were in 2010. As of May 2017, only three new banks were formed since the financial crisis.  It is clear that our community banks are suffering under an unbearable regulatory burden. And when our community banks suffer, our small towns and rural communities suffer also.  The underlying bill before us today exempts community banks from yet another regulation that lumps small institutions with big banks. The Volcker rule was implemented by Dodd-It was intended to keep banks from engaging in a practice known as proprietary trading. Proprietary trading is a practice where a financial institution such as a bank uses its own finances to buy and sell stocks and other investments so as to make a profit for itself.  Because of their importance to each individual American, but also to our broader economy, we should consider carefully how we allow financial institutions to operate. However, the real[[Page H3106]]impact of the Volcker rule on community banks has served to undermine investment options in our smaller communities.  All across this country, particularly in rural communities, entrepreneurs, farmers, and others sell their equity or bonds in order to raise capital to grow and expand. However, if community banks were prohibited from buying these financial instruments, then the sellers would have to find buyers on their own. That is a highly impractical situation.  Under the Volcker rule, an entrepreneur cannot approach their community bank and offer to sell a portion of their equity to the bank. Why? Because Dodd-Frank prohibits the banks from making its own investments. What sense does this make? Where is the entrepreneur supposed to go to find a buyer for their equity? Are they supposed to go door-to-door looking for someone who might want to invest? That is nonsense.  Community banks play a vital role in purchasing these financial instruments and holding them until the bank is approached by a willing buyer. Or maybe the bank holds them for a brief period as they know they have a customer who is searching for this type of investment.  Either way, this is not an evil practice that we should prohibit. The community bank's actions are making a marketplace for these investment transactions, and this should be encouraged. It increases access to capital for small businesses and farms in our communities.  But it is not just on the selling side of the equation that this practice benefits. It also benefits the buying side of the equation. Many Americans have invested a portion of their retirement savings in pension funds, mutual funds, or similar types of investments. These funds need for their investments to be liquid so as to meet demands for cash from the people who have chosen to save their money in the funds.  These funds often place these cash investments into smaller financial institutions through purchasing the stocks or bonds that these banks own. The banks allow these larger funds to purchase the bank's assets and also to sell back to the bank the same assets when the funds need cash.  This isn't a shady practice. This is an extraordinarily important practice and benefits every single American who has saved or is saving money in a pension or other retirement account.  The Volcker rule prohibits this activity. Washington, in its typically arrogant way, decided that it knew better than Americans and banned this under Dodd- On December 10, 2013, the five--I repeat, the five--separate agencies tasked with writing and enforcing this regulation released a final regulation that is 932 pages long and contains nearly 300,000 words.  That is astounding. What small town community bank can, on top of all of the other regulations heaped upon them, carve out the necessary resources to comply with such a burden?  When we had this bill at Rules Committee yesterday, one of my colleagues on the committee related a story of visiting one of his community banks. He indicated that it was a fairly small bank. The owner of the bank walked him into the back operations office and pointed to 14 staff members working. All of them were working exclusively on complying with regulations. That is 14 people not serving customers, or seeking new depositors, or helping the community grow. What a sad state to which we have arrived.  Washington heaps, and heaps, and heaps burdens on the backs of Americans day in and day out. Technocrats make it harder and harder to achieve success in this land.  We are still a land of opportunity, but that gift is threatened daily by our bureaucracy. Endless regulation of every meaningful detail of our lives is antithetical to the American way.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1230  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.Buck) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this closed rule and to the underlying legislation. Quite frankly, I had hoped that, when we returned from our Easter break, we would be debating and voting on legislation that would help people. I had hoped that maybe we would be able to finally help the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers whose lives are now in limbo because of President Trump's decision to end DACA and that we would be able to pass a bill called the Dream Act to actually provide them some peace of mind. But, no, we don't see that on the schedule.  I had also hoped that maybe we would do something to address the epidemic of gun violence in this country. Millions of young people all across the country have been protesting in front of congressional offices and have been holding rallies demanding that Congress debate the issue of gun violence and do something. No, we are not doing that.  Instead, what we are doing is another bill to help the financial services industries, and in that effort, we are doing something that I think is going to make consumer protections less relevant. This week, again, the Republican leadership of this House is ignoring the most pressing issues facing our country and our constituents in favor of more legislation to roll back financial protections put into place to prevent another financial crisis.  Need I remind my friends on the other side of the aisle how damaging the 2008 financial crash was? Millions upon millions of Americans--our constituents, Mr.Speaker--lost their homes, and they lost their jobs and their life savings. Many of these families have still not fully recovered from these terrible financial blows.  In response, Democrats in Congress came together to pass the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, landmark legislation to address risk in our financial system and ensure our constituents are protected from another damaging financial crisis.  Dodd-Frank isn't perfect. Nobody in this Congress says it is. But I strongly object to the calculated campaign by Republicans in this House to continue to chip away at the law, making our financial markets more vulnerable just to benefit their billionaire donors.  One of the key provisions of Dodd-Frank is the Volcker rule. It prohibits banks from engaging in risky trading activities that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. Simply put, it prevents banks from acting like casinos and gambling with our money.  The rule we are considering today provides for consideration of H.4790, legislation to undermine the Volcker rule by exempting certain banks from the requirements. The bill also puts rulemaking authority solely in the hands of the Federal Reserve, making it easier for the Trump administration to further weaken or eventually repeal this vital consumer protection.  Now, that is, of course, the goal of my Republican colleagues in the first place. They have continually advanced legislation to roll back and weaken the rules put into place to prevent another financial crisis. It is deeply frustrating, and more importantly, it is very dangerous to the financial security of the American economy and American families.  Now, Mr.Speaker, this rule also provides for additional debate time on the Republican majority's misguided balanced budget amendment, H.2.  Normally, when legislation of this magnitude is debated, the leadership of this House brings it through the Rules Committee to set the terms of debate and to allow for alternative proposals to be offered and debated. This will be the seventh time a balanced budget amendment has been voted on in the  In the past, it has generally been considered under a structured rule granting many hours of general debate, making in order substitute amendments, and providing the minority with a motion to recommit. But as they did in 2011, Republicans will once again bring this legislation to the floor under suspension of the rules, providing no opportunity--none--for Members of the majority or the minority to offer any substitute amendments.  Now, why does this matter, Mr.Speaker? It matters because this legislation, the so-called balanced budget amendment, could do irreparable harm[[Page H3107]]to our economy. It would hinder Congress' ability to respond appropriately to an economic crisis and could potentially even create one. It could even require Congress to cut funding for safety net programs that millions of our constituents rely on, programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP--which is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program--Supplemental Security Income, and veterans' pensions.  We owe it to our constituents to have a full and open debate on this legislation, to hear from experts and to thoughtfully consider alternatives. But this Republican majority didn't even take the time to hold a hearing or a markup on H.2. They are rushing it to the floor under suspension of the rules with no opportunity for us to consider any alternative proposals whatsoever.  We are talking about amending the Constitution of the United Why in the world would we want to use such a flawed process on such an important issue? Mr.Speaker, because maybe this isn't a serious effort in the first place. My Republican friends know this awful legislation will never become law.  So why are we wasting the House's time on this effort? I have a simple answer: to appease the far-right wing of the Republican Party in an election year and to give the impression that these guys, these Republicans, are somehow fiscally responsible.  You don't have to take my word for it. Republican Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania confirmed in the press this week that this is merely a messaging vote. If you think this is cynical, consider for a moment the impetus of bringing this legislation to the floor.  Press reports indicate that Speaker Ryan agreed to a vote on the balanced budget amendment in exchange for votes to advance the Republican tax scam. Can you believe that? Speaker Ryan, the leader of this House, is advancing legislation that could do irreparable harm to our economy and our safety net just so he could jam through his precious tax giveaway to corporations and wealthy donors last  Let me remind everyone just how terrible the tax scam Republicans rammed through Congress really is:  It raises taxes on 68 million middle class families to give 83 percent of the tax cuts included in the bill to the wealthiest 1 percent of  It gives a $1.3 trillion tax rate break to the largest corporations in this country and rewards these same corporations for shipping jobs overseas.  Here is the other part: it explodes the deficit by $2 trillion, jeopardizing the future of Medicare and  But this balanced budget amendment is supposed to trick people into believing Republicans still care about fiscal responsibility. It really is disheartening.  There is a pattern here, Mr.At every turn, House Republicans favor the well-off and well-connected while ignoring the needs of those in the middle class and working class and certainly turning their backs on those struggling in poverty.  I meet with constituents in my district every day. Quite frankly, they don't ask what we are doing to repeal Dodd-They certainly don't ask us to ransack Social Security and cut Medicare to give tax breaks to big corporations.  They want better jobs and they want better wages. They want us to fix our crumbling infrastructure in their communities and to invest in education. They want us to protect our water and air from pollution. They made it clear to us last month, when over 1 million young people took to the streets across this country, that they want action on legislation to protect our communities from the plague of gun violence.  But the Republican leadership is ignoring this call, and it is ignoring any call for progress in favor of legislation to help the wealthy and well-connected donor class.  I get it. They need all this money for reelection. But the price is being paid by the American people. They are getting legislation that is not in their best interest but is in the best interest of a few wealthy donors.  It is reckless and it is wrong. Over 56 percent of the legislation that we have considered in the Rules Committee this year--that is over half--has been bills to roll back regulations on Wall Street and the financial industry. I don't see millions of people protesting in the street to give Wall Street a bigger break. I don't hear the voices being raised all across this country to say: ``Let's make the rich even richer. Let's do more to give corporations tax breaks.'' I don't hear that, and yet that is what the focus of this Congress has been about.  By the way, the vast majority of these bills to help the well-connected and the well-off haven't even gone through regular order. This whole process has been a joke. The legislation we are set to consider later this week is no exception.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this restrictive rule, to oppose efforts to weaken the Volcker rule, and to oppose the balanced budget amendment when it is considered later this week.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-04-11-pt1-PgH3105.txt,2233,THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF REVEREND BILLY GRAHAM,2018.0,11.0,March

Mr.Speaker, the hypocrisy of the Republican majority is on full display today. After passing a $1.5 trillion tax scam bill that showers all the benefits on the wealthy and very rich corporations, we are now going to consider an amendment to the Constitution to balance the Federal budget on the backs of hardworking Americans by eviscerating social safety net programs.  According to the AARP, this balanced budget amendment could subject Social Security and Medicare to deep cuts without regard to the impact on the health and financial security of our most vulnerable citizens.

Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the AARP's letter.                                                         AARP,                                                    April 9, 2018.       Dear Member: AARP is writing to express our opposition to a      balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United      AARP is the nation's largest nonprofit, nonpartisan      organization dedicated to empowering Americans 50 and older      to choose how they live as they age. With nearly 38 million      members and offices in every state, the District of Columbia,      Puerto Rico, and the U.Virgin Islands, AARP works to      strengthen communities and advocate for what matters most to      families with a focus on health security, financial stability      and personal fulfillment.       A balanced budget amendment would likely harm Social      Security and Medicare, subjecting both programs to      potentially deep cuts without regard to the impact on the      health and financial security of individuals. It would also      likely diminish the resources available for programs      assisting Americans who are least able to provide for      themselves--services such as meals or heating for those who      are too poor or physically unable to take care of their basic      needs without some support.       A balanced budget amendment would prohibit outlays for a      fiscal year from exceeding total receipts for that fiscal      year. It would impose a constitutional cap on all spending      that is equivalent to the revenues raised in any given year.      Because revenues fluctuate based on many factors, spending      would, out of necessity fluctuate as well under a balanced      budget amendment. Consequently, Social Security and Medicare      benefits would also fluctuate, potentially subjecting each to      sudden or deep cuts. Social Security and Medicare would      therefore cease to provide a predictable source of financial      and health security in retirement under a balanced budget      amendment.       The lack of a dependable Social Security and Medicare      benefit would be devastating for millions of      Social Security is currently the principal source of income      for half of older American households receiving benefits, and      roughly one in five households depend on Social Security      benefits for nearly all (90 percent or more) of their income.      Over 50 million Americans depend on Medicare, half of whom      have incomes of less than $24,150. Even small fluctuations in      premiums and cost sharing would have a significant impact on      the personal finances of older and disabled       Individuals who have contributed their entire working lives      to earn a predictable benefit during their retirement would      find that their retirement income and health care out of      pocket costs would vary significantly year-to-year, making      planning difficult and peace of mind impossible.[[Page H3108]]       It is particularly inappropriate to subject Social Security      to a balanced budget amendment given that Social Security is      an off-budget program that is separately funded through its      own revenue stream, including significant trust fund reserves      to finance benefits. Imposing a cap on Social Security      outlays is unjustifiable, especially when the Social Security      trust funds ran a surplus for decades--reducing the past need      for additional government borrowing from the public--and      resulted in a public debt that is less today than what it      otherwise would have been.       Older Americans truly understand that budgets matter and      that we all need to live within our means. However, they also      understand that budgets affect real people; and they      certainly understand the difference between programs to which      they have contributed and earned over the course of a      lifetime of work, and those they have not.

Even for this record-breaking closed Republican Congress, to attempt to amend our Constitution for only the 28th time in our Nation's history in this manner, quite frankly, is stunning.

157,topic-id,1850,"Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, the Republican majority is attempting to amend the United States Constitution with a bill that has had no hearing, no markup, and will be considered without any opportunity to offer amendments or even a motion to recommit.  We have only amended the Constitution 27 times in our Nation's history. Why isn't the Republican leadership treating this with the seriousness that it deserves? Maybe because even conservative members of their own party know that this vote is a charade.  In a Politico article titled ``Conservatives irate over GOP spending hypocrisy,'' Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows said: ``There is no one on Capitol Hill, and certainly no one on Main Street, that will take this vote seriously.''  I couldn't agree more. Republicans just added almost $2 trillion to the deficit with their tax cut for billionaires. As the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said in the same article: ``This reads as, `Give us something to hide behind,' rather than a serious process proposal.''  But we are here because Republican leadership is trying to check a box, as the Club for Growth put it, in hopes that people will forget their tax scam giveaway. And no wonder why Congress' approval rating is at just 15 percent. This is a dangerous gimmick that my Republican colleagues are pushing. If this is successful, it will lead to major cuts to Social Security, to Medicare, and to We need to take that seriously, and we need to stop it.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record this Politico article titled ``Conservatives irate over GOP's spending hypocrisy.''[[Page H3109]]                       [From POLITICO, 10, 2018]           Conservatives Irate Over GOP's Spending Hypocrisy                   (By Rachael Bade and Sarah Ferris)       House Republican leaders, stung by President Donald Trump's      rebuke of Congress' recent trillion-dollar spending spree,      are moving to give their rank and file cover by passing a      balanced budget amendment this week.       But many conservatives, including a good number of House      Republicans, say the vote is insincere at best--and blatantly      hypocritical at worst.       ``There is no one on Capitol Hill, and certainly no one on      Main Street, that will take this vote seriously,'' said      Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), on the heels      of a $1.3 trillion spending package that Republicans approved      just last month.       ``Leadership is just trying to check a box here,'' added      Andrew Roth, vice president for government affairs at the      Club for ``I don't see how voters can distinguish      between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to      spending.''       One conservative commentator, Barbara Boland, equated the      upcoming exercise to ``gorging on a sumptuous feast while      insisting that you want a svelte physique.'' And other      members of the House Freedom Caucus, all of whom voted      against a $1.3 trillion spending package in late March, are      calling it little more than a charade.       ``The time to get spending under control was four weeks      ago,'' said Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), again referring to the      late-March spending vote. ``Coming back four weeks later and      saying, `Oh, now we're going to pound our chest like Tarzan      and say we're for a balanced budget amendment,' it's not      going to fool anybody.''       Jordan and Meadows support the balanced budget amendment as      a marker for fiscal austerity--it's the timing of the vote,      on the heels of the spending bonanza, that rankles them and      other conservatives.       The proposal requires supermajorities in both chambers to      pass, as well as ratification by three-quarters of the      states, an impossible hurdle. But with Republicans swimming      in red ink--the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office      projected regular trillion-dollar annual deficits starting in      2020, despite a growing economy--the party feels pressure to      do something.       The CBO's deficit forecast hasn't been that bleak since the      Great And this time, Republicans can't blame      Barack Obama and the       Rather, it's a result of a combination of GOP-approved      bills: tax cuts that CBO now expects to add $1.9 trillion to      the deficit over 10 years; a newly passed bipartisan deal to      raise strict spending caps by $320 billion for two years; and      a recent $100 billion infusion of cash into emergency      disaster coffers--almost entirely unpaid for.       The balanced budget amendment has been a staple of the GOP      playbook going back at least to Newt Gingrich's 1994 Contract      with It often resurfaces after major spending      battles that leave conservatives feeling jilted. The last      vote, for instance, followed the 2011 debt ceiling crisis,      when Republicans were anxious about the national debt, which      now tops $20 trillion.       Republicans are returning to it two weeks after Trump      chided Congress for wasting money in the omnibus spending      deal--a scolding that came as the president backed away from      a threatened veto and signed it.       ``I will never sign another bill like this again,'' Trump      vowed, adding that ``there are a lot of things I'm unhappy      about'' with it.       His remarks, GOP lawmakers and aides say, effectively threw      every Republican who backed the bipartisan deal under the bus      at a time when the party already faces an uphill battle      retaining its majority this fall.       Hill Republicans were shocked because White House staff      members were in the room negotiating the budget deal with the      top four leaders in both chambers. They had reassured some      skittish Republicans that it was OK to take the vote because      Trump would have their backs.       When they returned home afterward for the spring recess,      some Republicans caught flak from constituents, which in turn      sent GOP leaders into damage-control mode.       ``This reads as, `Give us something to hide behind,' rather      than a serious process proposal,'' said Maya MacGuineas,      president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget,      who said she'd believe the sincerity of the effort when      Republicans propose a budget with actual spending cuts.       Not all fiscal hawks are scorning the effort. Republican      Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker (R-N.C.), who asked for      a vote on a balanced budget amendment in October, applauded      the looming vote--even as he acknowledged the uncomfortable      timing for the Walker argued that it's consistent for      Republicans to back the amendment after voting for the      omnibus, because of the need to fund the military. Walker      added, though, that most members pushing hard for deficit-     reduction votes right now personally opposed the spending      bill, as he did.       ``We don't see this as a show vote. We need this. It's      something that we've been talking about for years,'' Walker      said       The balanced budget amendment is one of several measures      GOP leaders might bring to the floor in the coming weeks to      signal their commitment to lower spending. The effort is      being led by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.),      who is working with the White House to try to force a vote on      a ``rescissions'' package that would cut billions of dollars      from the just-approved omnibus legislation.       It's still unclear whether the House will take up the      measure, which GOP aides say could cut as much as $20      billion. House appropriators hate the idea, and some more      pragmatic-minded Republicans argue it would cripple      bipartisan spending negotiations in the future.       Republicans clinched the amount they got for defense only      because they gave Democrats some money for their own pet      projects. A move to recoup money retroactively would      infuriate Democrats--even though GOP leaders fully expect it      would fail in the       GOP leaders similarly expect the balanced budget amendment      to fail this week in the It requires 290 votes for      passage; the last time lawmakers voted on one, in 2011, it      failed 261-165, with 25 Democrats backing the bill.       Speaker Paul Ryan was one of only four Republicans to      oppose the measure at the time. It is unclear whether he will      do so again this year. He said the proposal before the House      then could have led to higher taxes to pay for more spending.       A balanced budget amendment would tightly restrict federal      spending and require two-thirds of lawmakers to approve any      tax changes. Critics argue it would trigger hundreds of      billions of dollars in across-the-board cuts.       Ironically, a balanced budget amendment would have      potentially prevented the GOP Congress' biggest legislative      achievement this year: tax reform. With the amendment,      Republicans could not have enacted tax cuts that weren't paid      for; these ones were not. The GOP also probably couldn't have      gotten the huge budget increase for the Pentagon that was      included in the omnibus.       In the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)      suggested Tuesday that he might follow suit on a balanced      budget amendment vote. He said a vote is ``likely . . . at      some point.''       Democrats are blasting Republicans for what House Minority      Whip Steny Hoyer called a ``political stunt.'' The Maryland      Democrat on Tuesday said Republicans are ``worried'' about      the midterm elections and ``they're flailing about.''       ``It sounds to me very much,'' he said, ``like they're . .      . saying one thing and doing another, speaking out of both      sides of their mouth.''  Mr.Congressman  Jim Jordan of Ohio, again another Freedom Caucus member, said on the balanced budget amendment: ``The time to get spending under control was 4 weeks ago. Coming back 4 weeks later and saying, `Oh, now we're going to pound our chest like Tarzan and say we're for a balanced budget amendment,' it's not going to fool anybody.''  I would argue that the time to get spending under control was when Republicans exploded the deficit with their tax cut for billionaires. I agree with Mr.Jordan on this: A sham vote like that isn't going to fool anybody.  Mr.Speaker, while I think everybody knows that what is going to happen on this balanced budget amendment is really show business, I think it is important to stress that it really underlines the values of my friends on the Republican side and what they think is important and what they believe is important to protect. As I said, if this or anything like what they are proposing ever became the law of the land, programs like Social Security, like Medicare, and like Medicaid would be at risk. There are no provisions in their draft to protect these programs that so many millions of Americans rely on.  And again, this is not surprising because we have seen over the years their attempts to privatize Social Security, their attempts to privatize Medicare, their attempts to undermine Medicaid, their constant attacks on programs like This is nothing new.  Mr.Speaker, I just want to close by saying to my Republican friends that there are some things worth defending, and programs like Social Security and programs like Medicare are worth defending. They are worth fighting for. And I want to make it clear that, on the Democratic side, any Republican attempts to undermine, to weaken, to undercut Social Security or Medicare, we will fight you. We will fight you with every ounce of energy and strength that we have because these programs are important. They are important to our values, but more importantly, they are important to our constituents.  With that, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question and ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.

The Volcker rule, passed under Dodd-Frank, is a solution in search of a problem. Our community banks should not have to bear the weight of this overarching regulation.

The material previously referred to by Mr.McGovern is as follows:          An Amendment to 811 Offered by Mr.McGovern       In section 2(a), insert ``as amended by the amendment      specified in section 3 of this resolution'' after ``United      States''.       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      section:       ``3. The amendment referred to in section 2(a) of this      resolution is as follows:       `After section 7, insert the following section (and      redesignate the subsequent section accordingly):     SECTION 8. EXEMPTION OF SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE, AND                    MEDICAID FROM FEDERAL BALANCED BUDGET                    REQUIREMENT       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the following      programs and any outlays resulting therefrom shall be exempt      from any Federal balanced budget requirement:       (1) All Social Security benefits payable under title II of      the Social Security       (2) Payments under the Medicare program under title XVIII      of the Social Security       (3) Payments to States under the Medicaid program under      title XIX of such Act.' ''.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

926,topic-id,2058,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation.  Just 3 weeks ago, we hosted a small lender in my district office who was being hindered in his efforts to serve home buyers in eastern Why? Washington, in its unyielding effort to regulate every decision of Americans, lumped this lender into a broader regulation that came out of the housing crisis 10 years ago. This isn't some theoretical exercise. These regulations have real impact on  The last time I was on the floor debating these issues, I discussed the affordable housing situation in Without completely recounting that debate, I want to reiterate the basic facts.  From 2009 to 2016, Colorado had a net increase of 600,000 people. In that same time, housing costs skyrocketed by more than 57 percent.  Since 2016, our growth has begun to fall off considerably. When The Denver Post researched why a State with a high quality of life and decades more growth potential had a dramatically slowing growth rate, they found that a substantial part of it had to do with rising housing costs.  We must reconsider our Washington-knows-best regulatory approach. We here in Washington can't possibly know what is the best for a potential home buyer in Trinidad or Las Animas or Fort Morgan or Greeley or Castle Rock,  I, for one, am tired of the arrogance of Washington telling us in eastern Colorado which banks we can and can't use to finance our mortgages. It is time that we bring financial accountability to the place that needs it most:  That is what these two financial bills do. They return power to the American people. They reduce unnecessary regulations on small community banks and credit unions, thereby freeing up capital that small businesses and employers can access to create new jobs. They make commonsense changes to Federal laws so that regulators have to routinely review their regulations to ensure that the regulations are not overly burdensome.  Eastern Coloradans are frustrated with the Washington-knows-best mindset of their government, and I am listening to them.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.Buck) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution, which provides for the consideration of two bills from the House Financial Services Committee--H.4607, the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act, and H.4296, legislation to undercut operational risk capital requirements--under a completely closed process.  These are the 66th and 67th closed rules of this Congress, Mr.I am deeply concerned with the Republican leadership's total lack of consideration for regular order.  For all intents and purposes, regular order is dead in this We consider one closed rule after another after another after another, and Republicans routinely rush bills to the floor without even holding hearings on the underlying legislation to help Members better understand the impacts of these bills and to benefit from expert witnesses.  What is especially shameful about the process today, Mr.Speaker, is the fact that there were amendments submitted, but Republicans decided to self-execute these nongermane amendments with no debate or discussion on the House floor and to shut down the ability of Members to offer additional amendments. This is just bad legislating, plain and simple.  I hope that if November turns out the way I hope it does and we have a change in leadership in Congress, when Democrats are in charge, we run this place like professionals, like adults, where we respect all points of view, where we go back to regular order, when we say we are going to go back to regular order, we mean it.  Why are we doing all of this, Mr.Speaker? What is possibly so urgent that we have to throw regular order out the window?  Today, we are considering another two pieces of deregulatory legislation that will benefit big banks at the expense of financial stability to our economy and consumer protections that help everyday families.  H.4607 would create a lopsided approach to implementing regulations that force agencies to consider the cost of regulations on bankers without considering the benefit to consumers. H.4296 would undermine the ability of regulators to establish operational risk capital requirements to protect our economy from another crisis.  Mr.Speaker, this is unacceptable. Our constituents expect Congress to put them first, not the big banks, especially the big banks that wrecked our economy and endangered the life savings of millions of families. We owe it to them to bring to the floor legislation that will help their lives and make our country better. But, sadly, Mr.Speaker, this Congress has failed to act on meaningful legislation that will do anything like that.  Mr.Speaker, today marks nearly 2 weeks since 17 people, including 14 students, were gunned down at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, This was one of the worst shootings our country has ever seen. It was the eighth school shooting this year, and it is only  Yet Republicans in Congress have not lifted a finger to take up bipartisan gun reform legislation that would help to prevent shootings like these and protect our kids. Instead, we are here considering a bill that will only help the already rich and powerful.  This is shameful. It is absolutely shameful, Mr. According to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit that monitors gun violence, since 2014, there have been over 1,360 mass shootings in In 2018 alone, less than 2 months, there have been over 400 teens aged 12 through 17 and 90 children under the age of 11 killed or injured by guns.  Yet the majority in this House even refuses to bring to the floor legislation banning bump stocks, a reform agreed[[Page H1282]]upon by both sides of the aisle, I thought. The NRA has even said that ``devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.'' I don't know if they meant it, but they said it.  President Trump: ``I will be strongly pushing comprehensive background checks with an emphasis on mental health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of bump stocks. Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue--I hope.''  Now, it is true that we have a President who is so erratic that he changes his mind from one hour to the next, but so far, I haven't seen a retraction tweet. So I have every reason to believe he is still standing by his commitment to supporting these modest gun safety reforms.  Yet here we are, just days after this horrific mass shooting, and not one single gun reform or gun safety bill is being voted on or even scheduled for a vote. I am furious that, in the face of such tragedy and such senseless violence, this Congress continues to do nothing--not a thing--to protect our kids and our families and our communities.  Students from Amherst Regional Middle School in my district in Massachusetts sent me a letter last week that every Republican in Congress should read.  They write: ``Seventeen innocent people lost their lives. . . . That scares us. It scares us that kids have to go to school wondering if they are next. That we even have to think that the next time we see some of our classmates or teachers may be in their open caskets. And what scares us most of all, is that our government fails to do anything to change this.''  They continue: ``They are gone because our country doesn't care enough to have better gun control, and we will not stop fighting until they get their justice. . . . We're writing this letter because we want to personally ask each and every one of our politicians: How many more killings must we bear before the laws are changed. . . . Our country is no longer safe. Not in school, church, concerts, parties, or even public meeting areas. Please choose to do something. All of our lives depend on your actions.''  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the letter written by these students.       Dear Congressman McGovern: Seventeen innocent people lost      their lives on February 14th, 2018. That scares us. It scares      us that kids have to go to school wondering if they are next.      That we even have to think that the next time we see some of      our classmates or teachers may be in their open caskets. And      what scares us most of all, is that our government fails to      do anything to change this. Please don't forget. About the      pain and suffering of all the families and the victims. About      the children fearing that their school is next. About all of      the lives that will never be lived. They are gone because our      country doesn't care enough to have better gun control, and      we will not stop fighting until they get their justice. And      that's why we wrote this letter. We're not writing it to get      some extra credit points or fame. We're writing this letter      because we want to personally ask each and every one of our      politicians; how many more killings must we bear before the      laws are changed and regulations are tightened. Before the      government cares for our safety. Before the lives that were      lost are never forgotten or regarded as yesterday's news. The      time to talk about gun-control is now. It is not next decade      or next year or even next week. It is now. Now is the time to      strengthen the process involved in conducting a complete      background check and lengthen the waiting period required in      order to receive a firearm. Please stand with us and all of      the of the students and children in our nation. Stand with      all of the families of the victims. Stand with the      tremendously brave people who lived through these terrifying      events. Stand with the heroes who saved countless lives, and      ended up losing their own. Our country is no longer safe. Not      in school, church, concerts, parties, or even public meeting      areas. Please choose to do something. All of our lives depend      on your actions and support.           Sincerely,                                  Students at Amherst Regional                                                    Middle                              {time}  1200  Mr.I cannot say it better than these students, Mr.These are young people writing to Congress begging us to do something to end the violence. They are young people who want a better future.  I would just ask my Republican friends: Are you so beholden to the National Rifle Association that you could possibly turn your backs on our country's young people? Can you really ignore these heartbreaking pleas for action?  You know, a recent poll showed that 80 percent of Americans support bans on assault-style weapons like the one used in the Florida school shooting and 90 percent support tougher background checks. These are commonsense reforms that have overwhelming support from the American people. This should be a bipartisan issue that we could come together on.  But I would say, even if you don't want to support what I think is commonsense legislation and commonsense reform, understand that the majority of the people in this country do support this and at least bring these bills to the floor so that we could have a debate, and then people can vote however they want to vote.  So I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and these terrible bills that help big banks, put consumers in our country at risk, and do absolutely nothing to address the real priorities that we should be tackling. It is long past time for Congress to finally do something to stop these horrific mass shootings that are taking the lives of our kids and our families.  Mr.Speaker, we could just have easily spent this afternoon debating and approving one, or more, of any of the gun safety and gun reform measures that have bipartisan support. We could have shown high school and elementary students, our children, Mr.Speaker, that we heard them, that we care about them, and that we are starting to take action.  Instead, we are debating these worthless bills to help big banks and continue to ignore our children's suffering. Shame on this Congress, Mr.Speaker, shame on all of us.

A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''[[Page H1286]]       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

Mr.Ross' bill corrects another oversight of the Dodd-Frank Act by reforming the nonbank SIFI designation process.  Mr.Speaker, this bill does not take away FSOC's ability to designate nonbank financial institutions with the SIFI tag. It simply gives these institutions a greater opportunity to be heard before their final designation from  FSOC should not be able to simply dish out this designation to these institutions, subjecting them to Federal Reserve requirements, without explaining their reasoning. Unfortunately, we have seen FSOC do this in the past. This is especially important since nonbank financial institutions are clearly different entities than banks are. Capital requirements, for example, might not be suitable to address the risk profile of nonbank financial institutions, so why even subject them to these requirements.  This is not a smart regulation, Mr.Simply put, the nonbank SIFI designation process is not fair in its current form.

1488,topic-id,472,"Mr.Speaker, it is not every day that I get to speak on behalf of someone who has changed the lives of millions of people across the globe, but today, I do.  Billy Graham, who passed away last week, was known as America's pastor, and rightly so.  When I was spending time this week in the district, someone who is a baseball fan came up to me and said: Do you know who's got the most saves in Yankee Stadium?  I said: ``Sorry, I don't know my baseball history that well.''  He said: It was Billy Graham, in 1957.  I had to laugh to think that it was truly God who did the saving.  But let's think for a minute about Billy He was born in 1918 on a dairy farm in Charlotte, North Carolina, just south of my district. His crusades in the 1950s attracted thousands of people and shaped the beliefs of a generation by introducing many to the evangelical faith.  In July of 1957, Graham invited Martin Luther, King., Jr., to preach in front of his audience at Madison Square Garden on the issue of racial justice. This was just months after the Montgomery Bus  Graham was a White pastor from North Carolina, and King was an African American pastor from But both of them knew that the Lord doesn't see skin color and that the love of Christ could heal any racial division. Mr.Speaker, in today's polarized political culture, we could learn a thing or two from their friendship.  Throughout his life, he met with 12 Presidents, dating back to Harry President Eisenhower called Graham ``one of the best ambassadors our country has,'' and John Kennedy brought Graham in before his inauguration to express his worry over the moral and spiritual condition of the  Aside from his role in the civil rights movement and vocal opposition to communism, he uplifted the souls of millions of By introducing them to the love of Christ, Graham gave hope to the hopeless and love to those who were in need.  Mr.Speaker, while our economy now is growing and wages are rising, Americans have still become increasingly more isolated, more lonely, and more depressed. This social crisis needs to be addressed but can't be solved by a bill that we pass in Congress or an executive action by any  We have gotten to a point in our country where too many people put their hope in elected officials. These people will most certainly be let down, because elected officials, like everyone else, are fallen, imperfect, sinful people.  Graham knew this, and he knew that the only person who would not let us down is Christ himself, and that we should trust in him for the forgiveness of our sins and have everlasting life. This is now the life Billy Graham will enjoy forever.  ",CREC-2018-02-27-pt1-PgH1322-2.txt,,U.S. NAVY SEAMAN DAKOTA KYLE RIGSBY POST OFFICE,2018.0,27.0,April

485,topic-id,664,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  1986 was the last time our Tax Code was refined. I had been practicing medicine for 5 years. Now, some 31 years later and after 15 years in Congress, the reformation of our Tax Code has made a profound difference in our country.  Mr.Speaker, it is not lost on me that the rhetoric prior to the vote on the conference report on the tax bill was pretty negative. The idea was to sow doubt in the minds of people who would be affected by the tax bill, to sow doubt in the minds of people who would otherwise be wanting to vote for tax relief for tax improvement.  And I will have to tell you something: after that vote--and Mr.Mitchell referenced Southwest Airlines and American Airlines--I cannot remember having ever had the positive feedback for a vote that I have taken here in this Congress like there was for this tax vote.  In my own Walmart, the week after Christmas, people were coming up to me saying, ``I work for American Airlines,'' or ``I work for Southwest Airlines.'' I have a lot of families in the 26th District of Texas who work for American Airlines or Southwest Airlines, and they all got $1,000 bonuses because of the tax relief that we had provided. Again, I cannot ever remember having that much positive reinforcement on a bill that, quite honestly, the rhetoric going into it was pretty negative.  The benefits have been immediate, as indicated by the increases in salaries and bonuses paid to employees. And Southwest Airlines, in addition to the bonuses to their employees, donated $5 million to charity, as well as made some capital improvements.  FedEx, which, of course, employs people all over the country, but has a big hub in the district that I represent, is going to spend $133 million increasing hourly wages, as well as $67 million on programs for salaried employees, and, get this, $3 billion on their pension plan and capital improvements. That is a pretty big turnaround.  The good folks at Peterbilt trucks, located in the 26th District of Texas, received over $170 million in tax benefits in the fourth quarter of 2017, as a direct result of this tax bill. Peterbilt also estimates that its 2018 effective global tax rate will be reduced by up to 8 percent and that the lower corporate tax rate and accelerated depreciation will, indeed, stimulate capital investment.  The increased prosperity of these and other companies will subsequently improve the financial situation of their employees. Coupled with a nearly doubled standard deduction, income for most individuals and families will, in fact, increase.  Chairman Brady mentioned filing taxes on a postcard. Mr.Speaker, when I first came to Congress, I really wanted us to enact a flat tax. I still do. But I will take the improvement that we have gotten, the gift of time, back to, what, 85 to 90 percent of tax filers who no longer are going to have to keep up with that shoebox full of receipts and spend quality time with their accountants every March and April as they prepare their Federal tax return. We are going to allow people to pay for necessities, without having to worry about other discretionary items and services, often provided by small businesses.  Local improvements in economic condition will not only benefit Main Street business owners, but I like to say it is going to benefit Elm Street business owners. That is the small business off of Main It is going to allow people to spend money across State lines. Increased financial mobility will inject capital into the market and continue the growth of our economy.                              {time}  2130  Look, we are right on the verge of some pretty significant and profound economic changes that are going to be beneficial, I predict, to all This is an important time in this country, time for us to get to work and deliver for the American people.

(3) In Chicago, Illinois, schools of medicine provide      critical trauma-informed care, including the University of      Illinois at Chicago Comprehensive Assessment and Response      Training System, which improves the quality of psychiatric      services provided to youth in foster care, and the University      of Chicago Recovery & Empowerment After Community Trauma      Initiative, which helps residents who are coping with      community violence.       (4) In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, service providers,      academics, and local artists use art to engage their      community to educate and involve citizens in trauma-informed      care activities.       (5) In San Francisco, California, the city's public health      department aligned its workforce to create a trauma-informed      system.       (6) In Kansas City, Missouri, schools worked to become      trauma-informed by encouraging teachers and children to      create their own self-care plans to manage stress. They have      implemented broad communitywide, trauma-informed culture      change.       (7) In Tarpon Springs, Florida, the city crafted a      community effort to gather city officials, professionals, and      residents to coordinate multiple trauma-informed activities,      including a community education day.       (8) In Worcester, Massachusetts, community members worked      with the Massachusetts State Department of Mental Health to      create a venue with peer-to-peer support to better engage      individuals dealing with trauma or extreme emotional      distress.

889,topic-id,712,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, 40 years ago I was an intern and resident at Parkland Hospital in Any intern or resident will tell you the month of July is significant in the life of an intern or resident. You were last week's medical student, and you are this week's intern managing the emergency room; or you were last year's intern, and you are this week's house officer managing perhaps a busy practice, perhaps a busy emergency room. As such, every intern and resident remembers the end of that first week of their internship or residency. It is just something that you do. You got through the first week of what was a very trying time. So I remember well July 7 of my internship, July 7 of my residency.  Mr.Speaker, in 2016, July 7 also took on additional significance in Dallas, Five police officers were killed and 9 more were injured during a shooting in downtown In the immediate aftermath of the attack, area hospitals sprang into action and activated their disaster plans. I am proud to say that the staff at Parkland Hospital, the staff at Baylor University Hospital, and other medical professionals provided excellent emergency care to the victims of the attack.  Mr.Speaker, it is critical that we have people who are able to respond when called. Now, additionally, I have long believed that the American military is the arsenal of democracy and that it is critical for upholding freedom in the world. Each member of the United States Armed Forces has an important role in a collective team effort. This is especially true in a combat zone, where trauma surgeons are some of the most crucial members of the Armed These medical professionals are trained to save the lives of soldiers who sustain traumatic injuries on the battlefield, and they are some of the best in the business.  However, as wars wind down and our soldiers come home, the experience that military trauma surgeons have gained overseas may be diminished or lost unless these surgeons continue to train and to prepare for their next possible deployment. To let this expertise and skill drift away would be a significant loss to trauma patients, both at home and abroad. Trauma, Mr.Speaker, is not limited to the battlefields and active conflicts. Unfortunately, no community is immune from the threat of traumatic injury, and community doctors must be prepared to give lifesaving care to trauma victims.  However, there is a way that we can ensure trained combat surgeons' skills are utilized to help American patients here in the homeland who need it. The MISSION ZERO Act seeks to connect American patients with battle-tested trauma care through the craft of military trauma care providers. The bill provides grants to allow military trauma care providers and teams to offer care in our Nation's leading trauma centers and systems.  Here is the bottom line: the MISSION ZERO Act is a win for both civilian patients and military trauma doctors.  Mr.Speaker, I am grateful that this bipartisan legislation has finally come[[Page H1238]]to the floor. Along with my fellow Texan, Mr.Gene Green, I introduced this bill in 2016 following that particularly traumatic incident that struck so close to home.  Texas is not unique in its need for this expertise. Over the last few months alone, our Nation has witnessed a need for trauma care hospitals across the country. One such incident was the Amtrak derailment near Dupont, Washington, on December 18, 2017. That incident resulted in 3 passenger fatalities and 70 injuries over a busy freeway.  As we have seen, having access to experienced trauma care can become the difference between life and death for a critically injured patient. There is no doubt that integrating military physicians into the trauma and disaster system is beneficial not only for American patients, but also for American soldiers.  I am encouraged by the bipartisan effort to support both our servicemen and our Nation's trauma system, and I thank the cosponsors from both sides of the aisle for their support of this important legislation.  Quite simply, the MISSION ZERO Act is common sense, and I urge Members to join me in supporting this lifesaving legislation.

1176,topic-id,604,"Madam President, I rise with my colleague from North Carolina, my colleagues in the U.Senate, and the American people to honor the life of a North Carolinian, Billy Graham--a man whose life has literally reached millions around the globe.  Reverend Graham's grace marker will be inscribed this way: ``Preacher of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.''  As the son of a minister myself, I am uniquely aware of the sacrifices and the responsibility that come with this calling. Indeed, this is a calling that Reverend Graham fulfilled honorably and nobly, bringing hope and comfort to millions around the globe. Reverend Graham was someone who was shaped by his roots on a North Carolina dairy farm, who committed his life to Jesus Christ at the age of 15, and who lived the commitment with faithfulness for the next 84 years.  He was married for 64 years to Ruth Bell Graham and was the father of 3 daughters, 2 sons, and now 19 grandchildren. As his casket was laid in honor in the Rotunda, all of a sudden, I realized that one of those grandchildren was a graduate of West Point, one of my nominees, and a soon-to-be lieutenant colonel in the U.It was certainly good to see him.  Reverend Graham preached to almost 215 million people in more than 185 countries and territories on 6 continents. He prayed with soldiers on the battlefields of South Korea and He preached in poor villages and at Britain's Windsor Castle, and he provided counsel to every President from Harry Truman to Barack He also stood up for what was right--denouncing segregation and oppression and preaching jointly with the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., in the 1950s. He lived a life of integrity and of honor.  He spoke words of comfort and hope at the National Cathedral following the September 11 terrorist attacks, reminding America: ``God is our refuge[[Page S1259]]and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.''  Reverend Graham will be deeply missed. I send my condolences to his children, his grandchildren, and his numerous great-grandchildren. Yet Graham himself said: ``My Home is in heaven, I am just passing through this World.'' Today, we honor the life that he lived, his faithfulness to the calling, and his impact on millions of individuals around the globe.  If I may take just another moment before my colleague from North Carolina speaks, I will read some remarks that were made by individuals who played important roles in American history.  President Bill Clinton said: ``Some were pressuring Graham to segregate his audiences by race but he refused.'' Clinton remarked: ``Graham would cancel the crusade rather than preach to a segregated audience'' because everyone deserved the chance to hear God's  President Obama said this in his condolences: ``Billy Graham was a humble servant who prayed for so many--and who, with wisdom and grace, gave hope and guidance to generations of Americans'' and, I would say, Americans to come.  Lastly, Martin Luther King, Jr., said: ``Had it not been for the ministry of my good friend Billy Graham, my work in the civil rights movement would not have been as successful as it has been.''  The country mourns the loss of Graham, but the country understands the impact of his life--that life as a servant of God, to preach His Word to everyone he could find, and a career of 84 years. He exhausted the opportunities that were given to him and will proudly affect generations that have yet to be born by the work that he did as a disciple of our Lord Jesus  I yield the floor.

339,topic-id,1248,"Mr.President, this week the Senate is considering two important labor-related nominations: the nominations of John Ring to serve as a Member of the National Labor Relations Board, NLRB, and Patrick Pizzella to serve as Deputy Secretary of Labor, Unfortunately, given the nominees' well-documented hostility to the collective bargaining rights of working men and women, I will not vote to confirm either of them.  If Mr.Ring is confirmed, he will restore the Board to the 3-2 anti-labor majority, with no assurances that President Trump will fill the Democratic seat of former chairman Mark Gaston Pearce expiring this summer. It is important to note here that nominations to the NLRB have traditionally been confirmed in bipartisan pairs.  Mr.Ring authored blog posts calling the NLRB an ``activist'' organization during the Obama administration. In other blog posts, he characterized the NLRB's union election procedures as ``some of the biggest assaults on employer rights in recent history.'' In fact, the election rule simply modernized union election procedures and has actually resulted in slightly fewer union elections.  During the brief 3-2 Republican majority late last year before then-Board Chairman Phillip Miscimarra completed his term on December 16, 2017, the NLRB rushed to overturn landmark decisions, weakening workers' rights under the National Labor Relations Act, NLRA, and undermining the statute's core purpose of promoting collective bargaining, including the Browning-Ferris Industries joint employer standard decision. The Board's inspector general has faulted those efforts, and the Board has been forced to vacate the joint employer decision. A new Republican majority may reorganize the NLRB in ways that are unfavorable to workers and their collective bargaining rights.  Mr.Pizzella is a vocal advocate of so-called right-to-work laws. They really ought to be called right-to-be-exploited laws. As Ross Eisenbray of the Economic Policy Institute reported last year, ``Wages are 3.1 percent lower in so-called `right to work' (RTW) states, for union and nonunion workers alike--after correctly accounting for differences in cost of living, demographics, and labor market characteristics. The negative impact of RTW laws translates to $1,558 less a year in earnings for a typical full-time worker.''  There is a clear correlation between the decline in union membership and stagnant wages. If the Senate confirms Mr.Pizzella and Mr.Ring, the Republican assault on unions and collective bargaining rights enshrined in the National Labor Relations Act, NLRA, will gain momentum, and working people and their families will suffer as a result.  Mr.Pizzella previously served at the Department of Labor, as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Administration and Management under President George During Mr.Pizzella's previous tenure at DOL, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, determined that the Department left workers vulnerable to unscrupulous employers while investigating complaints of minimum wage, overtime, and child labor violations. GAO found that the Wage and Hour Division's complaint intake, complaint resolution, and investigation processes were ineffective and discouraged workers from lodging wage-theft complaints.  Mr.Pizzella also has expressed his antipathy to Federal workers and their unions. I am proud to represent many of these public servants. The Federal workforce is one of our Nation's finest assets, and public sector unions make it more productive.  It is ironic that the Senate is considering two nominees this week who are[[Page S2055]]openly hostile to the collective bargaining rights of working people. Yesterday was Equal Pay Day, which symbolizes the number of extra days a typical woman who works full-time, year-round must work into 2018 to be paid what a typical man was paid in 2017. Women are still only paid 80 cents for every dollar paid to a man, a yearly pay difference of $10,086, and the disparity is even worse for many women of color.  Based on an analysis of Census Bureau data, the National Partnership for Women and Families is releasing a study which concludes that, in sum, women employed full time in the U.will lose nearly $900 billion to the wage gap this year. If the wage gap were closed, on average, a working woman in this country would be able to afford more than 1 additional year of tuition and fees for a 4-year public university, 74 more weeks of food for her family, nearly 7 more months of mortgage and utility payments, or 14 more months of childcare.  If Mr.Ring and Mr.Pizzella and President Trump are unwilling to protect female workers and try to close that pay gap, which seems likely, then let us let us arm women with the most powerful tool in our legal system: the U.Let us finally pass the Equal Rights Amendment,  The ERA is barely longer than a tweet, but it would finally give women full and equal protection under the Section 1 of the ERA states, quite simply, that ``Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.''  When Congress proposed the ERA in 1972, it provided that the measure had to be ratified by three-fourths of the States--38 States--within 7 years. This deadline was later extended to 10 years by a joint resolution, but ultimately only 35 out of 38 States had ratified the ERA when the deadline expired in 1982. Note that the deadline wasn't contained in the amendment itself; the deadline was in the text of the joint resolution.  Article V of the Constitution contains no time limits for the ratification of amendments, so the ERA deadline is arbitrary. To put the matter in context, the 27th Amendment to the Constitution, which prohibits congressional pay raises without an intervening election, was ratified in 1992, 203 years after it was first proposed.  The Senate should vote on a Senate Joint Resolution I have introduced--S.5--to remove the ERA deadline, and every State in our Union that has not yet taken up its consideration should do so without any further delay.  Nevada became the 36th State to ratify the amendment last March, leaving the ERA just two States short of the required three-fourths of the States threshold under the Constitution if the deadline were to be abolished.  The ERA would incorporate a ban on gender-based discrimination, explicitly written or otherwise, into the It could change outcomes in discrimination cases by requiring the Supreme Court to use the higher standard of ``strict scrutiny'' when assessing those cases, the same standard used in racial and religious discrimination cases.  I think many--perhaps most--Americans would be shocked to learn that our Constitution has no provision expressly prohibiting gender discrimination.  In a 2011 interview, the late Justice Antonin Scalia summed up the need for an Equal Rights Amendment best. He said, ``Certainly the Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex. The only issue is whether it prohibits it. It doesn't.''  So I ask my Senate colleagues this question most sincerely: Are we willing to do what must be done to prohibit gender discrimination in the Constitution? The people being affected by systemic gender inequality are our constituents. They are our mothers, sisters, wives, daughters, and our granddaughters. They are American citizens who deserve basic respect and equality.  It is time to end the assault on working families in this country. Let's end discrimination by making it possible to ratify the Let's close the pay gap. Let's stop denigrating Federal workers. Let's support, not attack, the collective bargaining rights that are the cornerstone of a strong middle class. I regret that the Senate is poised to confirm two individuals who are unlikely to assist these efforts. We can and must do better.

550,topic-id,1713,"Mr.President, I rise today to celebrate Black History Month, when we declare that Black History is American history, and that our Nation is a better, fairer, and more perfect union thanks to the Black Americans who helped forge it.  Fifty years ago, in 1968, a crowd of 25,000 people gathered outside Bishop Charles Mason Temple in Memphis, They congregated there in support of the city's 1,300 Black sanitation workers--men who were being underpaid and subjected to abusive and unsafe working conditions--all of whom had been protesting those conditions, day after day, for months. The sanitation workers had organized, unionized, and exercised their right to peaceful protest; yet the mayor of Memphis refused to heed their calls for justice and change.  So they gathered there, alongside thousands of supporters, outside a church in Memphis, waiting for someone to tell them--to show them--their path forward.  One man spoke to the crowd, saying, ``You are reminding not only Memphis, but the nation, that it is a crime for people to live in this rich nation and receive starvation wages.'' He went on, ``You are here tonight to demand that Memphis do something about the conditions our brothers face, as they work day in and day out for the well-being of the total community. You are here to demand that Memphis will see the poor.'' The speaker encouraged the sanitation workers to continue their fight and vowed to stand by them. He showed them their path forward.  The speaker who addressed the crowd that day was the Martin Luther King, His voice boomed from behind the podium to the crowd--and to all Americans--about the intersection of racial and economic equality. King argued that fair pay and basic dignity and safety in the workplace should be extended to all people, regardless of their race or profession.  King addressed the crowd on March 18, 1968. On April 3, 1968, King addressed another crowd at Mason Temple, declaring, ``I've been to the mountain top'' and continuing, ``Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the Promised I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land!''  King was assassinated the next day. Four days later, 42,000 people marched to honor King and support the strike, which was resolved 2 weeks after King's death when the Memphis City Council voted to recognize the sanitation workers' union. Finally, after months of turmoil and violence, the sanitation workers were promised the higher wages and more equitable treatment they deserved. On April 29,[[Page S1292]]2011, the Memphis sanitation workers were inducted into the Department of Labor's Labor Hall of  Senator Alexander has introduced a resolution--404--to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Memphis sanitation workers' strike, and I am honored to be an original cosponsor of the measure.  Every February, we celebrate Black History Month because stories like this one are too often lost or overlooked. Every child in America learns about the greatness of our country: the democratic principles that birthed us; our victories in battle throughout two World Wars; the American ingenuity that led to the invention of the automobile, the plane, the personal computer. But how often do our children learn about the difficult and dark periods of our history, wherein Thomas Jefferson's proclamation that ``all men are created equal'' was reserved only for those with White skin? How often do they learn about the sacrifices of those who demanded that we actually live up to the ideals on which we were founded? How often do they learn that greatness, equality, and justice has always come with a price in this country--and that price has often been paid disproportionately by men and women of color?  Black History Month is a solemn reminder of these truths. This month is a reminder of what the Black community has long understood--that, in the words of Frederick Douglass, ``if there is no struggle, there is no progress.'' And it is a reminder that we all have a responsibility, to our country and to each other, to be part of the struggle, and through it, part of the progress.  We must rise to honor that struggle. Doing so begins with celebrating the Americans who shouldered its burden, and Frederick Douglass is, in fact, a tremendous example.  Frederick Douglass was born in Maryland around 1818. He learned to read and write in Baltimore before escaping slavery. Despite unknowable hardship and systemic discrimination, he went on to become one of the most influential writers, orators, and abolitionists of his time. Though Douglass fiercely and vocally opposed slavery, he would want us to remember that he stood for the rights of all Americans regardless of race, color, religion, gender, or national origin. These views--revolutionary for the time--earned him increasing prominence, leading to 1872, when Victoria Woodhull chose him as her Vice Presidential nominee. Frederick Douglass was the first Black American ever to hold such a title.  We also celebrate Harriet Tubman who, with sheer grit and courage, not only escaped slavery, but dedicated her life to saving countless men, women, and children from it. ``I had reasoned this out in my mind, there was one of two things I had a right to: liberty or death,'' she famously said. ``If I could not have one, I would have the other.''  As one of the Underground Railroad's most effective conductors, Harriet Tubman was given the nickname ``Moses'' for how dogged and devoted she was to shepherding her people to safety. Tubman went on to become a Union spy during the Civil War and an iconic suffragist thereafter.  We celebrate scientists and inventors like Baltimore's own Benjamin Banneker, a self-taught mathematician and astronomer, and author of several groundbreaking almanacs; or Shirley Jackson, whose discoveries in the field of theoretical physics paved the way for the invention of the touch-tone telephone, solar panel cells, and fiber-optic cable; or Marie Van Brittan Brown, a nurse by profession, who invented the first home security system; or George Carruthers, a member of the National Inventors Hall of Fame, who invented the ultraviolet camera, allowing scientists at the National Aeronautics & Space Administration, NASA, to observe more of the universe, forever changing our perception and understanding of it.  We also celebrate the countless men and women whose names and heroism will never grace the history books, such as the Memphis sanitation workers. Throughout the American Revolution and the Civil War, from Reconstruction to today, for every civil rights leader or scientist we can name, there have been thousands we could not name.  In our eagerness to validate the importance of this month, let us not reduce Black history to stories about individuals--as important as they are--and forget the broader truth, that the Black community, as a whole, deserves to have its collective story told, not just this month, but every month. Let our history books reflect the experiences of all those who suffered discrimination in silence, who endured civil rights abuses without recognition, who sat in and stood up to oppression without accolade.  Such individuals would be the first to tell us that there is a lot of work left to do. Systemic prejudice is a specter that haunts us still today through practices like racial profiling. I have introduced a bill, 411--the End Racial and Religious Profiling Act--which would eliminate this harmful practice and offer resources for more police training, mandate greater accountability, and provide legal recourse for Americans who have been unduly profiled; yet this bill remains in the Judiciary Committee, with no hearing held on it so far, while too many African Americans and other people of color continue to be unjustly targeted.  The Voting Rights Act, which safeguarded every citizen's fundamental right to vote, was upended by the Supreme Court's decision in 2013's Shelby v. It is up to Congress to remedy that decision with a new, updated law, and it is up to the people of this country to hold this body accountable for passing it. For my part, I will do everything in my power to make that a greater priority.  Fifty years after the Memphis sanitation workers' strike, the Southern Poverty Law Center, SPLC, has released a deeply troubling report, ``Teaching Hard History: American Slavery,'' which traces today's persistent racial tensions to the failure of our schools to teach students properly about the great stain of slavery in According to the SPLC, ``Schools are not adequately teaching the history of American slavery, educators are not sufficiently prepared to teach it, textbooks do not have enough material about it, and--as a result--students lack a basic knowledge of the important role it played in shaping the United States and the impact it continues to have on race relations in America.''  So, yes, we still have much work to do, even 155 years after the Emancipation Proclamation and 50 years after the Memphis sanitation workers' strike; yet King believed in us. Despite all of our faults and shortcomings and all the hardship King witnessed and endured, he believed in this country. We should, too. This Black History Month, we vow not to let him--or the countless others whose names we will never know--down. We will march forward together, united, just as those sanitation workers and their supporters did 50 years ago, compelled by a shared desire to see justice ``roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream,'' as the Prophet Amos put it, Amos 5:24. We will pause to reflect on the legacy of the civil rights hero who showed us all the path forward, the man who pointed all Americans in the direction of the Promised It is up to us to reach it.

907,topic-id,957,"Mr.President, I wish briefly to note that Saturday, February 17th, marked the 10th anniversary of the independence of I want to congratulate the people of Kosovo on reaching their aspirations for statehood 10 years ago and to support their current aspirations to be part of a democratic, integrated, and peaceful I urge the government and people of Kosovo to use this anniversary as an occasion to strengthen their commitments to democracy and human rights, to seek reconciliation with their neighbors, and to undertake and fully implement the reforms necessary to move forward in these areas.  In 1998, the situation in Kosovo was markedly different. Still a province of Serbia, with its autonomy unilaterally revoked and its ethnic Albanian majority harshly repressed, Kosovo erupted in conflict. After years of passive resistance to Serbian rule, the people of Kosovo had enough and began to clamor for their rights. Early international efforts to restore peace were unsustainable, and with U.leadership, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, Alliance was compelled to intervene militarily the following year, placing Kosovo under the administration of the United Nations, UN, and opening the question of its status.  The violent chaos of 1998 and 1999--marked by horrific war crimes, massive displacement of populations, and ultimately the death of an estimated 12,000 or more people--made subsequent efforts to reach agreement on Kosovo's status a challenge, and only in February 2008 could Kosovo assert independent statehood based on a plan developed by the respected Finnish politician, Martti  This last decade has seen continued challenges as Kosovo has tried to achieve greater recognition of its independence abroad and to develop its democratic political institutions and economy at home. Perhaps the most important and positive development has been the direct dialogue since 2012 between Serbian and Kosovo officials in Brussels, under European Union, EU, auspices. These talks have sought to normalize relations between Belgrade and Pristina and to achieve practical progress that would improve the lives and protect the rights of the people in and from Some agreements have been reached, but implementation has been difficult. This work continues.  As a Member of Congress, both House and Senate, I have been a witness to Kosovo's history. As a member of the U.Helsinki Commission for more than two decades and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee since coming to this Chamber in 2007, I have visited Kosovo and participated in numerous hearings on developments there. I have met with its leaders, as well as those of Serbia and other neighbors, and engaged in critical debates on issues ranging from military intervention and peacekeeping operations to diplomatic recognition and bilateral support for the country's democratic and economic development.  As Kosovo moves into a second decade of statehood, I urge those countries that have not yet recognized its independence to do so now, particularly those in the European Kosovo's independence is a reality, and full EU recognition will help pave the way to Kosovo's European integration as it continues to take the necessary steps to strengthen its democratic institutions, respect human rights, and adhere to the rule of law. Progress in these areas is desperately needed and something we should all want. Withholding recognition accomplishes nothing.  While I make this call urging Kosovo's recognition, I want also to urge Kosovo's political leaders not to wait for outside incentives, but to see progress as in Kosovo's own interest and to make this progress now. Nothing will strengthen support for Kosovo and its integration into Europe in the years to come more than its efforts to take responsibility now for doing the right thing.  In this regard, I encourage the Kosovo Government to make clear its commitment to democracy. The political turmoil in the country has raised questions about the strength of this commitment.  I hope to see steps in Kosovo to boost respect for human and property rights of members of minority communities, whether Serb, Roma, Turk, Bosniak, or any of the others who live in This has been one area where progress has been sadly lacking with regard to what we would expect.  I also urge the Kosovo Government to make progress on justice for past atrocities by supporting the work of the special court established for that purpose and respecting its decisions and judgements. Upholding the rule of law for crimes that individuals in Kosovo have committed will boost Kosovo as a nation and contribute to a[[Page S1313]]sustainable peace and prosperous future.  With its young and enthusiastic population, I personally have little to question about Kosovo's future being bright, but the job of Kosovo's leaders today is to erase all doubts at home and abroad through accelerated progress on the democratic and human rights values we all hold dear. By doing so, Kosovo will make an even stronger claim to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe--OSCE--NATO, and EU memberships it deserves in the years to come.  Let me conclude, by expressing my support for continued U.leadership in the Western Balkans, a leadership that ended a decade of regional conflict, helped bring Kosovo to where it is today, and can make a difference still. With Russian and other outside influences seeking to undermine the progress we have made, it is in our interest to engage more actively and offer a positive alternative to a difficult past. It is in our interest to see Kosovo and the entire region stable and secure, reconciled and integrated, and--above all--prosperous. Let this be a time where we not only celebrate the progress we have made in the past decade, but also commit to more rapid progress in the decade to come.  Congratulations, Kosovo, on your 10 years of independence. You can count on the continued support of your friends in the United                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-01-pt1-PgS1312-2.txt,,COMBATING GUN VIOLENCE,2018.0,1.0,February

1019,topic-id,2955,"Mr.President, on Friday, I visited Wilde Lake High School in Columbia, which is located in Howard County, MD, between Washington and I wanted to talk to students about the tragic Valentine's Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, FL, which left 17 students and faculty members dead. This is the deadliest high school shooting in American history. I went to Wilde Lake because one of their own teachers, Laura Wallen, was shot to death in September 2017, and her former boyfriend is now on trial for her murder.  I was extremely impressed by the passion of these students. They had a great deal of interest in the subject matter; they were extremely articulate; and they asked great questions. I found it extremely encouraging for the future of Howard County, MD, and this These students are rightfully concerned about their safety and the safety of their classmates. It has been 2 weeks since a disturbed young man invaded Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  The reaction seems to be like clockwork after each shooting. There is bipartisan shock, anger, and horror. Predictably, the question comes out: Will this time be different? The answer for the Republican leaders in Congress has always been ``no'' as the outrage and call to act quickly falls back to NRA talking points versus reality. This time, the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and the students in Maryland and across the country are not taking ``no'' as the final word. This time, the survivors are leading the way and are speaking out in a forceful way like we have not heard before.  Students like Ryan Deitsch, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, want to know why these students--the children--need to be the ones to speak out ``just to save innocent lives,'' he said. He wants to know why the adults cannot be the adults and do what is necessary to protect children.  I think the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have had a clear, articulate message that this carnage needs to stop. They want to feel safe in their schools again. Armed with their cell phones and their stories, they have taken up the banner of hashtag ``never again'' and are changing the face of this debate to make this country safer from gun violence.  Alex Wind, another survivor from Stoneman Douglas, laid out the larger problem of why students are mobilizing:       We're marching because it's not just schools. It's movie      theaters, it's concerts, it's nightclubs. This kind of stuff      can't just happen. You know, we are marching for our lives,      we're marching for the 17 lives we lost. And we're marching      for our children's lives and our children's children and      their children.  So what can we do?  There are several pieces of legislation that are ready to go. The Democrats and some Republicans have been willing and ready to act. Leader McConnell could move any one of these bills right now. Let's start by making it clear that weapons of war are not needed by civilians of any age. I have cosponsored 2095, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2017, offered by Senator  This legislation would, one, ban the sale, manufacture, transfer, and importation of military style assault weapons; two, ban any assault weapon that accepts a detachable ammunition magazine and has one or more military characteristics; three, ban magazines and other ammunition feeding devices that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition, which allow shooters to quickly fire many rounds without needing to reload.  The bill also requires a background check on any future sale, trade, or gifting of an assault weapon that is covered by the bill, and it prohibits the transfer of high-capacity ammunition magazines. It also bans bump fire stocks and other devices that allow semiautomatic weapons to fire at fully automatic rates. Congress should also pass the Background Check Expansion Act, 2009, which I have cosponsored and has been offered by Senator  This bill would expand Federal background check requirements to include the sale or transfer of all firearms by private sellers, just as licensed dealers are required to conduct checks for sales under the existing Brady The bill requires background checks for the sales or transfers of all firearms from one private party to another even if either party is not a federally licensed dealer. This requirement extends to all unlicensed sellers whether they do business online, at gun shows, or out of their homes.  According to a recent poll, a record 97 percent of those surveyed said that they support requiring background checks for gun buyers--97 percent. Why can't we get this done? It is not a heavy lift. Americans are with us on this. We need to recognize that saving children's lives is more important than the National Rifle  Congress also should ease restrictions on gun violence research and prevention efforts by removing onerous restrictions on the Centers for Disease Control research. We can improve States' sharing of information with Federal databases that screen gun buyers.  At a townhall last week, Senator Rubio, when questioned by an audience of students and parents from Stoneman Douglas, said that ``the problems we are facing here today cannot be solved by gun laws alone.'' With that, I agree, but these gun laws will make a difference. Yes, there is no single solution, but we should be united in our willingness to do what we can to save lives.  I agree with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that we must devote more resources to mental health priorities to identify young people who may be about to cause harm to themselves or others.[[Page S1297]]  Let's attack this problem from multiple directions. We cannot raise our hands in the air and give up because there is no one law that can solve the problem. Sitting on the sidelines is not an option when our children are being killed, sometimes by other children, and surrendering to the false logic that the problem is too big to address falls well short of what the American people deserve. We were sent here to our Nation's Capitol to make the tough decisions and to do the right thing.  I agree with Alex Wind that this problem we need to tackle is larger than simply school safety, but I would like to talk about that specifically for one moment.  In an effort to turn the conversation away from an assault weapons ban or closing loopholes in background checks, the President decided to latch on to this idea that we should arm teachers and educators in our schools. We do not need, as President Trump has suggested, more guns in the schools, and we do not need teachers carrying guns. We do know that teachers are hired to teach, not to be security guards.  Let's listen to our educators and say no to this proposal. The answer to keeping guns and gun violence out of our schools is not to bring more guns into the school. The students I talked to at Wilde Lake High School in Columbia, MD, understood that adding more guns would not help the situation and could lead to more problems in the schools themselves. They certainly want to see their buildings more secure, but we can do that through infrastructure improvements, technology, and school resource officers.  Why are these things happening in the United States with such alarming frequency and not elsewhere around the world? Gun-related deaths unfold in tragic circumstances across this country daily, with more than 1,800 people killed by guns this year alone, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a not-for-profit group. Mass shootings often shine the spotlight on the United States and its position as a global outlier.  The number of firearms available to American civilians is estimated to be around 310 million, according to the 2009 National Institute of Justice report.  According to the Small Arms Survey, the exact number of civilian-owned firearms is impossible to pinpoint because of a variety of factors, including arms that go unregistered due to illegal trade and global conflict. Estimates indicate that Americans own nearly half of the 650 million civilian-owned guns in the world today, which is nearly one gun for every man, woman, and child in the United Our Nation is well armed. India is home to the second-largest civilian firearm stockpile, estimated at 46 million.  Americans own the most guns per person in the world, with about 4 in 10 saying they either own a gun or live in a home where there is a gun, according to the 2017 Pew Center study. Forty-eight percent of Americans said they grew up in a house with guns. According to the survey, a majority--66 percent--of U.gun owners own multiple firearms. The 2 country in the world for the largest number of guns per capita is Yemen--a country that is in the throes of a 3-year-old civil war. They trail significantly behind us. They have 54 guns per 100 in Yemen; we have 88 guns per 100 in the United  When it comes to gun massacres, the United States is an anomaly. There are more public mass shootings in America than in any other country in the world. The United States makes up less than 5 percent of the world's population but holds 31 percent of global mass shooters. In Australia, for example, four mass shootings occurred between 1987 and 1996. After those instances, public opinion turned against gun violence, and Parliament passed stricter gun safety laws. Australia hasn't had a mass shooting since.  Gun safety laws work. The public demands that we take action to make our communities safer.  Gun homicide rates are about 25 times higher in the United States than in other developed countries. The United States has one of the highest rates of death by firearms in the developed world, according to World Health Organization data. The calculations based on OECD data from 2010 show that Americans are 51 times more likely to be killed by gunfire than people in the  Most American gun owners say that a major reason they own a gun is for personal protection, according to the Pew study. However, the majority of firearms-related deaths are attributable to self-harm. Gun-related suicides are eight times higher in the United States than in other high-income nations.  Thinking of Stoneman Douglas High School, we all wonder out loud, what drove this young man to kill indiscriminantly? There is no one single reason, but that is no excuse for Congress and lawmakers in all of our States to remain frozen and fail to act to try to stop a future shooting from happening. If anything, it should be the impetus for us to move forward on many fronts and to take many actions to support our children and support our communities so more lives are not lost in such a violent way.  We cannot allow the story of this shooting to end like all the others in recent history. We should have taken action after three students were killed and five wounded in December 1997 at a high school in West Paducah, We should have taken action after two students opened fire on April 20, 1999, in Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, killing 12 classmates and a teacher and wounding 26 others. We should have taken action after a gunman fatally shot 32 people in a dorm and classrooms at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA, on April 16, 2007.  Columbine, Virginia Tech--for a period, these names became a code for some of the worst killings in our history. Nearly 5 years later, it happened again. Three students were killed and two wounded in a shooting on February 27, 2012, that started in a school cafeteria in Chardon, OH, as students waited for buses to other schools. Then there was Sandy I know we all remember a 20-year-old gunman, in December of 2012, killing 20 first grade children and 6 educators inside Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT--elementary school students. These were first graders, for goodness' sake, young children who should clearly have moved us to action. But no. The killings continued because the Republican leadership has been unwilling to budge from the NRA-approved message.  We have had bipartisan support for some of this legislation, as we do today, but too many are so afraid of the NRA response that they lose sight of the fact that children are being killed right before our eyes.  On September 8, 2016, a 14-year-old girl died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after shooting and killing another female student at Alpine High School in West  Just 20 days later, on September 28, a 6-year-old boy was fatally shot on the playground of Townville Elementary School in South Carolina by a 14-year-old boy who had just killed his father. Another child and a teacher were struck by bullets but survived.  I know some of you are thinking: I haven't heard about these shootings. That is a problem in and of itself. School shootings have become so commonplace and so much a part of our lives that children dying in our schools may not make it into the paper. We might miss it. We cannot let this become commonplace. It cannot be the new norm.  Another incident you may not have heard of happened last A gunman opened fire in the special education classroom of his estranged wife at North Park Elementary School in San Bernardino, CA, killing her and an 8-year-old boy and wounding another child.  In September of last year, in Rockford, WA, a 15-year-old boy was killed at Freeman High School and three female students were wounded when authorities say another 15-year-old boy opened fire with a handgun.  In December of last year, two students at Aztec High School in New Mexico were killed by a gunman disguised as a student.  Barely a month ago, in January, 2 students were killed and 14 wounded by gunfire when a student opened fire before classes began at Marshall County High School in West A 15-year-old--a 15-year-old--is being charged for this crime.  This time, the survivors are speaking out in a forceful way like we have not[[Page S1298]]heard before. I think the students speaking out have had a clear, articulate message that this carnage needs to stop. I am not sure I know any lawmaker or American who would disagree with the idea that our students need to be safe in their schools. It means that we need to act--really act this time.  Setting aside the outrageous idea of arming teachers, it has been heartening to see the President move in the direction of legislative solutions, such as expanding background checks and banning bump stocks. The devil is always in the details, and we will see how far the President is willing to stray from the NRA and whether the Republican leadership will back the President or remain on the sidelines of protecting the American people and especially our children.  On that Valentine's Day, February 14, when I heard about the shooting in Parkland, FL, my immediate reaction was horror, pain, and outrage. How could we allow this to happen yet again? Schools should be a safe harbor for our children, not a place of killing and terror. I was in my office thinking about how tragic this is, not only for those who were killed but for all the children who were there. I am as frustrated as the people across this country. I want to pass commonsense gun safety legislation. Why shouldn't we get these military-style weapons off the streets?  It is hard to know what will motivate the congressional leadership to bring up this issue, what will jar them to action. I want action. We may not solve the problem entirely, but we need to try. We need to do something.  A new CNN poll released just this Sunday finds that 70 percent of Americans now back tougher gun laws. This is a huge jump from 52 percent after the tragic, horrific October shootings in Las This number includes 49 percent of Republicans, which I think is encouraging. Saving lives should not be a partisan issue. Commonsense gun safety legislation should not be a partisan issue.  Public opinion polls may not be perfect, but they are generally helpful to show trends. Americans are getting it. It is time that we do. This trend toward protecting the American people, and especially our children, is moving in the right direction. The American people are letting their voices be heard on this issue.  Thoughts and prayers might console the grieving for a moment, but action speaks louder and will have a lasting impact. From my hometown of Baltimore to the many towns across America that have had their names in the headlines because of gun-related tragedies or mass shootings, people are calling upon Congress to act.  I don't care what the reasons are for a change of heart, but let's get bills on the floor. What we are proposing are logical next steps to address the deadly problem that has been festering in this country for too long. Too many young lives have been lost. Will this time be different?

614,topic-id,1881,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon--and I know I will be joined by a number of my colleagues on the floor--to talk about gun violence and to talk about what happened most recently and tragically in the State of I hope we can cover a number of aspects of this challenge, but I wanted to start with the victims who were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14. I will make reference to the individuals more specifically a little later, but we are remembering them today. We are thinking of their families and certainly thinking as well of the surviving students.  We are praying for the families, the victims, and the survivors. I can't imagine what these families are dealing with right now just days after this tragedy. There are a lot of ways to express grief, a lot of ways to somehow articulate the loss. I can't do it adequately, so I will turn to, in this case, a songwriter, recording artist Bruce We all know a good bit of his music, but years ago, after 9/11, he wrote the lyrics to a song which was entitled, ``You're Missing.'' Of course, it has application for those who have loved and lost, especially in this instance, so tragically.  Bruce Springsteen's words go, in part, like this, and the refrain of the song is ``You're missing.'' At one point he says:       You're missing when I shut out the lights       You're missing, when I close my eyes       You're missing, when I see the sun rise  He is giving us a sense of the loss--all day, every day, all night, every night--for that family member. He was speaking and reflecting upon the losses of9/11, but anyone who has lost a loved one, especially this way--in this case, victims of murder in the school--must be thinking the same about what is missing in their lives and who is missing in their life, whether it is a son, a daughter, or another loved one.  Gun violence in our country is all too common. It is almost hard to comprehend how common it has become, and unfortunately it is all too common not just for our country but especially for the younger generation. I will not provide lines of demarcation, but a lot of young people have known little else in their young lives but reading about or seeing on television stories about gun violence or being in the midst of an act of gun violence. At least hundreds of Americans have been in schools that have been the site of gun violence in the last 20 years or so.  What we ought to do here is, in addition to giving speeches and pointing out where we should go--that is helpful, I guess, but the most important thing the Senate can do is to debate and vote. It would be ideal if we would debate one bill and then vote on it, then have another debate on another bill and vote on that, and do that again and again and see where we end up. I think most people here would be willing to do that even if we knew the result, even if you could prove to us that this particular measure will not pass or this one will be close or that one might pass. Whatever the circumstance, we should debate this issue. This institution is supposed to be all about open debate on the issues of the day. That is what I think that not only young people across the country but people of all ages are expecting of us. They expect us to debate and vote and keep trying to pass a measure that might reduce or maybe even substantially reduce the likelihood of further gun violence in schools and all other kinds of places in our society.  Of course, we are thinking particularly about schools, where students should have a reasonable but sometimes cannot be sure of a reasonable expectation of security. I can't imagine this as a student. In all the years I was in school, we never even thought about this as a reality in our lives. People my age probably never thought about it for 1 minute. People who grew up in the 1960s or 1970s or 1980s never thought about this. It is only in the last generation or so that students have had to worry about and think about and unfortunately, for some, experience this kind of violence.  I was a teacher for 1 year. I was a volunteer in North Philadelphia in a fifth grade classroom. I only taught for a year and knew I would only be teaching for a year of volunteer work, but I never thought about this. I can't imagine what I would do even if I had some training in law enforcement. Even if I had some training in how to handle a weapon, I can't imagine having to defend a classroom against this kind of killer with a high-powered weapon, where he can shoot bullets, one after another, into a classroom. I can't even imagine, and most people can't imagine.  Schools are supposed to be places of teaching, of learning, of friendship, of competition, and of engagement with all kinds of activities in a school. Of course, schools are supposed to be places of growth, where young people start high school or grade school--high school for 4 years, grade school for longer--come through that, and grow into the kind of person their families hope they will be. Schools should not be places of fear and trepidation and uncertainty about what might happen in that school. This is not a common thought that students in years past had, that they would go to school and not be safe, that they would go to school and potentially not come home.  What has been heartening and inspiring in the aftermath of this tragedy is what young people have done in Parkland in the State of Florida and, frankly, throughout the country. The other day, one of my colleagues said something that made a lot of sense. My colleague made the statement that the Senate is not where the focus of attention is. This Senator said that the focus of attention is on these young people. They are leading. In this case, Congress might have to follow, but we should follow them. They are leading on this. They are showing us the way. Young people are charting a new course on this issue, and they are not going away. They are going to be voting for 50 more years or longer. They are not going away, and this issue won't go away. They are leading us, and we should follow them. They and their families expect us to act. That means debating and voting. It doesn't just mean giving speeches or expressing condolence.  Many of us were moved and inspired by their leadership, and we continue to be so inspired. Many of us were moved to tears and outpourings of emotion on all of these tragedies. I will never forget what I was thinking and responding to when it came to the Newtown massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary That, for me, was a seminal moment in my life in the That tragedy informed how I would vote going forward. That tragedy moved me to take a different approach to these issues and, frankly, to vote a different way.  Starting in 2012 and 2013, in the aftermath of that tragedy, the one question I had to ask myself at the time--and I think we are still asking ourselves tragedy after tragedy--is there no action Congress can take that will substantially reduce the likelihood of gun violence in a school? Is there no action[[Page S1276]]that the most powerful country in the history of the human race can take to reduce this likelihood? If our answer is no, then I guess that is the way some will vote, and they will move on to other issues. I don't think many Americans believe that. I think most Americans believe there are actions we can take. It won't be one bill or one amendment or one vote, but there are a series of steps we can take over time, and it will take too much time, but we have to start now to consider, debate, and vote on a number of measures.  I want to turn to my colleagues in just a moment.  In the time after the Sandy Hook Elementary tragedy, I was, as many of us were, reading about these young children and the horror in that classroom. I happened to tear out a newspaper page from the Wall Street These were printed in all kinds of newspapers across the country. You can't see it from a distance, but it is a yellowed copy of that page. It is from the Wall Street Journal dated December 17, 2012, page The inscription above it is ``Shattered Lives.'' It has pictures of the students and pictures of their teachers and others in the school as well. They were all victims of gun violence. I won't go through the stories, but these are powerful stories of their lives. We have to ask ourselves, in the aftermath of that kind of a tragedy--just like the most recent tragedy--are we going to celebrate their lives and tell the world how much they contributed to the life of America but then in the same breath say: But we have to move on to another issue. I don't think that is an American approach. I don't think that is the approach of a great nation, of a great people.  When we are at our best, we tackle problems. We know it will take a long time. We know it will take a number of votes and a number of actions. But we have to begin. I think we should begin.  In this instance, I am not going to go through all the names or all the names from every tragedy, of course, but let me read just the first names of the victims in I know the senior Senator from Florida, because of his concern for these victims and their families and his knowledge of his home State, will go into even more detail. I will read the first names. As we are reading them, we should think about what we can do, what we should do as a people, or should we just do what has been done too many other times and move on?  Alyssa, Scott, Martin, Nicholas, Aaron, Jaime, Chris, Luke, Cara, Gina, Joaquin, Alaina, Meadow, Helena, Alex, Carmen, and Peter--17 individuals who are missing in the lives of their family, missing what their classmates are experiencing every day; missing from the lives of those classmates, sometimes their best friends. As the songwriter says, those 17 are missing when they shut out the lights. They are missing when they close their eyes at night. And they are missing when they see the sunrise.  We have an obligation. We are dutybound as an institution but maybe more importantly, as a people, to take action. The time is now--maybe not to finish action, but the time is now to take action.

717,topic-id,1387,"Mr.President, I rise today to commemorate Black History Month and to pay tribute to a Pennsylvanian who has dedicated her life to public service.  Today, we honor former Philadelphia councilwoman Marian Benton Tasco, whose 50-year career in public service has improved the lives of countless people in our Throughout her career, Marian Tasco consistently fought for the people of her community. From her first days as a typist working in the city of Philadelphia to the end of her seventh term serving on[[Page S1205]]the city council, Marian Tasco's life has been dedicated to helping people. Today we celebrate Marian's commitment to public service.  Born during the days of segregation in Greensboro, NC, Marian Tasco was joyfully raised through the love and care of her mother, Mazie Benton; her great-grandmother, Susie Short; and her grandparents, Alice and Thomas At an early age, Marian expressed an interest in community service through volunteer activities with the Brownies and Girl Scouts of Even as a child, Marian Tasco was inspired to help others.  It was at this point in her life that Marian imagined that she would go on to become an educator. With that goal in mind, she began her education at Bennett College, a historically Black liberal arts college for women, which is located in Marian worked during the summers to pay for her tuition. After 2 years, Marian had to leave Bennett when she could no longer afford to pay the cost of tuition. Later in life, Marian would return to Bennett College as a member of the board of trustees and actively work to support the growth of the college.  After leaving Bennett, Marian Tasco moved to Philadelphia to be with her family and to continue her education at Temple Again working to pay her way through school, she attended classes at night until her graduation.  While she maintained a strong interest in serving others, she decided that, rather than education, politics and government would be her venue for service. In 1959, Marian began her work for the city of Philadelphia as a clerk typist I in the Philadelphia Police Department's Pawn Brokers As a result of her diligent work, not long thereafter, she was promoted to clerk typist In this new role, she was reassigned to the registrar's office of the Philadelphia Museum of  Like many others who have served the public, Marian Tasco's story in politics began on the frontlines of the community--the community she would later go on to serve.  Under the leadership of a distinguished lawyer, Charles Bowser, Marian served as a task force coordinator for the Greater Philadelphia Urban Affairs This is an organization that she continues to serve today as a board member. One of Marian's greatest accomplishments was the creation of a youth-focused summer work program that still exists today. Her experience at the Urban Affairs Coalition affirmed her interest in public affairs and community outreach and helped increase her understanding of the needs of the African-American community in  As her career progressed and new opportunities emerged, Marian Tasco remained committed to the path of service. Following her work as an assistant to the former secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Delores Tucker, Marian brought her passion for service to the office of the late U.Congressman William Gray He also, of course, served as House majority whip and chairman of the Budget She worked as both campaign manager and director of constituent services for Congressman  Serving with Secretary Tucker and Congressman Gray made Marian Tasco worthy of recognition, but Marian wanted to do more. She decided that with her years of experience in community activism and public service, she would seek elected office. It was at the urging of Marian's mentor, former Representative, City Councilman, and Secretary of Public Welfare John White, Jr., that she made the decision to seek elected office.  In 1983, Marian became the first African American elected Philadelphia city commissioner. Instantly, she helped develop voter education and registration programs in the city and worked to grow civic education focusing on Philadelphia's young people.  In 1988, Marian began her first term on the Philadelphia City Council as a representative for the ninth district of the city. For over 27 years, she served in a number of communities, including East Oak Lane, West Oak Lane, Mount Airy, Olney, Logan, Lawncrest, and Oxford She would go on to be reelected seven times and pioneer initiatives to improve the quality of life for Philadelphians young and old.  Throughout her tenure in office, Councilwoman Tasco's role continued to grow in responsibility and scope. She eventually rose to serve as Philadelphia City Council's majority leader, as well as majority whip.  Marian Tasco has served as ward leader for the 50th Ward of Philadelphia for the last three decades. She was also unanimously elected by the Pennsylvania Democratic State Committee to represent Pennsylvania on the Democratic National In this DNC role, Councilwoman Tasco's reach grew beyond Philadelphia into the national political arena.  She helped institute meaningful change in Philadelphia and literally across the Among other issues, she worked to fight predatory lending, and her work in that area positively impacted the lives of many Her commitment to ``protect Americans from unscrupulous dealings of financial institutions'' spanned both Broad Street and Wall Street and helped inspire some of President Barack Obama's work. Her advocacy on this issue dates back to the early 1990s, when she worked with community organizations to alert Philadelphia residents about the potential harm of money offered by loan sharks. In 2004, she briefed then-State Senator Obama on the issue during his campaign for the U.In commemoration of her efforts, President Obama invited Councilwoman Tasco to join him for the signing of the historic Dodd-Frank legislation.  Marian Tasco's accomplishments in public office made Philadelphia a better place to live and work, and the people of Pennsylvania's largest city remembered. Her retirement celebrations had over 1,200 attendees, including elected officials, labor leaders, community leaders, clergy, and, of course, constituents--the people she served. Councilwoman Tasco is a beloved figure throughout the city of Philadelphia and beyond. She is beloved by her peers and those she represented as a councilwoman.  Marian's work in public service was a shining example for others to follow. Philadelphia mayor and former city council member Jim Kenney and former mayor and councilman Michael Nutter have both cited the councilwoman as a mentor. In fact, Mayor Kenney even noted that Councilwoman Tasco ``raised him'' from the age of 32, when he was a new council member.  She also has a proven legacy of recognizing and developing young talent on her own team. Two current members of the Philadelphia City Council, Derrick Green and Cherelle Parker, and the late Judge Brenda Frazier-Clemons all served as members of her staff.  Councilwoman Marian Tasco's lifetime of service has been the subject of commendation. She has received a notable list of awards and honors, including an honorary doctorate of laws degree from Lincoln Her years of work to improve the city of Philadelphia resulted in a lifetime appointment to the Board of Directors of City Trusts, the Philadelphia Cultural Fund, and the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority Board, just to name a few. For her advocacy on behalf of behavioral health programs and work to push local healthcare reforms, the former Lindley Court senior living apartments were renamed in her honor.  Marian Tasco has spent the better part of her life working to improve her community, and she has inspired the next generation of public servants. As we celebrate this Black History Month, we honor those who have made a real commitment to serve others. Marian Tasco has always honored that commitment.  On behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the city of Philadelphia, and all those whose lives have been impacted and inspired by her work, it is my privilege on this day to pay tribute to Marian Tasco, a former member and leader of the City Council of Philadelphia and a devoted public servant who worked her way from clerk typist I to citywide leader with national impact.  Well done, Your adopted city and our Commonwealth are proud of your noble work.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

767,topic-id,1301,"Mr.President, I rise today as Syria is about to enter its eighth year of conflict. We have witnessed 7 years of displacement and violence, 7 years of war crimes, and 7 years of Bashar al-Assad's illegitimate grasp on power. To say that it is past time for Assad to go or that it is past time for the conflict to be resolved dramatically underestimates the horrible suffering and destruction the people of Syria have experienced. In these 7 years, almost 500,000 Syrians have been killed and more than 12 million have been displaced from their homes.  This conflict has disproportionately affected children, as all conflicts do. According to Save the Children, inside Syria, 7.5 million children have lived their whole lives knowing nothing but war. Emotional and psychological stress has manifested itself physically; Syrian children now face an increase in heart disease, diabetes, and depression. These children are growing up in refugee camps, with no end in sight. This means the loss of their childhood and[[Page S1335]]of educational opportunities. I don't exaggerate when I say that because of this war, an entire generation of Syrians will be both displaced and disaffected in an already volatile region. Ignoring these children ensures decades of instability to come.  In Eastern Ghouta this past week, we saw the most recent example of the brutality of the Assad regime, aided and abetted by Russia and While only just now making headlines, Eastern Ghouta has been held under siege by the Syrian Government since 2013. This neighborhood, which had supposedly been designated as a deescalation zone, has been bombarded by Syrian Government forces armed with Russian weapons. In just a few days, 500 civilians have been killed, and that number is growing.  Years after the international community reached a consensus that Assad had lost his legitimacy as the leader of Syria, he not only remains in power but is more secure than ever. The United States has not only failed to exert moral leadership in the face of Syrian suffering but has also failed to show strategic leadership in the face of a tangible threat to U.national security.  I have long called on both the Obama and Trump administrations, warning that U.interests were not being represented in Syrian negotiations, but this has never been more clearly illustrated than in November of this past year, November of 2017, when a picture circulated of Presidents Ruhani, Putin, and Erdogan shaking hands in Russia after a round of negotiations to determine a potential resolution of the Syrian conflict.  I have to ask, is it now U.policy to let these three dictate policy in the Middle East--Ruhani, Putin, and Erdogan? The United States was not there, nor were our European allies. The United States is failing our own interests by ceding leadership in Syria to Iran and Russia, whose national security interests often directly contradict our own.  What do these bullying regimes want from Syria?  Let's start with Iran sees Syria as an investment in its political infrastructure and its campaign for regional hegemony. It is their ``land bridge'' from Tehran to Beirut, a weapons pipeline, a training camp for It is a practice ground for a future war with  What about the Russians? The Russian Government, led by Mr.Putin, has made clear that they believe all Syrian territory must return to the Assad regime and to the Assad regime's control before political reforms can be considered. Putin seeks a solution that shows that he is the arbiter of events in the Middle Lately, foreign leaders--including Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, President Ruhani, and King Salman of Saudi Arabia--fly to Moscow instead of They see a Russia that seeks to write the rules of international order and an America that sits back, too enmeshed in our own political strife to lead.  This is not the America that I know and that most Americans know. The America I know does not believe that where you are born should dictate where you live or die or if you spend your childhood in a refugee camp. The America I know does not stand by while enemy nations threaten to expand their spheres of influence. The America I know sees the complexity of our own foreign involvements, understanding, for instance, that ISIS cannot be fully defeated without considering the context of the Syrian civil war. The America I know supports its allies, like Israel, that share a chaotic border with a nation at war with itself.  In 1963, President John Kennedy spoke at the Fort Worth, TX, Chamber of Commerce on the challenges posed by the Soviet regime.  He said:       This country, which desires only to be free, which desires      to be secure, which desired to live at peace for 18 years      under three different administrations, has borne more than      its share of the burden, has stood watch for more than its      number of years. I don't think we are fatigued or tired. We      would like to live as we once lived. But history will not      permit it. . . . The balance of power is still on the side of      freedom. We are still the keystone in the arch of freedom,      and I think we will continue to do as we have done in our      past, our duty.  So said President He spoke to the paradox of our country then and now, what we continue to face. If we are to remain the keystone in the arch of freedom, we cannot become fatigued by the responsibility to fight tyranny.  These are the very issues that should receive public debate as part of the congressional consideration of a new authorization for the use of military force, known by the acronym We undermine our own credibility when we continue to send our men and women into conflicts that Congress has not authorized. Secretary Tillerson, our Secretary of State, has indicated that he sees a need for a long-term U.military presence in Syria; yet many of us believe that there is no purely military solution to this conflict. Where is the strategy? we ask. I would like to see the administration put forward a plan that encompasses all components of this conflict--military, political, and humanitarian.  When we ask our men and women in uniform to put their lives on the line to protect our homeland and fight terrorism, we need to be willing to back them up by doing our jobs here in Just consider Pennsylvanians have made a substantial sacrifice in the past 17 years of war as 288 of our brave servicemembers have been killed in action in those 17 years and as almost 2,000 have been wounded in action in Afghanistan and  We owe it to these men and women to have a robust, bipartisan debate about this strategy and a vote on an We should also vote on legislation to cut off financing for ISIS or any other terrorist organization in the world. I have a bipartisan bill, the Stop Terrorists Operational Resources and Money Act, the so-called STORM Act, with Senator I have a bill, as well, with Senator Rubio, the Preventing Destabilization of Iraq and Syria Act, to promote humanitarian aid and sanction the Russian and Iranian actors who are destabilizing this region--all of the components of a comprehensive strategy.  Let's have a serious debate on this critical national security issue. We are not always faced with situations in which our moral obligation and our strategic priorities lead to the same conclusion, but this is one of those rare moments.  May it be said of us years from now, just as President Kennedy said, that we do our duty to continue to be the keystone in the arch of freedom, including helping the Syrian people, especially her children, be free of Assad's brutality and bombing.

893,topic-id,341,"Mr.President, I wish to recognize and honor Reading Terminal Market as it celebrates the 125th anniversary of its founding in  Reading Terminal Market officially opened on February 22, 1893, under the Reading Railroad Company and is one of the Nation's oldest farmers' markets. The market was a result of the city's consolidation of public markets in the early 19th century due to the mass number of merchants and health hazards that became associated with merchant stalls.  Reading Terminal Market opened with approximately 78,000 square feet, including 800 spaces for merchants to sell their goods. The market was prosperous during the Great Depression and World War II due to local farmers coming to the city because of high demand and fair prices. Individuals living in the suburbs could have their groceries delivered for free through the use of the train station. Employees at the Reading Terminal would load carts of groceries onto trains and deliver them to each station as the customer requested. Much of Reading Terminal Market's customer base and services relied on the Reading Railroad  When the railroad company failed, the market suffered and experienced financial hardship from the 1960s to the early 1990s.

1459,topic-id,1262,"Mr.President, I restate my support for the investigations by Robert Mueller into Russia's election interference, as well as to condemn the partisan attacks on the independent investigation being led by Robert Mueller, who has been an honorable public servant over many decades.  In 2016, our Nation came under attack by a hostile foreign power. Everyone knows that now. Our election process--the bedrock of our system of government--was targeted by Russian agents. They used a variety of measures to pursue their goals. The intelligence community's unclassified report concluded:       We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an      influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.presidential      election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in      the U.democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and      harm her electability and potential presidency. We further      assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear      preference for President-elect  That is from the unclassified report of our intelligence community.  These brazen and illegal actions have already resulted in the indictments of 13 Russian individuals and three Russian companies as part of Special Counsel Mueller's investigation.  Russia may not have used traditional military force against us, but the actions they took present just as serious a threat to our national security. Make no mistake, when a foreign adversary targets an American election, it has targeted America, itself. Yet the President, whose own campaign is being examined as part of the Russia investigation, has refused to enforce sanctions against He has refused to fight back against Putin and his regime, despite there being clear evidence that they attacked us. The President's failure to take action against Russia underscores the urgent need for Special Counsel Mueller's independent investigation to continue unfettered.  In this investigation, Mr.Mueller has already amassed enough evidence to have a grand jury indict Russian operatives and high-ranking members of the Trump campaign, including former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and deputy campaign manager Rick Other Trump advisers, like Mr.Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn, have pled guilty to Federal crimes.  Unfortunately, as this evidence has come forward, unwarranted, dangerous, and partisan attacks on Mr.Mueller's investigation and on Mr.Mueller, himself, have accelerated; yet a brief glance at Mr.Mueller's lifetime of service reflects his commitment to serving the American people with honor, integrity, and courage that, I think, is unmatched by anyone I know in Here are a couple of examples.  As a young man, Mr.Mueller served with distinction in the Vietnam war and was awarded a Bronze Star, two Navy Commendation Medals, the Purple Heart, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry for his leadership and exemplary service.  Mr.Mueller received the Bronze Star for his ``heroic achievement'' after leading his fellow marines through an 8-hour battle, where, under enemy fire, ``Second Lieutenant Mueller fearlessly moved from one position to another, directing the accurate counterfire of his men and shouting words of encouragement to them. . . . [H]e then skillfully supervised the evacuation of casualties from the hazardous fire area.'' After that battle, he was promoted to first lieutenant.  Just 4 months later, he sustained a bullet wound when he responded to an ambush by enemy forces on marines who were in his command. For his heroic response, Mr.Mueller received the Navy Commendation Medal with a citation praising him for rushing to save his fellow marines while ``completely disregarding his own safety.''  I will give a recitation of some of the record that Special Counsel Mueller developed long before he was named to this position. I was going through his actions as a marine in combat, and I have a few more parts of his record to review.  Mr.Mueller not only fought courageously on the battlefield, but upon returning home earned his law degree. He continued serving his country throughout his legal career.  After serving in U.attorney's offices in both Boston and San Francisco for over a decade, he later served at the Justice Department leading the Criminal Division of the Justice Department under President George H.There he oversaw cases ranging from the prosecution of the Panamanian dictator, Manuel Noriega, to the Lockerbie bombing.[[Page S1342]]  In 1995, Mr.Mueller left a high-paying position in the private sector to join the DC U.attorney's office--in this case, the Homicide Division--working to hold violent offenders accountable for their crimes.  Three years later, he became a U.attorney himself, serving again in San Francisco and earning a reputation as a dogged and fair prosecutor committed to enforcing the rule of law.  In 2001, Mr.Mueller was nominated by a second Republican President, President George Bush, to be the Director of the He was then confirmed unanimously by this body. His tenure at the FBI included leading the response to the September 11 attacks, spearheading the Bureau's efforts to combat cyber crime, which has been widely praised. In fact, in 2011, when his 10-year term was scheduled to end, we in the Senate voted 100 to 0 to extend his term as FBI Director through 2013, another 10 years.  Though our political system has become more polarized, each time Mr.Mueller has been named or nominated for a new position, he has received unqualified praise from people across the political spectrum and rightly so.  With Mr.Mueller's record as a war hero, a dedicated public servant, and an expert in law enforcement, it is hard to imagine anyone better suited to lead the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. There is no one in Washington, DC, or, frankly, in all of America better prepared to do this job.  Serious congressional oversight of executive branch operations is always appropriate. However, the reckless partisan attacks on Mr.Mueller's investigation and on Mr.Mueller himself are not the same as congressional oversight. Such attacks have made us less safe as a nation. The political smears like those we have seen undermine our rule of law and strike at the heart of our democracy. They are a disservice to the brave men and women in law enforcement who put their lives on the line to keep all of us safe.  As Members of the U.Congress, we have a duty to uphold the rule of law and the principles of fairness and independence that American democracy is built upon.  I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to defend the integrity of Mr.Mueller's investigation and reject the politically motivated attempts to discredit the investigation and its underlying conclusions. I call on the House and Senate majority to give us a vote on legislation to protect Special Counsel Mueller's independence and ensure that he can continue his investigation free from interference.  To ensure the integrity of our elections and our democracy, we must make sure we never allow a hostile foreign power to interfere in our electoral process again, and to do that we must allow the special counsel to get to the bottom of what Russia did in 2016 and whether it was aided by American individuals. That is what the whole investigation is about--those two parts.  History, of course, will be our judge. We will be judged about how we handled this crisis. We know that in 1787, when the Constitutional Convention had just adjourned, Benjamin Franklin was asked what kind of government the Convention had chosen for our young nation. He responded that the Convention has given us ``[a] Republic, if you can keep it.''  Democratic principles are only as strong as those elected to uphold them. I hope my colleagues will stand together and stand strong to preserve the rule of law and the institutions of this Republic we have been given, and we must ``keep it,'' as Franklin said.

957,topic-id,262," That is so wrong, that we passed a huge tax bill and put ourselves in deep debt so that much of the money can go to corporate executives--not improving the actual performance of their companies but just raising the value of their stock by buybacks. That is so wrong.  The article in the New York Times documents how the Republican tax bill has unleashed this wave of share buybacks and stock repurchasing programs, which, as I said, helps out rich executives and shareholders but doesn't accomplish much for everyday workers.  Rather than investing in new equipment and research, raising wages, providing better benefits, and raising productivity, which we are so short of here[[Page S1225]]in America right now, corporate America is using the Trump tax cut to give itself a raise.  At Morgan Stanley--hardly a leftwing company--the analysts surveyed a bunch of companies, and the companies surveyed said that they would pass only 13 percent of the Trump tax cut savings on to workers, compared to the 43 percent that go to share buybacks. For manufacturers--we all care about manufacturing--it is even worse. They expect 9 percent to go to workers and 47 percent to go to share buybacks.  Republicans made a conscious decision to give corporations and the wealthiest Americans the lion's share of the tax cuts and promised it would trickle down to everybody else.

1216,topic-id,944,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am honored to stand before you today to pay tribute to the life and service of a true American hero, First Sergeant Andrew McKenna, by naming the Bristol Post Office in his honor.  A native of Bristol, Rhode Island, Sergeant McKenna dedicated 17 years of his life to serve and protect our country in the United States  Born in 1980 to his mother, Carol, and father, Peter, Sergeant McKenna knew at the age of 5 years old that he wanted to be a soldier, and by the age of 7 that he wanted to serve the Nation as a Green His family and close childhood friends recall him wearing camouflage-patterned clothes almost every day.  Sergeant McKenna attended Mount Hope High School in Bristol, graduating in the spring of 1998. Upon graduation, he immediately enlisted in the Army as an infantryman.  After just 3 years, he went to selection for the Green He completed the grueling Special Forces Qualification Course in 2003, achieving his lifelong dream to be a part of the military's most elite.  Sergeant McKenna was then assigned to the First Battalion, 7th Special Forces He went on to serve one tour of duty in Iraq and five more tours in  During his first tour in Afghanistan, from 2004 to 2005, First Sergeant McKenna was awarded the Bronze Star with Valor for his tremendous courage under fierce enemy fire during a mission that resulted in the death of a senior Taliban official. He would then go[[Page H1351]]on to earn 18 military awards, including the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Purple Heart, the Army Commendation Medal, and the Army Achievement  First Sergeant McKenna is remembered at each of his duty stations for his intense work ethic, strong attention to detail, commitment to excellence, quick sense of humor, and infectious smile. To this day, former team leaders and fellow servicemembers praise his motivation, leadership, and ability to bring out the best in the people around him.  Of the countless stories I could tell that exemplify these values in Sergeant McKenna, there is one that stands out.  In 2011, Master Sergeant Chris Corbin, a fellow Green Beret, was forced to undergo a double amputation on both legs after stepping on a hidden IED in During a months-long recovery process at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, First Sergeant McKenna would make the 5-hour drive from Fort Bragg, located in North Carolina, to visit Master Sergeant Corbin, sometimes spending multiple days or even weeks at his bedside. Master Sergeant Corbin would later go on to credit Sergeant McKenna's reliability and motivation for getting him through his recovery.  This same selfless devotion to his fellow servicemembers was, of course, not a first for Sergeant McKenna, and it would not be his last in a decorated life that was ended far too soon.  He was stationed at Camp Integrity in Kabul, Afghanistan, in August of 2015 when Taliban soldiers exploded a car bomb outside the gates of the compound in the middle of the night. Four heavily armed insurgents opened fire on security contractors guarding the Special Forces complex, killing eight guards and breaching the facility. Sergeant McKenna was messaging with his mother at the time, and her last message to her son went unanswered.  After hearing an explosion and gunshots, he immediately grabbed his weapon and proceeded to engage the enemy alongside fellow Green Beret, Master Sergeant George                              {time}  1730  During the ensuing firefight, First Sergeant McKenna lost his life and Master Sergeant Vera suffered critical wounds to his spine, kidney, liver, and leg.  Their decision to charge into the fight without hesitation and regard for their own safety likely prevented the deaths of many, many soldiers stationed at that base.  First Sergeant McKenna's bravery and his ultimate sacrifice allowed supporting personnel to eliminate the Taliban attack and secure the complex.  First Sergeant McKenna was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for Valor in Combat, the Nation's third highest decoration for valor, for his courageous and lifesaving actions.  He was fearless. He was heroic. He represented the very highest examples of service, duty, and sacrifice throughout his career and on this fateful day. However, in the words of his friend, Master Sergeant Corbin: ``That's just There's dozens of times he's done stuff like that.''  First Sergeant McKenna was laid to rest in Mary's Cemetery in Bristol next to his brother, Patrick, who passed away in 2005.  He is survived by his mother and father, whom I had the honor of hosting for President Obama's final State of the Union  The First Sergeant Andrew McKenna, Jr., Memorial Scholarship Fund, set up in his memory, awards $6,000 in scholarships every year to Rhode Island high school students planning to attend college or serve in the Armed  Andrew McKenna was a true American hero who embodied the very best of Rhode Island values.  His patriotism, loyalty, and sense of shared purpose were reflections of his strong character and the values he learned growing up in  I consider myself fortunate to have met First Sergeant McKenna in 2015 at the Bristol Fourth of July parade and for my continued relationship with his wonderful family.  I am proud to lead the effort here in Congress to honor First Sergeant McKenna's legacy that means so much to his family, his friends, the town of Bristol, and the State of Rhode  Mr.Speaker, I extend my gratitude to Chairman Gowdy and Ranking Member Cummings for their support of this bill, as well as my good friend and cosponsor of this bill, Congressman Jim  Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their courtesy and urge my colleagues to support this bill.

1044,topic-id,730,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Representative Evans for yielding to me.  Mr.Speaker, I proudly represent the Sixth Congressional District of South Carolina in this august body. This past week, I spent a significant amount of time throughout the district meeting with faith leaders as well as other community-based organizations. And one of the things I kept hearing came from people who are particularly interested in whether or not this Congress will do anything to respond to this horrific problem that we have with guns.  Of all the things that I find myself talking about, the one thing that bothers me most is the fact that we seem to be no longer safe in our most sacred institutions.  I often quote Alexis de Tocqueville, who came to this country way back in the early 1800s seeking what he called the magic of this great country. He said that he went throughout the country looking at our institutions--educational institutions, legislative bodies--trying to find the magic of this great country. Alexis de Tocqueville said that he could not find it in any of these places. He said that it was not until he went into our churches and[[Page H1252]]synagogues that he found the real magic of this great country. He said that he came to the conclusion that, in spite of all of the difficulties and challenges we had as a country, that America was great because Americans are good.  And he went on to surmise that, if Americans ever cease to be good, America will cease to be great. It is kind of interesting that he came to that conclusion by visiting our places of worship. And tonight I want to remind the American people that that sacred institution has been violated time and time again.  And on this question of gun violence, we remember the Emanuel 9: nine soulful Bible study pupils in the basement of their church, once again reestablishing the goodness of They had that goodness violated by a young man with a gun who sat among them for a full hour before opening fire, killing nine of them.  Now, when we think about that incident and we ask ourselves how could such a thing happen, one of the things that we do know is that this young man was able to purchase a weapon, although under the law he was not eligible to make the purchase; but because of a loophole that we have in the law, a loophole that I have taken to call the ``Charleston Loophole,'' which says simply that, if the background check is not completed within 3 days, the purchase can proceed to conclusion.  Now, the fact of the matter is, this gun was purchased in West I don't know whether or not this young man had enough sophistication about the law to give the wrong information about his address. but what we do know is that the wrong address was keyed in; and because it was keyed in, there was difficulty trying to get the information that was needed.                              {time}  1945  By the time they found out the problem, the 3 days had expired, and the young man went back to get the gun, and, within days, traveled all the way from Columbia, South Carolina, down to  He picked this church because, he said, it was historic.

Tomorrow, I am going to come before this body with a discharge petition, because the legislation to close this loophole was filed in this body last It has been hanging around now for 8 months.

1046,topic-id,315,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his question.  I am sort of a history buff, and so I have spent a little time trying to find out what this country is all about. I also recall a great writer, George Santayana, once writing that if we fail to learn the lessons of our history, we are bound to repeat them.  I believe that history should be instructive, and I think that that is what de Tocqueville was talking about in his writings. He really came to this country, from France, to study our penal system on that particular occasion, but he was enamored with this country because of its people.  Now, the interesting thing about this, remember, the early 1800s when he came here, slavery was the law of the land, and he wrote about how contradictory that was to what he found in people's hearts, the goodness that he found in people.  So irrespective of what the challenges may be of the various institutions that we may have, the various legal issues that may come before us, the various legislative accomplishments we might make, irrespective of all that, there is a certain goodness in Americans that ought to be on demonstration at all times.  I really feel that it will demonstrate that goodness if we can say to these nine souls that, just as Alexis de Tocqueville found in our places of worship, what the basic goodness about America is all about, that is what they were in pursuit of as they sat in the basement of their church, Emanuel AME, on Calhoun Street, Charleston, South Carolina, they were there perpetuating that goodness, and it was violated.  I believe that this body can take a long step toward demonstrating how important that is by saying, in their memory, we are going to close this loophole so that their nine souls can rest in peace.

Every 2 minutes. In 2016, 8,042 cases were reported to the National Human Trafficking Hotline,[[Page H1236]]with 110 of those occurring in Those are just the cases that were reported. Human trafficking remains a hidden crime, and victims rarely seek help because of cultural barriers or due to fear of their traffickers, law enforcement, or of being deported, because many are imported into our country to engage in sex crimes.  In April 2016, I joined with the Department of Homeland Security in hosting our conference in Memphis, and from there came our legislation. The SOAR Act directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a program to provide training to healthcare providers at all levels on human trafficking.  Trafficking victims often end up in healthcare settings, and because traffickers want to maximize profits, victims will not have health insurance and will not often follow up on treatment. And pimps and johns will beat up the women, and they will end up in a public healthcare facility because they don't have insurance.  Mr.Speaker, 57 percent of trafficking victims report physical injuries, and nearly all report having faced either sexual abuse or physical violence. These injuries caused a reported 63 percent of trafficking victims to go to the emergency room when they are being exploited. Many victims also end up with sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, and are at high risk of pregnancy. As a result, nearly 88 percent of trafficked victims are seen by a healthcare provider at some point and, more likely than not, it is in an emergency room. So these are the people we seek out most to train and see the signs of trafficking to be able to report it to law enforcement and help these ladies out of the situation they are in.  Despite this, out of more than 5,600 hospitals in the country, only a handful have a plan for treating patients who are victims of trafficking, and over 95 percent of emergency room personnel are not trained to identify trafficking victims. As a result, it is estimated that only 1 percent of human trafficking victims are identified when they seek emergency care.  We must encourage healthcare professionals to be alert to possible instances of human trafficking when victims appear in clinics or doctors' offices for needed care, and we must provide them the additional training and resources to accomplish this goal.  I am proud to work on the SOAR to Health and Wellness Act and I urge my colleagues to help pass it today. I thank my cosponsors and the Republican leadership for scheduling this bill.

1369,topic-id,915,"Mr.President, I rise to introduce the Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act, which would prohibit suspected or known terrorists from legally purchasing a firearm.  I thank my colleagues--Senators Heitkamp, Flake, Heinrich, Toomey, Baldwin, King, Nelson, Manchin, and Kaine--for their cosponsorship of this bipartisan bill. I particularly recognize the leadership of Senator Heinrich, who has joined me on the floor this evening as we introduce the bill and explain it to our colleagues.  Often referred to as ``no fly, no buy,'' this bill represents one of the sensible steps that we can take to reform our Nation's gun laws to better protect our people. Our bill is based on a simple principle: If you are considered to be too dangerous to board an airplane, then you are too dangerous to buy a firearm.  Our legislation would grant the Attorney General the authority to block the purchase of a gun by a person who is on either the no-fly or the selectee list. Remarkably, current law does not prohibit a person known or suspected of engaging in terrorism from walking into a gun shop and buying a firearm. The no-fly list and the selectee list are the narrowest subsets of all of the government's terrorist watch lists. These lists include the names of individuals who pose the greatest threat of committing an act of terrorism against aviation, against our homeland, or against U.interests abroad. This bill would also provide an immediate alert to the FBI and to local law enforcement if an individual who has been on the government's terrorist watch list at any time during the past 5 years purchases a firearm.  Our hearts are all broken by the horrific shootings of the students in There was another horrendous shooting in Florida in 2016 that demonstrates why this look-back provision in this legislation is so important. The gunman, Omar Mateen, was on the selectee list for approximately 10 months, but he was no longer on the list when he purchased the 2 guns that he used to murder 49 people and injure scores more. If our bill had been enacted, the FBI would have been notified immediately when Omar Mateen purchased his first firearm in the weeks leading up to the shooting. Then the FBI would have been notified a second time that Mateen had sought to purchase additional firearms. Surely, that would have caused the FBI to reopen its investigation of Omar If our proposal had been law at that time, perhaps that massacre might have been prevented.  I note that our bill would provide robust due process procedures to protect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Any American who would be denied a purchase under this bill would have the opportunity to petition a Federal district court and receive a decision within 14 days. If the government, which would have the burden of proof, would fail to prove its case, it would have to pay attorneys's fees for that individual, and, of course, the purchase of the firearm would go forward.  In 2016, when the Senate voted on our bill, it won majority and bipartisan support. Our bill was endorsed by a distinguished group of military and intelligence leaders. I note that during the 2016 Presidential debates, both candidates agreed with our principle of no fly, no buy. Surely, this is a sensible, reasonable policy around which we can build consensus.  Another step that we can take right now is to pass legislation I introduced with Senator Leahy to explicitly outlaw straw purchasing. Straw purchasing is intended for one purpose only, and that is to put a gun into the hands of a criminal who cannot legally obtain one. Our bill, the Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act, would provide law enforcement with an effective tool to fight the violence that too often goes hand in hand with drug trafficking and gang-related crimes.  Today, gun traffickers exploit weaknesses in our Federal laws by targeting individuals who can lawfully purchase firearms. Sadly, according to briefings that I have had from Federal officials, in the State of Maine gang members from other States have targeted addicts to go buy firearms for them, and then they swap firearms for drugs. Right now a straw purchaser can be prosecuted only for lying on a Federal form, which is treated far too often as just a paperwork violation. Instead of a slap on the wrist, our bill would create new, specific criminal offenses for straw purchasing and trafficking, punishable by hefty prison terms, particularly for those who have reason to believe that the firearms will be used to commit violent crimes.  Our bill would also outlaw firearms and ammunition smuggling out of the United States to another country. That is vitally important for combating drug trafficking near and across our southern border, which is contributing to the heroin crisis here at home.  Let me again be clear that the bill I have introduced with Senator Leahy protects the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.  These are just two commonsense reforms that we can pass while fully protecting the constitutional rights of law-abiding We can make it as difficult for a terrorist to obtain a gun as it is for him to board an airplane. We can outlaw straw purchasing by increasing the penalties to make a real difference. I urge my colleagues to support both the bipartisan Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act and the straw purchasing bill, as well as other commonsense reforms.

The APKWS II All-Up-Round is an air-to-ground weapon      that consists of an APKWS II Guidance Section (GS), legacy      2.75 inch MK66 Mod 4 rocket motor and legacy MK152 and MK435/     436 warhead/fuse. The APKWS II GS is installed between the      rocket motor and warhead and provides a Semi-Active Laser      (SAL) precision capability to legacy unguided 2.75-inch      rockets. The APKWS II is procured as an independent component      to be mated to the appropriate 2.75-inch warhead/fuse;      however, for this case the APKWS II will be delivered as an      All-up-Round (AUR).       2. The GS is manually set with the appropriate laser code      during loading and is launched from any platform configured      with a LAU-68F/A, or similar launcher(s). After launch, the      GS activates and the seeker detects laser energy reflected      from a target designated with a remote or autonomous laser.      The control system then guides the rocket to the target.       3. The only interface required with the host platform is a      28V Direct Current (DC) firing pulse.       4. APKWS II increases stowed kills by providing precise      engagements at standoff ranges with sufficient accuracy for a      high single-shot probability of hit against soft and lightly      armored targets, thereby minimizing collateral damage. The      APKWS II is capable of day and night operations and      performance is many adverse environments.       5.

The Javelin Weapon System is a medium-range, man      portable, shoulder-launched, fire and forget, anti-tank      system for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers. The system      weighs 49.5 pounds and has a maximum range in excess of 2,500      meters. The system is highly lethal against tanks and other      systems with conventional and reactive armors. The system      possesses a secondary capability against bunkers.       2. Javelin's key technical feature is the use of fire-and-     forget technology which allows the gunner to fire and      immediately relocate or take cover. Additional special      features are the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an      advanced tandem warhead and imaging infrared seeker, target      lock-on before launch, and soft launch from enclosures or      covered fighting positions. The Javelin missile also has a      minimum smoke motor thus decreasing its detection on the      battlefield.       3. The Javelin Weapon System is comprised of two major      tactical components, which are a reusable Command Launch Unit      (CLU) and a round contained in a disposable launch tube      assembly. The CLU incorporates an integrated day-night sight      that provides a target engagement capability in adverse      weather and countermeasure environments. The CLU may also be      used in a stand-alone mode for battlefield surveillance and      target detection. The CLU's thermal sight is a second      generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor. To      facilitate initial loading and subsequent updating of      software, all on-board missile software is uploaded via the      CLU after mating and prior to launch.       4. The missile is autonomously guided to the target using      an imaging infrared seeker and adaptive correlation tracking      algorithms. This allows the gunner to take cover or reload      and engage another target after firing a missile. The missile      has an advanced tandem warhead and can be used in either the      top attack or direct fire modes (for target undercover). An      onboard flight computer guides the missile to the selected      target.       5. The Javelin Missile System hardware and the      documentation are The missile software which      resides in the CLU is considered The sensitivity      is primarily in the software programs which instruct the      system how to operate in the presence of countermeasures. The      overall hardware is also considered sensitive in that the      infrared wavelengths could be useful in attempted      countermeasure development.       6. If a technologically advanced adversary obtains      knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the      information could be used to develop countermeasures or      equivalent systems that might reduce weapon system      effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with      similar or advanced capabilities.       7. A determination has been made that Ukraine can provide      substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive      technology being released as the U.This      proposed sale is necessary to further the U.foreign policy      and national security objectives outlined in the Policy            8.

88,topic-id,1413,"Mr.President, today we have a joint Commerce and Judiciary Committee hearing on online privacy and the abuse of data obtained by social media platforms. Ordinarily, I wouldn't come to the Senate floor to talk about an individual legislative hearing, but this is no run-of-the-mill event. The CEO of Facebook will be testifying, and I believe his company and other parties have some important explaining to do.  One question is what Facebook's priorities are and whether they are what they should be. Facebook, of course, is a publicly traded company, and it has a fiduciary duty to its shareholders that it shares in common with every other shareholder-owned enterprise. Its business model is unique. It collects information on billions of people and uses that data to help drive its profits. One wonders whether, and at what point, that profit motive has come to be at odds with protecting the privacy of individual users. To me, that is one of the fundamental questions Mr.Zuckerberg is going to have to answer today.  From testimony released yesterday, we know Facebook will admit it made mistakes; that it didn't take a broad enough view of its responsibility and prevent its tools from being used in ways that it says it did not intend. That act of contrition is one we all welcome, of course, but it will not matter much without additional action, some of which might be even foundational to Facebook's entire business model.  Those changes, we are told, can take some time. Meanwhile, Americans will continue to wonder about their privacy, about who is acquiring data about their political opinions, their personal taste, and their preferences without their informed consent.  How much have any of us read of the terms of service for the social media platforms that we use? They are written by lawyers for legal purposes, which is basically to prevent any lawsuits from being successfully filed against the company. Yet, in terms of informed consent, which is what we ought to be focused on here, how much do consumers really understand about how the data is used that they turn over to these social media platforms?  Mr.Zuckerberg has an opportunity today to explain whether consumers are really being protected in any meaningful way. It is good that Facebook has, in recent months, shut down accounts that have had links to the Russian Government--accounts that were used to meddle in our last election. That is surely one actor we know who has used Facebook in improper ways, but it never should have reached that point. The company should have spotted this attempt of foreign influence much earlier and contained its spread.  In our moving forward, now is the time to demand a comprehensive accounting of internal monitoring efforts as well as the full extent of the infiltration and manipulation of that and other social media platforms in the past, not just by Russia but by other foreign actors, including rogue actors.  In addition to its response to the Russia allegations, Facebook, we have been told, has limited which online apps can literally vacuum up information from users' profiles. Once again, this announcement only tells us so much. We need to understand which apps are still being allowed to mine that data and under what conditions.  We have all heard about one egregious case of this happening--a political consulting firm, using Facebook, that improperly accessed the private data of some 87 million users. This data was used to assemble a psychological[[Page S2026]]profile to assess how people might respond to political advertising and how they might vote in an election. When people access Facebook to trade pictures with families and friends or to communicate with family and talk about their most recent vacations, I doubt they realize that data could be acquired by a third party, like Cambridge Analytica, and that it can not only literally use that information but all of the personal data of their friends and relatives in order to target political messaging for its use in an election.  Facebook has historically been a platform for all ideas, as they say, but now the company realizes that because of its business model, it has more responsibilities. It is not just a neutral platform. It must defend against false information, foreign government subterfuge, and other destructive conduct, such as child pornography and human trafficking. We know, as a result of the most recent legislation we passed relative to human trafficking, that we have actually expanded the responsibilities of social media platforms in the human trafficking arena because of the threat it poses to so many innocent people.  The basic questions are whether Facebook is responsible for misinformation in its use of its platform, for outright falsehoods, or attempts by foreign governments to meddle in our elections by sowing discord and disinformation. There are also some important questions about whether Facebook is inconsistently using the data that it collects in a way that obviously benefits itself financially but is not sharing it on an equal basis with law enforcement or intelligence when the intelligence community needs that information to solve crimes or to keep the country safe.  A lot of ideas have been tossed around about how to respond to these difficult questions. Perhaps we should treat social media platforms as information fiduciaries and impose legal obligations on them, as we do with lawyers and doctors, who are privy to some of our most personal, private information.  To me, one of the most important questions is who owns that data that we share on social media platforms and whether the data that is shared is shared with one's fully informed consent so that consumers are protected against consequences they had no way of anticipating and that are damaging to their personal privacy.  Other ideas involve increased transparency, partnering with the Federal Trade Commission, or passing new data privacy laws. They involve giving consumers more control and requiring companies to disclose in plain English and in nontechnical ways what information they collect before users are presumed to have given their consent. I look forward to exploring these and other related ideas at the hearing later today.  Facebook and other social media platforms need to come clean with the American people. An apology, while necessary and welcome, is not enough. These companies must back up their words with actions that better safeguard the American consumer and their right to privacy. Technology can be a good thing, but it can also be abused in ways that we need to reckon with. This afternoon's hearing will be the beginning of those efforts in a very substantial and comprehensive way.  Mr.President, on a separate matter, we have a lot on our plate here in the Senate apart from conducting the hearing that I just mentioned. One of our items on our ``to do'' list is to continue to confirm the President's nominees, who have faced an unprecedented level of obstruction from the minority. The majority leader, Senator McConnell, has been forced to file cloture--a formal piece of paper--on six important nominees, many of whom will be confirmed with strong bipartisan support, but because our colleagues on the other side refuse to consent to the expedited consideration of these noncontroversial nominees, we will have to literally burn up a week of the Senate's time during which we could be doing other important work.                       Nomination of Gina Haspell  Mr.President, in addition to the six nominees whom we will confirm this week, I want to talk about two in particular, two outstanding individuals who have been nominated by the President to some of the most important positions in the Federal These posts are the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Secretary of  Gina Haspel has been nominated for the first position. She joined the CIA in 1985, which was during the final years of the Cold She is a career intelligence officer and has served for more than 30 years overseas, around the world, and in She has held various leadership roles at the Central Intelligence Agency, including that of Deputy Director of the National Clandestine You can imagine this is some of the most sensitive and important work that is being done in the intelligence community, and she has been right in the middle of it.

337,topic-id,2240,"Mr.President, I preface my remarks today about China with a recent article from The Economist, dated March 1, 2018, which, I think, does a very good job of crystallizing what the hopes and aspirations that we in the West had for China and what the reality has turned out to be.  It points out that in March 2000, Bill Clinton divided the American opinion on China into two camps. The first, he said, was of the optimists, and the second was of the hawks and the pessimists. The optimists, as it describes it, have an eye on the future and can see China becoming the next great capitalist tiger with the biggest market in the world. That was the optimistic view. The Economist writes that the hawks and pessimists, who were stuck in the past, saw China as stubbornly remaining as the world's last, great Communist dragon and a threat to stability in  As this article points out, it was not an either/or. It called it a both/and. It concludes that the China of Xi Jingping is a great mercantilist dragon that is under strict Communist Party control and that it is using the power of its vast markets to cow and co-opt capitalist rivals to bend and break the rules-based order and to push America to the periphery of the Asia-Pacific region. It calls this one of the starkest reversals in modern geopolitics.  Indeed, the administration's national security strategy that President Trump rolled out just a couple of months ago states that China challenges American power, influence, and interests. It points out again that the hopes and aspirations of the optimists appear to have been dashed. Instead, we have one of the starkest reversals in modern geopolitics. This leads me to the subject I want to at least start talking about because it does relate to  Today, in the Subcommittee on International Trade, within the Senate Finance Committee, which I happen to chair, we are convening a hearing on trade issues and The core issue my colleagues and I will examine involves challenges to U.businesses, manufacturers, and service providers who are trying to get access to the Chinese market--a market that represents the second largest economy in the world. China, of course, has almost unfettered access to the United There are important protections in place, like the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which does look at some of those investments to make sure our national security interests are not compromised.  By and large, China has open access to the United States and the U.market. China is the United States' largest merchandise trading partner and the third largest export market for U.goods abroad. Although the legitimate flow of goods and services between the United States and China has increased over the years and is, in many respects, a positive thing, statistics alone do not capture the whole story, hence the preface that I gave about The Economist's view of what has changed in  Unfortunately, while Chinese companies largely enjoy open access to U.markets and an economy that is receptive to foreign investment, U.companies are not afforded reciprocity in this regard. In his State of the Union Message, the President made that point, which is that in our trading relationships, we expect reciprocity--in other words, to treat our trading partners the same way they treat us--hopefully, to everybody's advantage.  U.companies that seek to do business in China often encounter--I would say always encounter--a protectionist system, one that employs predatory tactics and promotes domestic industries over foreign competitors, many of which receive State subsidies. In many cases, China has used trade as a weapon and coerced U.companies to enter into joint ventures or other business arrangements that require a company to hand over its key technology and know-how--the so-called secret sauce of its business--in order to gain market access.  This practice has already begun to erode America's technological advantage and undermine our defense industrial base, which is something that[[Page S2053]]should concern all of us and is the subject of a revision of the Committee on Foreign Investment of the United States, CFIUS, statute that is going to be coming out of the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services It will be an updating of the CFIUS process to meet the challenges of today.  Of course, under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the Trump administration is currently considering potential investment restrictions to address the harm that has resulted from China's effort to acquire sensitive technologies through investments. I look forward to working with the President and others to ensure that the proper steps are taken, but the real issues are clear, and we will be considering them in more detail at the hearing this afternoon on China's restrictive market.  Even though multiple administrations have attempted to engage Chinese leaders on their trade practices, the high-level diplomatic talks have generally yielded little progress and have often resulted in commitments with zero follow-up action. Discussions may continue in the future, but China's market access reforms are still too slow, and real barriers exist. Reciprocal treatment for U.companies should not be too much to ask. Indeed, it is the minimum we should insist upon. It is my hope that today's hearing will paint a clear picture of the problems that persist with access to Chinese markets and that significant reforms will follow.                                 Judges  Mr.President, on a second brief matter, I will mention that yesterday was the 1-year anniversary of Neil Gorsuch joining the U.Supreme  Former Attorney General Ed Meese called Justice Gorsuch someone in the mold of the late Justice Antonin Scalia--an impartial judge who applies laws as they are written and who shows an abiding respect for the rights that are guaranteed by the  As I have numerous times in the past, I commend President Trump on his outstanding selection, and I congratulate Justice Gorsuch on his first year of serving on our Nation's highest  Let's not forget that Justice Gorsuch is not the only good news when it comes to the Federal judiciary. He is only one part of a much larger and, often, untold story. As of earlier this month, 30 article III Federal life tenure judges have been confirmed under President Trump's tenure--30. That is due, in large part, to the commitment of the Senate, under our majority leader's leadership, to making sure that this was a priority--to confirm judges who have been passed out of the Judiciary Committee here on the floor of the Senate and to maximize our floor time in order to get that priority accomplished.  My home State has filled two appellate vacancies, as well as two district vacancies so far. Additionally, five accomplished lawyers are waiting for hearings for Texas district vacancies, and two more are waiting to be confirmed for those vacancies. So is Andy Oldham, who is an accomplished lawyer who has been nominated to fill the third seat on the Fifth Circuit since President Trump has become I hope we will continue to move all of these judicial nominees and many more across the country very soon.  I know there is a lot of focus on the executive branch and the legislative branch, but I believe the judiciary is the bedrock of our government as it ensures that equal justice is available to all, no matter what one's station in life. It is the rule of law that enables all of our other freedoms to be possible. It enables our economy to flourish, and it creates opportunities for our people so that they can pursue their dreams. That is how important I believe the judiciary is, and we should never forget it.  Yesterday, President Trump took another important step in this area when he announced he would be nominating David Morales to fill one of the vacancies I just mentioned, this one in Corpus Christi, TX, in the U.Southern David has extensive experience in working for the Texas attorney general and the Governor, as well as in the University of Texas system. He was recommended by Senator Cruz and my Federal Judicial Evaluation Committee--a bipartisan group of the best and brightest lawyers the State of Texas has to offer. David was recommended to us by what we call the It performs a great service not only to Senator Cruz and me but to the public, generally, in its vetting of these potential nominees for judicial service and its recommending them to us. David Morales will bring more than 23 years of complex litigation and agency dispute resolution to bear.  I hope our colleagues will join me in making sure his nomination is swiftly considered and that he is confirmed.  I think David and the other Texans whom President Trump has nominated will make excellent additions to our courts. They are the kinds of people we should want in our courts--those who will impartially ensure that justice is done and the law, as written, is followed no matter who the litigant is or the type of controversy at issue.                    Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act  Finally, Mr.President, for the skeptics who like to say that nothing good ever gets done here in Washington, I will mention one other item and the real positive consequences of a bill we just passed and that is being signed into law by the President today--the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act,  The effort to pass it was led by our colleague, the junior Senator from Ohio, Mr.I and others were honored to serve as original cosponsors of this legislation in the We have been working on this issue since at least 2012, when I introduced a resolution, along with a bipartisan group of my colleagues, that called for backpage.com to cease its facilitation of human trafficking, including of children, and prostitution by eliminating the adult section of the website. We had to pass this law because, when it would go to court, under the Communications Decency Act, it was able to claim that Congress had not carved out a provision for trafficking, just merely for child pornography. Thus, it had escaped our attempts to bring it to justice in the past.  This important legislation goes along with a bill we passed in 2015, called the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which refocused our efforts on fighting the sex trade here in the United States by targeting those who purchased human trafficking victims, providing services to the survivors of this crime, and giving law enforcement new tools to target the organized networks that are responsible for commercial sexual exploitation. That was just a few years ago. Yet, just this last month, as I said, we changed section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to allow State attorneys general and victims to seek justice against websites that knowingly assist or facilitate commercial sexual exploitation and child sex trafficking.  The good news is that since that time, a grand jury in Arizona has indicted 7 people, who are affiliated with backpage, on 93 counts of money laundering, facilitating prostitution, and other crimes. The indictment alleged that the website essentially operated as a highly lucrative online brothel.  After we passed FOSTA, the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, some websites announced major policy changes and shut down sections that may have helped to enslave and entrap young women. So it has not just been the indictment and, hopefully, the conviction of people who facilitated backpage over the years, but it has also had a deterrent effect on other websites that have done similar things and has encouraged them, in their own self-interests, to shut down those sections that have helped to facilitate human trafficking.  Backpage has now been seized by Federal law enforcement. It can no longer serve as an open forum for the exploitation of children and the purchase of human beings for sexual slavery. These are all positive signs that the law we have enacted is making a real difference, ensuring that this malignant conduct does not go unpunished. The prosecution and dismantling of backpage has sent a clear message to the pimps and the buyers responsible for sexual slavery, resulting in the shutdown of many other sites involved in the commercial sex trade. This includes message boards where individuals post accounts of the sexual assaults of women and children as if they were reviewing a restaurant menu or product.[[Page S2054]]  As I said yesterday, with reference to Facebook, the internet can be a very good thing, but we can't be naive in ignoring the dangers it represents when put to a perverse use to women, children, and others. What we did with FOSTA, or the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, is an unqualified good thing. It is something that Republicans and Democrats worked on together with the President to pass and to sign into law. It is a good thing that we changed the provisions that inadvertently shielded the facilitators of sex trafficking online. It is one way we can make the internet a safer place for everyone.  I applaud the bipartisan efforts of the Members here in both Chambers of Congress, as well as the President for his support. For those who think nothing good ever comes out of Washington these days and that Democrats and Republicans can't get along to pursue the public interest, this is exhibit 1, which I would offer, of the most recent efforts we have made to shut down this modern day human slavery.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2018-04-11-pt1-PgS2049-3.txt,1692,OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKING ORGANIZATIONS,2018.0,11.0,March

610,topic-id,862,"Mr.President, on another note, we heard some great news yesterday, in terms of our economy. Consumer confidence has jumped to a 17-year high. Optimism continues to surge as employers and payroll services across the country continue to implement the reforms to our Tax Code that we passed last December in the Tax Cuts and Jobs  What is more, the Treasury Department has now released the new withholding tables that went into effect earlier this month and reflect the changes passed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  I got a call from someone close to me. I will leave it at that--I don't want to embarrass her--who said she opened her paycheck, and she had $240 more in her paycheck than she had in the previous month as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs She didn't regard this as crumbs; she thought it would make a positive difference in her life.  I think many Americans are having the same experience, seeing an increase in their take-home pay even in the month of As I said, for some, it is several hundred dollars extra each pay period, which is money that can be saved for a rainy day or invested for their retirement or future, or it could be used to pay for their child's education or to put new tires on their car. A married couple with two children, making about $75,000 a year, will see an estimated tax cut of approximately $2,000.  That is just on the individual side. What we are seeing across the country is greater than just what is happening to single families and households, though. It is good to see at the micro level or the personal level, so to speak, what the impact is, but we also have to see the bigger picture in terms of our economy, the jobs created, the investment opportunities, and the way to grow our economy, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has had a profound impact on that.  So far, at least 417 companies have announced new investments, pay raises, bonuses, and charitable contributions. They have added new employee training and increased contributions to pensions and 401(k) retirement accounts. According to the White House, more than 4.4 million workers have been positively affected. It is no wonder the tax law is becoming more and more popular as people have learned more about it. Even the New York Times has had to agree that the public is learning to love the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act because of the positive impact on hard-working American lives.  I see the wide-ranging effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in my Thanks to a competitive tax system, for example, Fort Worth-based companies like American Airlines paid large bonuses to their employees. AT&T, which is headquartered in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, paid $1,000 to more than 200,000 men and women across the country who work for that company. Just as important, AT&T announced $1 billion in capital investments, which could create as many as 7,000 jobs.  Texas also proves that the effects of tax reform are more than just a one-time-only impact. Waste Management, based in Houston, has already paid bonuses to drivers and landfill workers, but its CEO emphasized in an interview that the company will continue to spend money on its people beyond 2018. ExxonMobil, headquartered in Las Colinas in the Dallas area, will expand oil production in West Oncor, one of the largest investor-owned utilities in the State, will issue future refunds to customers on their utility bills. And Walmart, which is the largest employer in Texas, increased starting wages, expanded parental leave, and offered financial assistance to employees who choose to adopt.  It is not just the big players, though; small businesses are doing the same[[Page S1262]]thing. In Corpus Christi recently, I visited with the owners of Groomer's Seafood, who plan to expand distribution facilities serving thousands of restaurants statewide. American Bank in Corpus Christi is projecting that it can lend an additional $120 million as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs That is money it can lend to small businesses to grow or start a new business. In San Antonio, my hometown, Cox Manufacturing will move up construction of a new 8,000-square-foot plant. In Amarillo, up in the Panhandle of Texas, Happy State Bank made news to go with its name, which is higher hourly pay. In Lumberton, TX, the women running an engineering company called Leak Sealers paid tax savings forward to employees, calling on other businesses to do the same.  Our colleagues here in Washington who voted against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made a big mistake. I think they are beginning to realize that now, as the good news is rolling in. They have mostly kept quiet in terms of the criticism they lodged against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as we were debating it because they can't deny the facts, and they can't deny what is happening all across America--more take-home pay, more jobs, more money being invested and coming back home from overseas, and its generally being a very positive piece of legislation.

959,topic-id,2224,"Mr.President, I heard the remarks of my colleague from Illinois, and I, too, hope that we can get past the rhetoric and the talking points of the past and actually do something meaningful when it comes to public safety and address the terrible tragedies like the one that occurred at Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida just 2 weeks ago. But we are not going to do it by trotting out our laundry lists of requests and saying that it has to be all of this or nothing because when you say here in Washington--and particularly in Congress--``I want everything on my list or I want nothing,'' one thing is for sure. You will end up with nothing, and that simply is an unacceptable outcome, particularly when it comes to the public safety crisis manifested here most recently at Stoneman Douglas High School in  We know that there were many, many failures; you might even call this a systemic failure when it comes to the children at Stoneman Douglas High First and foremost, why didn't Federal and local law enforcement follow up on threats and warnings? This young man, the shooter who took the lives of 17 people, telegraphed in very clear, unmistakable language what he intended to do, but the very people whom we trust and entrust with public safety at the Federal and State levels did not respond.  We know that the alleged shooter was expelled from school for disciplinary reasons. We know that deputies in Broward County received at least 18 calls warning them over the course of several years--18 calls. We know about the disturbing YouTube posts, where the shooter basically said what he intend to do and did, in fact, do later. We know that the FBI received many disturbing tips from citizens about the imminent danger posed by the shooter.  Another question is whether mental health officials could have done more. We know that this young man had a long history of violent outbursts. We are told that in 2016 he reportedly attempted suicide by drinking gasoline. He had been accused of verbal slurs against racial and religious minorities.  We know that Florida has a State law, as some have advocated at the Federal level, that permits forced hospitalization of people in mental health crises, but it seems that in this particular case, mental health workers concluded that this individual was stable at the time they examined him. Why and how was that determination made, and why does that stand in such stark contrast to the picture that we have been able to draw as a result of all the information that we received since this terrible shooting? If law enforcement, public health workers, and school officials were communicating and coordinating effectively, would they have made the same decisions in this case? Could they have made a difference in the outcome? Well, I think we need the answers to those questions.  There are two other questions we need to answer as well. One is why and how did the shooter have access to firearms in the first place? Another is why didn't the school's armed resource officer intervene once the shooting began?  All of us are angry at the fact that this shooting happened, but that shouldn't tempt us into easy solutions that at the end of the day wouldn't make any difference in the outcome and wouldn't do any good. That is what we tend to get here in Congress when we have hard issues like this--easy solution talking points that lead to no effective action. We can't let that happen here. As one columnist put it last week, we can't fall victim to ``the politics of false hope.''  The most frequent refrain I hear in Washington after some tragedy like this occurs is ``We need to do something.'' Well, we need to do something effective, something that would change the likely outcome. We may not be able to protect every citizen against terrible tragedies like this, but there are things we can do that will make things better and that will be effective in changing the outcome and, I believe, in saving lives.  Real solutions require us to look at why the FBI and local law enforcement failed to respond to multiple warnings. I asked one police officer about this, and he said: Well, in America we can't arrest somebody for precrimes. In other words, we can't arrest somebody for an offense that they haven't committed yet. It is perhaps a flaw that is exposed in our system when, unfortunately, we can't anticipate who might commit these terrible offenses and stop them before they commit the act. That is a feature of our law enforcement system, but this isn't just another job for law enforcement. There are a lot more people who could contribute to a solution here and prevent these incidents from happening beyond law enforcement, who are, by our very Constitution, structured to investigate and prosecute crimes that have already occurred, not to stop them in the first place.  I think a fair question to ask is, What is the role of social media in preventing mass violence? When you have people basically telling us what they are getting ready to do and posting those on social media and nothing seems to happen as a consequence, it strikes me that something is terribly wrong there. What is the responsibility of these platforms? Well, we know that Congress has said, for example, that you have a responsibility to police your platform for things like child pornography. In other words, they can't be totally oblivious to the things that are being posted on these social media platforms. They have a responsibility to intervene in some cases, and maybe it ought to be in more cases.  What options currently exist to reporting disturbing content online? I believe in the YouTube video case, it was someone who actually saw it, was disturbed by it, and then reported it to the It was not even YouTube itself that identified it. Of course, they would be in the best position to identify it immediately. It was some third party who happened to see it, was disturbed by it, and contacted the Tragically, it was never followed up on. How often are these popular platforms reporting to police or Federal authorities when people actually threaten to commit acts of violence? If there are holes in the reporting protocol, we should close them.  That is why I think this is a systemic failure. When you look at mental health providers, when you look at law enforcement officials, when you look at the schools, when you look at the social media platforms, when you look at all of this together, I think it begins to give us some ideas about things we can do that may end up saving lives, and we should do them.  Members are discussing many ideas, which always happens after a tragedy[[Page S1227]]like this, and I am open to a conversation with anyone who shares my desire to take effective action to prevent another one of these tragedies. There is one proposal that has already been introduced that has won bipartisan support and has brought together advocates from all sides. It is really a unique piece of legislation because there are not many times that I can think of where people who are strong Second Amendment advocates and people who believe there ought to be more controls imposed on guns can come together to find consensus, to find common ground, but we have on a bill called the Fix NICS Act, which I introduced to strengthen the background check system.  It may take a long time to answer all the questions raised by the tragedy in Parkland, but one step we can take right now is to pass the Fix NICS bill. This bill has the unique quality of causing the junior Senator from Connecticut and me to cointroduce this bill. We couldn't be more ideologically different. He is a Democrat and I am a Republican, but we have come together on a bill that does enjoy broad bipartisan support and that, I believe, will save lives.  This bill was introduced in the wake of the shooting last fall in the small community near San Antonio called Sutherland Springs, As we will recall, a deranged gunman with a criminal record and a history of violence and mental illness opened fire during a Sunday morning church service, killing 26 people and wounding 20 more. To add to the tragedy that had already occurred, this murderer's criminal conviction records were never uploaded to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check When he went to purchase firearms, he lied about his record, and there was nothing in the criminal background check system to show that he lied and thus deny him the opportunity to purchase weapons. This failure to enforce our background check law allowed this shooter to walk into a gun store, pass a background check, and illegally purchase a firearm.  This bipartisan legislation would tighten the National Instant Background Check It is supported by people all across the political spectrum. It is even cosponsored by the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, and is supported by Everytown for Gun It has brought together all sides in the gun debate--leaders on the Republican side and Democratic side alike.  Under current law, mentally ill individuals and persons convicted of violent crimes are prohibited by current law from purchasing or possessing firearms. This is to make sure that these laws are enforced and that criminal history information is uploaded into the NICS Federal database by State and Federal authorities.  For years, our colleagues across the aisle have said that they want reform that would help stem the tide of gun violence perpetrated by dangerous criminals. Well, this is their chance. This is our chance. It is our chance to show the Nation that we refuse to accept shootings in schools and churches as the new normal, and we can do that. We can start doing that by passing Fix NICS this week.  Senator Schumer, the minority leader, said yesterday that he wants to wait, even though he is a cosponsor of the Fix NICS bill. He is a cosponsor of the bill, but he says that he wants to wait. He wants to wait and debate other ideas he knows are controversial and can't pass. Of course, that is his right as a Senator, but as I said earlier, if our attitude is ``I want everything on my list or nothing,'' we are going to end up with nothing.  I, for one, am not willing to go home and look my constituents in the face and say that we had an opportunity to pass legislation, the Fix NICS bill, which will save lives in the future and will make sure that existing laws are enforced. I will not be able to go home and tell them, in good faith, that we have done everything we can in our power to help save lives. We can do that by passing bipartisan legislation that could pass today if it were put on the floor and voted on by a supermajority of the  I implore our Democratic colleagues to change course. Let's do the art of the possible. That is what politics is, the art of the possible. Let's do what we can immediately to pass Fix NICS and build from there. I am willing to work with them. The President is willing to work with them on things like bump stocks and the mental health failure, trying to make sure that our schools are safer and to make sure that social media platforms report threats of violence to law enforcement officials so they can be followed up on.  There are a lot of other things we can do, but the one thing we can do this week before we go home is to pass the Fix NICS bill and to send it to the House and have the President sign it into law. It will save lives.  I yield the floor.                   Recognition of the Majority Leader  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.  Mr.Mr.President, the Senate will soon vote to confirm another fine candidate to serve on the Federal bench.

This follows a fine career that spanned both private practice and public service.  Judge Branch has previously answered the call to serve at the Department of Homeland Security, where she worked as associate general counsel, and then at the Office of Information and Regulatory Her record and qualifications are well known.  Our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee reported her nomination favorably by an overwhelming vote. Confirming this worthy nominee will be a further credit to the outstanding work of Chairman Grassley and the members of the committee.  I encourage all my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm Elizabeth Branch today. Let's continue to fulfill our constitutional responsibility and confirm the President's outstanding judicial nominees.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

1021,topic-id,1853,"Mr.President, this morning, I would like to start off speaking about a very important day in the history of my State, a day that inspires pride in the hearts of all those who were born in I am here to commemorate Texas Independence Day, which will be celebrated tomorrow.  On March 2, 1836, Texas adopted its Declaration of Independence from It is worth reading, and I would recommend it to anyone. This happened in the context of a struggle that is perhaps best remembered by the Battle of the Alamo, which laid some of the groundwork for Texans' eventual victory.  On February 24 of that year, with his position under siege, an important figure named William Barret Travis wrote a letter, which I would like to read. He was a lieutenant colonel in the Texas Army, and during the battle, his fellow soldiers were outnumbered nearly 10 to 1 by the forces of the Mexican dictator Antonio Lopez de Santa Here in the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats have had the honor of reading the fabled Travis letter since 1961, when then-Texas Senator John Tower started that tradition. The letter was addressed ``To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World.'' Travis wrote:       I am besieged, by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under      Santa Anna--I have sustained a continual Bombardment &      cannonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man--The enemy has      demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison      are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken--I have      answered the demand with a cannon shot, & our flag still      waves proudly from the walls--I shall never surrender or      retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of      patriotism & everything dear to the American character, to      come to our aid, with all dispatch--The enemy is receiving      reinforcements daily & will no doubt increase to three or      four thousand in four or five days. If this call is      neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as      possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due      to his own honor & that of his country--Victory or  Signed, ``William Barret Travis.''  What a letter it is. It is a reminder for all of us that the 189 defenders of the Alamo lost their lives, but they did not die in vain. In fact, Texans wouldn't be around today if it weren't for them.  The Battle of the Alamo bought precious time for the Texas revolutionaries, allowing General Sam Houston to maneuver his army into a position for the decisive victory at the Battle of San I would just note that I am honored to occupy the same Senate seat first occupied by Sam Houston when he became a U.Senator after Texas became annexed to the United States in 1845.  With that victory at the Battle of San Jacinto, Texas became a sovereign nation--the Republic of Texas--for 9 years. For 9 years, it thrived as a separate nation, and then in 1845 it was annexed to the United States as the 28th  Many Texas patriots who fought in the revolution went on to serve in the U.Congress--Sam Houston being one of them. Every single day, I am honored to have the opportunity to serve 28 million Texans--a chance I wouldn't have had without the sacrifices made by the brave men like William Barrett Travis 182 years ago.                               Tax Reform  Mr.President, on another matter, we have come a long way since the days of the Texas revolution, but Texas remains a place of optimism, fortitude, and dedication to worthy causes. It is also a bustling State, full of entrepreneurs, investors, and risk-takers who have created jobs and opportunities for the people who live there. I would like to mention briefly two iconic companies that are showing their devotion to Texas in a much different but important manner.  In Tyler, they are spreading the good news of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the law we passed in December, which overhauled our Tax For those not familiar with where Tyler is, it is out in East We sometimes refer to that as ``behind the pine curtain.'' The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act effects have been far-reaching. They have positively affected communities all across the country for the past 2 months, and Tyler is no exception.  The first company I would like to mention is Greenberg Turkeys, a family-owned operation that sells the famous Thanksgiving bird to around 200,000 customers each holiday season. Four generations of the Greenberg family have worked in the company since the 1940s, and its turkeys have been featured on Oprah Winfrey's website as one of her favorite things--twice, in fact. As a result of the tax reforms we have passed, the company plans to refurbish its plant and give hourly employees a raise. Sam Greenberg, the president, said:[[Page S1299]]         This is a really good deal for businesses. It pays to treat      people right, and so we want to share this with our workers.  I couldn't have said it better myself.  The second Tyler company I want to mention briefly is Don's TV & The staff there has more than 150 years of combined experience. It buys products direct from manufacturers at the lowest possible cost in order to provide customers with prices that are competitive with national chain stores. Recently, the owner, Don Thedford, and his son Donnie announced they would give their employees raises in 2018, which they were not able to do for the past several years, and they would not have been able to do it but for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Thanks to those reforms, Don has been able to help out his employees to provide them more take-home pay, and I am sure they appreciate the extra money in their paycheck each pay period. They can use these savings to invest, to pay for their children's education, prepare for their retirement, or whatever they find best.  So I just wanted to say to Don and other small employers who are making sure their employees see the benefit of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reforms: Thank you for paying the savings forward. I can't wait to continue to hear more stories like these two in the months ahead.                             Fix NICS Bill  Mr.President, on a final note, I would like to bring up one last topic we have been discussing a lot this last week; that is, ways we can prevent mass shootings from happening in the future. Of course, the most recent one occurred at Parkland, FL, at Stoneman Douglas High  Last fall, my State saw another insidious shooting at Sutherland Springs near San Antonio, Twenty-six people lost their lives that day worshipping in a small Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, and 20 more were wounded, including a 6-year-old boy named Ryland Ward, who was shot five times. We are ecstatic Ryland survived and is now out of the hospital and has gone home.  What we all learned in the aftermath of that event is that sometimes these horrific crimes are perpetrated by individuals who never should have been able to purchase firearms in the first place. That is because, under current law, convicted felons, like the gunman at Sutherland Springs, are prohibited from legally purchasing firearms. The problem was that his convictions were not uploaded in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, what is commonly referred to as the NICS system operated by the  I have introduced a bill that has already passed the House that would address this problem and, I believe, would save lives in the future. It is a bipartisan piece of legislation cosponsored by the junior Senator from Senator Murphy, along with his colleague Senator Blumenthal, come from the State that saw the horrific killings at Sandy We added 10 new cosponsors just this week, bringing the total number to 50 cosponsors for this legislation. In my experience, it is rare to see a piece of legislation enjoy such broad, bipartisan support--50 cosponsors.  I have been saying all week that we need to pass this bill now. We should not wait, we should not go home emptyhanded, and we should not have to face the grieving families who lost a child or a loved one as a result of a future shooting that might have been averted had we acted. America is tired of the government's response to these catastrophes which rip families apart, take lives, and pit people against each other. The response of their government has been largely either silence or bickering with no outcome, no result.  There are other proposals we can consider as we continue to grapple with the questions posed in Parkland--questions about failures of local law enforcement, social media platforms, and the Yesterday, the President hosted an amazing meeting of 17 Members of Congress on a bipartisan basis and brainstormed about other things we might be able to do, but right now--right now--fix NICS is our best and only option to act in response. It is supported by the President, the majority and minority leaders are cosponsors, and it is supported by gun groups like the NRA and Everytown for Gun Safety, which are at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum when it comes to the Second As I said, this bill has 50 cosponsors in the Senate and is ready for action, having already passed the House of  I pledged to myself, after my wife and I visited Sutherland Springs a week after the terrible shooting there and attended a church service led by the pastor who lost his 14-year-old daughter in that shooting just 1 week before--it was a gut-wrenching, emotional service, but it was inspiring in its own way. I pledged then that I would never face another grieving family with empty hands, saying we could have done something that might have saved your child's life or your loved one's life by fixing the broken background check system. I pledged I would never face them again, saying we didn't try our best to save lives in the future by passing commonsense, bipartisan legislation like the Fix NICS bill.  As I said, there are other things we might do, but, as we all know, the threshold for actually passing legislation is 60 votes. What I don't want us to do is to end up like we did on the DACA debate, where we started with a neutral bill--a shell which really did nothing--and all of the various proposals failed to get 60 votes, so we ended up emptyhanded on the DACA issue. I don't want that to happen again, and I am not going to go home and tell my constituents in Texas I didn't do my very best to make sure we did something and something meaningful that would save lives in the future. Fix NICS is the best way to do that and do that now.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

1355,topic-id,1124,"Mr.President, this week, we will be voting on an important piece of bipartisan legislation that recently passed out of the Senate Banking Committee, led by our colleague, Chairman Mike  The bill is called the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection The purpose of the bill is to rightsize the onerous regulations that are currently imposed on community and independent banks and that stifle their ability to loan money to people who need access to credit in order to start a business or to grow a small business.  Under the current law famously known as Dodd-Frank, these smaller banks are often treated just like the largest banks and financial institutions in our economy. That doesn't make any sense at all. Main Street, we need to remind some of our colleagues, is not Wall  The bill would make changes to reflect that important distinction. I can't tell you how many of my small bankers in Texas have told me they had to hire additional personnel, not to make more loans, just to comply with the onerous overregulation coming out of Washington,  Unfortunately, we lost over 2,000 banks nationwide since the end of 2010. Two thousand banks have gone out of business, either as a result of a merger with a larger bank that could sustain the additional cost of complying with these regulations or those that have just given up and said: We can't cut it because of the costs, and we are hanging up our spurs. In Texas, 165 bank charters have vanished during that same timeframe--a 26-percent reduction. Like I said, some of the decline is due to mergers with larger banks, but there have also been a number of bank failures.  We all heard about too big to fail, but some institutions were deemed essentially too small to save. They were the ones left behind and forgotten under Dodd-Because of the regulatory burdens, some small banks said enough is enough and opted to get out of the lending business altogether. You know who ends up paying the price and who ends up getting hurt? It is the married couple who wants to borrow money to buy their first home or, as I said earlier, a business that wants to expand and hire more people. Those are the people who ultimately get hurt.  In this bill we are considering this week, we are trying to change that situation. No less than former Congressman Barney Frank--the Democratic author of the original law--has emphasized the point that we need now to remember: The bill we are voting on keeps in place rules and regulations that were imposed on large Wall Street banks after the financial crisis. In other words, the big banks on Wall Street were the ones that helped contribute to the financial crisis, and they are the ones that will continue to be regulated under Dodd-Frank, but the community and regional banks that were, in essence, the collateral damage to the great recession of 2008, following the big financial crisis, will finally see some needed and welcomed relief. Rigorous stress testing of large financial institutions will continue. Congressman Frank has said it would be ``wholly inaccurate'' to claim otherwise.  So when some try to distort the bill's purpose and the provisions in the days ahead, I think it is important to keep that in mind and don't buy what they are selling. This bill will mostly, as I said, affect smaller community banks, which clearly don't fall under the same category as the titans of global finance.  Last year, the Banking Committee solicited input from a broad array of stakeholders. The committee's idea was to say: Hey, all of you out there who greatly suffered under Dodd-Frank, how can we reduce the burdens you face? Those are the kind of questions all of us need to be asking back in our  After extensive negotiations at all levels, and after hearing not just from financial entities great and small but also from consumer groups, the result is the bipartisan legislation we will soon consider on the Senate floor.  The bill was formally introduced by a group of 10 Democrats and 10 You don't get much more bipartisan than that. I know the Senator from Idaho, the chairman of the committee, has had productive discussions as well with my friend and fellow Texan Chairman Hensarling on the House side, who heads up the House Financial Services  While the new provisions will help community banks, credit unions, as well as midsized and regional banks, they will also ensure that key consumer protections remain in place. Some of these protections will even increase for consumers who have fallen on hard financial times or who are victims of fraud. Veterans and seniors particularly will benefit.  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has agreed that this commonsense bill will provide significant regulatory relief, and his predecessor, Janet Yellen, said it was a move in a good direction.  While I would like to go further and provide additional relief from Dodd-Frank, we should nonetheless pass as much as we can and help America's local lenders build small businesses and strengthen our local communities.  Let's get this bill--which is supported by a variety of stakeholders, including the Texas Independent Bankers Association--across the finish line this week.  I wish to especially congratulate and thank our colleague from Idaho for all of his hard work, and I hope that all of us can emulate that hard work on a bipartisan basis to get this bill across the Senate floor and ultimately to the President for his signature.                               Tax Reform  Mr.President, I would like to shift gears for a moment and discuss a matter that my friends back home in Texas are talking about a lot, and that is the benefits of tax reform.  I happened to walk out here just as the Democratic leader, the Senator from New York, was saying that tax reform is not working. Well, I note that his message seems to be a little out of sync with the news, which in part reported today that the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits is at its lowest level in more than 49 years. In other words, our economy is finally growing again, and it is working again for the people who needed the jobs and needed the income that are provided by the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Sometimes I wonder whether our Democratic friends, who took great political risk by voting uniformly to a person to oppose the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, are worried not that it will not work but that it will work and they will be proved completely wrong in anticipating what the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will be.

1518,topic-id,1050,"Mr.President, my colleague from Connecticut is here in the room and mentioned the bill we have been working on together, the Fix NICS bill. I want to remind all of us what the motivation was, at least on my part, for introducing this legislation and express my gratitude to the Senator from Connecticut, as well as the Democratic leader Senator Schumer, and others who have cosponsored this legislation.  It was just a few short months ago when someone murdered 26 people worshipping in a small church just outside San Antonio in Sutherland He had purchased these firearms having lied on the background check when they asked him whether he was a convicted felon, whether he was honorably discharged from the military, and whether he had ever committed any domestic violence. He lied.  If he had told the truth, he would have been prohibited from buying those firearms and perhaps--maybe, perhaps--he would have been dissuaded, slowed down, or perhaps would not have committed that terrible atrocity that day when 26 people lost their lives, and 20 more were injured.  We have come to find out that the Air Force, which had convicted him of two of those offenses--domestic violence and the felony--failed to upload the information that was required in the National Instant Criminal Background Check If they had, then he would not have gotten away[[Page S1261]]with lying because the FBI background check system would have revealed the truth.  I can state that I have the utmost confidence that if the Fix NICS law were in effect at the time he was attempting to purchase those firearms, in all likelihood, he would have been prohibited from purchasing those guns, and I would conclude from that, lives would have been saved, and the lives which were changed forever because of the terrible injuries that the other 20 received would not have been changed in such a terrible way.  I told myself at the time that I cannot go to another church service--we went to the church that met in a tent just down the street from the place where the shooting took place a week after the shooting. The pastor and his wife who lost their teenage daughter were there. The wife was distraught, as you can imagine. The pastor summoned a power that is greater than human power to preach that day. It was emotional, it was inspirational, but it was a terrible tragedy. I told myself that day that I never wish to look another family in the face and say we failed to do everything that was in our power to prohibit or to stop something like that from happening again.  Fix NICS, as I think people who are familiar with it understand, basically takes the laws that currently exist and makes sure it is applied so people like this shooter in Sutherland Springs can't lie their way out of it and get access to firearms and ruin people's lives in the process.  I realize it may not be as comprehensive as some people would like. The problem is around here, if you ignore the things you can agree on and just look to fight about things you can't agree on, nothing ever happens--no problems ever get solved. I think a good place to start would be to pass this bipartisan Fix NICS piece of legislation.  I hope our colleagues would consider it. I understand they have a different view on some aspects of guns, but what we had here was a catastrophic failure. We had a systemic failure. The school system failed, the mental health authorities failed, the local law enforcement, the Federal law enforcement failed. Our society failed to provide the tools to identify people who cry out, in essence, on social media like this young man did when he posted on YouTube essentially the threat he actually carried out, which was going to go shoot up a school. When that was referred to the FBI, they didn't follow up on it and nothing ever happened.  Looking back on this particular young man, he was sending signals out on a regular basis that he was a ticking timebomb and people were going to get hurt and potentially die, as they did.  I hope that rather than leave here this week with nothing to show for our efforts, we would at least agree to pass what enjoys broad bipartisan support and to perhaps prevent another shooting like that which occurred at Sutherland  The President has made clear, thinking now about the Las Vegas shooting, that he believes bump stocks ought to be regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and I agree with that. So those are two things we could do, perhaps, that might save lives in the future, but to just say it is not enough, we ought to do more, and to fail to do what is within our grasp, which we can agree to, to me, seems like a bizarre way of doing business, and I think it is an abdication of our responsibility.  I don't want to see another family who has lost a loved one as a result of one of these mass shootings that might be prevented by some action we might take on Fix NICS or the bump stock issue, for example.  There may be other things we need to do. We have done some things, such as trying to address the mental health challenges that people like Adam Lanza's mother had. Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook shooter, was obviously mentally ill, but he wouldn't accept the treatment his doctor prescribed.  What we did last December--during the Obama administration--passed something called the 21st Century Cures Act, which included a bill I sponsored called the Mental Health and Safe Communities Act, which encouraged the use of assisted outpatient treatment. For example, if Adam Lanza's mother couldn't handle her son--he wouldn't take his medication or comply with doctor's orders--she could go to a civil court and essentially get a court order requiring him to comply with his doctor's orders and to take his medication.  Again, I am not suggesting that any one of these in isolation is a panacea, but there are things we can do step-by-step, bit-by-bit, to reduce the likelihood that these terrible mass shootings occur in the future.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-28-pt1-PgS1260-3.txt,1692,STRESS TEST IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2017,2018.0,28.0,March

She mapped it out with her hands      as she sat in a central Fresno office nearly 20 years later.       ``They would have a little microwave there, and they would      have a little ice chest right there by the sink,'' she said.      ``I still remember the color of the ice chest.''       Rodriguez-Brown isn't sure whether the room was in an      apartment or hotel. But she does remember that for seven      months she was kept in this room under guard and forced to      perform whatever sex act the strangers entering the room      asked for. The room was punishment for refusing to do the      same at her trafficker's home. Her captors brought her all of      her meals. If she defied them, she'd be beaten--sometimes      with her hands bound.[[Page H1300]]       The Bee normally does not identify the victims of sexual      assault, however Rodriguez-Brown agreed to be named.       Her story is not uncommon in Fresno, or anywhere in the      world. It is one of cyclical abuse, habitual arrest and      unspeakable trauma. Women and children are bought and sold      every day in Fresno--online, in street corners, while at      school. They are raped, branded and beaten. They are taught      that they are the problem, not the people who force them into      this life--causing psychological scars that may never heal.

Eight hours a day as a hospital administrator, five hours--     sometimes more--as a prostitute.       He would wake her up at 4 a.m. to walk the streets. She      hated it--not that the house calls were much better. But when      she begged to stop, he would convince her the fault was hers.      Eventually, she would apologize and allow him to drop her off      before the sun was up.       ``He wanted at least $300 before I went to work at the      hospital,'' she said.       So she would work the streets for three hours before      starting an eight-hour day scheduling appointments in the      nephrology unit of a San Diego hospital--a job she had      enjoyed before she met him. He eventually forced her to have      sex with men during her lunch break, in addition to before      and after work. On the weekends, he took her to neighboring      cities--a common tactic to avoid law enforcement or reach a      new clientele.       ``If it were up to him, I would have never slept,'' she      said.

She climbed into a car      driven by a stranger, who would take her to another stranger      with whom she had agreed to have sex for money.       If it had been a few minutes later, the girl could have      easily blended in with children walking home from school. She      was not dressed provocatively; she wore a red Fresno State      sweatshirt and jeans. She was not wearing excessive makeup.      She carried a backpack.       Who knows how many times she had followed this pattern--     strange men and strange cars. Online advertisements showed      her in various states of undress.       That's how the vice unit of the Fresno Police Department      found her. Today, these strangers were both undercover      officers. Tonight, she will be safe.       ``She said she hasn't eaten in five days,'' Curt      Chastain said. ``No real family--an unreported runaway.

She flashes an easy smile as she speaks. Her voice is soft,      but her words are deliberate and flow with eloquence. She has      a distinct rockabilly style, with one arm bearing a tattoo      modeled from Disney's ``The Little Mermaid'' and a hair clip      featuring two large pink roses.       Looking at her, it's hard to imagine that a man she loved      forced her into slavery. For four years, Pauls was sold for      sex on streets and in hotel rooms across the western half of      the United She was barred from contacting her friends      or family. She was arrested multiple times and treated like a      criminal--a stigma that even now, five years later, is      difficult to shake.       Her worst moments seem unimaginable.       Pauls' trafficker--a man she believed to be her boyfriend--     refused to take her to a hospital when one of the men he sold      her to raped her. When she became pregnant with her      trafficker's baby, he forced her into an illegal, late-term      abortion. When her reeling body began to produce breast milk      after the abortion, her trafficker saw it as a moneymaker:      Those with certain fetishes would pay extra now, he told her.       It took a daring late-night escape--her trafficker's SUV      roaring behind her getaway car on a Las Vegas street--to get      out of that life.

The first--and it was seldom optional--was jail. They could      also go to rehab, provided they had a drug problem. But more      often than not, they returned to the sex trade.       That is no longer the case.       In 2012, human trafficking became a crime in California,      carrying with it new language for dealing with the crime and      harsher penalties for traffickers. Local law enforcement      found success against traffickers by treating girls and women      in the sex trade as victims, not complicit criminals.       Over the past few years, a growing network of advocates has      added new avenues of help for the hundreds of women who are      trafficked. These groups have provided victims with shelter,      counseling and the tools to rebuild their lives.       Many who work with human trafficking victims consider the      practice to be modern-day slavery. If that's true, this      advocacy coalition is the underground railroad.

The teenage girl had been beaten, raped and dumped in a      neighboring county. Police found her unconscious, lying naked      in an alley.       ``There are some parts of the body that bruise easily, and      some that don't,'' said Maxwell, who's worked in the Fresno      County Public Defender's office for 11 years. ``Looking at      her, you knew she had been through it. She had been beaten      really badly.''       This case stands out for its brutality, Maxwell said. But      it was the sheer number of human trafficking cases crossing      her desk when she took control of the Public Defender's      juvenile office in 2015 that shocked her into action.       The legal community has partnered with advocacy groups, law      enforcement and the Fresno County Probation Department to      improve the criminal justice system in an effort to get      children out of the sex trade permanently. Their work will      soon bear fruit: On 19, Fresno County's juvenile court      will establish a courtroom dedicated solely to human      trafficking cases.       This new court--patterned after similar courts in      Sacramento, Los Angeles and other California counties--will      allow a judge with specialized training to work with the      various partner agencies to ensure children caught up in the      sex trade receive help that's customized for their needs.

334,topic-id,1236,"Mr.President, last Friday marked the 70th anniversary of the 3rd Infantry Regiment's reactivation, and as one of its veterans, I didn't want to let the moment pass without notice.  The 3rd Infantry Regiment, more commonly known as the Old Guard, serves across the Potomac River at Arlington National Most here and most in the Gallery have probably visited the cemetery and seen Old Guard soldiers guarding the Tomb of the Unknowns or conducting funerals. Arkansans who visit me here in the Capitol consistently tell me that Arlington is a highlight of their trip. That is not surprising to me, because Old Guard soldiers set the standard for their dedication, their diligence, and their devotion. The 3rd Infantry is the Nation's oldest Active-Duty infantry unit, and yet the reverence we feel for them goes beyond their mere length of service and to what they represent: the dignity of freedom.  On April 6, 1948, the 3rd Infantry was reactivated on orders of the Secretary of the The ceremony was held just a few steps from here, on the East Plaza of the Then, the Old Guard immediately conducted another ceremony to present the Flag of Liberation to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the That flag had flown over this very Capitol on Pearl Harbor Day, December 7, 1941. Then, those forces raised that flag over Rome, Berlin, and Tokyo after we had defeated the Axis powers. Finally, the Old Guard led the large Army Day parade from the Capitol down Constitution Avenue, where[[Page S2050]]President Truman sat in the reviewing stand at the  That is not bad for their first day back with the regimental colors. It had been only 18 months since the regiment, serving with the 106th Division as an occupation force in Berlin, was caught up in the rushed demobilizations at the end of World War But the Army needed an official ceremonial unit in the Nation's Capital, as well as the contingency force as tension built up between the United States and the Soviet So the Army called the 3rd Infantry back into service at Fort Myer, right next to Arlington, and restored ``the history formerly belonging'' to the legendary regiment. That was due, in no small part, to the regiment's reputation for professionalism, present from its very beginning.  The 3rd Infantry was stood up in 1784, when the Continental Congress created the ``First American Regiment.'' The War for Independence had convinced Congress that, whatever its fear of standing armies, the country needed at least a small professional fighting force to defend it. So the 3rd Infantry started as the lone professional regiment in the early days of our Republic, when our common defense was organized mostly around State militias. To this day, its members continue to display that professionalism by holding themselves to the most exacting standards as the Army's highest profile unit and the official escort to the  But the 3rd Infantry's professionalism also had a serious purpose: to defend So faithfully has the regiment served the American people that its history and the Nation's history are thoroughly intertwined.  First, it served at posts along the frontier, where it protected American settlements against Indian attacks under the leadership of General ``Mad'' Anthony Wayne, and it fought the British Imperial Army to a standstill during the War of 1812. Today, members of the regiment wear a buff strap on their left shoulders to commemorate that 18th century heritage.  After the war, peacetime demobilization and reorganization gave the regiment its current name, the 3rd Then, during the Mexican War, the 3rd Infantry distinguished itself with bravery, skill, and stamina at every major battle of the war, in places like Palo Alto, Monterrey, and Vera Its famed bayonet charge at the Battle of Cerro Gordo is what persuaded the War Department in 1922 to authorize the 3rd Infantry to march with bayonets fixed to their rifles--a privilege still reserved solely to that regiment in the entire U.It was because of the 3rd Infantry's valor that General Winfield Scott, the commanding general of the Vera Cruz campaign, granted it the honor of leading the victorious march into Mexico City, during which he turned to his staff as the 3rd Infantry passed in review, and said: ``Gentlemen, take off your hats to the Old Guard of the Army.'' Ever since, the name has stuck.  After the Mexican War came the Civil War, which divided not only our Nation but also our Ulysses Grant and Robert Lee, who both fought alongside the Old Guard in Mexico, now faced off against each other. The 3rd Infantry fought every major battle in the war's first 2 years: First Bull Run, Second Bull Run, the Seven Days Battles, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and, finally, Suffering casualties that exceeded its original strength, the Old Guard ended the war at the Union's mobile headquarters, standing alongside General Grant at the Appomattox courthouse as he accepted General Lee's surrender.  In the days that followed, the vast majority of State volunteers returned home to their families--not the Old The ``regulars,'' as they were known back then, went straight back to the front, again protecting settlers from Indian raids across the western frontier. They defeated Spanish forces in Cuba during the Spanish-American They fought rebel insurgents in the Philippines and then returned to fight Muslim insurgents there, too, in some of the same places where the Islamic State is present today.  They guarded our border with Mexico during World War They helped to get the lend-lease program going in the early days of World War II, before deploying to Europe itself. But it was after the Old Guard's reactivation that it assumed the duties for which it is rightly famous today: performing ceremonies and military honor funerals.  For its first 162 years, the Old Guard defended America's frontiers and fought its wars, both at home and abroad. Now these new responsibilities have defined the Old Guard's mission for the last 70 years. The size and structure of the regiment has evolved, just as Arlington National Cemetery itself has grown. The Old Guard's prominence has increased, as it has participated in major internationally televised events, such as the ceremony to inter the unknown soldiers from World War II and the Korean war in 1958 and the state funeral for President Kennedy in 1963. But the essence of the mission has not changed since 1948.  It is this history, this reliability, this steady, sober leadership that the Old Guard has become known for. Their skill and proficiency, their care and attention to detail, their faithfulness and discipline--all of them--set the highest of standards of military conduct and character. Our fellow Americans see all that whenever they visit They can imagine it on the battlefield. Then, they have little wonder why our soldiers accomplish such amazing feats of valor. That is why the Old Guard is held in such reverence, and that is why it is fitting to mark this important anniversary.  The Old Guard represents the best of our country, but also the best in ourselves. Freedom isn't free. It requires self-sacrifice and self-discipline. That is what makes it a noble and, therefore, a fulfilling way of life. For reminding us of that dignity--the dignity that comes with being a free people--the men and women of the Old Guard deserve our deepest thanks.  I yield the floor.

316,topic-id,655,"Mr.Speaker, today, April 11, 2018, is a special day in southeastern It marks the 150th anniversary of when the State of Connecticut and the city of New London conveyed a deed of gift to the U.Navy that today still stands as the Naval Submarine Base New London, which has had a glorious, distinguished career in terms of our national defense.  Again, on that date in 1867, when the deed was signed and given to Gideon Welles, who was the Secretary of the Navy at the time, himself a native of the State of Connecticut, Glastonbury, Connecticut, it was the result, again, of an effort by one of my predecessors, Congressman Augustus Brandegee, who got an authorization and an appropriation through the Naval Appropriations bill in 1867 that set up this conveyance.  Congressman Brandegee was a distinguished Member of this body. He was a strong supporter of abolition. He voted in favor of the 13th Amendment, and he was somebody who was a frequent friend of President Lincoln at the time. They rode horseback together in the morning, and he was a very strong ally of the  After that deed of gift was signed, the Navy base was a coaling station that provided a way station for Navy ships in New England waters to again get refueled. It also was a place that Civil War Navy ships were stored in the wake of that conflict.  Again, fast-forward to 1915. That is when the Navy actually designated that base as a submarine base. It was a timely event because, very shortly thereafter, with the U.involvement in World War I where U-boat activity, obviously, was the driving force for why the U.got into that conflict, the submarine base in New London became a critical part of our effort in terms of that conflict.  Moving forward, even from 1915 when the first G-boat subs arrived at the Navy base in World War II, as Admiral Nimitz, who headed up our efforts particularly in the South Pacific, stated frequently in the wake of Pearl Harbor: It was, in fact, the submarine force that really held the line against the Japanese onslaught that took place in that area.  The Groton base was a site where a lot of the submarines that were part of that conflict actually took on that struggle; again, tragic and catastrophic losses. Nonetheless, I think most historians, particularly in the Pacific region, will affirm it was, in fact, the submarine force that was critical in terms of holding the line, particularly in 1942 and early 1943.  After World War II, the Groton base played another huge role in our national defense with the development of the nuclear Admiral Hyman Rickover developed the USS Nautilus, which was launched in the 1950s. That all took place in Groton and New London, Electric Boat was the shipyard where the Nautilus was built.  Today, our submarine force is completely nuclear powered. We have 15 attack submarines at the Groton-New London base which are doing important work both in the European theater, in terms of Putin's much more[[Page H3103]]aggressive naval resurgent activities, as well as other combatant commands around the world.  So the wisdom of my predecessor, and certainly the State of Connecticut, to site a Navy base--a submarine base--now, today, in a place that is very strategic in terms of critical regions of the world is still paying important dividends for our national defense.  As I am standing here today, there is a ceremony that is taking place to commemorate Congressman Brandegee's vision, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles' participation, and all the great service that has taken place in the wake of that historic moment.  So to all of you up in the State and to all of the 10,000 sailors that serve at the Groton Navy Base today, I thank you for keeping this incredible legacy and important future mission alive because our national defense depends on it.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-04-11-pt1-PgH3102-2.txt,1836,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2018.0,11.0,February
1144,topic-id,874,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Shimkus for yielding. Again, I am here tonight to join a bunch of my colleagues to speak in strong support of H.3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017, which Mr.Shimkus has skillfully guided through the Energy and Commerce Committee, again, a 49-4 vote on a committee which basically is challenged, in many instances, with other issues from healthcare and energy policy, you name it.  It is really just an amazing accomplishment on his part dealing with one of the thorniest, toughest issues, which, again, has been out there for 30 years, which is, again, how we, as a nation, deal with the tons of nuclear waste that is now piled up and accumulating in over 100 communities around the country.  Again, I represent the Second District of Connecticut, the eastern half of the State, which has two operating nuclear facilities. One has been decommissioned, the old Connecticut Yankee facility, which sits very close to the Connecticut Again, it has been closed for over a decade. The plant itself has been cut up, dismantled. It is now pretty much, you know, just overgrown with vegetation. But still sitting there is dry cask nuclear spent fuel rods, which, again, are being patrolled every single day, literally, as we are here tonight, by heavily armed guards, which makes perfect sense, because, as has been said by other speakers, again, this is still very dangerous material, and again, very close to one of the largest bodies of waters in new England, the Connecticut  We also have the Dominion nuclear power plant in Waterford, Connecticut, which today is in full operation. Over 45 percent of the energy consumed in the State of Connecticut is generated at It is about 15 percent of New England, because, again, it provides a supply for the rest of the region that is there, and again, this is a plant that goes back decades.  We are also the home of the Groton sub base, which is a base where, again, we have 15 attack subs that are deployed there. Again, the Groton sub base was where the USS Nautilus was launched 62 years ago. Admiral Rickover, the father of the nuclear Navy, actually designed that first sub, which was christened by Mamie  Again, that sub was built 5 years after the first lightbulb was powered by nuclear power as a nation; again, a pretty amazing accomplishment that Admiral Rickover was able to build and launch a nuclear submarine, something which the folks at the Navy at the time told him wouldn't happen for 75 years. Yet, today, the nuclear force, both in terms of submarines and carriers, are the backbone, again, of our away team, the U. So, again, we have a lot of history and experience with the fact that we have got really smart capable people who do amazing things in terms of providing the energy needs but also the national security of this country. But, as has been said, again, a byproduct of that is that nuclear waste which we thought 30 years ago was going to be dealt with with the decision that Congress made to dispose of nuclear waste in a central facility in Nevada that, again, ratepayers have paid year in and year out, $40 billion, as was mentioned earlier, but today is still immobilized.  So, again, Mr.Shimkus' effort, in terms of trying to not just restart the process but also to reform it, again, is such an extraordinary effort that really we, as a House, should really take advantage of and move on a bipartisan basis to enact.                              {time}  2000  This is not your father's Yucca Mountain bill that Mr.Shimkus got through. It made some changes for fairness in terms of ratepayers. It also created more transparency so that local stakeholders in Nevada will have an opportunity to really help make decisions and see and understand the technology that is being employed there.  It also set up an interim process, which, again, if it is over decades, which it is still going to take, that we can at least start moving material out from these over 100 sites situated all across the country, which is so important in terms of reducing costs and reducing national security risk.  His proposal, I think, deserves great support and, frankly, congratulations that he has been able to take this on.  I would note that the country of Finland has actually started to move forward with their own waste disposal site, the Onkalo Peninsula Depository, which a country that is very progressive in terms of a lot of its policies, but that have shown that the technology is there to safely deposit nuclear waste in a way that has real confidence and is moving forward. We should do it, too.  Again, H.3053 is, I think, the roadmap for this country to deal with this problem in a way that is safe, is transparent, and will reduce costs for ratepayers all across the country.  I look forward to seeing a vote take place very soon on the floor of the And then, frankly, I look forward to a bill signing ceremony at the White House, where Mr.Shimkus[[Page H1361]]should certainly take a front row seat for his great work.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.1209, which will rename a post office facility in my district at 901 North Francisco Avenue in Mission, Texas, as the Mission Veterans Post  Across my district, fine men and women of all walks of life have honorably served our country, and it is critical that we honor their service and their dedication. Mission alone is home to over 2,000 veterans, according to the U.Census Dedicating this post office to our veterans will serve as an enduring reminder of the sacrifices that our friends, neighbors, and families have made while serving their country. These individuals put country ahead of self, and I am proud to recognize them with the dedicating of this post office facility.  Today in particular, I want to acknowledge the sacrifice of Captain Joaquin Castro from Mission, Captain Castro joined the Army Air Corps in 1941 and served as a B-17 pilot in the Pacific theater. He was stationed at Hickam Field in Hawaii during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, where his airfield was extensively damaged and suffered heavy casualties. However, Captain Castro would go on to serve several missions against enemy forces before being declared missing in action during a bombing mission.  He received the National Defense Service Medal, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Air Medal with an Oak Leaf Captain Castro would eventually be honored with an elementary school named after him in his hometown in Mission, He was known to be a humble and diligent individual who served in a variety of jobs before joining the military. He was a janitor; he was a school bus driver; and he was a stenographer also.  We owe our freedom to veterans like Mr.Castro, which is why I am recognizing him with the dedication of this post office, not only for his service but also that of the other veterans. He is just one example of many veterans who have made countless sacrifices for their country in the face of danger.

In the words of President John Kennedy: A nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces but also by the men it honors, the men it remembers.  And, of course, we include women in that quote also.

This legislation is another example of ensuring regulators work in the best interest of the U.economy rather than abiding by international standards that hold American businesses back rather than move them forward.  In fact, the very premise of this legislation reminds me of a song. I remember when Bill Clinton was running, he[[Page H1313]]had a song about: ``Don't stop thinking about tomorrow.

Well, this piece of legislation that is in place today, established by the Basel Committee in 2006, is thinking about tomorrow, is thinking about yesterday. What happened in the past is constraining what could happen in the future.  So banks are reserving against past losses in an era that holds them from being able to adopt the business plans that maybe even under new leadership, new board members, and a whole new set of governance requirements that will get the company moving forward at a better growth rate. This is better for not just the company, not just the executives or the board members, but the consumers that would be served by this market.  Take, for instance, historic losses being reserved against. That capital is sitting there not actively employed in the market. Even the Basel Committee saw how ridiculous this rule is; so they updated their guidance, in 2016, to include historical loss experience as a relevant indicator instead of as the sole factor.

In the wake of that crisis, it was very appropriate for Congress to do something, and we did, with Dodd-Frank legislation, which is legislation that I strongly support. As part of the Dodd-Frank legislation, FSOC was established, the Financial Stability Oversight Council; and the job of FSOC was to reduce systemic risk in the financial services sector, which is a mission that I also support.  But they were given very limited tools to fulfill that mission. Effectively, their one tool was to designate companies as systemically risky to the system. So they had the power to designate; they didn't really have the power to de-risk the system, which should be their job.  What this piece of legislation--again, this piece of strongly bipartisan legislation--does is effectively empower FSOC with the ability to reduce risk in the financial services system by working in a collaborative manner with companies that it is considering designated and the primary regulators of those companies to develop plans to de-risk those companies.  Mr.Speaker, wouldn't we be better off with a financial services system that has less risk in it, fewer companies that are considered systemically risky in substance, as opposed to having a system that is inherently more risky or has greater risk and has more companies designated?  In other words, designation doesn't, in and of itself, reduce risk. What reduces risk is primary regulators working with FSOC and companies that it deems potentially worthy of designation to develop strategies and plans to de-risk those companies.

This is because of the survivors--not our generation doing something, but the children. It is because of them.  You see, this generation believes that they can change the world.

227,topic-id,808,"Mr.Speaker, our previous Tax Code was ineffective and outdated. For too long, Americans' history of entrepreneurs and aspiring job creators has been in jeopardy.  The United States now ranks 12th worldwide in business openings. For the first time in 35 years, American business closures outnumbered business openings--the first time in 35 years. That means jobs were vanishing faster than they were being created.  For decades, our country's families have been burdened by countless hours of paperwork just putting taxes together, confusing tax rules that you needed an accountant or a lawyer to look at, and unsustainable rates that cut into everyday hardworking paychecks.  The Code also did little to encourage U.companies to invest right here. Instead, it was only successful in creating new loopholes, exemptions, and disincentives that pushed more profits and jobs overseas. The Tax Code just wasn't working. That is why I was proud to have supported and coauthored H.1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which tackled each of these separate issues in ways to support American families and U.job growth.  In the midst of all the rhetoric around here, the partisanship, the Washington spin outside of this building, it is important that we don't lose sight of who actually won in this. It is the people in my district. People in places all across the country. It is Americans who won by changing the Tax  This bill will allow businesses to grow, to continue to give bonuses and raises. Small businesses will now have the flexibility to make new hires and investments, thanks to the new 20 percent deduction for qualified pass-through companies. It is a deduction to make sure we are hiring new people.  They will also be able to immediately write off the full cost of purchases of new and used equipment, making their goals to expand operations a reality. This gives them the opportunity to take the money that they are making, the profits that they are making to go out and buy new equipment, buy new supplies, and be able to hire more people and bring them into their company.  The bill is also good for agriculture. That is my district's biggest economic driver. It repealed the harmful estate tax and includes supportive export provisions that help our local farmers compete and sell their crops on the national market.  The bill is good for our communities. It creates a new pathway for investments to flow directly into lower income areas. These newly designated opportunity zones will receive the necessary capital infusion to jump-start their economies and support our local residents.  Most importantly, the bill is good for individuals and families. It cuts rates across the board and doubles the standard deduction. It also bolsters the value of the child tax credit.  Now, a lot of people have asked me: What is the standard deduction? Most people just take all of their information for the year and they give to it their accountant or they put it into the[[Page H3089]]system and try to understand the old Tax  The standard deduction was something that most people in my district did before, but by doubling it, 94 percent of the people in my district will now utilize the standard deduction. This affects everybody.  Other commonsense provisions, like the earned income tax credit, adoption tax credit, charitable deductions, and retirement savings options are all preserved under the bill. That ensures that families can keep more of their own money.  Now, since this bill passed, being home in the district, I have been to the bank and talked to people. In the grocery store, people have come up to me and told me what a difference this has made in their paycheck--$50 a week, $100 a paycheck, $200 a month. It is real money adding up to the people in my district.

85,topic-id,3202,"Mr.President, last Friday, America lost a good and gracious person, a statesman, and many of us in the Senate lost a personal friend.  Senator Daniel Akaka was as kind and decent a man as you would ever meet in life. For 3\1/2\ decades, Danny Akaka served the people of Hawaii in the U.Congress with dignity, humility, and deep caring.  The Hawaiian concept of ``aloha'' isn't a quality that many think of when they think of politicians. ``Aloha'' means mutual regard and affection. It means extending warmth and caring with no obligation in return, no strings attached. Danny Inouye, that giant of Hawaii and its history, once called Danny Akaka ``a true ambassador of aloha.''  When Danny Akaka announced in 2011 that he would not run for reelection to the Senate, then-Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie said:       The words aloha and Akaka are interchangeable. Daniel Akaka      is  Now, at age 93, Senator Akaka is gone. I first met him in 1983. I was a newly elected Member of the U.House of Then we sat together on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, the two of us next to one another down at the far end of the table. Danny had 6 years' seniority on me. We served together, worked together, laughed together, traveled together, and came to be friends.  Here was a man, a great politician, who didn't have a personal ego. Politics was always about someone else, about helping other people. In fact, he went out of his way to avoid the spotlight. But don't think for a minute that he was weak. I have memories seared in my mind--certainly October 11, 2002, when 22 Members of the Democratic caucus in the Senate voted against the resolution authorizing President Bush to invade Iraq--the Iraq war resolution Danny Akaka opposed. I can recall that it was nearly 1 in the morning when that rollcall ended and he left the floor after that historic vote. Soft-spoken, yes. Capable of making hard, meaningful, courageous decisions, certainly. That was a lonely road. I believe history has judged it to be the right vote.  Danny Akaka's vote, like so many, was deeply influenced by his own experience in the U.military. At 17 years of age, he witnessed the Japanese attack on Pearl Two years later, after serving as a welder and diesel mechanic with the Army Corps of Engineers, he entered Active Duty with the Army and served in several areas across the  After the war, he used his GI benefits to go to college, and only later did he realize he was still carrying a wound from that war--post-traumatic stress disorder. He said that earning a bachelor's and master's degree in education and working as a public school teacher and principal--his first profession--helped him to cope with  In politics, his second career, he used his influence to help other members of the military, veterans and their families.  In 2008, as chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Danny Akaka cosponsored the post-9/11 GI bill of rights. That new GI bill of rights included a provision that I asked Danny to include to improve care for veterans wounded by another of the often-invisible wounds of war--traumatic brain injury. Senator Akaka's leadership helped to pass that important new law.  Two years later, then chairman of the Veterans' Committee, I appealed to Danny Akaka again for another provision. It was an idea actually authored originally by Senator Hillary Clinton of New It was called the Caregivers The idea was to allow family members of disabled veterans to care for them at home, to provide necessary medical care and support in a home setting that they all wanted to be in. It was the right thing for our veterans, the right thing for our budget, and the right thing for Danny Akaka embraced it and became a leader on the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010, providing those family members with training and modest stipends. The stipends amount to only a fraction of what would have been spent on these veterans had they been in a different setting sponsored by the government.  Well, Danny Akaka is gone, but his legacy of service lives on in millions of veterans and military families whose lives are better because of his quiet but fierce commitment.  In 1996, Senator Akaka spearheaded an effort to require reevaluation of the service records of Asian Americans who had fought in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and the 100th Division during the war.  As a result of Danny Akaka's perseverance, almost two dozen Medals of Honor were bestowed posthumously on Asian-American veterans, many of them Japanese The most prominent recipient was his colleague, Senator Danny Inouye, who had lost an arm during World War II fighting for the United States in It was a long overdue justice for heroes whose courage had been largely ignored for decades because of racism, and Danny Akaka helped to make it happen.  In 1993, Danny Akaka helped to bend the arc of the moral universe another time when he and Senator Inouye successfully pushed through a resolution in which the Federal Government apologized for its role in overthrowing the Hawaiian monarchy a century earlier.  As a child, Danny Akaka listened to his parents speak their Native Hawaiian language in whispers. They didn't want Danny and his seven brothers and sisters to hear them because of the Territorial law allowing children to be punished if they spoke their Native Hawaiian language in school. That little boy, little Danny Akaka, grew up to be the first Native Hawaiian ever elected to the U.Danny Akaka was a champion of Native Hawaiians and Native Americans, a champion of good government and the men and women who do that work in government.  He was a deeply spiritual and religious man, who once considered following his brother into the ministry but instead decided to help others in his own way as a teacher and a public servant. His was a life well lived.  Last night, I had a telephone conversation with Danny's wife, Millie Akaka--what a team, 69 years of marriage. They were just a few weeks away from celebrating their 70th anniversary. They were inseparable. He was the Senator, but she was the driving force in his public career. She managed every one of his campaigns. She knew everyone in every direction. She never forgot a name, and she was always[[Page S2023]]there to finish his sentences. We talked for a long time last night about the times when we were able to get together--my wife Loretta, Millie, and Danny--and the good times we had and the great people we met in the process. I also talked about the time when Danny came before the Senate Democratic caucus luncheon. We used to have a great tradition, where every few weeks Senators would get up and just tell a little bit about their personal lives--things that don't make the headlines.  I still remember Danny Akaka's presentation. He talked about growing up in a very modest family but having a mother with a very caring heart. His mother just couldn't stand to see someone who was struggling to find a home or a meal. She was always inviting someone in. Even though they didn't have a lot themselves, they were always sharing with people. She would say: Bring them over to dinner, Let's meet them.  Then, after they met them, they would offer them a room. Danny told a story of people who came and lived in his home with him--perfect strangers who became part of their family and lived with them for months and even years. Some of those people whom they befriended went on to greatness. One was a medical doctor who became famous and never forgot the kindnesses extended by the Akaka family.  His mother's lesson was learned by Danny It was shared with us in the It was an indication of truly a caring heart and a person who was really prepared to serve every day of his life.  I join my colleagues in expressing our condolences to Danny's wife Millie, to their five children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. May your love and memories be a comfort in this time of loss.  To my friend, Senator Danny Akaka: Aloha and mahalo. Farewell and thank you.                                  DACA  Mr.President, I have come to this floor over 110 different times to introduce to the Senate and to the people who follow our proceedings remarkable people who live in the shadows of These are Dreamers--children who were brought to this country by their parents, some at the age of 2 or 3. They were brought into this country perhaps on a visitor's visa and stayed. They grew up in Then, when they were 10 or 12, in some cases, their mother and father sat down and said: We need to tell you the truth about who you are and where you are.  These children are undocumented. Their parents didn't file the necessary legal papers. They live lives without a country. They have grown up here. They always believed they were They went to our schools and stood every day in class and pledged allegiance to that flag. They really believed they were part of America, but legally, no, they were  I have tried for 17 years now to pass legislation to give them a chance to earn their way to legal status and citizenship. I have had some luck from time to time, but we have never quite been able to find the necessary votes in both the House and the Senate in the same year.  A number of years ago, I appealed to my former Senate colleague, Barack Obama, and asked President Obama to do what he could to help these He created a program called DACA by Executive order. Under DACA, these young people could come forward, submit themselves to a criminal background check, pay a filing fee, and be protected from deportation for 2 years at a time. They had to renew this. So if there was any problem, they could lose their protection. That DACA Program finally brought 800,000 Americans--people who live in America--out of the shadows under the protection of  Initially, we thought new President Trump was going to give these young DACA recipients a break. He said a lot of kind things about them, even though his rhetoric about immigration has been very harsh. He said good things about them because he realized, as all of us do, that many of them are victims of unfairness and injustice and they should be given a chance to prove themselves and be part of America's future.  But then, on September 5 of last year, President Trump reversed himself. He announced that he was eliminating DACA, eliminating the protection these young people have. He challenged Congress and said: Come up with a law that protects DACA and I accepted the challenge and so did Lindsey Graham, the Republican Senator of South We put together a team of six Senators--three Democrats and three Republicans--and worked for months to come up with an alternative that would protect the Dreamers, protect those who are under the DACA  I think it was a good proposal. I think it was balanced. Parts of it I didn't like, and parts of it I did. That is the nature of a political compromise. It was bipartisan. We took it to President Trump, but he rejected it. He just rejected it.  There we were, emptyhanded, coming to the floor of the Senate a few weeks ago for four different votes to try to solve the DACA crisis. None of our proposals passed. The one with the most votes was the one Senator Graham and I worked on and brought to the floor with Senator King and Senator It even included the President's wall. Some of us think this is a crazy idea, a waste of taxpayers' dollars, but we were prepared to say to the President: If you would give 1.8 million of these Dreamers a path to citizenship, we will at least start building your wall--one that was supposed to be paid for by President Trump rejected it. He rejected it. March 5 came and went. The deadline for DACA ended, and protection under DACA started disappearing.  There were court suits that were brought. Two Federal courts stepped in and issued injunctions. They said to the President: Stop the threat of deportation against these DACA-protected young people. Two of those injunctions now stand, and under those our Federal Government--the Department of Homeland Security--is allowing those who were once protected by DACA to renew their status. Of course, those who were newly eligible--for instance, reaching the age of 15, which is the age of eligibility--can't sign up. But if you were in the 800,000 protected, you can renew your DACA protection by these court orders.  So how long are these young people going to be protected? We don't know. That court protection could end next week, next month, or 6 months from now. We just don't know. So they live in absolute uncertainty with the danger that at any minute DACA protection ends and they can be deported.  When I have come to the floor to tell their stories, people understand that these young people are extraordinary. Think about growing up as a teenager and all the uncertainty and challenges and things that come to your life. Imagine doing that with the knowledge that at any minute you could be deported or some misstep by you might deport your entire family. That is what these young people have grown up with. Yet they are determined. They are resilient. Some of them are nothing short of amazing on what they have done with their lives.  I have come to the floor to tell their stories so you could attach a face to them, to the issue. DACA isn't just another government program. It turns out to be something that is significant in their lives.  Today I wish to tell another one of those stories about another one of these This lovely young lady here is Gloria Gloria Rinconi is the 113th Dreamer whom I have had the honor to introduce to the Senate and to those who follow our proceedings.  Gloria was brought to the United States at the age of 1 from She grew up in North Carolina and in Her family had so little money that at one point her parents slept on the floor of a trailer. Gloria slept on a makeshift bed made out of a piece of cardboard and a blanket.  Gloria's parents told her she was undocumented, but ``you are loved by many regardless of what you might hear on TV.''  Her family was poor, but Gloria was a hard worker and an extraordinarily good student. In high school, she took advanced placement courses and was a member of the National Technical Honor She received the Tyler Independent School District Student She was active in extracurricular activities, worked on the[[Page S2024]]school yearbook, was a member of the French club, pom squad, and drill prep. She competed in pageants, winning the National American Miss State Pageant and the National American Miss National  Gloria graduated from high school with a medical assistant program certification. She is attending Richland College and majoring in psychology. She also works as a medical assistant for a surgeon. Her dream is to become a clinical psychologist and work with low-income families facing mental health issues.  This lovely and amazing young lady sent me a letter. Here is what she said:       DACA is my entire life. It's the only thing I have that      allows me to work, give back to my community and continue      with my future plans. Without it, my life as I know it will      be gone.  This is what the DACA debate and the Dream Act debate is all about. It is all about the aspirations and hopes of amazing, talented, and dedicated young people who just want to be part of America's future.  Would we be better if we ended up deporting this young lady, sending her back to Mexico--a place she has probably never even visited in her entire life since she came here at the age of 1? I don't think so. I think everyone understands that a young person like this deserves a chance.  We now face the possibility that DACA protection through court order may protect those who are already protected under DACA from deportation but may not protect them for some period of time and allow them to work. That is the second part of DACA--that you can legally work in the United  A lot of them have graduated from college and do work today. I have met doctors, lawyers, engineers, and teachers. There are some 20,000 teachers across America who are protected by DACA and allowed to work, but President Trump has said recently that it is over and, as far as he is concerned, they should be deported. I hope his position does not prevail. I hope, for Gloria's sake and for the thousands just like her, that we will do the right thing, the just and fair thing, and that we will do something immediately to provide DACA protection, protection for Dreamers, and a path for citizenship.  How did we get into this crisis? President Trump's decision on September 5, 2017, to end DACA created the crisis we face. We need to work toward a solution.  The President has rejected six bipartisan proposals. I don't know what it will take to bring him around. I am skeptical now of any statement that he makes publicly that he wants to solve this problem. I also know that we face, as Gloria faces every day, the uncertainty for these young people.  I urge my colleagues on both sides, don't quit on this issue; don't quit on these young people. Every time I go home--every time I go home and meet with these Dreamers--it is an emotional meeting. Few of them can tell me their life stories without breaking down in tears. Then, when they mention their parents--who have been vilified by some--these young DACA recipients break down in tears again. They say: Senator, wouldn't you have done everything in your power to help your children, even if it meant breaking a law?  Yes, I am sure I would have.  Should the parents pay a price? Well, under comprehensive immigration reform, we had a fine they had to pay, and we delayed any eligibility they had to become citizens, but we didn't deport them and break up their families. If they had no criminal record and no difficulties or problems, we gave them a chance--not amnesty, a price had to be paid but a chance to become part of the future of America as well.  This issue is not over because we have failed in the The issue is still there. The question is whether Senators from both political parties can summon the courage to solve this problem.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

336,topic-id,2528,"Mr.President, last week, I spent 4 days in I had never been there before. I was given an opportunity to get a visa to go to the country, and I jumped at the opportunity. Venezuela, of course, on the north end of the South American continent, is a constant source of concern in the United States and the region, and I wanted to see for myself what was happening. No doubt, many are aware that Venezuela has been suffering devastating economic and democratic backsliding, but what I found was a country that is on the edge of collapse, facing overlapping economic, humanitarian, and political crises.  On the economic side, Venezuela has so many positive things. It is rich in natural beauty, oil, minerals, and human talent, but it has seen its economy run into the ground by mindless price controls, multiple exchange rates, and gross mismanagement. Inflation is rampant and expected to reach 13,000 percent this year, leading to what some call ``a race for survival.''  Imagine walking down the main street of Caracas and seeing long lines at every Why are they there? Because each day, the residents of Venezuela must go to the ATM machine with their credit card or debit card and take out the maximum withdrawal allowed. It is hundreds of thousands of Bolivars, which sound like more money than you could possibly need, but it translates into 20 cents--waiting an hour at an ATM machine for 20 cents' worth of currency so that you can ride the bus back and forth to work. That is what life is like in the capital of  They have universally discredited and arbitrary price controls that are eerily reminiscent of the failed policies in Cuba and the Soviet They have decimated local production and left basic goods unavailable or unaffordable.  I went down the main street in Caracas and saw many shops but no customers. Basic goods were available--shampoo or diapers, for example--but they cost the equivalent of 2 or 3 months of salary. We stopped and did a translation at one store that isn't under price controls, and we found that a pound of hamburger costs $4, which doesn't sound bad, except that that is the minimum monthly wage in Venezuela--for a pound of hamburger. People waited in long lines.[[Page S2051]]  Rampant inflation--hyperinflation, really--has made actual cash scarce, and near worthless when it can actually be found. I have never visited a country where I never touched their currency. They warned me against it. They said: If you buy things here, as a tourist, you are going to pay 20 times what local people pay. They have exchange rates that are bizarre and change by the minute. These people live with this every single day.  The government of Maduro stages raids into formal grocery stores to impose arbitrary price controls, leaving the owners unable to stock their shelves or run a functioning business. If there is a rumor that there are eggs for sale somewhere in Caracas, there is a rush to that location, and people wait for hours in the hopes that they can buy eggs.  As a result, informal markets are springing up trying to meet the people's demands. Yet even while I walked through these markets, I saw long lines. From the second floor in the back, in the dark, there was a long line waiting. I went to the front to see what they were waiting for. They wanted to buy toilet paper.  Business leaders told me that they are being vilified by the government, forced to sell products below cost and out of markets so the government can be the exclusive seller of imported goods.  Listen to this. They also shared stories of workers fainting on the job from hunger. Of particular concern, one of the largest employers in Venezuela said they decided they had to start bringing fruit to the workplace in the morning so their workers could get something to eat. When they fainted, it was not only dangerous to them but to people around them, and they wanted to keep their workers awake. Only one out of three people in Venezuela eats three meals a day. There are children fainting at school.  The government has run the state oil industry into collapse, treating it as its cash cow and as a way to line their pockets. Currently, there is little or no investment in the oil industry, the national oil industry of There is little or no maintenance, and there is a mass exodus of skilled personnel and engineers. What would an engineer working for a Venezuelan national oil company earn in the course of a year? Dramatically more than most Venezuelans--$1,700 a year in annual income. What do they earn in other countries in Latin America with the same skills? They would earn an average income of $85,000 a year. Is it any surprise they are leaving?  It is also no surprise that the country is suffering a heartbreaking humanitarian crisis, one that is notable for malnutrition and a breakdown of basic public health. Brave and dedicated healthcare workers--and I have met some; NGO leaders told me of a shortage of vaccines with outbreaks of measles and diphtheria that haven't been seen for decades. Malaria is at record levels.  When the public health officials gave me a briefing on the public health crisis of Venezuela, they said that the maternal mortality rate--the death of mothers--is at the level it was 50 years ago, the early 1960s. The same thing is true for infant mortality--that high a level. You have to go to South Sudan, Yemen, or Syria to find comparable public health crises, and those three countries are all at war. Venezuela is at war with itself. In fact, one expert said that the outbreak of measles, diphtheria, and malaria was the worst he had seen, certainly the worst in all of South  With Venezuelans flooding into neighboring countries, many of them are spreading diseases that have been cured in so many countries around the world. Basic diabetes, asthma, and HIV treatments are simply not available. For 4 months now, HIV patients have not been given medication.  A staggering number of hospitals cannot perform basic services. Many do not have any capacity to perform a blood test. There are no x ray machines available on a 24/7 basis. Many of them don't have electricity. Some do not even have clean water.  Venezuelans are suffering malnutrition, and it is particularly acute for children, who suffer for a lifetime due to stunted brain development. One expert said that the rates of malnutrition have affected more than 8 percent of the population. In some areas, the percentage of people suffering from malnutrition is as high as 15 percent. You can see it on the streets of When you look at the public parks, you see these children--thin limbs, spindly legs and arms, and you think to yourself: These kids are not getting enough to eat.  It is hard to know precisely about all of these statistics because the government has officially stopped collecting and releasing information. They leave it up to private organizations.  What I found particularly cruel is the government's supposed effort to help with hunger. A provision of a monthly food basket was linked to having the right political identification card. Sadly, these food boxes are imported. Someone is making a lot of money in that process, with corrupt middlemen taking a cut at multiple steps along the way, all to provide a politically manipulated lifeline that meets only 7 of the 12 basic food needs.  The regime has also linked these food rations to polling stations during elections, which brings me to the third overlapping crisis, a democratic crisis. Let me acknowledge that Hugo Chavez did, in fact, win his initial terms in democratic elections. He tapped into public disenchantment with the failure of traditional governing parties to address the deep chasms of poverty in He even said ``I am not the cause, I am the consequence,'' referring to his rise to power. But his election, like that of so many other autocrats at heart, also brought the steady dismantling of the country's democracy, a path followed by the current  You see, in Venezuela, political parties that look threatening are arbitrarily banned. Political opponents who appear to be popular are jailed or exiled or just plain disqualified from running for office. Government institutions, like the Venezuelan election commission, are simply political tools of the regime. The rule of law has collapsed.  In 2015, the opposition won a sweeping victory in legislative elections. What happened next? The President of Venezuela, Maduro, installed an illegitimate rubberstamp constituent assembly to usurp the legitimately elected National It was his way of stopping his opponents. The supreme court and national election council are stacked with partisan cronies who do whatever the regime asks, regardless of the law.  Now, with the country on the edge of economic collapse, the President has called for a snap election on May 20--more than 6 months before it traditionally would be held. He wants to move quickly, for fear that he might lose. Maduro doesn't want to risk losing even under a rigged system, so he is rushing forward with this election that doesn't even come close to meeting established international standards.  What I found, and bears repeating, is that the critics of the Venezuelan Government regime and their actions are not confined to the United States or They include Central American countries like Panama and South American countries, which have expressed their displeasure with Maduro's actions, as well as the European Union's displeasure. The parties and candidates still remain arbitrarily banned. There is zero trust in discredited election commissions, and registration and voting processes have been dramatically manipulated.  I met with some of the opposition leaders, and they told me what happens when people try to vote. They have to go through an elaborate process with a machine to register to vote. It is controlled. It takes too much time. It limits the opposition from registering their voters. There is little time for a legitimate campaign, especially with government control of the media. Reputable, long-term election monitors are nowhere to be seen, and none seem to be planned for the actual election, either.  Under these conditions, how can any such election be credible? If President Maduro proceeds with this May 20 election under these circumstances, he is going to find Venezuela further isolated.  Amid these deeply troubling and ominous conditions, I nonetheless met many brave and dedicated Venezuelans who are trying to endure and reverse this horrible situation. Doctors, nurses, civic leaders, business people,[[Page S2052]]politicians, and so many others are sharing food and medicine, running for office and facing the threat of arrest or exile, documenting human rights abuses in the shrinking media state, trying to run businesses in a broken economy. It is an incredible act of courage each day.  I also met with former political prisoners, political opposition members, and their families who are under constant threat or already under some kind of arrest. I would name them here, but to do so would put them in danger in I was moved by their dedication and humanity.  I am haunted by the comments of one group of young idealists. Over dinner Friday night in Caracas, they talked about the future. They said: If we called the same group of five opposition leaders together a year from now, we would be lucky if three showed up. Two of us will be exiled or jailed between now and then. That is what they face by being political opponents of the current regime. I fear how many of Venezuela's most talented will be sacrificed under these conditions.  The regime is also tragically holding a U.citizen, Josh Holt of Utah, on criminal charges. The charges are nonsense. I visited with Josh Holt in his prison. The prison is known locally as hell on earth. Josh and his Venezuelan wife have served 21 months, with no end in sight, and they still haven't gone through the criminal process. He is suffering, and he should be. It is understandable. He is clearly being held as a political hostage. I appealed to the President and every member of the government to release this young man and his Venezuelan wife and her daughter so that they could come back to the United Keeping Josh Holt as a political hostage will just isolate the Maduro regime even more. I am one of a bipartisan group of Members in Congress who will continue to push for his immediate release.  Lastly, I want to note that every time I go on one of these trips overseas, including to some of the most far-flung corners of the globe, I am always moved by the group of talented Americans working for us and representing us; those are the men and women in our Embassies, without exception. Under the Charge d'Affaires, Todd Robinson, our Embassy team in Caracas is a point of great pride and outstanding public service. The conditions under which they are forced to operate are extraordinarily stressful.  There was some small hope that negotiations led by the Vatican and regional leaders or most recently hosted in the Dominican Republic could lead to some kind of path forward between the Venezuelan Government and the opposition before it is too late, but all of these have failed. Some hoped years ago that a group known as the Boston Group--American and Venezuelan elected officials--might be the beginning of a dialogue and might be continued to this day, but it is increasingly difficult to see that possibility. I met some of the Venezuelan Boston Group members. Several of them are deeply committed to this administration currently in power. Many of them talk about changes that need to be made in I haven't given up hope completely that there may be some voices that can move this country back to a civilized status.  Let me be clear in my concluding message to the Venezuelan Government, specifically, a message that they should proceed with an election that meets the following basic standards: All political prisoners must be released, and all candidates and parties must be allowed to compete. There must be at least 6 months for a legitimate campaign. The national election council should be restructured and led by a credible group of professionals on an evenly divided partisan basis so that it isn't loaded for one party or another. There must be no linking of food with voting or political party affiliation. The National Assembly must have its powers restored. Credible international and local election monitors must be allowed to observe preelection and actual election processes, with full accreditation and access.

958,topic-id,1592,"Mr.President, a few years ago, an author named Malcolm Gladwell wrote a book titled ``The Tipping Point.'' He spelled out that in the course of history, when something occurs that changes people's thinking and actions, it is a precipitous moment where what has been done for so long stops, is reevaluated, and a different course is followed. The clear question we have in America today is whether we have reached a tipping point when it comes to gun violence.  It has only been 13 days since the tragedy in Parkland, Look at what has happened since. Of course there is outrage, sadness, and mourning for the families who lost these wonderful students, teachers, and administrators, but beyond that, these high school students--17, 18 years old, some even younger--have become a national voice, a powerful voice on the issue of gun safety in schools.  I often wondered when this moment might occur or whether it would occur. There has been such a long litany and string of mass shootings and massacres. It is sad to say that there was a numbness setting in. When terrible things occurred in places like Las Vegas, Texas, and other States, you wondered, is that the event? Will the killing of those innocent children in Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut be the tipping point? Will America finally say ``enough''? It appears that on this day, 13 days after the tragedy in Florida, we are near or at a tipping point when it comes to gun safety.  Some of it is very personal. Two weeks ago, after this occurred, my 6-year-old granddaughter said to her mother that she had been warned in her first grade classroom that if a shooter should turn up at school firing a gun, first, she should stay away from the windows, and second, she should lie down on the floor. I can't tell you what a profound impact that had on me as a grandfather to think that my little first grader, this beautiful little girl, was worried about the moment when somebody would walk in her classroom and wantonly try to kill the students and teachers who are there.  I cannot believe that any sane person believes that the Second Amendment to the Constitution--the right to bear arms--envisioned that possibility. I am sure it didn't. I am sure our Founding Fathers--and we can debate for the rest of the day what their words actually meant--never envisioned that an American citizen's right to bear arms could somehow translate into violence against so many innocent people, as it has over and over again.  Last week, I was in I was joined at a press conference by gun safety advocates at the Martin Luther King Community Center on the South We stood together, victims of gun violence and I, at a press conference. With me were advocates from Hadiya's Promise and the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence, who have been working together for years to combat the scourge gun violence in I also stood with Patrick Korellis, who was wounded on February 14 10 years ago at a mass school shooting at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb,  A new voice came to join us, a graduate from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, named Francyn She graduated from Stoneman Douglas in 2009. She is currently a law student at the Chicago-Kent College of She is one of dozens of Stoneman Douglas graduates in the Chicago area--which include, incidentally, the first baseman for the Chicago Cubs, Anthony Rizzo--and hundreds, if not thousands, nationwide who joined together in the aftermath of the February 14 mass shooting that killed 14 Stoneman Douglas students and 3 staff. These young men and women have come together to speak up and urge their lawmakers to do something about the Nation's epidemic of gun violence. The message is starting to resonate.  When Francyn Brown was speaking last Wednesday, students at schools across the Chicagoland area were walking out of class in solidarity with Stoneman Douglas students. They are all calling for commonsense gun reform. These students don't have time or patience for political games in Washington or They have seen their friends, kids just like themselves, get shot in their classrooms and neighborhoods. They have had enough.  Francyn Brown said:       It's not supposed to matter what side of the aisle a      politician sits. We are supposed to all protect the future of      our children.  I couldn't agree more.  These students and young people across the country are changing the debate about gun violence. They are making it clear how absurd it is for lawmakers in this Chamber, across the rotunda, or in State capitals to do nothing when Americans get shot every day in their homes, their neighborhoods, their churches, nightclubs, concerts, and schools. They are fed up with politicians in Washington who ignore the overwhelming majority of Americans who want commonsense gun safety and listen instead to paranoid, bullying gun sales lobbyists.  Remember, the National Rifle Association and its allies oppose virtually anything that hurts gun sales. They fight against proposals that might reduce gun sales, and they try to roll back laws on the books that limit them. That is their agenda. But it is not America's agenda. Corporate America is starting to walk away from the It is no longer a source of pride that they are doing business with the National Rifle Association--just the opposite. We are seeing company after company end relationships with the NRA because of its increasingly unhinged and hysterical rhetoric on the issue of gun safety. Corporate America--some of the biggest corporations in our Nation--realize that the NRA no longer speaks for responsible gun owners. When will Congress realize this?  We know we need to act to keep our children safe. There is no single reform that can stop every shooting, but we know there are gaps in our gun laws that make it easy for criminals, abusers, troubled children, and mentally unstable people to get guns, even military assault weapons with bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.  We need to close these gaps, and that requires the Republicans who control Congress to stand up to the NRA and do something that the NRA might not like. For starters, my Republican colleagues could take up legislation that the leader of their party, President Trump, proposed last Here is one of the President's infamous tweets:       I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks      with an emphasis on Mental Raise age to 21 and end      sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do      something on this issue--I hope!  And I hope as well.  There are proposals that Americans broadly support. Let's do something. Of course, the NRA is opposed to most of these. We expected that. These proposals might have some negative impact on gun sales, but is the gun sales lobby now in charge of writing bills for the Senate and the House? Deferring to the NRA is the reason we have reached this moment in history.  Remember, the Senate has held one gun vote since President Trump came to office, and it was a vote to prevent mental health records from the Social Security Administration from going into the FBI's gun background check system. That is the only vote since the Trump administration took office. It is the only thing we have done here--roll back a law on the books on mental health and background checks. That was a giveaway to the gun lobby, which claims to support enforcing the laws on the books but actually tries to roll[[Page S1226]]back those laws if it means helping to lift their sales.  Let's show the students at Stoneman Douglas and across the country that we hear them. I hope we show that reducing gun violence is a priority.  I call on my Republican colleagues to join the Democrats in a bipartisan effort to treat the issue of gun safety with the sense of urgency that the American people believe is necessary. If Republicans gave a fraction of the effort to gun safety that they have to other issues, we could get this done--and done quickly. There are plenty of reforms we could pass that are completely consistent with the Second Amendment and would save lives. Even President Trump, for the time being, has said that he supports them.  So let's get started. Not on a giveaway to the gun lobby--let's work on closing loopholes. Let's have universal background checks. Over 90 percent of the American people believe we should keep guns out of the hands of convicted felons and mentally unstable people. I also believe that those who are subject to protective orders for domestic violence should be disqualified from buying a gun. I would say that those who are on the terrorist watch list, whom we do not allow to fly on airplanes because of fear that they could do harm to others, shouldn't be allowed to buy guns in the United I want to add a provision that straw purchasers--the girlfriends with no criminal record who buy the weapons to give to the boyfriends with a long criminal record--ought to have the book thrown at them. Let's get to work.  I want to thank the victims and advocates who have worked for many years to help reduce the epidemic of gun violence. I want them to know we stand with them, and I hope we can all stand with them on a bipartisan basis.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

1111,topic-id,590,"Mr.President, I rise with a heavy heart to pay tribute to Chicago Police Commander Paul Bauer, who gave his life to protect the city he loved. We use the word ``hero'' far too often, but in this case, that word is fitting. Commander Paul Bauer is a true American hero, and his loss is a tragedy.  On February 13, Commander Bauer was at an ``active shooter'' training session in downtown Chicago, but he didn't hesitate to help out his fellow officers when they were pursuing a fleeing suspect. Commander Bauer was shot several times by the suspect and died from his wounds. Commander Bauer's story is a reminder to us all that our heroes serving in blue risk their lives every day, and even routine calls can turn into tragedy in an instant.  A 31-year veteran of the Chicago Police Department and the commander of the 18th Police District in the Near North Side, Paul Bauer was a pillar of that community. Last year, he was commended by the city council for a charity holiday party he helped host for underprivileged kids. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said it best: ``This department didn't just lose an exemplary police officer. The City lost a piece of itself.''  Last week, when the charges were announced against the alleged shooter, an impromptu memorial developed outside the Thompson People brought flowers, left crosses, and displayed signs reading, ``RIP CDR Bauer.'' One woman on her lunch break even left a plush stuffed dog that she hoped would make it in to the arms of Paul's teenage daughter. It was a tremendous show of love, respect, and gratitude.  A few years ago, I gave a commencement address and asked the students to think about what they wanted people to say about their lives. I asked them, ``What will you be remembered for? What service did you render to your community? Your nation? You world?'' The great thing about living in America is we can choose the answers to those questions. Commander Bauer will be remembered for is his service to his community. He gave what Lincoln called, ``the last full measure of devotion'' and did so for the people and city he loved and served, but he will be remembered for so much more. A friend described Paul as ``every bit the good guy he's being made out to be,'' but also added: ``You can't capture his goodness.'' What a beautiful legacy.  For all Paul Bauer's professional accomplishments, the highlights of his life were his family. Paul met his wife, Erin, met at a fundraiser for a Chicago police officer who was also killed in the line of duty. The Friday following Paul's death, February 16, would have been the couple's 16th anniversary. Together, Paul and Erin raised a bright and wonderful 13-year-old daughter Paul's family will carry on his legacy of love and his devotion to service and community.  Commander Bauer was the quintessential officer, a role model in his department and his bravery inspires the rest of us, especially his friends and family. After his memorial service Commander Bauer's wife, Erin, sent a touching message to all who paid tribute to her husband. She wrote: ``One man almost stole my faith in humanity, but the City of Chicago and the rest of the nation restored it, and I want to thank you for that.''  We are all humbled by her strength, and our thoughts and prayers are with Erin, Grace and all who loved and knew Commander Paul Bauer was one of our best.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-26-pt1-PgS1212-3.txt,326,RACISM AND POVERTY 50 YEARS AFTER THE KERNER,2018.0,26.0,February

1350,topic-id,2696,"Mr.President, today is the day--March 5--the deadline imposed by President Trump on those who are being protected and allowed to stay in the United States under the DACA  It was last September 5 when President Trump's Attorney General held a press conference and said: That is it. The protection that is currently given to 780,000 young people in America to allow them to stay in this country and pursue their dreams will end on March 5 of 2018--today--780,000 who were brought to the United States as infants, toddlers, children, and teenagers, who have lived their lives in this country, who have gone to school, who have never had a serious run-in with the law, who have gone through criminal background checks, come up with $500 filing fees, and who were given permission under an Executive order by President Obama to legally stay in this country for 2 years at a time. During that period, they would not be deported, and they would be allowed to work.  Who are these young people? They are known as the Dreamers, although President Trump hates that term. They are known as the Dreamers because they represent young people who went to school in America, stood up in their classroom every day and pledged allegiance to that flag. This is the only country they have ever known. This was to be the country of their future, but at some point in their lives, a member of their family sat down and said: We have to have a serious conversation. You see, we never filed the papers when we brought you to this country as an infant, and right now you are undocumented in the United States of  What that means is that any minute, there could be a knock on the door and you and perhaps your entire family would be asked to leave. I introduced a bill called the DREAM Act 17 years ago. Senator Hatch was my cosponsor when I introduced it. The purpose of the DREAM Act was to say to these young people: We will give you a chance. Though you are illegal in the eyes of the law in the United States--undocumented--we will give you a chance to earn your way to legal status, give you a chance someday to be a citizen of the United It will not be easy. There is no helping hand for you. If you want to go to college, there will be no Federal assistance for you. You are going to have to make it on your own. You will have to work and work harder than perhaps the person sitting next to you at their desk in high school. See if you can do it. If you can, we will give you your chance.  That is what the DREAM Act said. It passed with a majority vote in the Senate many times, but it never quite made it to 60 votes, which it needs to become the law of the land.  President Obama, when he was a Senator in this Chamber, was my colleague from He cosponsored the DREAM Act with me. So the time came when he was elected President, and I wrote him a letter. Dick Lugar, Republican of Indiana, joined me in that letter. He supported the DREAM Act when he served in the We wrote to President Obama and said: Can you do anything to give these young people a chance, to spare them from deportation? He worked on it for 1 year. Then President Obama came up with something called DACA, a program by Executive order that gave these young people their chance--780,000 of them went through the background check, paid their filing fee, and proved they were eligible.  They were spared for 2 years at a time and allowed to stay in this country. During the course of the campaign, President Trump said many strong words about immigration. We remember them well--it is hard to forget--the words about the wall, words about Mexican rapists, on and on, but he seemed to have a soft spot in his heart for these kids. Many times he would say: We have to give them a chance. They are different.  The very first time I met President Donald Trump was minutes after he had been sworn in. It was at a luncheon here in the  I went up to him and said: I want to thank you for the kind words you said about the Dreamers and those protected by  He said: Dick, don't worry about those kids. We are going to take care of those kids.  That is what President Trump said on January 20, 2017. I brought it up to him several times too. It is an issue that is important to me, but, more importantly, it is an issue that is critical to the future of these young people.  Then, what happened on September 5 of last year, just 9 months after the President was sworn in? His Attorney General held a press conference and said: That is the end of the protection for these young people. As of March 5, 2018, no protection.  Then he challenged He said: Pass a law. Do what you are supposed to do here in the House and Pass a law that will protect these young people.  A number of us took up the President's challenge. We had a bipartisan effort, six of us--three Democrats and three Republicans--and we worked through some really hard issues on immigration and on these young people. I want to salute my colleagues who were part of that: Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina; Jeff Flake, a Republican of Arizona; Cory Gardner, a Republican of Colorado; joined with myself and Michael Bennet, a Democrat of Colorado; Bob Menendez, a Democrat of New Jersey, and we put together an approach that gave these young people protection and a fighting chance to prove they deserve to stay in  We felt pretty good about it. The President called a meeting in the White House on January 9--I remember these dates. I will always remember them--with about 25 Members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, House and He held an open press conference for an hour, which is unusual and rarely done in the White  We talked about DACA and we talked about Dreamers and we talked about[[Page S1327]]what was going to happen next, since the President had given us a deadline of today, March 5, to do something.  The President outlined what he wanted to see, and then he said in front of the television cameras: Send me the bill, and I will sign it. I will take the heat on this one. That was January 9. So a number of us, the six I mentioned earlier, came together immediately that same day and said: Let's finish this bill, and let's get it in his hands as quickly as possible.  By January 11, 2 days later, we were ready. We reached a compromise, and it truly was a compromise. Parts of it I didn't care for at all, but that is what we do around here if Democrats and Republicans are going to produce something that might become a law. We called the We met the President--Senator Graham and I and a number of others, and he totally rejected what we had done. In fact, the President went on to reject five other bipartisan proposals to try to solve this problem.  This is the same President who said on January 9 of this year, ``Send me a bill, and I will sign it,'' who turned down bipartisan option after bipartisan option. He just said no.  We had a vote on the floor of the It has been about 3 weeks ago now. It was a vote on four different proposals to deal with this challenge. Not one of those proposals received 60 votes.  The one I had hoped for, a bill with a version of the Dream Act, was put together by Senator Coons and Senator McCain and brought to the floor. I remember it had 52 votes. It needed 60 votes. It fell short. The bipartisan compromise led by Senator Rounds and Senator King with the President's opposition ended up with 54 votes--6 votes short of what it needed to pass. Then the President's own immigration proposal came up here on the floor of the Now, there are 49 Democrats and 51 Republicans in the The President's proposal came up and got 39 votes--60 votes in opposition. It was a rejection by his own party and the Democrats in the  So here we are on March 5. The deadline is here. No bill has passed the The House will not even consider the measure--will not take up any version of the measure. What is at stake? There are 780,000 young people protected by DACA, which officially, by President Trump's order, ends today.  They have one ray of hope, perhaps two. Two courts have said they are going to suspend this abolition of DACA until we hear the arguments of the President's authority in the So there is a temporary--and I underline temporary--injunction in place while these cases are pending, but I can tell you as a Member of the Senate and as a lawyer, no one--no one--can predict how long that protection will last. Is it a matter of days or weeks or months, at best?  That is what these young people live with, this uncertainty.  This humanitarian crisis in this country--and I call it that--was created by President Trump on September 5. He has failed to agree to six different bipartisan proposals to solve the problem he created, and now these lives hang in the balance.  Well, who are they? Who are these young people?  I was with one of them earlier today. Her name is Ana Ana grew up in Aurora, IL, and went to the public schools there. She is a very bright young woman who was brought to the United States at the age of 5 from Mexico by her parents. She is undocumented in America and lives under the protection of  What did she do with her life?  She went to the Illinois Institute of Technology, one of the best in the Nation, and she won a civil engineering degree there. Clark Dietz is an engineering firm in Illinois that stepped up and said: We want that bright young woman on our staff as an engineer, and they hired her.  I met her for the first time today. She is a wonderful person. She struggled against the odds all of her life. She is protected by DACA, a program that officially, under President Trump's edict, ends today.  Will Illinois be a better State, Chicago be a better city, the United States be a better nation with this young lady and her engineering talents at work for us? Of course, there is no question about it. Why in the world would we ever want to deport someone who has gone through our educational system and excelled like this young lady?  She is not the only one, by any means. This is a photo of Elizabeth She is the 109th Dreamer whom I have spoken about on the floor of the U.She was brought to the United States at the age of 7. She grew up in Yonkers, As a child, she heard about STEM subjects--science, technology, engineering, and math. She decided to make that her life's work. She excelled in math and science and decided she would be part of the future of this country and took on these important subjects. She said: ``From that point forward I made pursuing a career in STEM my responsibility, as an American.''  During high school, Elizabeth was a member of the Honor Society, the Key Club, the Architecture, Construction and Engineering She was editor of the yearbook and also played on the volleyball team. She graduated high school with an Advanced Regents diploma.  She was then accepted into the Honors College at City University, New York City  Remember, these Dreamers--these undocumented students--don't qualify for Federal assistance to go to school as most kids do. They have to find another way to work and save their money or take private loans.  She received a Community Service Award from the School of Engineering 4 years in a row for her work organizing engineering education programs for low-income students. She received a Student Leader Award for her work with an engineering student association. She was named Volunteer of the Year 4 years in a row for managing the Manhattan robotics competition.  I have seen those robotics competitions. A lot of young people in high school do some amazing things in these competitions, and it launches a career and a life in the STEM subjects.  Elizabeth graduated with a double major in mechanical engineering and political science. She worked as an engineer for Samsung for 2 years. Then she founded a nonprofit organization focused on creating funding opportunities for early stage technology startups. Today, Elizabeth's nonprofit has over 700 members. To date, they have raised over $8 million to grow their companies.  She wrote me a letter and Elizabeth said:       To me DACA is my opportunity to give back to the United      States and my family the way I dreamed of since I was 10      years old. It's the ability to help solve the STEM talent      shortage after 15 years of preparing for it and being told it      was impossible. It's the power to say ``No'' to going back to      the shadows and ``Yes'' to serving as a role model for young      girls across the country who aspire to be engineers and      entrepreneurs.  People like Elizabeth are the reason why more than 400 business leaders signed a letter to Congress urging us to pass the bipartisan Dream  The letter says:       Dreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our      economy. With them, we grow and create jobs. They are part of      why we will continue to have global competitive advantage.  It would be a personal tragedy for us to deport Elizabeth Vilchis, but the decision of President Trump to abolish the program that protects her, sadly, makes that a possibility. If this injunction by the court is lifted, at that moment, there could be a knock on her door--or perhaps on the door of the company that hires her or her engineering firm--and she could be told that her time is up. Under President Trump, she has to leave the United States of  President Trump created this crisis. Instead of working toward a solution, he has rejected every bipartisan effort that has been sent his way to save the  What will happen next? Do we have to stand by and watch as these families are divided, as talented young people like Elizabeth and Ana are deported? Is that what we are all about? Is that what the President meant when he told me ``We'll take care of those kids''? That is what it has come down to.  It is a sad reality that all across America, hundreds of thousands of these young people now live in fear of deportation. They should be living, as Elizabeth said, outside the shadows and[[Page S1328]]as part of America and its future. What can we do about it? I am at a loss.  Unless and until this President accepts the responsibility to help us solve the problem he created, I am afraid we will never be able to rally the necessary Republican votes to make this a reality. It is up to President  In the part of the world that I come from in the Middle West, there is a saying that I am going to clean up a little bit, and it goes something like this: Any old mule can kick down a barn door, but it takes a carpenter to build one. This President has kicked down DACA, kicked it down to the dirt, and this is the day--the deadline that he set. The question is, Does he have the will or the heart to rebuild it?

1407,topic-id,1422,"Mr.President, like all great cities, Chicago is a city of neighborhoods, and one of its most storied neighborhoods is an enclave on the South It is called Bronzeville was born a century ago, during the first wave of the Great Migration, when tens of thousands of African Americans left the oppression of Jim Crow laws and lynching in the Deep South and headed north, to Chicago, in search of industrial jobs. By 1920, Bronzeville was home to so many African-American-owned businesses that it took on a prestigious new moniker: ``Black Metropolis.''  Among the famous African Americans who called Bronzeville home were Ida Wells, journalist, civil rights activist, and cofounder of the NAACP; Bessie Coleman, the first African-American woman pilot; and Rube Foster, founder of the Negro National Baseball League, the league that gave America such greats as Josh Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, and the legendary Satchel  Black History Month, which America celebrates each February, also has its roots in It began as a modest proposal, but it seemed revolutionary at the time. In 1926, the distinguished historian and journalist Carter Woodson launched America's first Negro History  Carter Woodson, the ``father of Black history,'' had earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Chicago in 1908. He had gone on to become only the second African American ever--after W.E.DuBois--to earn a doctorate from Harvard Years of studying history convinced Carter Woodson that the contributions of African Americans were, in his words, ``overlooked, ignored, and even suppressed by the writers of history textbooks and the teachers who use them.'' The result, he believed, was an incomplete and inaccurate account of history that perpetuated racial inequality and stunted the dreams of many African So Carter Woodson made it his life's mission to fill in the missing chapters in America's history books. He returned to Chicago often, almost always staying in Bronzeville at the Wabash YMCA, the first African-American Y in the United  In 1915 in Chicago, he and four other African-American historians founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, later renamed the ``Association for the Study of African American Life and History.'' In 1916, the association began publishing The Journal of Negro History, ``particularly targeted those responsible for the education of black children.''  Woodson chose the second week in February to mark Negro History Week--to commemorate the birthdays of the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass and the ``Great Emancipator'' Abraham  In the 1970s, Negro History Week became Black History  As we near the end of this year's Black History Month, I want to tell you about an amazing woman from the Chicago area who is making history today by helping to free women and children from modern-day slavery. Her name is Marian Hatcher, and she follows in the footsteps of two earlier ``she-roes'' of American history: Sojourner Truth and Harriet  Sojourner Truth was born in upstate New York in 1797, three decades before that State abolished slavery. She was separated from her family at 9, and she was bought and sold four times before escaping to freedom with her infant daughter in 1826.  She began her life as a free woman working first as an itinerant preacher. She later became an outspoken advocate for abolition, civil rights, and women's rights. When the Civil War broke out, Sojourner Truth urged young men to join the Union cause and organized supplies for Black troops. For her efforts, she was invited to meet President Lincoln in the White House in 1864.  After the war, Sojourner Truth moved to Washington, DC to work with the Freedmen's Bureau, helping freed slaves find jobs and build new lives. In the mid-1860s--90 years before the Montgomery bus boycott--a Washington streetcar conductor tried violently to block her from riding his car. Sojourner Truth insisted that he be arrested and tried.  Harriet Tubman was born in Maryland to enslaved parents around 1820--the youngest of nine children. She escaped to freedom in the North in 1949 and became one of the most famous and fearless ``conductors'' on the Underground She risked her life repeatedly to return to the South and lead hundreds of slaves, including her own parents, to freedom.  Harriet Tubman risked her life again during the Civil War to work as a Union Army cook and nurse--and later as an armed scout and spy. Many called her Moses for her fierce courage in leading others out of bondage.  Marian Hatcher is a sort of modern-day Like Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman, she knows the pain and despair that comes from being bought and sold like a commodity. For 2 years, she was trafficked for sex by a violent pimp. And like Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman, Marian Hatcher escaped her bondage, and she has dedicated her life to helping other trafficked persons regain their freedom and dignity.[[Page S1280]]  Let me tell you about this incredible woman. Marian Hatcher grew up in a home with loving, supportive parents. She earned a finance degree from Loyola She was married and had five children. But Marian also had painful secrets, including a history of childhood sexual abuse, untreated depression, and a husband--a former Vice Lords gang member--who beat her.  Marian started smoking crack to ease her pain. When she could no longer stand the beatings from her husband, she left her family and survived for 2 years by working as a prostitute. Her pimp gave her crack so she wouldn't return to her family. On Mother's Day, he gave her extra crack because she grieved so deeply for the children she had left behind.  During those 2 years on the street, Marian was beaten and raped more times than she can count. She was in and out of jail repeatedly. As she says, ``I tried to smoke enough crack to bust my heart, but God would not let me die. He had another plan for me.''  That plan began to unfold in 2004, when Marian was arrested again--this time for violating probation on a drug charge. She expected to be treated like a criminal. Instead, in the Cook County jail, Marian Hatcher found the compassion and care she needed to begin to heal from her trauma and rebuild her life.  The Cook County Women's Rehabilitative Alternative Probation, WRAP, Drug Court--one of the Nation's most successful drug courts--took a chance on A judge there sentenced Marian to a jail-based, therapeutic treatment designed specifically for women struggling with trauma and substance abuse. When Marian was released 18 months later, she began working as a volunteer with that same program. She was so good that the Cook County Sheriffs Office hired her to work full time at the jail. She has never left.  Fourteen years later, Marian Hatcher has been promoted five times. She is now coordinator of the Cook County Sheriff's Office pioneering efforts to combat human trafficking, and she is one of America's leading experts on how to help victims of sex trafficking to escape that life and heal from the trauma. On behalf of her boss, Cook County sheriff Tom Dart, she has recruited a network of more than 100 law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, as well as research and nonprofits groups, to work together to reduce the demand for sex trafficking and prostitution.  Like Sojourner Truth, she is also an ordained minister.  Her work has won acclaim and respect. Marian Hatcher received a Presidential Achievement Award from President Barack Oprah has told her story. She has spoken on human trafficking at the United Nations and participated in President Jimmy Carter's summit to end trafficking globally. And just before Christmas, the Governor of Illinois granted Marian Hatcher clemency for offenses in her old life--official recognition of her tireless work to break the chains of bondage for others.  I have introduced a bill to expand the availability of trauma-informed care for survivors of gun violence and other forms of trauma and toxic stress. Marian Hatcher's remarkable redemption is proof that such care can help to heal shattered lives and help break the cycle of recidivism that too often results from untreated childhood trauma.  Like Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman, Marian Hatcher struggles with chronic, painful health conditions as the result of the beatings and abuse she endured. She also lives with multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia, and she is a cancer survivor. There are days when every step she takes hurts. But she never stops working to end the modern-day slavery that is sex trafficking. I respect her greatly and am proud to tell her story during this Black History month.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-28-pt1-PgS1279.txt,326,RACISM AND POVERTY 50 YEARS AFTER THE KERNER,2018.0,28.0,February
1530,topic-id,514,"Mr.President, last week, rainstorms and melting snow caused flooding across Illinois, with more than 20 counties throughout the State placed under a flood warning. As the water level of rivers continued to rise, several communities had to evacuate their homes for their own safety. Sadly, these storms were so severe that flooded roadways claimed the life of an Illinois resident after her car rolled into a rain-filled ditch. Multiple communities were evacuated, and in some areas, residents had to be rescued by boat.  Some of the worst impacted areas were in Iroquois, Kankakee, and Vermilion The Governor declared a State disaster for these counties, and the American Red Cross established shelters for evacuated residents.  These floods were not just limited to communities in east central Counties in western and downstate Illinois were also among the most impacted. In Ford Heights, a suburb of Chicago, at least 100 homes were impacted and seven residents were rescued by boat. In north central Illinois, a nursing home in LaSalle County had to be evacuated, and the next day, parts of the county were placed under mandatory evacuation order.  Downstate, rain continued through the weekend, and crews from the Department of Corrections worked to install flood gates in Hardin County, and the Department of Transportation delivered pumps, hoses, and sandbags to aid in recovery. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources also provided boats to aid with flood patrols.  Some of the areas that experienced heavy rains and flooding throughout last week, like Freeport in northwestern Illinois, were also impacted by flooding just last year. Freeport was flooded in July 2017, and on Friday night, the Red Cross once again opened an emergency shelter there. Situations like this are the reason that communities that often experience flooding need more assistance, both to plan for emergencies and to quickly mitigate the aftermath.  With extreme weather conditions like these becoming more frequent and more severe, I have heard from many Illinois constituents who are concerned about their ability to recover from repeated flood events like these. I stand ready to assist at the Federal level to help these communities rebuild and recover in a way that will allow them to be more resilient when the next flood occurs.  As is often the case when a disaster like this occurs, I was so impressed with the residents, first responders, and local officials who worked tirelessly to protect their communities. I want to thank our local law enforcement--firefighters and police--who always do the best job to keep our communities safe and work long hours because of it.  I also want to recognize the hard work of the State and Federal employees that have pitched in at every level, including the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Natural Resources, and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency.[[Page S1238]]  Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the Illinois resident who lost her life and with all those who have experienced damage to their homes and other property. We will rebuild--as the people of Illinois always do--and will once again be stronger for it.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-27-pt1-PgS1237-2.txt,326,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1865, ALLOW STATES AND VICTIMS TO",2018.0,27.0,March
164,topic-id,4242,"Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from California for yielding. I appreciate all of the work Congressman DeSaulnier does in this area. And I want to thank him for raising this particular issue for this Special  Madam Speaker, I agree with him that inequality is the issue of the moment. Not only does inequality funnel money from working Americans up to the richest people, but what do they do with the money once it is up there? There is only a certain number of boats you can ski behind, only a certain number of houses you can buy, and only a certain number of luxury cars you can buy.  What do the billions go to? Much of it goes to things like merger and acquisition, and also political influence. It is very important to understand that as economic inequality has grown, political inequality has also grown. Nowadays, the money goes into some super-PAC: some big, giant thing where they do independent expenditures and pour money in against their enemies and pour money in in favor of their friends.  Politics in America has become the battle of the billionaires now. You have to get a billionaire on your side in order to win. I mean, we know that whether it is the Coates', or the Mercers, or the Adelsons, or whoever it is, it is some big, rich person who is going to sponsor a political candidate, and that is who gets to represent us in what is supposed to be a democratic society. So I think that it is critical to make the link between economic inequality and political inequality.  I will say again, when we get economic inequality to the degree that it is, one of the other things that is purchased, besides political influence, is mergers and acquisitions.  I would just like to point out to everybody that it doesn't matter what industry you are talking about, markets are deeply concentrated and anticompetitive. If you are talking about like a pharmacy--not a pharmaceutical company, but a pharmacy--CVS, Walgreens, we used to have Rite Aid and, of course, they merged together. And, of course, there is another merger coming up. Every day you open the paper, there is some other big company buying up some other big company, concentrating markets, making the barriers to entry even higher so that the small-business person is just locked out.  It costs a lot to get into business now. If your opponent, who is some big, huge company, doesn't want you in the market, they can just drop their prices, suffer the losses, because they are big, run you out of business, and raise them right back on up.  But if you look at any market--beer, hamburger, chicken, online search engines, anything you want--almost all of them are deeply concentrated--two, three, maybe four--companies representing 80 or 90 percent of the industry, which cuts off opportunity, limits competition, and it is bad for the American people.  Madam Speaker, I have a few more things to share, but I will kick it back to Congressman DeSaulnier for now. Maybe he can kick it back to me a little later, and we will just have a conversation for a little while.  Mr.Madam Speaker, that sounds good to me.  Madam Speaker, I do want to say, as a former small-business owner, having owned restaurants in the San Francisco Bay area for many years, I can definitely identify with your comments that all too often Main Street America, those entrepreneurs who employ most of our workers, are at a distinct disadvantage.                              {time}  1730  And, unfortunately, I always felt this as a small independent restaurant owner, that the desires of a lot of my fellow restaurateurs that were nationally owned were not necessarily my desires. I supported the community. I was[[Page H3132]]active in the community. I was in the Rotary or went to Rotary, was very active. They didn't have that kind of Main Street presence.  I do think that we have deserted that kind of--we collectively, I think, in this body, have all too often deserted that constituency, which is so much a part of not just our economy, but our culture in  Ben Franklin, when he started, went through and was trained by his father and his older brother. Somewhat controversially, he came to Philadelphia and walked down the street and started a business.  So, to your point, I think that is really important, that when you look at the fabric of America, what this inequality talks about--and as we go through this, it will sound from somewhat of an academic perspective because we have listened to the experts. We have listened to experts, particularly in my area in northern California at Berkeley and Stanford, but we have gone to others.  This presentation will be about what the economic history and what the economics are telling us so that everyone can accept this in terms of the historical record and the facts as Thomas Piketty put in his best selling economics book, very dry, ``Capital in the Twenty-First Century,'' which I take a lot of my influence from.  When the majority was going through their tax reform bill, I happened to pick up a compilation of economists--it was very broad, from their ideological perspective--called, ``After Piketty''; and as I was reading this, I already knew this, and I thought this tax plan is probably the worst medicine to give this environment because it will only make it worse, in my view, based on a hopeful thought that all of this will trickle down from the wealthiest.  We know that in an economy like the United States, where 70, 75 percent of it is consumer driven, you need people to spend money. Myself, as a small-business person, if people didn't have disposable income to come in my door to pay for the food, I couldn't pay my employees. I couldn't do all the things I wanted to do to engage in the community. So this is the fabric of the American economy, but it is really about the fabric of the American culture and what we want for our kids.  One of the most disturbing things is being a baby boomer and the parent of two sons in their thirties and to see their struggles as they do well and play by the rules and do as is required of them. What we are passing on, my generation and future generations, is not just the challenge of a prospectively lower life expectancy, but all the despair we see in too many communities in this country that this last election, according to the ultimate winner in the Presidential campaign, was about reaching them.  Over a quarter into his term, I defy anyone to say where the average person in multiple communities is seeing a benefit, and this is going to be a challenge.  So I put up here, there have been many famous admonitions through history, starting with Plato and Aristotle, about this issue, about the inequality issue of humans treating other humans. The first one I would like to point out because it comes from Adam Smith--Adam Smith, who wrote ``The Wealth of Nations,'' the great Scottish political economist whom many people in the Chicago school and people who believe in this idea of trickle-down economics look to and the invisible hand that he so famously wrote about.  But the quote on the top here, I think, is a very clear demonstration of his view in the late 1700s in spite of his perspective on many things, and it is the first quote on the chart: ``The disposition to admire, and almost to worship, the rich and the powerful, and to despise, or, at least, to neglect persons of poor and mean condition is the great and most universal cause of the corruption of our moral sentiments''--Adam  The second quote is from someone whom we are all familiar with. A great American, a great Republican progressive, Teddy Roosevelt, said: ``The man of great wealth owes a peculiar obligation to the state because he derives special advantages from the mere existence of government,'' a quote rooted in a passage from Luke in the  That passage says and is quoted often in our political discourse: ``To whom much is given, much is required.'' That is part of what Jesus of Nazareth said when he was giving his gospels on the mountain as part of the Sermon on the Mount or prelude to that.  And the last quote, I think, is very demonstrative for the situation we are in and leading up to these next elections both in 2018 and 2020. The great jurist, the first Jewish American to be a member of the U.Supreme Court, Louis Brandeis, said: ``We can either have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.''  With that, I would like to briefly go through four charts that I think are visually demonstrative of the problem we are exposed to, and I would like people who are watching to particularly look at the timeframe on the graphs.  So it has been talked about going back to when America was great. These charts will demonstrate that this period of time, that a lot of us who had parents who fought in World War II, grandparents who fought in World War I, heard their stories about that national commitment in both those instances and in both generations.  I grew up in a household outside of Lowell, Massachusetts, hearing my French-Canadian grandparents and my Irish grandparents talking about coming to Lowell, Massachusetts, to work in those textile mills for the opportunity to improve their lives and the lives of their kids.  Indirectly, of course, I benefited from that, because their kids were the first kids in their family who went to college, my parents. But they had to endure World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II, a transformative period of time that then led to what some economists will now say was really a unique period of time where there was great economic growth after the war, during the Eisenhower administration and after that, Truman through Eisenhower and beginning with Roosevelt, where everybody was benefiting.  So this great consumer economy was a benefit to everyone sharing the wealth and the historical disparities that we have come to from outside that.  So if you want to go back to the best world, the best parts of that world, acknowledging that America had real challenges there around race, and continues to have, that had to be addressed. We had real challenges around sex and sexism that had to be addressed. There were other issues about things that we needed to deal with in this country that are urgent, and we have dealt with since that time. So I don't want to make it sound like everything was wonderful. We had our challenges.  One of the great things about this country, as so many people have said, is we acknowledge our weaknesses, but we address them and aspire to move on. I would say we are at one of those points where we are particularly challenged in that regard.  So, if we could go to the first of these charts, in particular, I want you to look at the dates, because this will be consistent in the four diagrams we are going to bring up. The dates starting on the far left in the early periods, the 1920s, which actually was the gilded age, and then through to 2013.  So this particular chart talks about inequality and that historical perspective. In the United States, right now, income inequality has grown rapidly by every statistical measure for 30 years. America's top 10 percent--and this is not class warfare. This is a discussion of what the statistics tell us and what that implies for our democracy and the benefit that we all should derive as it is written in our sacred creeds in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and also in our other great commentary.  So America's top 10 percent, approximately 32 million people, now average more than nine times as much income as the bottom 90 percent, or about 293 million people. Think of that. The top 10 percent, 32 million people, many of them got their wealth from talent and good work. Some of them have not had as much talent and hard work, and that is human nature.  But because of the policies that we have passed--and as my friend from Minnesota has alluded to, the influence in politics, in our election process, that is more extreme than it has ever been[[Page H3133]]in the history of this country. It has always been there. It has always been part of our dynamic.  Being from California, there is a famous quote from a former speaker of the State assembly that money was the mother's milk of politics, sort of a day-to-day look as a working politician, but now we are at extreme, extreme levels.  Independent expenditures, to what my friend from Minnesota talked about, in the Supreme Court decisions around Citizens United and SpeechNOW, two decisions in 2010, have created a world that this country has never seen before, where the Supreme Court decided in those two decisions by a 5-4 majority that the American public and their representatives had very limited ability to put any kind of controls over what is called independent expenditures. Those are funds that are written. And the one condition is those people who are doing that cannot communicate or be in party with the campaigns.  You can go and see how that has dramatically changed in the last cycles and will continue to get worse in this next cycle. This last cycle, the Presidential cycle, it got up to, I believe, just about $9 billion of independent expenditures that are largely not held accountable.  So next, America's top 1 percent, roughly 3.2 million people, averaged 40 times more than the bottom 90 percent. America's top 1 percent, or one-tenth of a percent, or roughly 325,000 people, average over 198 times the income of the bottom 90 percent, or roughly 293 million people.  The top 1 percent of America's income earners have more than doubled their share of the Nation's income since the mid 20th century. This is the period post-World War The incomes of the top 1 percent peaked last during the 1920s, during the start of the Great So you can see this again, the concentration.  Again, people will start pounding their chest and saying: ``You are starting class warfare.'' The numbers speak for themselves. These numbers are driven and they are attributed--if people at home want to see where we got these numbers so they are not driven by fake news, they are driven by impartial, nonpartisan constituencies. And the point is just to say that we have got a problem.  So, again, at the last peak, this gave us great social displacement, gave us, arguably, the conditions that created World War I, definitely gave us the conditions that gave us the Great Depression, gave us the conditions, fortunately, that led to Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal, and through this sweet period where the economy was growing by 5, 6 percent, and it was generating benefit across all demographics and did what Henry Ford said when he started making his Model He said:       I want a product that is a quality product that my workers      can afford, so I want to pay my workers enough to pay for      this car.  This is the sweet spot that people talk about going back to.  Now we are here. Well, if history is right and taught us anything, and what Piketty talks about in a very classic economic historian view and his view of Western democracy and economic trends, his view is these are inevitable.  This is my perspective, of course. I am not trying to put words in Piketty's mouth.  But this was sort of an anomaly, when you look through Western economic industry, according to Piketty, which was the best-selling economics book in modern history.  So that would make one wonder what comes after this, and what Piketty suggests and others suggest is there is a correction. And the question, I think, we have for this time in our history is: What kind of correction is that going to be? Is it going to be the correction that we want in this House, this sanctum sanctorum of democracy, the House of Representatives, where we battle it out, we express ourselves and our ideologies, our perspectives--our constituencies have very different world views--but we acknowledge that this is not right, this is a problem, and this is not America as we envision it or our great leaders envisioned it, whether it was Washington or Lincoln?  Lincoln once famously said:       If wages and capital are not equal, if they become      different, then we have lost democracy. And if capital, in      particular, gets beyond wages, we have really lost democracy.  And he also cryptically said:       I have the Confederate Army in front of me, but I have the      northern banks behind me, and, honestly, I fear the latter      the more.  There is nothing wrong with capital; there is nothing wrong with investment; but, from a historical perspective, this is not a healthy economy. We want a mix, and we want everybody to enjoy it.  So just to go on, between 1992 and 2002, the 400 highest incomes--that is, individuals--reported more than double, even after the dot.com bubble burst. So, corrections, they still increased more. The benefit of the recoveries after the dot.com bust and after the recession benefited, again, this disparity, the people at the top end of the spectrum. Since 1979, the before-tax incomes of the top 1 percent of America's households increased more than four times faster than the bottom 20 percent.  Through much of this introductory part, we have been talking more about everybody in the middle income, but it has really disadvantaged poor people.                              {time}  1745  So when we talk about doing away with healthcare or Social Services or food stamps, it is really a cruel, sort of Dickens type of bargain where people who are already suffering will suffer more.  CEO compensation. With the unions playing a smaller role than they did decades ago--and, during this period, during the Eisenhower administration, in particular, almost a third of American workers were in a union--it was the glory days of America; but it was also the glory days, and this wasn't a coincidence, of American workers having a voice in American economy and with their employers, where they partnered.  So since then, CEO compensation and average workers have changed. With unions playing a smaller role, down to 11 percent from almost 35 percent, than they did decades ago, the gap between CEOs and workers was eight times larger in 2016 than 1980. Union participation has declined to 11 percent, as I said, from its peak in the 1940s and 1950s.  As of 2015, 100 CEOs--and I don't say that they don't have talent and capabilities, but this is just a historical fact. Since 2015, 100 CEOs had company retirement funds worth $4.7 billion, which is a sum equal to the entire retirement savings of the 41 percent of U.families with the smallest retirement funds. That is just the 41 percent that don't have retirement.  So imagine that; 100 individuals, who are supposed to be not just our economic captains, they are supposed to be our social and community captains, and they were once. In the 1970s, CEO compensation was roughly about four times the median income for their workers. So if you went to Ford or Motorola, there was a different corporate culture then, a feeling of social responsibility. It still exists, but it exists in this context: Now it is almost 300 times.  So when you look at large companies that are global, think of that, of their median global employees, this is the disparity. So it is just another thing that we should be cognizant of.  Retirement savings. Workers with employer 401(k) plans have a median balance of just $18,433.  So let's talk for a minute about paycheck income, and then I would like to ask if my colleague would like to jump back in. This will only take a second.  So paycheck income. We are talking about a few different things, but they all add up to the same thing. So what do you get? Your paycheck, if you are lucky enough to have investments in your home or in the stock market or in any other kind of investment.  Less than half of American workers actually have investments on Wall So when we look at Wall Street going up, this is the disparity between what we measure as helping the economy and what is happening on Main  So the average person on Main Street, who doesn't have any investment on Wall Street--and it is interesting. When Wall Street started to go down recently, it was because there were statistical reports from the Department of Labor that wages were finally coming up. It is not lost on me that Wall Street would be concerned[[Page H3134]]about inflation because wages are finally going up for American workers, which is obviously a problem.  Paycheck income. For more than three decades, wages have been stagnant. Typical American workers and the lowest-wage workers have seen little or no growth in their real weekly wages in that time. So when you consider cost of living, which is going up exponentially in areas like where I live, in the San Francisco Bay area, and these urban areas, like D.C., where young people are constantly moving to because that is where the jobs are, between 1979 and 2007, paycheck income of the top 1 percent of the U.earners exploded by over 256 percent; 256 percent for the top 1 percent, but stagnant for the rest of us.  While productivity has increased at a relative rate since 1948, since the 1970s, wages have not. So we are more productive than we have ever been. The American workforce is more productive, when we talk about these glory days, than they have ever been because they have accepted compromise and working with innovation to make us more productive.  We have put a second income into the household. The value of women coming into the workforce has made such a change, not just to our economy, but to our way of life. Unfortunately, as opposed to other industrialized countries, we haven't provided the infrastructure for usually the woman who comes into the workforce to replace their activities at home; so early education, high quality education, things like that, not to mention the fact of pay disparity between genders, which I will now go to.  American women are now almost as likely to work outside the home as men. So in 1973, 14 percent, if memory serves me right, of women with children were in the workforce full time; 1973. By 1994, that number had changed to 74 percent. So think of that in the context of social change; the benefit it gave us from having talented women being in the workforce and being more in the culture, but we didn't provide the infrastructure that they had provided, in my view, when they were at home raising kids and being part of the community. It was a good change for this country, but we didn't adapt to it from a public sector.  You look at the French and the Western Europeans, it didn't happen as dramatically there, but they provided the infrastructure, which we should here.  Women still make up only 27 percent of the top 10 percent of the labor income earners; so this is the glass ceiling. Among the top 1 percent of women, they make up slightly less than 17 percent of workers. At the top 1 percent level, a woman makes up only 11 percent.  Bonus pay. This is a big issue that has come in the last 20 years. In 2016, we were going to incentivize, or before that, during the Clinton administration, incentivize performance. Unfortunately, our performance wasn't tied enough to the benefit for everybody, the economy, the company, the investors. It was more skewed toward the investors.  So in 2016, Wall Street banks--this was 2016, just recently--doled out $24 billion in bonuses to 177,000 of largely New York Wall Street-based employees; $24 billion for 177,000 of America's 320-plus million people and 175 million workers. This is 1.6 times the combined earnings of all 175 million Americans who work full time at the Federal minimum wage of $7.25.  The CEO of McDonald's--when I was in the California Legislature when we were trying to raise minimum wage, we figured out they were fighting against raising it to $15 and indexing it for inflation, but the CEO's compensation was almost $35,000 an hour. I don't think his commitment or his quality to work was that different, and it wouldn't have been in the 1970s.  This bonus pool was large enough to have lifted all 3.2 million U.fast food workers or all home care aides or all restaurant servers and bartenders up to $15 an hour.  Madam Speaker, I will take a little break if it is appropriate and yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.Ellison).

165,topic-id,2122,"Madam Speaker, I definitely want to thank the gentleman for the important information he has shared with us tonight. Folks who are tuned in definitely, I believe, are interested in this topic. In fact, it is the thing that most people think about.  As I am here tonight, I would say, Madam Speaker, that we just celebrated, or shall I say we just memorialized the loss of Martin Luther King, which it was his 50th anniversary of his passing, of his assassination back on April 4. And just recently, this is the year that we passed the fair housing law in 1968, so it has been 50 years.  A lot of people, when they think of King, they think, oh, he helped African Americans defeat Jim Crow segregation, and that is true. That is one way to look at it.  But when he died, he was marching with sanitation workers who were paid so little they could not make ends meet. They weren't allowed to go into adequate shelter when it was raining, so two of them, one day, happened to go into the back of the garbage truck. The garbage truck had a malfunction, and those two men were crushed in the garbage truck, and so that initiated a strike which Martin Luther King came and joined two times, it being the last fight he was ever in.  Why do I bring up this point? Because we think of America as being more evolved since that time. We think, oh, we have got voting rights; we have gotten rid of discrimination. It is illegal now.  But I will tell you what. Despite the fact that we still are battling for racial equality, we have absolutely slipped backwards in the fight for economic empowerment for working people, no matter what their color.  In 1968, the Federal minimum wage, if it had been adjusted for inflation, would be about $11.62. But as the gentleman just mentioned, it is now $7.25. And the server minimum wage, the tip minimum wage is $2.13. People don't believe me when I say that, but it is $2.13.  How can it be legal to pay a server $2.13? They say, oh, they make it up in tips. Do they? What if their tips aren't given to them? What if there is wage theft, which happens all the time?  I want to thank the gentleman from California for mentioning that in 1968, the average CEO got paid about 20 times more than the average worker. Today, it is above 300 percent, 300 times. So the inequality has dramatically not just enriched the rich, it has made working and middle class and the working poor suffer.  There are--and this is a shocking statistic. There has been a 60 percent growth in people living under the Federal poverty guideline since 1968. That is wrong, and this tax bill that we just passed will do nothing other than make it all that much worse.  It is a cruel irony that, in the face of this spread, this gap that working people are experiencing relative to their richer fellow Americans, that we would say, oh, you know what we need to do? Give the rich people even more money.  Now, again, I am not anti-rich. I wouldn't mind being rich myself one day. But I do hope that if I ever were to be doing well financially, that I would not pull the ladder up, climb up the ladder and then pull it up so that people can't even follow me.  Wait a minute. That is exactly what they are doing. They are trying to take away the Affordable Care Act, which actually gave millions of people healthcare for the first time. They want to put work requirements on receiving Federal benefit and aid. They want to make it tougher to be working class and poor. It is outrageous.  I just want to wrap my own comments up tonight by just saying it doesn't have to be this way. Poverty is not something that simply happens like the weather. It is not a storm and, oh, boy, how did that ever happen? No, it is a series of decisions made by people who have political power, who advantage some and disadvantage others.  It is things that we do, and it is also things that we don't do. It is when we just let markets concentrate and don't engage in legitimate anti-trust action; and it is when we pass a tax bill that we know, before anything has happened, that 83 percent of the benefits will go to the top 1 percent. This is how you create massive inequality.  There are things we can do about it. I think we could start by passing a policy that links CEO pay to raises for workers. What if a CEO thinking about, you know, I am going to get my pay, I am going to get a big fat old bonus. Oh, okay. If I do that, I have got[[Page H3135]]to make sure my folks get some of this too. What if we passed a policy like that?  What if we said you couldn't deduct those bonuses off your taxes the way that they do now?  What if we actually said to ourselves, we are going to have a very high estate tax? I think that is fair enough. I mean, what did you do, other than negotiate a birth canal, to get all that money? I think that we should reward work, not just birth.  I think, what if we said we are going to make majo investments in public wealth? What do I mean by public wealth? Well, I don't know, the parks, the roads, the bridges, the transit, the schools. What if we invested in those public institutions that actually help everybody come up?  Even the rich folks can go to the public park. We don't ration that. We say it is something for all of us.  What if we said we are going to make sure that the right to join a union is a right that we are going to protect and defend, knowing that the fortunes of unions--when union density goes up, working class people do better. When union density goes down, working class people's wages stagnate and go down.  What if we lifted the minimum wage to a livable wage?  What if we had real consumer protection?  What if we said that everybody can go to the doctor?  I believe that we should have universal single-payer healthcare. That is my opinion, and I hope others join me.  What if we did things like looked at the labor policies that they have in some countries around the world?  Do you know, in Germany, Madam Speaker, that workers have to be on the board of the corporation if the corporation is above a certain size?                              {time}  1800  That makes sense. They certainly are affected by what the company does.  In Germany, if there is a slowdown, a recession, and that happens, everybody takes fewer hours rather than just laying off people who are just relegated to the unemployment lines, who see their skills deteriorate and who are just out of the workforce and it is hard to get back in.  What if we did these things? What if we said to ourselves that we were going to have a trade policy that really factored in how is this policy going to impact the local economy and workers? I definitely think trade is a good thing, but what if we thought about how it is going to impact this worker, these workers, this factory right here?  What if we got rid of the idea of right to work and said everybody in American can join a union?  This would make America a stronger country for working It would improve our economy. It would put money in the hands of working Americans, and it wouldn't stop people from getting rich if they got a great idea and made a lot of money. It wouldn't stop people from amassing any wealth, but what it would do is make sure that people at the middle and the bottom of the economy had a greater shot and a better share.  My Republican friends' vision for the economy is that, look, you know, here is how you have a good economy: You don't make rich people or big companies pay any taxes, and you shuffle all the property taxes and the sales taxes. You let those things be on the shoulders of the working folk. Then you don't spend on public institutions like public schools or anything. You just let those folks do the best they can.  If those kids aren't smart enough to be born to rich parents who send them to private school, forget about it. We are just going to underfund that, or we are going to do charters, and then we will let individuals own those schools and make money off of them.  Their idea of a business model is to smash the workers down, treat the workers like a cost, push their labor costs as far down as they can get it, and amass the wealth at the top as much as they can, allow stock buybacks, and don't regulate anybody, and don't have any rules of the game so that you get a free-for-all, and then when the economy finally goes bust, oh, you know, we just go back to John Taxpayer and Jane Taxpayer and make them bail them out.  Anyway, I think there is a better way. I think we can have a better economy. We can have a democracy. We can have an economy that allows for free enterprise and we can have a public sector that makes sure that liberty and justice and opportunity are for everyone, not just a few.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from Minnesota (Mr.Ellison) for his passion and his commitment.  I just want to mention a couple things before I turn it over to my incredible colleague from Connecticut, who brings such passion and real insight to these issues.  But as the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.Ellison) said about minimum wage, in the 1960s, if you worked a full-time job and you earned the Federal minimum wage with an average amount of overtime, you earned 55 percent of the median household income nationally.  So think of that. You could work a minimum wage job in the sixties, and you could have enough to earn at least half of what the rest of your citizens were doing. So you could pay for housing. You could get by.  I know there are a lot of things, but if we had indexed that for inflation this whole time, it would be very different.  And just a few statistics on extreme poverty, because Mr.Ellison brought this up.  So extreme poverty or absolute poverty is the definition by the economics profession. It is not limited to nations outside our borders. So we like to talk about the rest of the world has come up from $1 a day on average of these poor countries to $2 a day.  To my great chagrin and shock, 3.2 million people in the United States now live on under $2 a day. Think about that. The United States of America, 3.2 million people. This is extreme poverty that we often ascribe to very, very underdeveloped poor countries.  According to Oxford economist Robert Allen, absolute poverty in the United States is anything under $4 a day due to the costs.  Can you imagine trying to live on $4 a day. But, yes, over 3 million of our fellow citizens attempt to.  In comparison, let's say based on this, if you took the $4, then you go up to 5.3 million Americans are in this economic definition of absolutely poor by global standards. There are more people in absolute poverty in the United States than in Sierra Leone or  In comparison, zero percent of the populations of Germany, Iceland, Switzerland live in absolute poverty. Two-tenths of a percent of Great Britain and three-tenths of a percent of France live in absolute poverty, respectively.  So this is just the extreme that I think we have to hear about because too often we gloss over the issues in this Chamber of people who are really struggling, the absolutely poor, the very poor, the most vulnerable amongst us, while we correctly try to help everybody in the bottom 90 percent, particularly middle income, but we have got to help everyone.  With that, I yield to my wonderful fiend from Connecticut, who is such a passionate, determined, eloquent spokesperson in this Chamber for issues around poverty and inequality.

372,topic-id,344,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I also thank Chairman Smith and the ranking member for standing together on this important House Resolution 128.  It is true that Minnesota is home to a large number of people who find their roots in Ethiopia and are of the Oromo background.  These Minnesotans have made it very clear by reaching out to their elected representatives that while their feet are firmly planted on American soil, they still, like so many other Americans, have a heart and a sentiment where they want to support justice in the homeland that they came from. As a result, I have been able to get an education from my constituents about circumstances in Ethiopia which make this resolution necessary.  So I do rise in support of House Resolution 128, which calls on the Government of Ethiopia to make clear, concrete steps toward becoming inclusive, more democratic, more respectful of human rights of all of its citizens.  I would like to note that this is a bipartisan resolution, proving that we can come together for critical issues like human rights in Ethiopia for Americans who find their roots in Ethiopia and for people all over the world.  In Minnesota, as I noted, we are fortunate to be home to one of the largest Oromo and Ogaden communities in North America, and it is because of the relentless work of these folks that these issues have come to light. I thank them. Many of them are here today. They have been working on this issue for many years, Mr.Speaker, because it is that vitally important.  Now, as my colleagues have noted, Ethiopia is an important ally of the United States, that is a fact, but even allies must be held accountable when they violate the human rights of their people.

639,topic-id,729,"Mr.Speaker, Republican tax scam tax cuts really are only going to benefit giant corporations and the wealthy few, and what working people will ever glean from this is minimal in scope and really is just sort of a pittance in order to allow people who have more wealth than they can possibly even count to just get more.  This tax cut, this massive tax cut, would wipe away healthcare coverage for millions of workers, give multinational corporations and foreign investors a giant payday, and it paves the way for more cruel cuts, cutting programs that will benefit  It is a moral abomination. It is wrong. It is giving more to those who already have too much and taking from those who already are struggling to make ends meet. But, sadly, it is just another example of how Republicans and their billionaire buddies are in it for themselves and not the American people.  I would like to talk about another important example, because you have to look at what is going on in our Supreme Court together with these tax cuts and other programs to understand how much damage Republican leadership means to the American people.  Yesterday, the Supreme Court heard a case. It was Janus v. Janus, as the case is called, is yet another attack on the right to organize your workplace and negotiate for better wages and benefits and safer workplaces.  Over the last several decades, big companies and their conservative allies in Congress have attacked the right to collectively bargain.                              {time}  1030  The attacks on workers have led to stagnating wages for workers and greater income inequality. This case is no different. It is being bankrolled by the usual suspects: the Koch brothers and their billionaire allies.  Janus will determine whether public sector unions that represent teachers, firefighters, police officers, and nurses in States and cities across this country can collect fees from all of the employees in the workplaces that they represent.  This case is about whether millions of hardworking public sector workers will have the freedom and the resources to stand together and fight for a better future for themselves and their families. But it is also about the corrosive power of money in politics. It is about the millions of dollars wealthy donors spent to hold a Supreme Court seat open for over a year; the millions more that were spent to elect President Trump so that he could fill that seat with Neil Gorsuch; and the millions of dollars that the Koch brothers and the Bradley Foundation, two organizations devoted to cutting government services for Americans and weakening unions, spent to fund the Janus case.  And today, now that the bought-and-paid-for court has heard the case that will deliver a blow--we hope it doesn't, but likely it will--to the public service workers and the unions that represent them, their investment appears to be paying off.  Here is the thing: millionaires and billionaires who fund these antiworker and antiunion attacks are petrified about the labor movement. They are absolutely afraid of it. That is why they have been working to attack it.  That is because the labor movement is premised on the simple idea that, when workers come together, they can fight for their fair share of the wealth that they helped to create and because the labor movement is about equality and a fair economy that works for everyone, not just a few.  That is why wealthy donors have worked to eliminate and cut union representation; that is why they engage in union busting; that is why they funded the Janus case; and that is why they continue to keep kicking working people in the teeth over and over again.  This Republican tax scam is only part of the restructuring of American democracy where we take from working Americans, give to the wealthiest, and then try to deprive through the courts people's right to organize collectively on their job.  But hardworking Americans are standing up, hardworking Americans are banning together, and hardworking Americans are not going to allow a prosperous life for themselves and their families to be taken away so easily.  This Janus case is something that I urge everybody to look into. It represents another attack on the American working class, but the American[[Page H1273]]working people are standing up stronger than ever and will come back stronger than ever.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-27-pt1-PgH1272-2.txt,1857,INEQUALITY AND FAIRNESS FOR ALL AMERICANS,2018.0,27.0,March

As I got older, I wanted to know more about the causes of the riots, and I learned and read about the Kerner The Kerner Commission's report was designed to focus on all of the civil disturbances that had been happening in the United States, including the Detroit riot, which I was alive and have some memory of.                              {time}  2045  I think it is difficult for young people who want to understand the Kerner Commission report--a report that was prophetic, a report that was thorough and important, a report that was actually a pretty good piece of literature that had good recommendations that our country has never really taken seriously.  But to understand this report and to really delve into the roots of it, I think it is important, Mr.Speaker, to understand that, before 1968, before there ever was a Kerner Commission report, our country, the United States, was a slave-holding nation for about 250 years. If you mark African-American presence in the United States from 1619 and you say slavery officially ended in 1865, America, our country, the United States, was a slave-holding nation longer than it was not one--longer, actually longer. This country held men, women, and children in bondage in absolute absence of freedom for longer than it has not, which is particularly ironic, given that our country is dedicated to liberty and freedom.  Literally millions of Americans existed in a state of anti-freedom, which is slavery. We have yet to contemplate it.  I remember going to law school studying property and contracts. We never talked about America's greatest amount of property, which is human property. We never actually asked: What is the law about leasing on slaves? What is the law about property ownership on slaves? What is this species of property?  We talked about real estate. We talked about other forms of property. We talked about intellectual property. But for many years of this Nation's history, the predominant form of property was human property in the United States, and we never stopped to even slow down.  I bet you there is not more than two or three law schools in the United States that take on this topic so that people can really understand the ground upon which we stand. We are in the U.Capitol, built by people who were not free. In this cathedral of freedom, the people who built it were not free for 250 years.  People stand by and say: Why don't you all get over that? You are always talking about that.  I say: Well, you all still celebrate the Fourth of  We are all proud on the Fourth of July that happened in 1776, but we are not supposed to talk about an institution that prevailed in the United States for most of its history.  And it wasn't quite over in 1865, was it?  In 1865, we passed the 13th Amendment banning involuntary servitude. We passed the 14th Amendment granting citizenship in, I think, 1868. In 1870, we passed the 15th Amendment granting Black men the right to vote.  This is essentially war measures. I am glad they exist, trust me. I am quite grateful they exist. But when you consider that over 200,000 Black soldiers took up arms to keep the Union--the Union--it was the very least that could happen that Black men would get to vote. Black women didn't get to vote.  But then after that, it is important, Mr.Speaker, to bear in mind another phenomenon took place. By 1877, the Tilden-Hayes compromise was effected, in which there was a dead heat political election. And the Republicans of that day, who, ironically, were the people who were against slavery at that time and against racism and bigotry, they said: We are tired of fighting about racism, slavery, and what is to happen with the We will pull Union troops out of the South if you Democrats give us the election.  That allowed Rutherford Hayes to become Samuel Tilden did not become the President, but the Southerners, Democrats at that time, got what they wanted.  This phenomenon that occurred after that was the end of reconstruction. Lynching, slavery by another name, and true terrorism, under the auspices of the Ku Klux Klan, reined in America at this time. Pulaski, Tennessee, was the home of the But there were many other White supremacist groups that received the sanction of our government. In fact, one might even argue that the whole government of the State of Indiana at one time was dominated by the  People interested in this phenomena can study a very important piece of film and book called ``Slavery By Another Name,'' that talked about convict leasing. The 13th Amendment says that you cannot hold anybody in an involuntary servitude unless convicted of a crime.  That loophole allowed our country to use the criminal justice system to push Black men into it to take advantage of their labor through convict leasing. And even though the industry in Alabama of steelmaking really had not taken root during slavery, it did take root after slavery. The people who mined the iron ore and who worked in those mines were, essentially, in convict leasing.  Convict leasing prevailed in our country up until the 1930s and 1940s. In fact, cotton production dropped after the Civil War, but then went back up because of convict leasing because Black men and women were held in bondage through an unjust criminal justice system that forced them to work cotton up until mechanization made hand cotton picking not advantageous anymore. That, together with the sharecropping system, maintained that system.  We think about the Kerner Commission report, we think about the riots of 1968, 1965, and 1966, all of these things, Black rage exploding on the national scene, and people ask: What are they mad about?  Two hundred and fifty years of slavery and 100 years after Jim Crow after that might make you a little upset.  Black people never missed a war. African-American soldiers helped fight for the Union; African-American soldiers helped fight in Korea; the Spanish-American war. As a matter of fact, you can't name a military conflict that Black people didn't fight for this country and die for it. Yet, after the service, usually we came back to racism and discrimination.  There is a great movie out now called ``Mudbound'' about this very phenomena. If people want to learn more about this, they can look at this film ``Mudbound'' about a Black soldier who comes back, gets treated with human dignity in Europe, comes back to Mississippi, and then gets lynched.  This is our country. I am proud of my country and I love my country, but I am not blind to it.  The Kerner Commission tried to open our eyes and tell us what was really going on. One of the phenomenon--and I would like to just note this--is that one of the many ways that racism manifested itself is through residential segregation. Blacks were not allowed to live in certain areas, work in certain areas, and, in 1903, the great Woodrow[[Page H1368]]Wilson kicked Black people out of Federal employment. His reason was that we carry disease. This is in the modern era. Black people were relegated to living in certain neighborhoods. And, actually, when it was found to be illegal to say Blacks can't live in this neighborhood by the Supreme Court, then that is when redlining took hold.  Residential segregation was so effective, Mr.Speaker, for 50 years, that we now in America today--and I am talking about 2018--if you survey White Americans and you ask them, Have you had a significant and meaningful conversation in the last 6 months, who are those people and who are the top seven, 91 percent of White Americans will say that they haven't had a meaningful conversation with a person of color.  Residential segregation is so bad that we don't talk to each other. The result is no empathy--no sympathy; no empathy; no sense of, gee, that is really too bad.  People say: Well, they don't work hard. That is the problem.  Well, wait a minute. How could it be that the people who worked for 250 years for free don't work hard? How could it be that people who don't have any power are some big threat to be feared in this Nation when all we have done is serve it and build it?  At the end of the day, the Kerner Commission tried to highlight discrimination against African Americans in education, housing, and employment; tried to help the Nation understand why some African Americans get enraged about incidents of official violence; why we don't condone, nor even do we agree, with riots.  We cannot act like we don't understand them. Of course we understand them. Many of us have chosen that we are going to try to reform our country and help it reach its promise through our electoral system, through organizing, and activism. We are going to try to make America a stronger and better place by working within the systems that exist.  I am proud that I am one of those people. But I often have to find myself trying to convince people who don't agree with me that there are answers within the system that I am right and they are not, because they come with arguments sometimes based on the history.  The bottom line is the Kerner Commission report, 50 years ago today, we have made progress. There is no doubt about it. We don't have Jim Crow anymore. But we have also seen stagnation.  There is a new report by the Eisenhower Foundation, which shows that since the late 1960s, income inequality and the wealth gap have actually gotten wider. While high school and college graduation rates have improved for the Black community since the Kerner Commission report--thank goodness, and this is an important advance, and we are grateful for it--these gains in access have not translated in economic vitality.  Black families have the highest student debt. Thirty-one percent of all Black families have college debt, compared to about 20 percent of White families. College debt is tough on families of any color, but African Americans, having a lower overall income and a much lower wealth, have to borrow more to seek out education, and that is limiting African-American opportunity.  More than 70 percent of White families own their own homes compared to less than half of Black and Hispanic families. Since 1968, White homeownership has steadily increased, but Black homeownership has not changed. In 1968, 41 percent of Black families owned their own home.  And what is the homeownership rate today?  Now it is 41.2.  Given what I shared with you earlier about residential segregation and about how Blacks and Whites and Latinos don't really interact nearly as much as they should, given the fact that we are all Americans, people may not understand why African-American economic progress has not been as swift as we might want it to be.  To that I say it is a matter of residential segregation and even current redlining. I recommend to people to read an important book called ``Evicted'' by Matthew Desmond, and also listen to a podcast called ``Reveal'' about redlining. This prospect of redlining is very important. ``Reveal'' looked at literally thousands and thousands of pieces of data from the Home Mortgage Disclosure They found that, in 61 metropolitan areas in the United States, there is substantial evidence of mortgage discrimination. That is African Americans, who got the same credit score, the same down payment as other people, who are denied loans.  Mr.Speaker, this even happens in neighborhoods where Black people are the majority.  People wonder: How is it that you have gentrification?  Well, the Black person with the downpayment and the 700 credit score gets told that they cannot have a loan; and the White person with the 500 or 600 credit score and a 3 percent downpayment gets told: Sure, have the loan.  It is happening every day.  Listen to the podcast ``Reveal.'' You will see a woman who went through this herself. It left her not only without a house, but she had to have her partner, who is White and Asian mix, be the one who took out the mortgage because they wouldn't give her one.  I am saying that our country is truly a great nation, but to get to its true greatness, it has got to confront racial discrimination. I am not talking about prejudice. I am talking about racism.  What is the difference?  Prejudice means I don't like you because of your color, your race, and it is a personal thing. It is just I don't like you.  What I am talking about by racism is systematic denial of opportunity without regard to personality.  They didn't turn that Black woman down in that ``Reveal'' podcast because they didn't like her. They don't know her. They know she is Black, and that is all they need to know to turn her down.  This is what we have to confront as a country.  And as I close, Congressman Evans, and as I get ready to take my seat, I just want to point out that, in 2016, White families had a median net worth of $171,000 compared to $17,000 for Blacks and $20,000 for Sixty percent of White families reported having retirement savings, which is double the rate for Black and Hispanic families.  We have to understand what Martin Luther King tried to teach us, and that is: What difference does it make if you can sit at a lunch counter if you cannot afford a hamburger?                              {time}  2100  The Kerner Commission tried to signal to us the way forward. In 2018, we still have the opportunity to take the lessons of it and to build a truly beloved society, as Martin Luther King tried to teach us, but it cannot just be platitudes and pretty talk. It has got to be real commitment, real money, and real investment in opportunity for all.  At the end of the day, in the United States, we say, as we say the Pledge of Allegiance, ``liberty and justice for all.'' I say economic liberty and economic justice for all, and I say we will then see much more social inclusion, and we will live up to the recommendations of the Kerner We can't wait another 50 years.

783,topic-id,544,"Mr.Speaker, I think another Kerner Commission report is definitely appropriate. It is right. It is good. But I will say that the Eisenhower Foundation did a report that showed that, since the late 1960s, income inequality and the wealth gap have widened.  I really believe that what we really need to do is say to ourselves, as a nation, that we are going to actually live out the true meaning of our creed. At the end of the day, the problem is not intellectual; the problem is a matter of will.  Actually, we have real challenges in our Nation today because, I happen to believe, we have a President who is less willing to move progress forward than even other Republicans who have been in office.  We live in a time, now, where we have seen the rollback of the 1965 Voting Rights We have seen the--right now, there is an attack on public employees in the Supreme It feels like 1870.  You remember I was talking about the Civil Black soldiers entered the Civil War in 1863 after the Emancipation Proclamation; 200,000 fought in that Civil Black soldiers helped win the Civil War and maintained the In fact, Lincoln himself said that, without Black soldiers, we might not have a  We went through Of course, Lincoln was killed in April of 1865, but by 1870, we began to roll back, we began to see the progress and the promise roll back.  It feels a little bit like that right now. It feels a little bit like that. But, you know, we are not going back to them bad old days. I want everyone to hear that African Americans, Latinos, women, the LGBT community, people of other religious groups, minority religions, we are not going to the back of the bus. It is just not going to happen.  Better to say, okay, instead of having one group in America be supreme over everyone, what if that group were simply equal to everyone?  Some people in our country seem to believe that having 43 Presidents who are White men, you get one that is Black, and now, all of a sudden, oh, my God, the world is coming to an end. No, it isn't. Everything is fine. Everyone is fine. It just means that what we wrote on paper is actually getting reflected a little bit more in reality.  I think we need to make a firm commitment to end housing discrimination, a firm commitment to let the people vote, a firm commitment to stop giving tax breaks to the richest people and give the working and middle class a chance to earn a decent level of pay.  I think we need a Republican caucus who will help work with us to stop the carnage of guns on these streets and to allow people who have come here as children not to be thrown out of the country summarily. That is what we really need. But I am not getting the sense that they want to help out, so I am thinking we need to get elections that will get some people, Republican or Democrat, to come out here and do some good things for the American people--and not just the wealthiest, most privileged people.

1203,topic-id,609,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, allow me to just thank the gentleman from the great State of Arkansas (Mr.Hill) and also Congressman Pittenger, as well as many other members of the Financial Services Committee on both sides of the aisle. It is always a pleasure to be able to work together on things. This is what our constituents expect, and that is what the Credit Access and Inclusion bill actually represents.  So, Mr.Speaker, if I told you that we could help millions of people get access to an apartment, lower the cost of a loan, lower the deposit they may have to put down on a phone or utility deposit, and we could do all these things without creating a new government program, we could do it without government mandate, and we could do it with virtually no new tax dollars, would you take that deal? Because I would. I would say: Wow, help millions of people be able to afford services that they need before, lower the cost of loans? Yeah, why wouldn't we do that? Well, the truth is that we can if we vote ``yes'' on the Credit Access and Inclusion bill.  I am proud to tell you that this particular piece of legislation, which is bipartisan, will bring about basic fairness in the credit scoring system. Credit is currency in our society. It unlocks credit for access to goods and services. Hardworking Americans need to build some economic security for themselves and their families.  There are currently about 26 million people, or 1 in 10 Americans, who do not have a credit record; and there is another 19 million Americans who do not have enough information to even score. Low-income individuals and even racial and ethnic minorities are even in worse shape. About one in four Latinos and African Americans either don't have a credit score or don't have enough information in the file to get a score.                              {time}  1545  And almost half of the residents of low-income communities do not have a score of any background.  This bill allows credit rating agencies to use on-time rent, phone, and utility payments when determining credit scores.  Now, you should know, Mr.Speaker, if people are late with these lines of information, it can, and often does, show up on their credit score now. And if people take out loan products which they pay back on time, that helps those people's credit score now.  But what about the people who pay phone bills and utility bills, and they pay their bills every month on time? They are not building anything to help them get in a better credit situation. This bill allows them to do that.  As a result, more than a third of previously unscorable Americans will now have access to prime credit and the opportunities that come with it when we pass this bill.  This bill isn't just about access to credit, though. It is also about saving hardworking Americans real money, thousands of dollars, on car loans and their mortgages.  Mr.Speaker, if you are unscorable, you can often get a loan, but the interest rate is always higher when that happens. So, if people are scorable and they get a credit score, they will be able to save money for themselves and put it into their household budget.  The money that used to be going to auto lenders and mortgage brokers is now going to go into the pockets of consumers so that they can improve the lives of their family. That sounds like a pretty good day's work to me.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-02-27-pt1-PgH1306.txt,1857,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2018.0,27.0,April

1512,topic-id,3917,"Mr.President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report for February 2018. The report compares current-law levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2018, 71. This information is necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. The Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act,  The enforceable levels included in this report reflect all of the numerical adjustments made to the resolution since its passage. The information contained in this report captures legislative activity from the passage of the budget resolution through February 26, 2018.  Republican Budget Committee staff prepared tables 1-4 of this report.  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays under the most recently adopted budget resolution. This information is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the For this reporting period, 11 of the 16 authorizing committees are in compliance with their allocations. As previously reported, the Senate Veterans' Affairs, Energy and Natural Resources, and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committees remain in breach of their allocations. Since my last report on January 18, 2018, both the Finance and Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committees have increased spending beyond allowable levels. Through the enactment of both the fourth continuing resolution, H.195, P.115-120, and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, BBA18, H.1892, P.115-123, which contained packages of healthcare extenders, the Finance Committee breached its allocation by $76.9 billion in budget authority and $7.8 billion in outlays over 10 years. Enactment of the BBA18 also produced the Agriculture Committee breach. That law changed the treatment of seed cotton, dairy, and livestock under Federal farm programs, increasing both budget authority and outlays by $1.2 billion over the 2018-2027 period.  Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This information is used to determine points of order related to the spending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of the While no full-year appropriations bills have been enacted for fiscal year 2018, subcommittees are charged with permanent and advanced appropriations that first become available in that year and any full-year standalone provisions included in continuing resolutions. This table reflects one change from my January report. The continuing resolution portion of the BBA18 included full-year authority for the Secretary of Energy to draw down and sell oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, reducing budget authority and outlays by $315 million in 2018.  The budget resolution contains two points of order limiting the use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, Tables 3 and 4 show compliance with fiscal year 2018 limits for overall CHIMPS and the Crime Victims Fund CHIMP, respectively. This information is used for determining points of order under sections 4102 and 4103 of 71, respectively. Notably, there have not been any full-year bills enacted thus far for fiscal year 2018 that include  In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget totals approved by the  CBO provided a spending and revenue report for fiscal year 2018, which helps enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under CBA section 311. In its report, CBO annualizes the temporary effects of the latest continuing resolution, which provides funding through March 23, 2018. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, the Budget Committee excludes this temporary funding. As such, the committee views current-law levels as being $814.6 billion and $463.7 billion below budget resolution levels for budget authority and outlays, respectively. Details on fiscal year 2018 levels can be found in CBO's second table.  Current-law revenues continue to be in excess of the levels assumed by the budget resolution. On-budget revenue levels currently exceed assumed levels by $3.5 billion in fiscal year 2018, $41.9[[Page S1281]]billion over the fiscal year 2018-2022 period, and $98.4 billion over the fiscal year 2018-2027 period. Since my last filing both the fourth continuing resolution and BBA18 contained provisions that reduced revenues compared with current law. The fourth continuing resolution included $25.4 billion in on-budget revenue loss over 10 years related to delays in several health-related taxes. The BBA18 contained an $11.6 billion revenue loss largely as a consequence of a package of tax extenders. This BBA18 figure omits $1.8 billion in revenue increases attributable to language related to Federal Reserve Surplus Funds, which are required to be omitted under current scorekeeping rules.  Social Security outlay levels are consistent with the budget resolution's figures for all enforceable periods. Social Security revenues, however, are $446 million below levels assumed for fiscal year 2018, $1.9 billion greater over the next 5 years, and $28.8 billion greater than assumed over the next 10 years. These revenue effects are attributable to the tax provisions from the fourth continuing resolution, BBA18, and the tax reconciliation bill enacted in December 2017.  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The Senate's PAYGO scorecard currently shows deficit reduction of $24 million in fiscal year 2018, $14 million over the fiscal year 2017-2022, and $13 million over fiscal year 2017-2027 periods. For fiscal year 2018, legislation has been enacted that would reduce outlays by $24 million. Over the fiscal year 2017-2022 period, legislation has been enacted that CBO estimates will decrease outlays by $13 million and increase revenues by $1 million. Over the fiscal year 2017-2027 period, legislation has been enacted that CBO estimates will decrease outlays by $11 million and increase revenues by $2 million. Notably absent from these amounts are the direct spending and revenue effects from the fourth continuing resolution and This is due to provisions in those measures that mandated the exclusion of those budgetary effects both from the Senate and statutory PAYGO scorecards. The Senate's PAYGO rule is enforced by section 4106 of 71.  Also included in this submission is a table tracking the Senate's budget enforcement activity on the floor since Congress adopted the budget resolution. No points of order have been raised on the floor since my last filing.  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.

This decision tells us what we have already known all along, that ending DACA would be detrimental to our community and for our economy.

816,topic-id,522,"Mr.Speaker, ending DACA would be a nightmare for In fact, it would be a nightmare for businesses and a nightmare for America's economy.  You would think that that statement may have been said by the advocates for immigration rights or maybe by some of the faith-based groups that support immigration. But it wasn't. It was said by the U.Chamber of Commerce, Mr.Speaker, and that is so because DACA-eligible workers contribute $1.4 billion in Federal taxes, $2 billion in Social Security taxes, and $470 million in Medicare every single year.  So this statement on its face we would think was made by folks who have traditionally supported immigration rights was made by the U.Chamber of Commerce, the one entity that is really concerned about economic growth, job creation, and the well-being of our economy.  Ranking Member Nydia Velazquez's report on the impact of DACA on small businesses found that deporting Dreamers will cost $60 billion and reduce economic growth by $280 billion, including $460 billion in economic output over a decade. So this is the dramatic impact that not resolving DACA and not bringing help to the Dreamers will have on our  Mr.Speaker, when we look into the eyes of these Dreamers, we just can't say no to them. You can't say no to a young person full of aspirations, full of dreams, and still full of so much hope for our Even under these very critical and challenging times for our Nation and the world, these Dreamers are full of aspirations.  So the question will be: Are we a nation of aspirations or a nation of deportation?  Nearly 8 in 10 voters support allowing Dreamers to remain permanently in our country. In red States and blue States, in Republican majority districts and Democratic districts, over 80 percent of Americans feel that these young people should stay in our Even three-quarters of Trump voters and only 14 percent believe that they should be forced out. Only 14 percent of our Nation feels that these young people should be kicked out, thrown out in the cold--only 14 percent. A very small minority of Americans believe that that should be what we do.  Ninety-one percent of DACA recipients younger than 25 are employed. They are no burden on our economy. Those who are over 25 years old have been employed at a rate of 93 percent. Ninety-three percent of DACA recipients over 25 years old are working residents of our Nation with an average earning of $36,000.  Dreamers are students, teachers, healthcare workers, devoted members of our communities, members of our Armed Forces, and first responders. That is who Dreamers are. They are not a load on our country. As we saw in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, it was a Dreamer who made food and volunteered to set up beds for thousands of Americans who were displaced. Jesus Contreras, a Dreamer and a paramedic, worked as a first responder for 6 days straight after the hurricane.

1243,topic-id,333,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Lacy Clay for[[Page H1349]]yielding time, as well as Ranking Member Elijah Cummings and Chairman Trey Gowdy for their support in bringing this bill to the floor.  I rise today in strong support of H.4406, my bill to designate the post office located at 99 Macombs Place in New York, New York, as the Tuskegee Airmen Post Office  The Tuskegee Airmen hold a historic significance as the first Black military aviators to serve in the U.Army Air Corps during the peak of World War At the time, racial segregation remained in the U.Armed Forces as well as much of the country. These men were treated as second-class citizens, and much of the military establishment believed back then that Black soldiers were inferior to White soldiers. The Tuskegee Airmen proved them wrong.  Collectively, they earned more than 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses, and they flew missions in secondhand P-40 planes, which were slower and more difficult to maneuver. Yet, in their more than 200 escort missions, the Tuskegee Airmen had a better success rate than any other escort groups of the 15th Air  The Tuskegee Airmen were active in fighting against Jim Crow laws in the South, and their success and bravery encouraged the eventual integration of the U.Armed Many of the men who served in this squadron dedicated their lives to fighting for racial equality and civil rights.  Among the Tuskegee Airmen was a 26-year-old second lieutenant of Dominican heritage named Esteban Mr.Hotesse immigrated to the United States through Ellis Island at the age of 4 with his mother. He went on to serve as a pilot for 3 years with the Tuskegee Airmen before being killed during a military exercise in 1945.  Naming this post office after the Tuskegee Airmen is a fitting tribute to honor their memory and contributions to this country. I am proud to have sponsored this bill and look forward to the Tuskegee Airmen's legacy living on in my district for many, many years to come.

772,topic-id,692,"Mr.Speaker, it is a great honor that I rise today to anchor the CBC Special I would like to thank the CBC chairman, Chairman Richmond, for his leadership in this effort.  For the next 60 minutes, we have an opportunity to speak directly to the American people about issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus and the millions of constituents we represent.  Tonight, Mr.Speaker, I want to speak about a topic that has affected this country and plagued us all. Over 50 years ago, in the middle of the Detroit riot, President Lyndon Johnson established the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, commonly known as the Kerner The goal of that Commission was to identify the underlying causes of the civil unrest in communities across the country.  This was a time of tremendous tension in our great Many Americans were confused about the root causes of the riots and the unsure path forward.  On February 29, 1968, following several field trips to troubled communities, the Commission released the Kerner Report, a 176-page report that examined cultural institutional racism, from segregated schools and housing discrimination to generational poverty and to limited economic opportunity.  The Commission largely held racism responsible for Black rioting and warned that our Nation is moving to two societies, one Black, one White--separate and unequal. The Commission called for bold policies to counter decades of political failure, such as investment in much-needed social services, housing, and education programs; and incentivizing diversity among law enforcement.  Sadly, President Johnson ignored the Kerner Report and rejected its recommendations. In the midst of that, we had the assassinations of several prominent Americans: President John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther  Fifty years later, America has made some improvements, but African Americans continue to face some of the same issues discussed in the Kerner  Since its release, Black American homeownership has been flat, and unemployment is still twice that of White The Black prison population has tripled here in It used to be two other countries, South Africa during the apartheid years and the former Soviet Union, had more people in prison. Now the United States has more people in prison than any nation in the world.  Black household wealth is less than one-fifth of the national average, and almost 33 percent of Black children are growing up in poverty.  Recently, Fred Harris, the last living member of the Kerner Commission, issued a new report highlighting the persistent issues plaguing the Black community and calling on major investments in education, workforce development, and a living wage. This comes in stark contrast to the severe cuts proposed by President Trump in the fiscal year 2019 budget.  Today, in fact, I attended a meeting for the CEO Council for Growth at Drexel The council's mission is to lead our region forward by convening decisionmakers, taking action, and doing the things necessary to strengthen our regional economy.  With poverty at 26 percent in my district, I am committed to working with the CEOs present at today's meeting and others who are using creativity and innovation to help reduce poverty, combat hunger, and spur economic growth.  I also attended a discussion at Temple University in Although the recently passed budget was by no means perfect, I firmly believe that our leadership and our actions matter.  So it was great to hear firsthand from professors at Temple University today about how the recent jolt in NIH funding will allow them to keep their research on the rise. If we want to continue moving the needle on poverty reduction, we must make it our priority to invest in all of our neighborhoods.  We are in the business of doing no harm. As elected officials, we are here to help move our neighborhoods forward, not backward, and we must continue to urgently press for commonsense economic solutions for Americans most in need.  I stand before you today to tell you just as I have always done before, we must continue to make ideas matter.

789,topic-id,711,"Mr.Speaker, what others have heard this evening from the Congressional Black Caucus is sort of like a canary in the mine. The Kerner Report, when President Johnson established it 50 years ago, was an attempt to shine a light and to send a warning that we were two nations, one Black and one And for every Member who stood up here and spoke, they all talked about how proud they are, as Americans; and that we all recognize the beauty and the idea of America and what it has meant.  I come from the city of Philadelphia, where it all started. In those conversations, there is no question it started out as a very flawed document, where African Americans and women basically were left out of that discussion.  But as you think about what my good friend from Minnesota said as he laid out the historical aspect to where we are here in 2018 and the opportunity we have--because I do believe we have an opportunity, and I do believe it is not any more words on paper. It is not a report or anything. It is a question of what is in our hearts collectively.  I don't think this is a Democrat or Republican issue. I don't think this is a Black or White issue. I think this is an issue about inclusion and involvement. I think that when you go back to that report that talks about the underlying causes of the civil unrest in these communities across this country, I think that we all have an obligation to try to address those issues.  The issues are very fundamental. May you live in rural America, or urban America, or suburban America, you know, everybody needs quality healthcare. Everyone needs a job opportunity. Everyone needs a good, solid education. And those things we should not take lightly. All of those things, we all need.  So what we, as the Congressional Black Caucus, attempted to do is continue to raise the consciousness and to get people to understand that we still have a lot of work to do. This should not be taken lightly; that we all recognize that though, as King used to say, we have come over here on different boats, we are in the same boat now; and that boat is America; that boat is we are in a much more competitive world than in 1968. This is 2018. The world has radically changed.  The question is: Are we going to be in the forefront of the change, or are we going to be in the back of change?  I like to believe we should be in the forefront of change. I like to believe that we all understand, as a country, that it is in our collective interests to work together and to make a difference. I am not saying to you it will be easy. And it was not easy in 1968.  As I said, President Johnson was a Democrat, but he did not heed the report the way he should have probably heeded it. But it is no use talking about the past.  The question is: How do we deal with the future, and where do we go?  We should applaud him and others for at least having the discussion. We should not be fearful of discussion. We should all recognize that we have some challenges ahead for us in the 21st century.  Again, I will repeat myself. It will not be easy. It will take a lot of work, and it will take us confronting those issues that we face today. It is not easy, as we have debated the issue about healthcare or the issue about jobs or the issue about education. Everybody wants to work. Everybody wants a quality job and a quality opportunity. No one wants to sit on the sidelines.  So we have a chance today, in my view, to take advantage of the opportunities. I hope we will, Mr.I believe that all members of the Congressional Black Caucus strongly feel that way. I thank the chairman of our caucus for initiating these efforts that we have been doing for this last year or so. I really appreciate that opportunity.

So for the next 60 minutes, we have an opportunity to speak directly to the American people about issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus and the millions of constituents we represent. Tonight's Special Order is about gun violence. I thank my colleagues for joining me here today to speak about the national epidemic of gun violence, an important topic to us all.  The Black community is at a critical time because we have a lot to lose because too many of our neighbors, unfortunately, have been subject to gun violence at a consistent rate, a crime which often goes unpunished because of unreliable witnesses.  On February 14, this Nation once again witnessed a horrific tragedy that took place at a high school in Seventeen lives were taken at the hands of a gunman with way too much firepower. The horror and tragedy that shook the Florida high school should be an unimaginable event in our country. Yet, tragically, our Nation has lost too many loved ones at the hands of gun violence, to the point where we often see the same reaction: hand wringing, blaming going around, but nothing being done to stop the violence.  The city of Philadelphia knows all too well the lives we have lost at the hands of gun violence. In 2017, we saw the city experience its largest homicide epidemic since 2012.

He first ran for Congress in 1964, winning a House seat representing Riverside and Imperial After three terms in the House, when he was only 36 years old, John challenged Senator George Murphy in 1970.  It was highly contested election. Senator Murphy shared the ballot with his good friend, then-Governor Ronald Reagan, who was seeking reelection.

763,topic-id,658,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about the introduction of the ``Age 21 Act'' by Senator Flake and myself.  Two weeks ago, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, our Nation experienced yet another horrific mass shooting that has shocked the conscience of us all.  The shooter--a 19-year old former student of the high school--used an AR-15 military-style assault rifle that he legally purchased at a gun store, to kill former classmates and educators. Along with 14 wounded, 17 beautiful lives were lost in this horrific attack. Many of them were children and young adults. Their whole lives were ahead of them.  The overwhelming agony so many victims and their loved ones are experiencing is all too familiar to gun violence victims and survivors all across This palpable agony and grief has emboldened students from Parkland and all across this Nation to speak out about gun violence and demand that we as lawmakers act. I am deeply inspired by the courage of these young people, and I hope my colleagues will join me in working with them.  The bill that Senator Flake and I are introducing is straightforward and simple--it raises the minimum age to purchase a military-style assault rifle and high capacity ammunition magazines to age 21. In so doing, this legislation closes the loophole in current law that allows teenagers to legally walk into a gun store and buy an AR-15. It further prohibits private individuals from selling or transferring AR-15s to teenagers under the age of 21. In this way, it brings the minimum age requirements for buying handguns and military-style assault weapons into parity.  It makes perfectly clear that in America, if a person is not old enough to buy a handgun--or, for that matter, old enough to buy a beer--they should not be able to purchase a military-style assault weapon. In my view, this bill is one small step in the right direction. It was developed following the attack in Parkland that had students asking ``why was this teenager able to legally walk into a gun store and buy an AR-15?'' In fact, one student named Samuel Zeif, who lost his best friend in the shooting, asked President Trump why a young person in America ``can still go in a store and buy a weapon of war?''  So we worked in the spirit of bipartisanship to let Samuel, and these students, know that as lawmakers we hear them. And we will work together to make sure that they feel safe in their schools and in their neighborhoods.  So I'm proud of this bipartisan piece of legislation and would urge that this body take it up and pass it immediately. However, I would be remiss not to mention that so much more remains to be done. Already this Congress, I have introduced legislation to ban bump stocks and assault weapons from our streets. I've also introduced legislation that would provide states with a legal framework for courts to issue gun violence restraining orders to prevent dangerous individuals from accessing firearms. Additionally, nearly 100 percent of Americans support legislation that would require universal background checks on all gun sales, something that ordinary Americans are shocked is not already the law.  I ask my colleagues to work with us on these common-sense, broadly supported proposals. I strongly believe that lives are at stake. We can't continue to watch our children get slaughtered.  Martin Luther King, once said that ``we are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history there is such a thing as being too late'' and ``we must move past indecision to action.''  Today, as students and communities all across our nation cry out for stronger gun laws, this message continues to ring true. Now is the time for us to act, and to show the American people that we can come together when they are looking for leadership.  I yield the floor.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2018-02-28-pt1-PgS1288.txt,1332,ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION,2018.0,28.0,February

1398,topic-id,479,"Mr.President, I rise today in support of bipartisan legislation aimed at ensuring that those individuals who are on the Department of Homeland Security's no-fly list are likewise not able to have access to guns. I just met with several of the students from the shooting at the school in Florida and heard the very compelling case they have made to take this issue seriously and do what we can on a commonsense basis to make it more difficult for those who shouldn't have guns to have guns.  Regardless of what happened in Florida these past couple of weeks, this is a measure we should have taken before. It has been brought to the floor of the Senate, and it has received majority support here. I think it is simply common sense that someone who is not permitted to fly in this country and is considered by the Federal Government to be a potential threat to national security should not be allowed to purchase a firearm.  The no-fly list and the selectee list that we are talking about is composed of those who are not allowed to fly. With the selectee list, it is those who require additional screening. These are both narrowly tailored, defined, targeted lists.  This restriction would affect just a small number of people, all of whom would be afforded due process under the Those who find themselves on either of these lists would have the authority to challenge that designation, and the onus would be on the government, not the individual; the onus would be on the government to justify the classification and to prove that they should not be allowed to purchase a firearm. These are strong, robust, due process protections that would make sure that these restrictions are constitutionally sound.  This bill also adds another layer of safety for citizens from those who would do us harm, ensuring that anyone who has been denied the right to fly cannot purchase a weapon without at least undergoing additional scrutiny. It simply stands to reason that if we fear that someone may use our commercial airlines as a weapon or to[[Page S1233]]harm those on board, we should not allow that same person to purchase a weapon without additional scrutiny.  I encourage my colleagues to review this bipartisan legislation and to join me, along with Senator Collins and a number of our colleagues here--a bipartisan group of Senators--in supporting this commonsense piece of legislation.  I hope we will have a debate on some of these measures. I will be talking in the coming days about some of the other measures that we ought to take to make sure that we don't put guns in the hands of those who shouldn't have them.

And right away we talked about Yucca We talked about nuclear waste, and I told him that I was going to be representing a very special place: Oak Ridge,  So let me start by thanking Chairman  John He has been the hero for the Yucca Mountain project. He has worked tirelessly. He has seen this through the courts. He has seen it through the He has worked so hard. I thank him for his efforts.  Oak Ridge, Tennessee, it is a beautiful place. I represent the Third District of Tennessee: Oak Ridge, where we had the Manhattan Project, where we won World War II; Oak Ridge, where we won the Cold War; Oak Ridge, where we have worked tirelessly to build our Nation's nuclear arsenal, and today we are still advocating to do that, to keep America strong--great men and women.  But Oak Ridge, like many other places around the Nation--Savannah River, Portsmouth, Hanford--years ago, ladies and gentlemen, when we manufactured our nuclear weapons, we were not as safe and secure as we are today. There was an immediacy. There was a need during World War II to get the bomb built, and we did it in Oak Ridge, and it ended World War  But for years thereafter, we were not as safe at many of these venues. What does that mean? That means that legacy wastes were left in communities: sometimes in the soil, sometimes in the water, sometimes in facilities. And what that means is that the Federal Government has a duty to these communities to clean this waste up. And this waste has to go somewhere.  Now, Chairman Shimkus, and we have heard from Chairman Walden--for those of you who are listening tonight, they are authorizers. They authorize the law. I sit on the Appropriations That is the committee in Congress that authorizes the spending for this.  I am the chairman of the Nuclear Cleanup That is how passionate I am about cleaning up nuclear waste not only in Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Savannah River; or Hanford, but all over these great United States, because we owe this to the American people.  The Federal Government caused this problem; the Federal Government needs to clean this up. It is the ultimate, I think, in environmental advocacy. This is something that Republicans and Democrats, Members of the House and Members of the Senate, usually agree upon; and we have worked together in this very important caucus.  Why is it important that we pass the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017? Because, first of all, we owe it to the American people. The Department of Energy does a good job in cleanup, but this will revise their programs. It will give what Congress[[Page H1358]]should do, give direction to a Federal agency. So, as we advocate for dollars to clean up the nuclear waste, we need this key authorization bill to give it structure, to give it purpose.  So, in the end, Yucca is critically important--critically important. And I know the people in these affected communities want Yucca That is the interesting thing about it. They want it because they realize it is critically important that we store the waste there: it is important for America; it is important for our environment; it is important to these communities; and it is long overdue.

They lost their homes. They couldn't afford to send their kids to college. And all of this heartache, this pain, this suffering that they went through was the direct result of risky predatory lending practices and too-big-to-fail banks that did not have sufficient capital in place to support and absorb their financial losses.  It was in the aftermath of this financial disaster in 2008 that Congress passed protections to prevent this from happening again, but here we are today where these big banks now believe that we should simply forget the past mistakes that they made and, instead, only evaluate their current activities to determine certain capital requirements. I guarantee you those families that have suffered have not simply forgotten about what they went through and what they are still struggling to overcome and recover from.  By ignoring critical indicators of past activities, this bill would allow big banks, like Wells Fargo, for example, who defrauded the American people just in the last several months by opening millions of fake accounts, to get away with a slap on the wrist. And the American people are set up to take the fall for their actions.  Now, supporters of this bill claim that current capital requirements stifle lending and hurt our banks and the economy, but the facts say otherwise. In 2016, bank profits reached an all-time high, and today business lending is up 75 percent since 2010. Our country's banks added more than $700 billion in capital to absorb potential losses and protect Americans and our economy from financial disaster.  Higher capital requirements don't restrict lending. They simply ensure that big banks that are even bigger today than they were in 2008 can absorb their losses without depending on taxpayers for a bailout.  The American people deserve a financial system that works for them and their families, not one that bets against them to boost Wall Street profits. We need to pass legislation that increases these capital requirements of banks with assets greater than $50 billion and continue to enact and strengthen reforms that will protect our economy and American families from another massive collapse. That is why I am strongly urging our colleagues to reject this dangerous bill and, instead, work together towards efforts to build a financial system that serves the American people, not special interests or Wall Street banks.

It also led to passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, legislation that had great bipartisan support. People on both sides of the aisle worked on this legislation together to pass a bill to address what is happening to our communities.  Every single one of us has a story about somebody close to us, near to us, perhaps a friend or relative--probably both--who has fallen victim to prescription drug addiction and opioid addiction. Of course if you end up with a prescription drug addiction, that one pill might be $60 or $80, but you can go out on the streets and find heroin for $10 to $15. Now we see the rise of heroin replacing prescription drugs and you see the cycle. The drug dealers have figured out a way to lace cocaine with fentanyl so that it becomes a little bit more addictive and so people are hooked on cocaine more than they already are.  You know the dangers of fentanyl, a synthetic drug so powerful that you can't have a dog sniff for it at the Post Office because it would kill the animal.  During these roundtables that were held in the San Luis Valley about opioids, I learned a couple of things. In Alamosa, CO, I learned that about 90 percent of the jail population in Alamosa is addicted to drugs. At the same roundtable, we talked about the challenges that rural communities have in treatment. We know that if a police officer or law enforcement officer or paramedic finds somebody who is overdosed and they are revived with Narcan, yes, you saved their life. You brought them back, but what happens after that? They are left to their own devices. Do they return to that abuse? Do they return to that cycle of overdose? Without treatment, yes, they will.  We learned in Swedish Medical Center Englewood, CO, the Front Range[[Page S2067]]suburb of Denver, that 1 out of every 10 visitors to the emergency room of people who are revived by Narcan or some other treatment after an overdose will be dead within a year. So 1 out of 10 who come into an emergency room will be dead within a year.  We know that there has been great success in finding alternatives to opioid medication. In fact, Colorado emergency rooms and the Colorado Hospital Association, working together with a number of hospitals, developed a program called Alternatives to Opioids, or ALTO, which is a program that we actually introduced legislation on--Senator Booker, myself, Senator Bennet, and others--to try to make sure that emergency rooms don't just turn to opioid medication but find other alternatives because there are other alternatives. You don't just have to prescribe an opioid-based medication.  As a result, opioid prescriptions out of the emergency room have decreased by 36 percent over the 6-month course of this pilot program in Those are remarkable results. We introduced legislation to mimic the same thing and to learn best practices at the Federal level so that hospitals around the country can work together, share those best practices, identify what works, and use them.  We have to reform the Medicaid Program so there is no incentive for doctors to overprescribe addictive medication. In Alamosa, physicians we talked to are entering into contracts with their patients. At San Luis Valley Health Regional Medical Center, they are entering into contracts with patients about the responsibility that goes with taking these powerful, powerful drugs.  We found new ways to make sure that the pill mills are being discovered and abandoned. We try to make sure that people can communicate with each other on how these treatments work.  While I was in Colorado, we talked about the devastation that drugs are having on their small communities. We learned about a group of high schoolers who are talking to other high schools about the dangers of addiction and prescription and drug overdose. They are trying to work with each other to stop the cycle and to make sure that people who need help find help and hopefully will avoid it in the first place.  Perhaps, one of the most frightening things that I heard during this roundtable--being a parent with three children of my own, I often worry about what happens to them when they go to school and what pressures they face. Two of them are young now. Our daughter is 14, and she will be entering high school. I worry about the pressures they will face from their peers. I worry about them, and I worry about what happens to our community and to their friends with what is around them. But I never thought that I would hear what I heard in the San Luis  We were talking about prescriptions and reimbursement from One of the providers brought up a challenge that they had with getting reimbursement. I later learned from a pharmacist that it may simply be a coding problem, and if it were coded correctly, the reimbursement would occur.  This is what this provider said. They were trying to make sure Medicaid could reimburse for the nasal spray of Narcan so that children could administer it to their parents when they overdosed, because it is easier for a young child or a little child to administer a nasal spray than to give an injection.  Kids are given nasal spray so they can revive their parents. If that parent goes to the emergency room at Swedish hospital in Denver, CO, revived by that child, 1 in 10 of those parents revived will not come back again because they will be dead.  We have done a lot of work in this country, and we have a lot more work to do when it comes to opiate addiction and crisis. We have a lot of work to do in this Congress to come together and find ways to stop this--to break the cycle, to make sure it is easier to prescribe the drugs that will help instead of create addictions.  We have talked to people who said they have to have 8 hours of training and certification, which makes it impossible for certain drugs to be administered by a physician in the emergency room because they don't have time to comply with the paperwork. They actually would rather prescribe this drug than the opiate-based drug because the opiate-based drug, they know, would create the possibility of addiction. Yet this other drug wouldn't. There are more barriers to prescribe the drug that wouldn't cause the harm than the drug that would cause the harm. So we have a lot of work to do. These aren't Republican issues or Democratic issues. They are our families' issues. They are our friends' issues. They are our communities' issues.  I will end it with this story. One of the healthcare professionals we talked to told a story of their son who was a golfer--an athlete, loved to golf. He was injured golfing, so they wanted to make sure their son was cared for so he could recover and go on to a golf career or whatever career he had in front of him. They took their son to the doctor. Their son was given Vicodin to address the pain from the injury. At this point in the story, the mother started to cry because she feels guilty and responsible for the very first treatment that led down a path of addiction and the eventual death of their son. All this mom wanted to do was help, and she now feels the blame of the powerful drug that led to the addiction and death of their son. It is not a unique story. That story has been shared far too many times around the country, and yet here we are once again talking about it.  So I encourage my colleagues, let's continue the great work we have already done. Let's do more. Let's work together, and let's make sure we can find solutions this country will be proud of. We will know this when our communities recover and people stop dying.  I yield the floor.

The Senator and I also share the great work that takes place at F.Warren Air Force F.Warren Air Force Base has a significant role to play in the nuclear triad, with facilities in both Colorado and That is obviously something very important to our national security.  One of the other things I think is important to bring to this conversation that the Senator from Wyoming talked about is the national security component that energy can play and the important role that it has. We can export our energy not just to the Midwest or to the eastern parts of this country, but we can take that gas produced in Wyoming and Colorado and export it to Asia and Europe, to countries that want American energy, that desire American energy resources, not energy resources from tyrants and dictators like Russia and other places we see around the globe.  This is an opportunity for us to really show, and I commend my colleague for his leadership on energy.

The Secretary knows that 93 percent of all Federal land is located in the western part of the United This map shows the Federal lands around our country. If you look at the eastern seaboard, you can see a lot of patches of white, with a few patches of red in Virginia, West Virginia, the George Washington National Forest, the Shenandoah National In Florida, you can see the Everglades National Park, the Great Smoky Mountains, but you can see the predominant shade of the western part of this country is red. Red signifies all the areas that are owned by the Federal  Look at the State of Almost the entire State of Nevada is owned by the Federal Government--is public land. Look at the State of It is public land owned by the Federal  Nationwide, the Bureau of Land Management is responsible for managing approximately 700 million acres of Federal mineral estate located underground and all of the Federal land management agencies' holdings. So it is not just land that is held by the Bureau of Land Management in Colorado, in fact, they hold even more when it comes to our mineral holdings.  The BLM is also responsible for administering 245 million acres of Federal surface lands. As this map points out, nearly all of it in this country is in the 11 western-most States and  Historically, local BLM field offices have been diligent and effective managers of the public land for multiple use, as they are charged to do under the Federal Land Policy and Management  In fact, when I meet with county commissioners and others in the West, they all talk about the good relationship they have with their field offices and the good decisions they are able to reach with those field offices.  Although, unfortunately, in recent years, directives and management coming from the BLM headquarters in Washington, DC--a long ways away from these publicly held lands out West, the 200-plus million acres of Federal land held by the BLM thousands of miles away from Washington, DC--have favored deep-pocketed, radical special interests over field office decisions and the opinions of those who live near and who actually use this land.  Whether it is the withdrawal of mineral leasing or the reduction of grazing permits, the concept of multiple use--something that was fundamental to the founding of our public land agencies--has fallen out of favor with the Bureau of Land  When you don't live in the communities that are among and surrounded by these lands, it is easy to make these decisions that close off energy development or close off recreational opportunities or close out cattle ranching because the consequences are felt out West, 1,000-plus miles away from the decision makers in the  The BLM Headquarters Relocation Act is legislation I have introduced to fix this problem.  I was pleased to see within its budget request that the Department of the Interior is planning a modernization of their organization and infrastructure for the next 100 years. At the very top of this modernization plan should be relocating the BLM headquarters out Move it out of Washington and put it exactly in the middle of these lands.  Grand Junction, CO, the Western Slope of Colorado, is a beautiful place, a great city that can accommodate an agency headquarters and has the benefit of a populous that is intimately familiar with public land management policy and decision making. It makes perfect sense. It has a great airport, interstate access, a county with well over half of its land held by public land agencies. It is a community surrounded by public land. It is a community that is surrounded by people who are affected by those public land decisions. Doesn't it make more sense to have those decisions coming from the lands that they are regulating than from the beltway of Washington?  This proposal has strong bipartisan support--Republicans and Democrats who agree. Let's put the decision makers into places where those decisions are felt first and foremost. Making this agency more accountable to the people who have to deal with its management decisions by putting its headquarters among the land managers would be a huge start and a great recognition that we can modernize this agency and this Department for the next 100 years.

Unclear Federal regulations could force millions of Americans who recreationally compete in rodeos or participate in other equestrian events to get a commercial driver's license.

In a recent story in the Billings Gazette, Andy Bolich, the head coach for the Montana State University rodeo team, said: ``For the most part, around Montana, I would say rodeo is a hobby for most people.''

1025,topic-id,1719,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about the mass murder in Florida this month, and I rise to ask a simple question that millions of Americans in every part of this country are asking at their kitchen tables right now: Is Congress finally going to do anything meaningful about gun violence? When will enough be enough? What will it take for this body to move beyond the same talking points that we hear after every mass shooting and actually do something to prevent more deaths? Will Congress finally see what the vast majority of Americans see--gun owners and non-gun owners alike--that America's gun problem isn't going away unless Congress musters up the courage to take it head-on, or will Congress continue to give the lipservice of thoughts and prayers and then do absolutely nothing?  We have to act because once again there was a massacre on American soil. Once again it was inside a school. Once again American children were gunned down. We keep living through a nightmare of gun violence that repeats itself in schools, movie theaters, churches, nightclubs, concerts, and every single day on the streets of cities in every State around this country--Sandy Hook, Aurora, Charleston, San Bernardino, Orlando, Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, and most recently, Parkland,  We can help stop this. We have the power to help stop this. The question is whether Congress has the political will to do it, whether this institution will finally put families first, our children first, and stand up to the gun manufacturers and the  I urge every Member of Congress to reflect on why they first ran for office. We are here as public servants to serve the people who sent us here, not to serve the gun industry's profits, not to serve the organizations and companies and lobbyists who demand political retribution when we do the morally right thing. Does Congress have the will to act? Does Congress have the basic courage this country needs? I am sorry to say, I don't know, but we can put it to the test.  There has been a lot of talk--more than normal even--about our need to act in this So I will say this to my colleagues: Let's make this time different. Let's listen to the children from Stoneman Douglas High Let's seize this moment. Let's take action.  I implore my colleagues to listen to what the country is saying about gun violence today, listen to the families, listen to the survivors from Parkland and tune out all the other noise. I did. It is possible.  Ten years ago, I had an A rating from the NRA, just like many of my colleagues today, but then I met the mother of Nyasia Pryear-Then I met her classmates. Nyasia was an honor student from She was dancing with her friends, having fun, loving life. She was killed by a stray bullet in her community. Now I have an F rating from the  I don't understand how, after meeting with all of these families, after meeting with all of these children whose lives have been destroyed and torn apart by gun violence--I don't understand how any public servant would not vow to do what is necessary to make sure it never happens again.  It is what we do after a terrorist attack, rightfully so. It is what we do as a country. We come together. We say never again, and we do whatever it takes to protect our country. We have to have the very same sense of urgency now.  Plain and simple, it is a lie to say we have to choose between protecting law-abiding gun owners' rights and protecting our children from being murdered by assault rifles. It is a false choice to say we cannot end gun violence without violating people's constitutional rights. It is time for Members of Congress to stand up for what is right for America and do what is right for our communities, and say no to the  I commend one of our colleagues in the House of Representatives--a Republican from Florida and an Army veteran--who is seeing this crisis differently now too. He wrote:       I know that my community, our schools, and public gathering      places, are not made safer by any person having access to the      best killing tool the Army could put in my hands. I cannot      support the primary weapon I used to defend our people, being      used to kill children I swore to defend.  That is what leadership looks like.  I implore my colleagues in the Senate to see our gun violence problem differently. See it with your heart. See it for what it is. It is a matter of national security, of public health, of public safety that will never go away unless Congress does its job.  So, once and for all, let's pass laws that actually are meaningful, that actually can do something, not just something simple so we can say we did something and move on. I strongly agree with my colleagues that we need to improve the mental health system. Let's make those investments, but it should not stop there.  We have to address the fact that we have weapons of war on our streets today. We have to address the fact that it is so easy for people to buy a gun--people who should never have that privilege. Let's vote to ban semiautomatic assault rifles.  Congress has already banned fully automatic weapons. Congress has already recognized that some weapons have no place in the civilian world, and a weapon of war that was designed for military use, that can fire up to 100 rounds in 1 minute or 100 rounds if you just add a bump stock, a weapon that can completely outgun a police officer has no place in the civilian world.  Will my colleagues vote with me to ban semiautomatic assault rifles?  Then, let's vote to ban the high-capacity magazines that go with them. They are made for wars; they are not made to be in our schools, not in our cities. High-capacity magazines let killers fire dozens of rounds without having to frequently stop and reload. They are designed to let someone fire bullets at as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time.  Let's vote to ban high-capacity magazines, and let's vote to pass universal background checks. That is something that is so commonsense, so obvious. Too many people who should not get their hands on these weapons are easily able to get them, and there are so many loopholes that allow people to buy semiautomatic assault rifles online, where there are no background checks. They allow people to buy semiautomatic assault rifles at gun shows, where there are no background checks.  It simply doesn't make sense that every person who buys a firearm doesn't go through a basic background check system. Do you know who agrees with that? Ninety-seven percent of the American people. I can't think of any other issue where there is such near-universal agreement across our entire population.  So let's do what our constituents are demanding from us--not what the NRA is demanding from us--and vote to pass universal background checks. When we do it, let's make sure the effort is actually sincere. If we are only voting on universal background checks, when it is tied to the issue of concealed carry reciprocity, then that is not a sincere attempt to fix our broken background check system. If Congress is saying we will only pass universal background checks if we pass a new law that says a stranger from one State has to be allowed into my State or your State when he has a gun hidden under his jacket, that is an insult to 97 percent of the American people who want Congress to pass universal background checks now.  Then, let's finally vote to overturn the outrageous law that has banned the Centers for Disease Control from even studying the issue of gun deaths. The CDC can study any other cause of death--heart disease, cancer, car crashes, plane crashes--unless it involves a gun. Don't you think it is strange that when we debate this issue, the two[[Page S1303]]things related to gun violence that Congress has actually banned in recent years are research--research on gun violence--and a ban on the ATF from using computers to keep records? Let's vote to allow the CDC to conduct research on gun violence so we can finally have the information and the data we need to fight gun violence as effectively as possible.  Let's also pass a law that finally makes gun trafficking a Federal crime. Over and over again, law enforcement officers keep finding illegally obtained guns being used in crimes. Numerous NYPD officers have been killed by guns that were illegally obtained by criminals, and there is literally no Federal law to stop someone from loading his truck with guns in Georgia, driving up I-95, and selling them in a parking lot in the Bronx directly to criminals and gang members.  I have a bill that would make this illegal. It is called the Hadiya Pendleton and Nyasia Pryear-Yard Gun Trafficking and Crime Prevention It is bipartisan, because both parties agree that gun trafficking is a source of gun violence in our cities.  This bill is named after Nyasia, whom I mentioned earlier, and another teenager from Chicago who was also killed by a stray bullet. Both guns in those crimes were trafficked. So let's pass this bill and finally make gun trafficking a Federal crime.  If we are not trying to solve this problem now, then we are failing as elected leaders. Congress must solve America's gun violence crisis now. It is urgent. Our country is demanding it. Americans deserve more from Congress than just banning bump stocks, just fixing NICS, which, while I strongly support both of them, will not do enough on their own. So let us not fail our country again.  I would like to ask our colleagues to immediately vote to ban semiautomatic assault rifles and bump stocks, to pass a universal background check system and close all of the loopholes, to allow the CDC to research gun violence as a cause of death, to close the gun show loophole, and to finally make gun trafficking a Federal crime.

36,topic-id,2738,"Mr.Speaker, a very tragic thing occurred for those of us[[Page H3090]]who care about constitutional rights yesterday. It is a continuation of the travesty that is coming out of the so-called special counsel Robert  I am not aware of anybody else in the House or Senate who was as absolutely concerned and livid as I was when I heard about the appointment of Robert Mueller as a special counsel because, from my questioning of the man and from my research from questioning the man during judiciary hearings, I believe he has done more damage to the FBI than all of the FBI Directors put together since Edgar                              {time}  2015  He ran off thousands and thousands of years of experience from the FBI in his goofy 5-year up-or-out policy. It works in some areas, but not in law enforcement. That is the one area where law enforcement needs time to build credibility with local law enforcement.  But anyway, these guys were--most of them that he ran off with thousands and thousands of years of experience during his first 10 years, which is the requisite term set up for an FBI Director--those guys were trained to recognize radical Islamist characteristics as to what they were studying, what they believed, things they did, and that was a very helpful thing for the FBI to know.  They began, I guess really got on track after the attempted--well, actually, the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993. It was incredible, the amount of information the FBI had discerned about radical Islam during the prosecution of The Blind Sheikh, led by Andrew McCarthy, a brilliant lawyer. He was a fantastic prosecutor. I believe Mr.McCarthy said yesterday, in an interview, that he had three prosecutors helping him with what, at that time, was the most important and high-level prosecution of radical Islamist terrorism in our country.  Since then, back in 2008, there was prosecution and conviction of principles involved in the Holy Land Foundation who were convicted for supporting terrorism. The FBI gathered that evidence as well.  Yet, under Robert Mueller, who came in immediately before 9/11--you would have thought that this man would have enough wisdom after seeing the tragedy befall thousands of Americans--what does he do? He crawls in bed with CAIR, one of the named coconspirators in the Holy Land Foundation trial, along with others, and wants to placate them at all costs.  They wanted his training materials that helped FBI agents understand what to look for in trying to find radical Islamist terrorists. They wanted those materials purged, cleaned out of anything that might help educate our FBI agents as to what to look for in radical Islamists, and FBI Director Robert Mueller obliged.  And there was nothing that, I think, draws the distinction about how wrongheaded he was as FBI Director than his responses when I was asking him about the heads-up that they had gotten over the Tsarnaev older brother who was the main Boston bomber, killed and maimed so many people, totally preventable if Robert Mueller had allowed his agents to know what to look for.  But in frustration, I said: You didn't even go out to the mosque to find out if they had been radicalized. You didn't go out there to find out about the Tsarnaevs at the mosque where they worshipped.  He said they did go out to those mosques in their outreach program. It is where they go play patty-cake, sit around, maybe have a meal together on the floor, something like that. And that is great. That is fine to do. It is a good thing to do. But not when you are ignoring your law enforcement function that will prevent so many people in Boston from having their lives tragically ended or tragically altered and a living hell imposed upon them.  But that was our Robert If you go back to his days as the acting U.attorney in Boston when, even after it was clear to most everybody else that the FBI had helped frame Whitey Bulger, the mob boss' competitors, and put four in prison, it was clear to most everybody at that point the FBI framed these guys. They didn't do it. And yet Mueller was still riding the parole board demanding that they not let them out on parole, which ended up costing the people of Boston and Massachusetts over $100 million for Mueller's horrible aide.  The taxpayers of the United States paid less of a price for the years of harassment that Robert Mueller, with his sidekick, James Comey, did zeroing in on Hatfill as the person who was spreading bioterror. I think they only paid about $6 million as a result of Mueller's intensity on pursuing the wrong guy, against whom there was not one shred of any evidence that could ever be used.  The only thing they had to justify the many years of torture that the FBI put Hatfill through was when two dogs--which were later found to have been totally bogus in spotting anything--when they went by Hatfill, he rubbed their ears, and they seemed to have reacted favorably to having their ears rubbed. That was the only so-called evidence Robert Mueller ever had, and he was relentless.  One thing you have got to give Robert Mueller credit for, he is consistent.  He has destroyed so many lives. He has cost people their lives, but he never apologizes. He always hides behind the words that he is doing his job when he goes about destroying innocent people's lives.  Alan Dershowitz, I disagreed with him so many times on policy matters, but he understands the So does Jonathan As Dershowitz said, he didn't vote for Donald Trump, but he sees what is happening. And he points out in an article published today in The Hill, he says: ``There is much speculation as to the significance of the search of the offices and hotel room of President Trumps lawyer, Michael To obtain a search warrant, prosecutors must demonstrate to a judge that they have probable cause to believe that the premises to be searched contain evidence of crime. They must also specify the area to be searched, the items to be seized and, in searches of computers, the word searches to be used.''  The problem is there has to be probable cause established by sworn evidence to justify a warrant. And when anyone gets a warrant to go after a lawyer of someone that law enforcement wants to target the way Mueller and Rosenstein want to target Donald Trump, there has got to be probable cause put in the affidavits.  These guys have gotten so used to sending out bogus national security letters like subpoenas. We found out that while Mueller was at the FBI, the IG says there may have been thousands of letters sent out with no basis in fact. This was under Mueller's direction at the  He may not have known individual letters, but he let things get out of control because, in his mind, when he or any of the people working for him are going after people they think are bad guys, it doesn't matter what they do. They are in the right. And that is exactly how you can lose a constitutional republic that we have.  Dershowitz says: ``I believe we would have been hearing more from civil libertarians--the American Civil Liberties Union, attorney groups and privacy advocates--if the raid had been on Hillary Clinton's lawyer. Many civil libertarians have remained silent about potential violations of President Trump's rights because they strongly disapprove of him and his policies. That is a serious mistake, because these violations establish precedents that lie around like loaded guns capable of being aimed at other targets.''  ``What else does the raid tell us?''  He says: ``It seems likely that special counsel Robert Mueller is bifurcating the investigation: He will keep control over matters relating to Russia, the campaign and any possible obstruction. But he has handed over to the U.attorney for the Southern District of New York any matters relating to Trump's personal and business affairs.''  Well, I would submit to you, having been a prosecutor, defense attorney, felony judge, chief justice, that normally when somebody in law enforcement raids a lawyer's office--and in this case, office, home, and, since they were out of the home while it was being apparently remodeled, they raided the hotel room. When a raid on a lawyer's office--and especially personal lawyers--occurs, the guys raiding that are lawyers know, if they find something, even if it is a potential defendant telling his lawyer, ``I am guilty as sin''--we know that didn't happen in[[Page H3091]]this case because President Trump knows he is not guilty. But even if the target had said that to his lawyer, judges ultimately--even if it has to go to the Supreme Court, that is not going to be admissible. That is going to be protected by the attorney-client privilege.  That is why every defendant who people suspect told his lawyer exactly what he did doesn't have that lawyer's office raided because, if this system of justice is going to work, there has to be two adversarial sides that do the very best they can as long as it is ethical and it is constitutional, following the law.  So the attorney-client relationship means something. It is protected. Courts have made that clear. It doesn't matter what you have got that went between the attorney and client. Now, there were those who say: Well, but, you know, the law, if they are both engaged in fraud, then together--well, you still have got an attorney-client problem with admissibility.  And that is why, normally, when someone in law enforcement raids a lawyer's office trying to target their client, they are looking for something that they can use against that lawyer, hopefully, maybe a bunch of violations, no matter what it is, they can use against that lawyer that doesn't have an arguably protected status of attorney-client, just something to do with the lawyer, so that they can tell that lawyer: Here is what we have got now. We had what we believe was a lawful search, and while we were searching, we found all of this stuff that shows you have committed other crimes. So you are looking at going for life or 1,000 years, whatever it is they happen to use in that particular case. However, if you will simply testify that your client violated the law, you don't go to prison at all. You stay rich. Everything looks good for you. It is only your client who suffers.  Well, in this case, it would be a constitutional republic going down the toilet. Mueller doesn't care. He has shown that over and over. He let Eric Holder get away with all kinds of things--some would say even murder in the Fast and Furious operation where one of our own agents died and potentially hundreds of others across the border died as a result of Eric Holder's Department's actions. But they covered up.                              {time}  2030  But they covered up. They obfuscated how they had violated the law that resulted in death.  Eric Holder said recently in the press about how he knows Mueller and that Mueller is going to get Trump on something.  There is a reason President Obama extended the horrendous 10 years that Mueller was FBI Director for 2 extra years. Any of my colleagues who really want to go back and see who Mueller is and what he did, I can show you. There is plenty to show the damage that this man has done to our country.  He served valiantly in He deserves awards. But that doesn't give him the right to ruin my country after he gets back, and that is what he has been doing. He is bringing us to the brink of a terrible constitutional crisis.  I think he is also trying to provoke the President to firing Mueller because Mueller knows he doesn't have anything right now. This is a last-ditch effort to try to find something, try to get something, get somebody to testify against the President, even if it is a lie just as it was that put Sergeant Derrick Miller in prison for life whose parole hearing I came back and testified before last week. It is not that hard to get people to testify to a lie against somebody else when you are threatening to take everything they care about away.  Rosenstein needs to be stopped. He was involved in the original Russia uranium investigation as a U.attorney. He should never have been allowed to appoint a special counsel. If Rosenstein had any decency and ethics about himself, he should have told Jeff Sessions: I am not the guy who can do this because I was involved in that Russia uranium investigation that enriched Hillary Clinton's foundation $145 million; I can't do this.  But since he is not ethical, he is not moral, and he doesn't mind keeping the limitations running while they are looking elsewhere rather than at him and Mueller who is also the FBI Director involved in that Russia investigation where Russia was trying to get our uranium, neither one of them should have been able to accept.  Rosenstein has got to go, and his assistant who so often keeps the good people who supported President Trump in the dark, Tash Gauhar, she needs to go. She needs to go, and Rosenstein should follow right out the door. Those people are doing more damage over there. They have got to go, and then we can try to salvage this country and our constitutional  By the way, tomorrow we are voting on a balanced budget amendment. I came up here wanting a balanced budget amendment, and Congress wanted it passed here, in the Senate, and across the Nation, but I saw very quickly how easy it was to raise revenue--taxes, fees, whatever you want to call it--and if we don't have a spending cap on a balanced budget amendment, it is a prescription for ratcheting up the level of spending taxing, spending taxing, because we just can't get people to vote for real cuts.  We vote to slow the rate of spending sometimes, but real cuts, we couldn't even vote to do that. We had the horrendous thing called the sequestration that gutted our military which we have been trying to make up for. But every time, we add hundreds of billions of dollars just to do what is right by the military.  Now, to cover for the horrendous omnibus that gave Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi big smiles because of all that they were awarded during that horrendous vote is a huge mistake. I guess it is a cover-our-rear type of action, but it doesn't cover anything. It is like a hospital gown. You only think you are covered. This doesn't cover anything.   Bob Goodlatte has a good balanced budget amendment that includes a spending cap, but that is not the one we are going to be allowed to vote on. We are not going to be allowed to bring an amendment to put a spending cap on this bill. That is why I voted against it last time.  People say: Oh, but you don't have to worry. There is protection in this against things like that terrible omnibus.  Oh? What is the protection?  Oh, if you look--and I did--it says that it will require three-fifths of a vote from the House and Senate to set aside the requirements of the balanced budget amendment and to raise revenue. So to raise revenue, we have got to have a 60 percent vote; and in that horrendous omnibus, it passed with 60.5 percent of the vote.  This terrible balanced budget amendment we are voting on is such a farce. It would not have even stopped us from hurting future generations in this last omnibus bill. It still would have passed even if the balanced budget amendment we are voting on tomorrow were a part of the Constitution already.  Then you say it won't take effect for 5 years. The Senate is not going to take it up. This is to try to make us look conservative after the omnibus bill. I am sorry, Mr.Speaker, I want a balanced budget amendment that means something, not a hospital gown bill.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-04-10-pt1-PgH3089.txt,1801,"BILLY'' F. GRAHAM, JR.",2018.0,10.0,April

318,topic-id,5568,"Madam Speaker, I come into the conclusion of a very interesting day and week. Our current Speaker of the House, of course, has announced that he is not going to be seeking reelection. I think he made it clear before he was elected Speaker that he really wasn't seeking the position. He didn't really want the position. He had other things in mind. He enjoyed his chairmanship, but he ended up stepping up to the plate, being elected And for his willingness to serve, he is to be applauded.  I have appreciated having a Speaker who, even when we disagreed, I knew he always tried to be honest and was somebody that wanted to do the right thing. So I appreciate that very much. We hadn't always had that, and I appreciated having that from Speaker Paul  Some of my colleagues have said: ``Gee, Louie, we have gotten calls saying you ought to run for Speaker again.'' And so I really appreciate that, but I need to make clear: Back in December of 2014, after the Speaker--at that time, John Boehner--had pushed through a CR/Omnibus bill that immediately broke many of the promises that got Republicans elected back to the majority in November of 2014, after the promises, so many of our promises and the Speaker's promises were broken in that December 2014 CR/Omnibus, a number of us realized, we have got to have a new We can't go through 2 years like this, these kinds of outrageous, broken promises with the country suffering under ObamaCare, so many problems that were before us.  So we began to try to get enough We did the numbers. We knew that if all of the Republicans voted, we needed 29 Republicans to vote for any living person to be Speaker who was not the current Speaker, John  And we tried for like 3 weeks. We couldn't get more than nine people to agree to vote for someone other than John The vote was coming up on the House floor on Tuesday, and on Friday night I got a call from Thomas Massie and Jim Bridenstine, two of the finest people who ever served in Congress--two of the smartest as well, people of real integrity. And Thomas said, ``Louie, Jim had a brilliant idea, and we need to talk to you about it.''  And Jim Bridenstine, who, like I say, was brilliant, served our Nation in the Air Force, graduated from Rice University, which has rather high standards of intelligence to be admitted. And Jim said: ``Hey wait, Thomas, would you repeat that part about a guy from Rice having a brilliant idea, you being a guy from MIT?''  And anyway, they got on and they said: ``We are stuck with nine people. We can't get past nine people. We need[[Page H3138]]29 Republicans to vote for somebody besides Speaker Boehner.'' And if we can get to 29, of course, that was our goal. The whole goal, though--to make a full disclosure--the plan was, if we could get 29 Republicans to vote for somebody besides John Boehner, then that would throw it into a second ballot for the first time since 1923.                              {time}  1830  There was some point back in the 1800s, mid-1800s, when they had over 60 ballots cast before they elected a But that was a goal, and we knew if we got 29 and we got to a second ballot, then we could call for an emergency conference among the Republicans, go down and meet in HC-5 downstairs, and we knew the 29 of us would be belittled, fussed at, and yelled at.  I could say: Look, you can yell at us and call us whatever names you want, but we are not changing our vote. So let's agree to a compromise  By that afternoon, we expected to have a compromise There were a number of potential people who would have been acceptable. That was the plan.  Thomas, Jim, and I, all three, knew that if I announced, then there would be an awful lot of people in our party who would hate me for the rest of my life or their life, whichever came first. The point that Thomas and Jim made was that we have a number of our Members who have been hearing from constituents who have said: Look, we want you to vote for somebody besides John Boehner for There had been a poll done that showed that, as I recall, 61 percent of nationwide Republican voters across the country wanted somebody besides John Boehner as  So as some of our Members heard from constituents saying to vote for anybody but They said: I would. I would vote for anybody but John Boehner if someone else formally announced. But no one has formally announced, so I am not just going to throw my vote away, and that would satisfy their constituents.  Thomas' and Jim's point was that, if you announce, then they will hear from all of those thousands of constituents saying: Hey, you said if somebody announced, and now a Republican has announced, so keep your promise and vote for somebody besides  The thinking of Thomas and Jim was that, if we do that and you announce, then that would make those guys so uncomfortable that had been promising I would vote for anybody but Boehner if somebody announces, that we could finally get to the 29. We have been stuck on nine for weeks now.  So I had asked them to let me give it some thought overnight. The next morning, there was a conference call already scheduled with all nine of us. I said: Let's talk about it in the morning and give me a chance to think about it.  What occurred to me is what I told the other eight Members who had agreed to vote for somebody besides the current Speaker, John Boehner: Look, guys, I have given this a lot of thought. If I am the only one who announces, then you will have both mainstream media and you will have Republican and Democratic reporters casting this as an election between this crazy guy from Texas, even though I feel quite certain that I scored much, much higher than my opponent would have at that time. They will say that he is crazy, and poor John Boehner is dealing with this crazy guy.  I said that what occurred to me is that, if one of you guys sent out word that you were announcing, then I could ask FOX News if I could come on to announce, and during the announcement I could make clear that this isn't about me being It is about getting a different So-and-so announced yesterday; somebody else may announce tomorrow. It is about getting a new  Ted Yoho said: Well, Louie, if that is all it will take to get you to announce, I will send out an announcement this afternoon announcing that I am running for  I said: Ted, if you announce you are running for Speaker, send out that announcement today. As soon as it goes out, I will call FOX News to see if I can come on.  That all happened. Ted sent out the press release. I called FOX News, and they let me on early that morning. I made it back from Dallas to Tyler in time to go to church, and the struggle was on.  But I knew, and all eight of our other patriot Republicans in the House knew, that by my announcing formally as a candidate for Speaker, which would bring about so much response from their constituents demanding that Members vote for somebody besides Boehner now that somebody has formally announced, those people who were made to feel very uncomfortable because of my announcement and the wrath they heard from constituents, some would probably never forgive me and would be angry with me. It would mean that I would never be able to be elected to any position. Even if we had a dogcatcher in the House, I could never get elected to that after I worked to have made that many people angry.  And I made a lot of people angry. People were calling by the thousands up here. I had many Members tell me they had gotten over 1,000 calls from constituents saying: Vote for  There was one article that got it right, that reported accurately that I was overheard a number of times saying: Look, guys, you know that Boehner is going to be mad at you if you don't vote for him; but you know he is going to be doubly mad at you if you vote for me because of how strongly he feels about me. So vote for anybody. You pick a living person and name them as your vote. We have got to have 29. If we get 29, we will have a compromise candidate for Clearly, it would never be me after I made that many people angry.  So overnight, Sunday night, we started getting new people to pledge that they were willing to vote for someone besides I encouraged people to vote for somebody besides me so you don't make Boehner totally mad.   Jim Bridenstine said: Louie, I am going to nominate you on the floor, and all I would ask is that you at least vote for yourself if I am going to nominate you so that I am not the only one voting for you.  He had been hearing me tell others to vote for anybody but me; it is fine. We just need to get to 29.  So I said: Absolutely, If you are gutsy enough to stand up and nominate me for Speaker, I will absolutely vote for myself so that you don't look, in some way, lame.  I will always treasure and appreciate the words that Jim Bridenstine said and the things that he spoke during his nomination, even during so much of the uproar against me by some of my colleagues. It still warms my heart to hear what Jim Bridenstine had to say here on the floor about me.  He has been nominated by our President to be head of Bridenstine is probably one of the smartest people to be named as head of He has been in the sky. He has served his country nobly and well, both flying planes and flying the rules of the House here in He would be an absolutely incredible asset to NASA and to this country once he is confirmed.  I had asked some other people--I imagine Jim knows--but what I have heard from other people is that it is not the Democrats who have a hold on Jim Bridenstine for head of NASA; it is actually our own Senator Marco Now, that is what I was told by some people I trust.  If that is the case, I know that Bridenstine didn't support Senator Rubio in the primary for President, but Bridenstine is one of the finest, most qualified, and most intelligent people we could ever hope to have as head of If what I was told is true, that for some reason Marco Rubio has a grudge against Jim Bridenstine, I hope that he will do the right thing, put that grudge aside, whatever it is, and get this incredibly noble and qualified man into being head of We can't keep hurting our country with these kinds of actions by  So I appreciate very much, Madam Speaker, people calling and encouraging me to run for Speaker, but I knew exactly when I announced for Speaker before, there would be people who would likely never forgive me for making their lives so uncomfortable. I had a goal. I just knew in my soul, if we didn't get a new Speaker soon, we would lose the majority at the end of 2016.  If Congress had been in such dismal shape in 2016, it would have hurt any chance we had of possibly winning the[[Page H3139]]I just knew this country was in such rough shape that we had to do that. Even though it meant people hating me and being angry at me for years to come, it was worth it to try to help my country. I was willing to do that.  So I appreciate the calls, and I appreciate the encouragement, but I was willing to sacrifice any possibility that I would ever be elected to anything by other Members of Congress in order to get a different  We ended up with Paul Ryan, and despite our disagreement on some things, I knew he was always trying to be honest, and I will always appreciate that. We all know that we did not lose the majority in the House and our failure under Speaker Boehner did not hurt us and keep us from being able to elect a Republican So I think those are good things that arose out of it, but now we need to be looking ahead for the future.  I do think that people--unlike me--who might have a chance to be elected Speaker and who have not done things like anger my colleagues by announcing back in 2015, people who have a chance need to put together a plan of action, something like a Contract with America, not a farce like was put together that Speaker Boehner helped direct, which was the Pledge to As soon as we were elected after that pledge, the pledge was abandoned by Speaker  We need an agreement: You reelect us to the majority, here are the things we are going to do, and then do them.  I appreciate what my friend  Thomas Massie said to a reporter earlier this afternoon. The reporter was demanding of Congressman Massie what he saw would ultimately be the result of a race for  Thomas Massie said: Well, I see this race for Speaker a lot like There are many, many laps to go, and I am sure there will be some spectacular crashes before we finish that race.  So I think that could very well be the case. There are many, many laps to go in the race for Speaker that we didn't even know about until this morning, and Thomas is probably right. There will probably be some spectacular crashes along the way in that race to be We just need people who believe in the power of prayer to be praying for an honest and honorable Speaker who will follow the right plan, and then we will go from there.  Also, I want to touch on this incredible investigation not of a crime--we have long since gotten past a special counsel, Special Counsel Mueller, investigating a crime which, under laws and regulations, is a requirement to even appoint a special counsel. You have to have a crime in order to have a special counsel. As we found out, there was no crime that could be pointed to, yet they raised the question maybe the Trump campaign somehow colluded with  As we have heard from Comey and so many others, there is no evidence of Donald Trump colluding with Russia or the Trump campaign to change the outcome of the election.                              {time}  1845  So what the special counsel's job has morphed into, illegally, I might add, is the special counsel no longer being in pursuit of a specified crime in the appointment of special counsel to investigate; but he now has a person target, Donald Trump, and he has taken his job to be search everything you can, now raid his lawyer's office so that you can try to find some crime unrelated to Donald Trump that you could use in evidence to prove against his lawyer, Michael  And then, once we have found sufficient crimes, we will tell Michael Cohen: Okay, we have got evidence that will put you in prison for life, or 1,000 years, whatever they are going to do, unless you agree to tell us something--don't care if it is true or untrue; we need you to say it is true--that Donald Trump committed a crime, and then we won't prosecute you.  That has to be what that big raid was all about, because even if Donald Trump told his attorney, Mr.Cohen, anything that had to do with a potential crime for which Mr.Cohen was representing him, they could not introduce that. That would be privileged, covered by the attorney/client relationship, the privilege. I know absolutely, without any question in my mind, that Donald Trump never made a question admitting guilt in anything because he certainly convinced me that he is not guilty of anything. Nothing that has been proven.  But as The Heritage Foundation established in recent years, there are so many laws that carry criminal penalties that incorporate regulations that unelected bureaucrats have put in place so that if you violate a regulation, then you could be convicted, put in prison.  We have had hearings in prior years in Judiciary The estimate is probably over 5,000 Federal crimes. And we are not even sure how many there are, but probably over 5,000. And so many of them incorporate regulations: If you violate the regulation promulgated by this agency or department, then you are guilty of a crime, and you can go to prison.  So we heard some horror stories; such as, the gentleman, nerd, up in the northwest trying to create some kind of new, better battery. And he knew the laws and the requirements how to take care of chemicals, and he was very fastidious in doing that, followed the law, legal requirements, on keeping chemicals that he used to try to develop this battery. And one day he is driving along in his little fuel-efficient, small car, and he has three suburbans swoop up: one behind, one in front, one to the side. They force him off the road. They grab him out of his little car, throw him to the ground, boot in the back, handcuff him. He had no idea what he had done, and he didn't learn for quite some time.  But he had sent some chemical to Alaska to be used to help research what he was trying to establish in making a new battery. This was my understanding from the testimony we had at the hearing. So, since he was sending something by mail to Alaska, then, under venue statutes, that allowed the U.attorney to prosecute either in his home State, in the continental U.S., or in Alaska; and since he really wasn't friends with anybody in Alaska, they drug him up to Alaska, threw him in jail there with a high bond for no reason other than the Justice Department being ruthless.  And they tried this man for committing the heinous crime of violating a regulation that required, if someone sent this particular substance through the mail, it had to go by ground. He knew that. He checked the box to mail by ground only. He didn't realize that even when you check the box ``by ground only'' there was a regulation that said that wasn't good enough; you also had to get this Federal stamp to put on there that had a picture of an airplane with a line across the airplane so that it wasn't supposed to be taken in the air.  He got thrown to the ground, badly abused, taken to jail in Alaska, tried for a Federal felony because he didn't put a little sticker on with a plane with a line through it. Well, the jury did the right thing. They did a jury nullification and found him not guilty, although technically he was guilty of not putting that little sticker on there. They felt like he had been punished enough. They found him not guilty.  So he was ready to go home, but the Justice Department was so angry that he had been acquitted that they looked for anything to try to keep him incarcerated. And what they came up with was another statute that said, if anyone ever leaves certain substances unattended for so many days, then they are strictly liable, they are guilty of a Federal felony of abandoning these chemicals. And there is no defense for the fact that you were kept away from those chemicals 100 percent involuntarily, against your will.  So, as I understood from what we got at our hearing, he ended up being convicted of abandoning these chemicals, even though he didn't abandon them. The Justice Department was guilty of that, not him. But those were the regulations. They were properly stored, but he was forced to go to He couldn't stay there with his chemicals, and he went to prison for that.  Now, I bring all that up to say that there are probably thousands of cases like that. We heard about a number of others. And The Heritage Foundation's point was that probably most Americans have committed Federal felonies we don't even know about because of some technical violation like that gentleman had that ended up with him being incarcerated for 18 months or so.[[Page H3140]]  So if we abandon the constitutional approach to proving crimes in America that you are innocent until proven guilty and that judges are not allowed to give search warrants, or even arrest warrants, unless--well, for search warrants, under the Fourth Amendment, items are described with particularity that are to be searched for, and the area to be searched is identified with particularity. You have got to be specific.  And in this case, we have a special counsel who is out of control. I have told the President, I have said in the media: Mueller should be investigated himself. And I can't help but think that Rosenstein, as deputy attorney general, and Mueller, as special counsel, are running out the clock on statutes of limitation for any crimes they may have committed in stifling the investigation under Rosenstein's control as U.attorney and Mueller's control as FBI Director into Russia trying to gain control over American uranium.  And we also know that Comey has admitted he leaked information, which should be pretty easy to prove is a crime. He admitted it. He should be investigated. Each time Mueller's special counsel team has leaked information, it most likely has been a crime as well, for which Mueller needs to be investigated and held to account.  Each time there has been a leak about the President that contained information that it was a crime to leak, Mueller should have been all over that. But the trouble, we know, if he were to be investigating the most obvious crimes being committed, then he would be most likely under arrest himself.  We need to know: Rosenstein and Mueller, were they complicit in helping ensure that Russia would end up with such a sizable amount, 20 percent or so, of our uranium? They had a person under cover that was giving them information showing that Russians were committing crimes; and, as far as we can tell, they made sure nothing was done so that nothing would prevent some of the Cabinet members approving the sale of U.uranium. That needs to be investigated.  The leaks that we know have been committed that are crimes, they need to be investigated. Obviously that is going to take a second counsel, a special counsel. And no, even appointing a current U.attorney somewhere to investigate the special counsel and Comey and Rosenstein, it is going to have to be outside of the current Justice Department, outside the current U.attorney.  And it seems pretty clear to me, no one would need as many of the heartless prosecutors as Mueller has hired. It is obvious he is on a witch hunt. Seemed pretty obvious to some of us that, by his outrageous activity in raiding a lawyer's office, he was probably hoping the President would fire That is an indication he really doesn't have anything; he has gotten desperate and is trying to manipulate lawyer Cohen and, in the alternative, trying to get evidence that they could use to squeeze Cohen to get him to testify, even creating a crime if he has to. That seems pretty serious.  But you look at the history of what Robert Mueller has been engaged in, the way he destroyed the life of Ted He probably would still be a Senator today and be alive were it not for Robert Mueller's                              {time}  1900  And what of the supervising FBI agent who we found out had helped manufacture evidence and hid evidence that proved Ted Stevens was innocent--not just a reasonable doubt, definitely proving he was innocent? Well, she continued on with the I don't know if she is still with them, but the person who was the whistleblower was run out of the FBI pretty quickly. He was notified he would not be allowed to investigate any more criminal cases, which means he has got to get out.  So Mueller made sure the guilty, malicious prosecuting FBI agent was rewarded and the honest, honorable FBI agent was punished. We saw what he did to Hatfill, who was not guilty of any crime, yet Mueller was incessant in trying to establish that he was guilty for a number of years without any proof whatsoever. And that is, of course, why Hatfill ended up with a $6 million or so settlement from the Federal  But the great consistent thing about Robert Mueller--no matter how many lives he destroys, how many people, like the two in Boston who died in prison of a crime that Mueller's FBI agents he was supervising had totally framed--he was still there at the end trying to keep them from being paroled, even till eventually they ended up with a $100 million-plus settlement--but no matter how many lives he destroys, how many people he pushes for malicious prosecution, how many businesses he may jeopardize, his great consistency is he never apologizes. It doesn't matter who he destroys or what he destroys. He won't ever apologize.  And you got to really admire a guy who is so strong-headed that despite any crimes that he or those working for him may commit or people who may die, as happened at Boston as he refused to adequately investigate the--twice, the tip that was given twice by Russia that the older Tsarnaev was a radical Islamist and going to kill people. Under Mueller, he made sure that FBI agents purged the training material, and then he made sure that--from what agents have told me, they make you, as an FBI agent, feel like that if you receive a complaint or a notice that an American citizen has noticed suspicious activity by somebody who says appears to be a practicing Muslim, but they are gathering guns, maybe gathering materials to build bombs or like the guns out in San Diego, what Mueller made sure his agents were trained to know when they got a complaint about a potential radical Islamist threat is it tells you that the person making the complaint or giving the information about a potential radical Islamist terrorist is an Islamophobe and you really need to investigate the person making the complaint about or giving the information about the potential terrorist, that is who you need to investigate. As I have been told by former FBI agents, it was like Mueller made us look under every rock for Islamophobes rather than looking for radical terrorists.  What a legacy. It will be in history books in years to come. Not current ones. Because as long as the Federal Government is involved in education, history is not taught, and when it is, so often it is not taught appropriately, but perhaps it is after the rise and fall of the United States, but at some point history books will record how amazing it was that America could select a special counsel who had done so much damage, blinding the FBI of its ability to see what a radical Islamic terrorist was doing, and maliciously prosecuting people, and they are going to say: Are these potential indications of the fall of the civilization that rewards people who are not actually defending the country but prosecuting patriots within the country? It is a very interesting time.  I don't think we have to get to that. I think if we can get a second special counsel to investigate Comey; his mentor and bosom buddy, Robert Mueller; and Mr.Rosenstein--I mean, for heaven's sake, we find out that Mr.Rosenstein not only was involved in the Russian investigation, knew that they were trying to illegally obtain U.uranium, but that he also signed at least one of the requests for a warrant extension on a Trump campaign member, even when he knew that it was salacious allegations, that the allegations were not verified, and that the Clinton campaign was behind the production, as was a foreign intelligence agent out for hire who also hated Donald  So, I mean, for heaven's sake, Mr.Rosenstein obviously committed at least one fraud upon the FISA court, which brings me back around again to the point: I think it is time to get rid of the FISA courts. Let's go back to having Federal courts that can be trusted but just can't make everything secret.  Let's make sure that we have a legitimate judge who can't be sure that everything will be so secret that he or she feels comfortable just granting 99.9 percent of the requests. I know I have read the one that was made for a warrant to get Verizon to disclose all of its information about all of its customers; and when I read the affidavit that came out from WikiLeaks and I read the application, I was astonished.  It burst my bubble of thinking we could trust the FISA courts because there was no particularity. It said, just[[Page H3141]]basically, we don't know of any crimes being committed, but we do need every Verizon customers' records, and that is what the application said. Yeah, we just need every--we need a warrant to require Verizon to give us every customers' records, all the records they have got.  And the judge, a nominated and confirmed Federal judge just signed off on it. Oh, sure, you want every record. No crime has been committed. There is no particularity of describing a particular thing to be seized or a person who has committed a crime or anything like that, just give us all the records you have got on everybody you got records on. And the FISA court judge just signed it.  Again, I come back to the fact: any judge--Federal, State, or local--who has lawyers come before that court and commit a fraud upon the court, as blatant as was committed in extending, getting a search warrant and continuing a search warrant on a member of the Trump campaign, even though it was such a brief time, and four times they got that warrant, extended three times, apparently, and the judges are not outraged enough to call the lawyers to account?  Well, we find out at least one of the parties involved was apparently dear friends with the Federal judge, so I guess, to that Federal judge, if you are a dear friend and you lie to the judge or you participate in the fraud upon the court, it is okay, because you are friends; whereas, an honorable, upright, honest American would be outraged that a friend would participate in a fraud upon the court.  But until we can see that the FISA courts can be trusted, I think we need to come back to that issue. We need to redesign courts. Yes, I know there are agents in this world who want to destroy the United States of America and our freedom, and some things would need to be done in camera, some records would need to be sealed, but we can't keep doing this where FISA judges can make outrageously unconstitutional rulings, granting warrants, and no accountability.  And the thing here is, I would be saying this if this were being done to a I would be saying this if it were done, you know, to anybody. It is just so wrong, and I am hoping that eventually, at some point, some of my friends across the aisle will say: Wait a minute, we can't keep allowing the United States Department of Justice to be spying on American citizens. We surely can go a ways further as a nation before we become quite so Orwellian as has occurred in the FISA court and in this special counsel vilification of individuals.  They have got their person. Now, I am sure they would be pleased to indict the President if they could find that perhaps he ever mailed a substance that didn't have the little sticker with the airplane on it with a line through it. They are looking for anything they can get. It is like Eric Holder said recently in an interview: I know Robert Mueller, and he won't stop until he gets something on Trump--something like that.  I think he is right. It is time to fire It is time to have Rosenstein, Mueller, and Comey investigated. It is time to get down to what we know has been occurring, that it so clearly appears to be Federal felonies.

1339,topic-id,1372,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for such great words of encouragement. I was hearing it all across east Texas as I was all over the district this past week. People are encouraged when it comes to the economy. People are feeling better about the economy. I am hearing it.  They are encouraged, but after yet another school shooting, another mass shooting, I am hearing more and more people who are asking: Why? Why is this?  Of course, some say, you know, the United States is the only place that mass shootings occur. Of course, that is just false. There are worse mass shootings in other parts of the world.  Some say if we get rid of all guns in the country, then we could end the senseless violence, but when you try to tell that to people who were in Rwanda during the period when 800,000 people or so were slaughtered with machetes for the most part, it goes beyond the question of the weapon.  We have seen airplanes used as bombs for the worst mass execution in our country's history. Of course, Pearl Harbor, bombs were used, bombs themselves. We know in Oklahoma City, apparently it was anhydrous ammonia, fertilizer. We have seen the Boston bombing utilizing pressure cookers.  So if the answer is to get rid of the weapons, we got to get rid of airplanes. We got to get rid of rental trucks. We[[Page H1263]]got to get rid of fertilizer. Pressure cookers have got to go. Machetes have got to go. Once you start listing the things by which people with evil intent have killed others, you realize this is an endless list. There are people who have exacted violence on others all kinds of ways.  There is nothing more senseless and ignorant. And I don't mean that mean-spirited. I mean that everybody is ignorant of something; some are just ignorant of a lot more things. But the statement that, ``I just want Congress to do something even if it is wrong,'' well, that is how you lose civilizations, by doing something even if it is wrong. But there are plenty of indications, things that we can do, things we can agree on.  It seems absolutely senseless that a school would know about a student who is repeatedly involved in violence, threats upon other students, threats upon other people, but actually not just threats, actual violence. We want to look into this to see if this is really a national phenomenon that some of our schools, to avoid having students continue to be arrested, that they actually try some mediation process so they avoid giving a 17-, 18-year-old student an arrest record, which once they have an assault that is confirmed in court, then certainly that would affect their ability to get a gun at all of any kind.  So, actually, when you start analyzing all of the ways that the system broke down and didn't work, the things that should have protected those precious lives in Parkland, Florida, instead of saying, ``Just do something even if it is wrong,'' how about if we do something that is right? How about if we do something that would actually prevent that kind of senseless violence from being exacted upon innocent people?  I mean, we got a sheriff that I don't know what kind of a department this guy is running. I know when there was a shooting involving a domestic case--and until terrorist activities and mass shootings started occurring, most often if there was violence at a courthouse, it was over a domestic affairs case.  I saw the video. I was already in I was no longer sitting on the bench in that courthouse, but I saw the video. And as soon as there were gunshots, those deputies--I knew them; I loved them--were running to the sound of the gun. They didn't hunker behind anything. They ran to the sound of the gun.  And that has been repeated around the country. Law officers hear a gun and they run to the sound of the gun. But, apparently, it appears from what we are reading, that the sheriff there had a department that is living in pre-Columbine days.  Just like before 9/11, it was thought that if your plane is highjacked, just don't create a problem; there will be negotiations when you land somewhere.  I still believe to this day there were American heroes on all four of those planes; and if the first three planes had known they were going to be used as a bomb to kill others, there were Americans that would have stepped up and stopped it just like those incredibly heroic Americans did who brought down the plane in  So I don't think it will ever happen again. There will always be people who love this country and love life so much that they would give theirs to save so many others. That is what Jesus said is the greatest love, and clearly the fourth flight had that.  But here is a story from the Florida Sun It is entitled ``School shooter Nikolas Cruz: An unending saga of disturbed behavior and red flags,'' written by Brittany Wallman, Paula McMahon, Megan O'Matz, and Susannah They document that he did things like--well, of course, we know apparently he didn't know his father. He knew his adopted father. Of course, his adopted father and mother had died. Apparently they had a wonderful home, swimming pool, lots of comforts; but he didn't have a moral compass at all. Apparently he threatened his mother, threatened his brother, violence on his brother. At least threatened violence on his own mother.  We know from this article, at least, it says the adopted father, Mr.Cruz, didn't own any guns. But Nikolas was diagnosed as having a string of disorders: depression, attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder, emotional behavior disability, and autism. His mom told the sheriff's deputies he also had obsessive-compulsive disorder and anger issues. He had counselors in school and at home, according to DCF records. He took medications. We don't know what all medications he took. Maybe there was some relationship there.  We ought to be able to discern how many of these people have taken different types of drugs and which ones they were. We know there seems to be a correlation between people committing suicide and many of the medications that are prescribed to kids who feel troubled.  This article says that Nikolas was a mama's boy, yet he threatened his mother. His mother called the police to say he got physical with his brother and with her. It sounds like a physical assault on his mother.  My late mother was close to 5-foot. I was a lot bigger than she was in high school, but, whew, I knew not to even think about raising a hand.  When he was 14, his mother reported he had hit her with a plastic hose from a vacuum cleaner. A few months later, she told deputies he had thrown her against the wall because she took away his Xbox gaming system. A year later, she told deputies Nikolas had punched the wall after she took away his Foul language, insults, disobedience, disruption.  Cruz's behavior was exactly what schoolteachers frowned upon. He went to a different school for a while which offered a program for emotionally and behaviorally disabled children, but, according to the article, Cruz could not control himself.  Now, it talked about in the article that he was 5-foot-7, 120 pounds. I know a lot about being bullied up through junior high, up through eighth grade, because I was very small. I didn't start growing of any size until high school. I may have been the smallest guy on our football team the first couple of years in high school. I know a lot about getting bullied. I know a lot about getting my nose bloodied. I never killed anybody.                              {time}  2145  I had parents that would make all four of us kids quite angry, but they taught us respect of authority.

As Ted mentioned, he was born in 1918, and married Ruth in 1943. What a dynamic couple they were. How devoted they were to each other. They had five children. I have come to know and dearly love I have met and come to know Franklin to a lesser extent.  But he knew, he believed, he preached that you don't go to Heaven by being a grandchild of someone. You have to have that personal relationship with the Lord as an individual child of It is not something you can inherit.  He has been called home.  He spent his life trying to persuade people that he loved to accept Jesus with the words that Jesus uttered:       I am the way, the truth, the light. No one gets to the      Father, but by me.  He believed with all his heart that, unless someone professed Jesus Christ as Savior, they had no chance of getting to  We know from Jesus that greater love hath no one than a man that lay down his life for his friends. We have paid tribute to people who have laid down their life in one great moment of saving others. We have heard of those type of heroic actions at the school in Parkland in trying to save others.  Yet, this man, for 99 years, or at least after he accepted Christ, laid down his life day after day after day for others, trying to help them come to a personal relationship with Jesus so that he could share eternity with Him in That is his belief. That is my belief.  Yet, several years ago, we passed what is called a hate crimes bill. I said at some point it would be used to prosecute a preacher for simply reading Scripture from the Bible, so I can't help but wonder if he has been called home so he can never be charged with a hate crime.  We live in a time when things have gotten so perverse that there are actually people who say that these evangelical Christians are so hateful, so mean, they actually believe that if you don't think exactly like they do, you go to hell.  Well, that is a perversion of the one religion that is 100 percent based on love. God so loved the world, He sent His son. His son so loved the world, He laid down His life for others.  Billy Graham has laid down his life. He has put a marker down. In his memory, we can give no greater memorial than that we persevere and we perpetuate that love in bringing others to eternal life with us.

Fifty years ago this week, 15,000 students in East Los Angeles rose up in solidarity to demand culturally relevant education, better facilities, and diverse teachers. I rise in honor of those students from Wilson, Lincoln, Roosevelt, and Belmont High Schools, who started a movement that would be known as the East Los Angeles walkouts.  I also rise in honor of current student activists everywhere. Student activism has always been a powerful response to social injustice, that when those in power fail to listen or to act in the interests of all people, it is time for a new generation of Americans to speak up, walk out, and organize.

441,topic-id,357,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, today I am pleased we are voting on H.4203, the Combat Online Predators This legislation increases the maximum criminal penalty for those who stalk children and obligates the Department of Justice to report best practices for prosecuting stalking laws at the State and local levels.  According to the National Center for Victims of Crime, approximately 7.5 million people are stalked each year. While stalking may not involve physical harm, the psychological effects from being stalked can be just as severe. Stalking victims live in constant fear of violence. They fear it will never stop.  In fact, the prevalence of anxiety, insomnia, social dysfunction, and severe depression is much higher amongst stalking victims than the general population. About half of all victims of stalking indicate that they were stalked before age 25, and about 14 percent of female victims and 16 percent of male victims experienced stalking between the ages of 11 and 17.  Mr.Speaker, the unfortunate reality is that, in the internet age, stalking our Nation's youth has become easier for predators. Predators can now harass children in their homes--the very places our children should be safest--and can even do so anonymously.  H.4203 recognizes that those who stalk minors should be subject to greater criminal penalties. The bill increases the maximum allowable prison sentence by 5 years in cases in which the victim is a minor. No child should live in constant fear for their own safety, and this bill will further deter predators from such conduct.  Stalking cases are also notoriously difficult to prosecute because they require showing repeated intentional harassment. It is important for prosecutors to be able to reference best practices in investigating and prosecuting these cases. Therefore, H.4203 requires the Attorney General to issue a report identifying best practices in bringing these cases.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to thank the lead sponsor of this legislation, Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick from This bill was approved with unanimous, bipartisan support by the House Judiciary Committee, and I urge my colleagues in the House to support this legislation.

513,topic-id,1293,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.1865, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017, and urge my colleagues to do the same.  This legislation will finally make a meaningful difference in combating online sex trafficking. For too long, bad actor websites have operated with impunity in selling young women and girls forced into the commercial sale of sex. They have, beyond any shadow of a doubt, profited off the misery of others. They have convinced courts to misapply the Communications Decency Act, a Federal law that was originally intended to encourage websites to police content and rid platforms of illegal content. They have misused the Communications Decency Act as a shield to avoid criminal liability in State courts.  Given the number of local websites that are deliberately selling women and children for sex, we must now take steps to allow Federal, State, and local prosecutors to hold these websites accountable and dismantle these illicit, heinous online markets.  H.1865 will ensure vigorous criminal enforcement against bad actor websites by creating a new Federal law to prosecute these sites and explicitly permitting States the ability to enforce comparable laws.  While the Federal code does not criminalize the knowing advertisement of sex trafficking, this statute is, unfortunately, of limited utility. Nearly all websites responsible for rampant sex trafficking advertisements host ads that rarely, if ever, state that the victim being sold is either underage or subject to force, fraud, or coercion.  Therefore, this bill takes measures to target websites that are deliberately promoting and facilitating prostitution.  Additionally, H.1865 provides for an aggravated violation that applies to websites that promote prostitution in reckless disregard of the fact that sex trafficking is occurring on their platform.  I want to highlight, Mr.Chairman, an amendment that will be offered to this legislation. Though I applaud my colleague's dedication to this issue and fully appreciate the suffering of victims, I have concerns about this amendment which states that the provisions of the bill apply regardless of whether the conduct alleged occurred or is alleged to have occurred before, on, or after such date of enactment.

Robert Goodlatte,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Mr.Chairman: This letter presents the views of the      Department of Justice (Department) on H.1865, the ``Allow      States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of      2017.'' The Department supports H.1865. We applaud House      and Senate legislative efforts to address the use of websites      to facilitate sex trafficking and to protect and restore      victims who were sold for sex online. The Department      appreciates this opportunity to provide technical assistance      to ensure that these goals are fully met through narrowly      tailored legislation. The Department also notes that a      provision in the bill raises a serious constitutional      concern.       Every day, trafficking victims in America appear in online      advertisements that are used to sell them for sex. The      Department works diligently to hold the traffickers      accountable for their crimes but faces serious challenges.      This is due in part to the high evidentiary standard needed      to bring federal criminal charges for advertising sex      trafficking, but also because the Communications Decency Act      (CDA), codified at 47 U.S.230, bars our state and      local partners from bringing any criminal action that is      inconsistent with that section. H.1865 addresses both      issues and would take meaningful steps to end the industry of      advertising trafficking victims for commercial sex.                          TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE       Section 3(a) of the bill creates 18 U.S.2421A, a      new federal offense that prohibits the use or operation of      websites (and other means or facilities of interstate      commerce) with the intent to promote or facilitate      prostitution. The bill also provides for an aggravated felony      if the defendant recklessly disregards that the crime      contributed to sex trafficking as prohibited by 18 U.S.     1591(a). Section 2421A would stand as a strong      complement to existing federal laws.       However, the Department notes that Section 2421A as      originally drafted is broader than necessary because it would      extend to situations where there is a minimal federal      interest, such as to instances in which an individual person      uses a cell phone to manage local commercial sex transactions      involving consenting adults. Therefore, the Department would      support amending the language of Section 2421A so that      Congress can clarify its intent to target traffickers using      or operating interactive computer services, as follows (with      a corresponding change to 2421A(b)): ``Whoever, using a      facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce or in or      affecting interstate or foreign commerce, owns, manages, or      operates an interactive computer service, as defined in      Section 230(f) of Title 47, United States Code, or conspires      or attempts to do so, with the intent to promote or      facilitate prostitution shall be fined under this title,      imprisoned for not more than 15 years, or both.''       The Department believes that any revision to 18 U.S.     1591 to define ``participation in a venture'' is      unnecessary. Section 1591 already sets an appropriately high      burden of proof, particularly in cases involving advertising.      Under current law, prosecutors must prove that the defendant      knowingly benefitted from participation in a sex trafficking      venture, knew that the advertisement related to commercial      sex, and knew that the advertisement involved a minor or the      use of force, fraud, or coercion. See Backpage.com, LLC v.      Lynch, D.D.C., Civil Action 15-2155, Docket 16 (24,      2016). While well intentioned, this new language would impact      prosecutions by effectively creating additional elements that      prosecutors must prove at trial. In the context of the bill,      which also permits States to bring actions for conduct      equivalent to Section 1591, we are also mindful that this      language could have unintended consequences as applied by the            Section 4 of H.1865 also sets forth critical revisions      to the CDA to permit state prosecutors to bring criminal      actions related to sex trafficking and the use of the      internet with the intent to promote or facilitate      prostitution. The Department believes that the existence of      this exception to the CDA will alter the landscape of the      industry involved in advertising prostitution.                         CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN       We note that Section 4 of H.1865 states that the changes      to the CDA ``shall apply regardless of whether the conduct      alleged occurred [sic], or is alleged to have occurred,      before, on, or after such date of enactment.'' This raises a      serious constitutional concern. Insofar as this bill would      ``impose[] a punishment for an act which was not punishable      at the time it was committed'' or ``impose[] additional      punishment to that then prescribed'' it would violate the      Constitution's Ex Post Facto Cummings v. Missouri, 4      277, 325-326 (1867); see Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U.167,      169-170 (1925); U.art I, 9, cl. 3. The      Department objects to this provision because it is      unconstitutional. We would welcome the opportunity to work      with Congress to address this serious constitutional concern.       Thank you for the opportunity to present our views in      support of this legislation. We hope this information is      helpful, and we look forward to continuing to work with      Congress on this important legislation. Please do not      hesitate to contact this office if we may provide additional      assistance regarding this or any other matter.

520,topic-id,301,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This amendment makes small but important changes to the bill.  Most significantly, the bill narrows the class of defendants covered in the new section 2421A, which criminalizes the deliberate promotion or facilitation of prostitution. As the creation of this law is designed to target bad actor websites, this amendment narrows defendants covered to those who own, manage, or operate an interactive computer service with the intent to promote or facilitate prostitution. This amendment avoids creating a broad Federal law that covers conduct that is not necessarily Federal in nature.  Second, the manager's amendment strikes language from the underlying bill's civil recovery provision that was intended to encourage victims to successfully plead their cases. However, the language could have created a risk of confusion by the courts, and so it has been removed.  Further, the manager's amendment clarifies that mandatory restitution provision is only applicable to victims of sex trafficking, not to those who voluntarily have engaged in prostitution.  Finally, the manager's amendment adds language inadvertently omitted from the original bill, which permits defendants who face an aggravated charge for promoting or facilitating more than five people to assert the statute's affirmative defense if a defendant can prove that advertisements were targeted to a locality where promotion or facilitation is legal.[[Page H1302]]  Mr.Chairman, this manager's amendment is the product of the Judiciary Committee's repeated and thoughtful effort to produce a workable and technically sound piece of legislation. This bill will do a great deal to protect victims of sex trafficking.

Democrats and Republicans can certainly find common ground on our infrastructure being deficient, degrading, and incurring accidents that are becoming all too regular.  The American Society of Civil Engineers gave America a D-plus infrastructure rating on their scorecard. New Jersey also received an overall D-plus, with rail and transit in particularly bad shape.

From administration to administration, we can't have inconsistencies or delays in implementing rail safety rules.  I am proud to have led on this bipartisan bill to secure America's rails with real safety provisions.

It does so my implementing the DOT's inspector general report and ensuring reporting to Congress on compliance.  The IG found that the Federal Railroad Administration had taken some steps to improve data reporting, but it still lacks standardized reporting and training. This bill codifies steps suggested by the IG, providing more certainty in the safety of our rails.  By allowing us to better leverage bill datasets--and the key here is putting big data to work--this bill will save lives.

400,topic-id,766,"Mr.Speaker, the President said to reporters at the White House on Monday: ``And it's a disgrace. It's, frankly, a real disgrace. It's an attack on our country, in a true sense. It's an attack on what we all stand for.''  While I agree that there has been a disgraceful attack on our country, I don't think it is the investigation that is closing in on the President, but rather his disgraceful reaction to it.  We now know, without any doubt, that the special counsel's investigation is closing in on the President and those very, very close to him. I don't think lawful warrants legally executed against the homes, office, and hotel rooms of the President's chief fixer and fellow grifter are the problem.  Rather, it is the constant threats to further obstruct justice by a sitting President, to thwart those lawful investigations from reaching their logical conclusions. That is what I and a lot of patriotic Americans are worried about.  What we find disgraceful is the President's attitude toward law enforcement and the circumstances that have led us to this moment, including the apparent dealings with the Kremlin, the campaign finance violations, the hush money payoffs to silence witnesses, and using one's elected office to influence and even try to end an investigation in which you are the target.  When he is the target, it is called disgraceful.  Before we left for the Easter break, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee made a commitment that we would be on the first plane back to Washington to initiate hearings if the President took action to further obstruct justice, including firing the Attorney General for recusing himself or the deputy attorney general or the special counsel.  The President reiterated his threats to subvert justice by firing key Justice officials this week. So I feel obligated to reiterate my commitment to defend the Constitution and the rule of law as a citizen of this  Let's be clear. Republicans have no intention of investigating, holding hearings, or taking seriously their constitutional mandate, no matter how far this President goes.  When athletes kneel during the national anthem or the former President wears a tan suit or salutes a marine while holding a cup of coffee, that is a constitutional crisis. But when the President threatens to fire the special counsel, well, you know.  We cannot rely on Republicans to defend democracy and our system of government as long as they find political and personal advantage in walking lockstep with the President, or they tremble in fear of what would be in a tweet if they stepped out of line.  And we as Democrats, well, we are in the minority, so we are almost powerless unless some of our fellow colleagues put country ahead of party.  But human beings are very resourceful and fight fiercely for their own freedom. When we are united in great numbers, we can accomplish any goal.  In Selma and elsewhere, King and others showed us that beatings, lynchings, and State-sanctioned discrimination could not withstand the power of the people fighting for justice and equality.  In turn, they inspired, in part, the resistance known as the Prague Spring in Central Europe, when people stood up to tanks and repression, and eventually the wall came down.  In Africa, the Americas, Asia, and across the Arab world, people are still fighting to secure their freedom.  And in China, the image of a lone man standing up to tanks to defend his country moved the world.  One man standing up will not be enough, but many American women and men are already heeding the call. Young people from Parkland, Florida, called us to Washington by the millions, despite viscous attacks.  Women led the way by the millions in Washington and around the world.  And when our Muslim brothers and sisters called us to the airports to oppose Trump's religious ban, we came in numbers.

711,topic-id,849,"Mr.Speaker, when we left Washington before the Presidents Day recess, we watched our colleagues in the Senate vote on a series of bills to address immigration. Only one bill received 60 votes, but it was 60 votes against the bill offered by Senator Grassley, the bill that most closely matches the President's hatred for immigrants.  So a supermajority in the Senate opposes the President's plan for massive cuts to legal immigration and massive deportations.                              {time}  1015  Then, yesterday, President Trump's campaign against immigrants received another blow. The Supreme Court declined to take a case from California[[Page H1271]]and declined to lift an injunction requiring the Department of Homeland Security to continue to process renewals for the DACA program, which means that those who signed up for DACA over the past 5 years can renew their DACA now, and the arbitrary deadline the President set for kicking 1,000 people per day out of the program beginning next Monday has, like so much of what Trump does, been stopped for now.  Just take a moment to appreciate what happened. The Attorney General and the President, without offering any evidence, told the American people that they had to end the DACA program because it was illegal and the courts would strike it down, they said.  As it turns out, the truth is almost the exact opposite of what the President and the Attorney General have told the country. No court has ever found DACA illegal or even legally suspect. Their actions to kill the DACA program have been found highly questionable by the courts.  But let me be clear, Mr.Speaker, just because the courts have taken no action and the Senate failed to take action does not mean that the House and Republicans are off the hook for The President still plans to kill DACA and make hundreds of thousands of immigrants, who are currently documented and known to our government, into undocumented immigrants forced underground--vulnerable, exploitable, and deportable.  The House has an opportunity--indeed, a responsibility--to step up to the occasion and craft a permanent solution. The good news is that the solution is supported by 8 out of 10 voters in the United States: a pathway to citizenship.  Can we, as a body, rise to the occasion to do something Americans want us to do? Can we set aside questions of who wins and who loses politically long enough to do what is right? We won't know unless we try.  Many on the other side say there should be only one option: leave or be deported, but that is not what we do to American children. And let's be clear, these are American children. We do not force American children to live in exile for 10, 20, 30 years. We do not educate and acculturate our youth and then force them out of the country.  If you are an American patriot, the last thing you want is for the world to see us deporting our own Just ask your donors, the Koch brothers, who know that saving the Dreamers is what they call something demanded as patriots.  So, Mr.Speaker, the ball is in our court. We need to take action now. If we can draft a compromise to protect Dreamers and allow them to live in their home country, America, if both sides concede something to the other, we may get to a solution. That is what leaders must do. A compromise will likely be painful for all. We need to show the country that we are willing to take the heat and that we are ready to legislate.  The President set us on this course. He pulled the legal rug from underneath the Dreamers and then cloaked his position on immigration in an ethnocentric, pro-European, pro-White agenda that will hurt  But the racists--and we must call them out for what they are--the racists who are driving immigration policy in the White House are defining the agenda for every House Republican and are shaping the brand of the Republican Party not just as the party opposed to illegal immigration, but, now, as the party opposed to legal immigration; not just as the party who doesn't want poor or Latin American immigrants, but doesn't want Brown or Black or anyone who isn't White in this country. If that is how my colleagues on the other side of the aisle define themselves and want to be remembered, then they should do nothing.  But I have a greater faith in this institution and in the ability of this Congress to rise above racism and to do something the American people want us to do without regard to race, religion, or national origin. I am a Democrat who will work with Republicans if Republicans are serious about reaching a solution, but it must start with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle saying: ``Yes, we want to solve the problem, and we want to rise above the racism emanating from the White House today.''

618,topic-id,933,"Mr.President, I wish to thank my colleagues for their words on this difficult, challenging topic.  On this day 2 weeks ago, the Parkland, FL, community ``took 17 bullets to the heart'' as Cameron, a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, so devastatingly put it.  Over the past years, the epidemic of gun violence has touched every aspect of American life, from schools and churches to concerts and night clubs and movie theaters, in homes and in the workplace. After each of these tragedies, we say enough is enough, yet time and again Congress fails to take action, and the discussion fades until this deadly cycle once again repeats itself. But we cannot allow this vicious cycle to continue.  Like many Americans, I have been inspired and touched by the bravery of the students of Stoneman Douglas and by their determination to create from this tragedy a legacy of positive change. They are looking to us to help ensure that they are the last students who suffer through a mass shooting. They will hold us accountable, as they should.  I have been inspired by students like Sam, who said that he doesn't feel safe in his own country and powerfully asked at the White House: ``How did we not stop this after Columbine? After Sandy Hook?''  And Emma, who has been calling out elected officials for the excuses they make for putting the priorities of the gun lobby ahead of the safety and well-being of their constituents. Emma and her classmates rightly have called these excuses  We must actually listen to these students, and we must act to protect them and all of our children.  People across New Hampshire own guns for hunting, sport, and protection. New Hampshire has a long tradition of responsible gun ownership that I respect and that I am committed to upholding. But I also know that the people in New Hampshire do not want dangerous weapons in the wrong hands. It is our job to keep our citizens safe, and we owe it to the students and survivors who are speaking out, to those whom we have lost to tragic violence, and to their families and loved ones to come together and make our communities safer.  The level of gun violence in America is a public health crisis that is unique to our Nation, and like all public health challenges, there are actions we can take to mitigate harm and save lives. We can put in place responsible, commonsense policies that will do just that.  To start, we know that the shooter in Parkland displayed warning signs that, if properly heeded and addressed, may have prevented the incident, the massacre. But when law enforcement was called because of these warning signs,[[Page S1279]]it is not clear that they had tools that would have allowed them to confiscate the shooter's weapons. So one of the things we must do is ensure that every State has what are known as red flag laws--laws which allow courts to issue time-limited restraining orders to restrict access to firearms when there is evidence that an individual is planning to harm themself or others.  It is also long past time that we improve our background check system to close loopholes and ensure that people who are already legally barred from owning guns cannot easily access them--a step that we know is supported by the vast majority of  Studies have shown the correlation between gun violence and people with a history of domestic violence. We must close loopholes that enable domestic abusers to access guns.  Additionally, for too long, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been barred from conducting public health research on gun violence. We must change that.  Finally, from banning the use of bump stocks to raising the purchasing age of semiautomatic weapons to 21, we must look at responsible steps to reduce access to deadly weapons of war that fire at high rates and inflict massive harm.  No one gun safety measure is perfect, and no gun safety measure will stop every act of gun violence, but that should not stop us from taking action. After all, we take public health measures all the time that don't prevent all diseases but vastly reduce the incidence of them.  In a country with a government of, by, and for the people, it is simply an outrage to suggest that there is nothing the people who govern themselves can do to ensure that their gun safety laws evolve as firearm technology creates weapons of increasing lethality. I also refuse to accept the notion that we cannot pass any law to address gun safety because it is too hard or the challenges are too insurmountable. That has not stopped our Nation before, and it shouldn't now.  Students in Parkland and young people across the country are speaking out and making clear that they don't want to live this way. They don't want the horror that they experienced to be inflicted on more of their peers. These young voices are speaking up and sparking a conversation that has been absent or has been pushed to the wayside for far too long. It is up to us to meet them in this moment.  The purpose of self-government is to make sure that we all do, in fact, feel safe and valued and that we each have a chance to build a life for ourselves. Let's take action to give all of our citizens those opportunities and keep our people safe from senseless acts of gun violence.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

He leaves behind not only a strong record of legislative achievement, but a legacy of love and Aloha that animated his work here in the  Senator Akaka committed his life to public service. Whether as a soldier, educator, or Senator, he dedicated himself fully to the betterment of our After graduating high school in 1942, Senator Akaka enlisted in the Army Corps of Engineers, playing a key role in critical construction projects across the Pacific Theater during World War Senator Akaka's military service was a springboard to even greater opportunities, allowing him to finance a college education through the GI bill.  As a beneficiary of this historic legislation, Senator Akaka was perhaps the greatest advocate of our troops during his time here in the Senate, writing and spearheading passage of the 21st Century GI bill. He wanted our servicemembers to have the same opportunity he had to transition into civilian life, receive an education, and change this country for the better.  With help from the GI bill, Senator Akaka earned both a bachelor's and master's degree in education from the University of For nearly two decades, he worked in Hawaii's public schools, first as a teacher and eventually as a principal. Working in the trenches of America's public education system, Senator Akaka gained the[[Page S2033]]hands-on experience he would need as a legislator to take an active role in some of the most important education reforms of modern times.  After working as both a teacher and an administrator, Senator Akaka served as the chief program planner in the department of health, education, and welfare, and eventually served as the director of the Hawaii Office of Economic The sterling reputation Senator Akaka gained in State government helped launch his legislative career, and in 1976, the people of Hawaii elected him to the U.House of He had a distinguished record as a Congressman before Hawaii elected him to the Senate in 1990.  In this chamber, Senator Akaka worked hard on behalf of our Native populations as the chairman of the Indian Affairs He also fought valiantly for our troops as the Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, ensuring that our men and women in uniform were well taken care of upon returning home.  Having served alongside Senator Akaka for more than two decades, I remember best the spirit of civility he embodied as a legislator. He was caring and kind, loving and loyal, genuine and generous to all. He represented the best of this body in his willingness to lay aside partisan differences for the good of the Although we were members of different parties, he was the kind of Senator you could work with, never letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.  I consider myself lucky to have known Senator Akaka and even luckier to have called him a friend.

570,topic-id,1447,"Mr.President, 1 week ago today I stood here and urged my colleagues on both the left and the right to lay aside their differences and work together to prevent future tragedies like that in Parkland,  It has been nearly 3 weeks since the murder of 17 students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High While time will continue to march on, our resolve to do something about school violence must grow only stronger.  Over the past 3 weeks my colleagues have put forth a number of legislative proposals. Some are recycled versions of earlier proposals, while others propose creative new ideas. Some enjoy broad bipartisan support, while others have not been widely embraced. We have seen much discussion and debate but little legislative progress. To break the impasse, we must unite on the issues where we agree.  Let today be the day that we come together to take a meaningful step toward legislation that has the potential to prevent school gun violence, save lives, and restore the sense of peace and security that all children should enjoy when they walk through the doors of their respective schools.  Today I come together with my partners on both sides of the aisle to introduce the Students, Teachers, and Officers Preventing School Violence Act, or STOP School Violence As I outlined on the Senate floor last week, the bill will make Department of Justice grants available to fund four initiatives. Last week I outlined those four initiatives, and today I would like to describe them in even greater detail.  First, the bill will provide grants to be used for evidence-based training to prevent student violence against others and self, including training for local law enforcement officers, school personnel, and students.  One kind of training this bill would fund could prevent many incidents of school violence. Over the last 25 years, research has revealed that in 7 out of 10 acts of gun violence, a friend or someone else was told that an act of violence would be committed before it happened. In one study, it was reported that in four out of five school shootings, the attacker had told people of his plans ahead of time.  We must ensure that everyone in the school ecosystem is educated to recognize the signs of a potential threat and likewise--students, teachers, and administrators--take action and follow up when they see warning signs. By building a culture in which students and teachers understand the importance of reporting possible threats of violence, this bill will save lives and help keep our communities safe.  Second, the bill will fund evidence-based technology and equipment to improve school security and prevent school violence.  After the shooting at Columbine High School nearly 19 years ago, I authored legislation that made Department of Justice grant funds available for metal detectors, locks, lighting, and other deterrent measures. The Secure Our Schools Program, which ran from 2002 through 2011, was the only Federal school safety program that exclusively provided direct funding for the purchase and implementation of security technologies to improve school safety. The legislation I am introducing today will reauthorize and build on that program to provide funding for proven school security infrastructure improvements consistent with schools' individualized needs and industry best practices. While we certainly don't need to turn our schools into fortresses, we must do more to protect our children from harm.  Third, the bill will provide funding for the development and operation of evidence-based school threat assessment and crisis intervention teams, which may include evidence-based training for school officials in responding to mental health crises. These multidisciplinary teams--based on existing staff of school personnel, administrators, law enforcement, and mental health professionals--can implement proven, evidence-based approaches like the Virginia Student Threat Assessment These guidelines, which have been documented to be effective in field tests and controlled studies, provide schools with a safe, structured, and efficient way to respond to student threats of violence. Used at thousands of schools across the country, these are the types of proactive, preventive solutions that should be available for all schools.  Fourth, the bill will authorize funding for continued coordination with local law enforcement.  These four initiatives do not operate in isolation but together are a comprehensive approach to improving school security and reducing student violence. Training students and teachers to identify and report warning signs is critical to stopping acts of school violence before they happen.  As we saw in Parkland, having folks identify warning signs is not enough. There must be a process for acting on this information when it is brought to the attention of school administrators or law enforcement officials. The school threat assessment and crisis intervention teams that could be funded through this bill will ensure that schools have an effective procedure for evaluating and responding to potential threats of school violence.  Unfortunately, no amount of prevention will ever be able to stop every act of school violence before it happens. For those hopefully rare instances where we cannot intervene ahead of time, this bill ensures that funding is available to assist schools with commonsense security infrastructure improvements to harden schools and make it more difficult for attackers to succeed. Through each step of this process, local law enforcement has an important role to play in partnering with school personnel to prevent and respond to incidents of school violence.  States are already taking the lead in these areas to ensure that our schools are safe and secure. Last week I highlighted the Safe Utah smartphone app, a statewide service that provides real-time crisis intervention to youth through texting and a confidential tip program. Since the app was unveiled in 2016, 86 planned school attacks have been stopped. Utah and other States across the country are rolling out proven solutions that prevent and reduce student violence.  We must respect the leading role of the States in this space, and we must do what we can to ensure that proven, evidence-based solutions are available to protect all students nationwide. The STOP School Violence Act will complement and magnify those efforts at the State and local level. With a requirement that States and localities contribute to the cost of these programs, my bill will authorize $75 million in fiscal year 2018 and $100 million[[Page S1341]]each year for the following 10 years. In total, that is more than $1 billion to secure our schools and train our students, teachers, and law enforcement.  Many of my colleagues have called for reforms and restrictions related to firearms--something this bill does not address. Those are important discussions, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on these and other issues. In the meantime, we need to work with what we have, and what we have in the STOP School Violence Act is good, commonsense legislation that can save hundreds of lives. I will not pretend that my bill is a catch-all solution to the problem of school violence. It is not, but it is a start. Indeed, this bipartisan proposal is the catalyst to a critical conversation that will take place in the weeks and months to come.  For far too long, we have allowed politics to get in the way of real reform. For far too long, we have been holed up in our partisan foxholes, ducking the difficult issues of the day in hopes that the problem of school violence would solve itself. For far too long, we have clung to our rhetorical weapons, but now is the time to lay those weapons aside. Now is the time to reconcile our differences for the good of our Nation and for the good of our children. As I said last week, now is not the time for argument but for action.  Rather than letting the perfect be the enemy of the good, I implore my friends on both sides of the aisle to come together for the safety of our children. Rather than resorting to recycled talking points, I ask my colleagues to heed minority leader Schumer's call to ``pass real legislation that makes a difference.'' I thought that was a good statement.  Mr.President, I wish to emphasize the singularity of the opportunity we have in front of us. My bill represents a respite from the anger and acrimony that far too often pervade our politics. It is a symbol of the great good we can accomplish when we come together in common cause. Already, dozens of my colleagues from both the left and the right have signed on to support this bill. The STOP Act is just the start we need to prevent violence in our schools, so let's come together to get this done, and I hope we can.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-05-pt1-PgS1340.txt,1351,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4790, VOLCKER RULE REGULATORY",2018.0,5.0,February

719,topic-id,1232,"Mr.President, today marks nearly 2 weeks since the murder of 17 students and staff in Parkland, May today also mark the moment that we resolved to do something about school violence. May it mark the moment that left and right determined to lay aside their differences and work together to prevent future tragedies.  To keep our children safe from harm, there is no panacea, no one legislative solution, and it disheartens me when I hear talk about what can't be done. It is time to focus on what can be done.  Fortunately, solutions on the State level--including in my home State of Utah--can help show us the way forward. Working in the realm of the possible, Utah State legislators have come together to forge bipartisan solutions to stop school violence. When I was in Salt Lake last week, I learned firsthand about the Safe Utah smartphone app. The Safe Utah crisis text and tip line is a statewide service that provides real-time crisis intervention to use through texting and a confidential tip program. Licensed clinicians from the University Neuropsychiatric Institute at the University of Utah Health respond to all incoming chats, texts, and calls 24/7 by providing supporting or crisis counseling, suicide prevention, and referral services.  The Safe Utah Program--developed with funding from the Utah State Legislature in collaboration with the University Neuropsychiatric Institute, the Utah State Office of Education, the Utah Office of the Attorney General, and the Utah Anti-Bullying Coalition--is a testament to what can be done when mental health, education, and law enforcement agencies work together to prevent student violence.  Not only is the app innovative, it works. Since the app was unveiled in 2016, 86 planned school attacks have been stopped. Think about that, 86 school attacks stopped in a relatively small That number translates to dozens of lives saved and hundreds of heartbreaks spared. For thousands of families across the State, this simple app made a world of difference. Imagine the potential if these kinds of technologies were available to students across the country. We could quickly get help for those who need it and, in the process, save countless lives.  That is why, later this week, I will introduce the Students, Teachers, and Officers Preventing School Violence Act, or the STOP School Violence My bill makes Department of Justice grants available to States to fund programs designed to reduce school violence.  To that end, the STOP School Violence Act will fund four initiatives. First, it will provide grant funding for evidence-based training to prevent student violence against others and self, including training for local law enforcement officers, school personnel, and students. This is not just active shooter training but training designed to give students and teachers the knowledge to recognize and properly respond to warning signals or signals to stop school violence before it occurs.  Second, the bill will fund evidence-based technology and equipment to improve security and prevent school violence. This includes the development and operation of anonymous reporting systems like the Safe Utah app, as well as improvements to school security infrastructure to deter and respond to threats of school violence, and, when prevention efforts fall short--as they unfortunately will in some cases--locks on classroom doors, reinforced entryways, and other commonsense security infrastructure improvements will help.  Third, the bill will provide funding for the development and operation of evidence-based school threat assessment and crisis intervention teams, which may include evidence-based training for school officials in responding to mental health crises. Again, school personnel need the tools to assess and respond to threats before they materialize, including those threats that originate from individuals struggling with mental health issues.  Finally, the bill will provide funding for continued coordination with local law enforcement. Law enforcement alone cannot prevent school violence--just as no amount of prevention training, security infrastructure improvements, or mental health resources would be able to singularly prevent tragedies like that in Parkland, but law enforcement, and in particular those officers who already staff schools, have an important role to play in any comprehensive solution to prevent school violence.  Now, some of you may point out something my bill will not address, and that is guns. On this issue, many reforms have been proposed over the last 12 days--some old and some new. I believe we can find common ground here, too, such as that outlined in the bipartisan Fix NICS Act, which ensures that our background check system is operating as designed.  A background check is only as good as the records in the database. The FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System is currently incomplete because many Federal agencies and States have not provided all records that establish someone as prohibited from owning a firearm under current law, especially those related to mental health adjudications and involuntary commitment orders.  The bipartisan Fix NICS Act will ensure more of those records make it into the database by holding Federal agencies accountable for uploading relevant records and incentivizing States to upload all relevant information. Including these missing records will help ensure more accurate and complete background checks, thereby keeping dangerous weapons out of the hands of felons, fugitives, drug addicts, persons with serious mental illness, and other prohibited persons.  I will be the first to admit there is no single, perfect solution--not the STOP School Violence Act and not the Fix NICS Act, but both of these bills can help save lives. Remember the 86 planned school attacks since the Save Utah app was unveiled and remember the 26 lives that might have been spared if the domestic violence offense of the shooter in Sutherland Springs, TX, had been properly entered into the FBI background check database.  Now is not the time for argument but for action. Rather than letting the perfect be the enemy of the good, I implore my friends on both sides of the aisle to come together for the safety of our children. Rather than resorting to recycled talking points, I ask my colleagues to heed Minority Leader Schumer's call to ``pass real legislation that makes a difference.'' Rather than retreating to our partisan foxholes, I call on Republicans and Democrats alike to surrender their rhetorical weapons. For the good of the Nation, and the good of our children, all of us must look beyond the horizon of our political differences to find common ground.  Is this legislation enough to solve the problem of school violence? Quite frankly, it is not enough, but it is a start, and it is a start upon which we can all agree. We will not solve the problem of school violence overnight, but with incremental efforts--such as the legislation I have proposed--we can make a lasting difference and even save thousands of lives.  So let's not delay any further. We owe it to our children, and to all of those affected by gun violence, to take decisive action in those areas where we do agree. This is important stuff. We can't just throw in the sponge and act like we have this problem solved when we still have work to do. So I hope we will take heed to what I have just suggested--I think it can be very helpful to us--and we follow the suggestions I have made here today.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1370,topic-id,763,"Mr.President, I want to start by thanking my colleague, Senator Collins of Maine, for her work in crafting this legislation and the language of this bill and, more generally, for her leadership, formerly on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and certainly for the time that I have been on the Intelligence Her contributions have not gone unnoticed, and she has been a pleasure to work with in trying to find reasonable places where we can make a material difference in the kinds of mass shootings we have seen.  I should start by speaking a little bit to the recent tragedy in As the father of two young boys, I can't begin to imagine the nightmare that families are living through as they mourn the loss of their children in the wake of yet another horrific mass shooting.  Frankly, no parent should have to live in fear of their child not coming home from school. It is pretty unthinkable.  Just last week, one of my own sons went through an active shooter training at his school. Sadly, that is now the new norm in schools all across our country. In fact, 91 Americans are killed each day by gun violence, and we simply cannot accept the status quo as the new normal when there are real[[Page S1249]]and concrete steps we can take to reduce gun violence while respecting constitutional rights.  Once again, Americans are looking to Congress to finally enact commonsense reforms to our gun laws, to protect our schools, to protect our children, to protect our communities. Like so many Americans, I have been deeply moved by the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students and young people all across this country who have spoken out after losing classmates and friends to demand that we as lawmakers take action to prevent future tragedies.  It is no secret to my constituents or even my colleagues here that I am a passionate outdoorsman, hunter, and owner of firearms. I strongly believe that law-abiding Americans have a right to own guns for sport and self-defense. I am teaching my own sons how to safely and responsibly use those firearms. The vast majority of Americans, including gun owners like me, know that Congress must take action to close loopholes and reform our laws to keep those deadly weapons out of the hands of those who would turn them against our communities.  Today I am quite proud to join my colleagues from both sides of the aisle--Senators Collins, Heitkamp, Flake, and others--to introduce one of those measures that should have broad bipartisan support. This is a poster child for the kind of policy that ought to get across the finish line even in these deeply divided, partisan times.  Our bipartisan legislation, the Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act, would deny firearms sales to individuals who appear on the Department of Justice's no-fly or selectee lists. These are the narrowest of databases, the kinds of lists one would have to work pretty hard to land on, and for good reason. Our legislation includes due process procedures for individuals to appeal their placement on those lists.  It seems pretty straightforward to most of my constituents that if the government and law enforcement have determined that an individual is so dangerous as to land on the terrorist watch list and is too dangerous to fly on a commercial airplane, that person should not be able to walk into a gun shop and purchase a gun. But unless we pass this legislation, this glaring loophole will continue to allow individuals identified as terror suspects to buy firearms.  It is time for those Members of Congress who oppose commonsense reforms like this to finally step up and tell us what they are doing to protect the public. It is time for all of us to listen to the student leaders across this country who are rejecting the unacceptable status quo of our Nation's gun violence epidemic.  Those of us in the Senate who know firearms well have a special duty to lead these efforts and to get the details right on any legislation to reshape our Nation's gun laws. Inaction simply won't cut it anymore. We all need to listen to these students, parents, teachers, and to our own children who are calling on us to be part of the solution.  New Mexicans can count on me, despite the odds, to continue fighting for real solutions to keep our children safe, to reduce gun violence, and to keep our communities safe.

51,topic-id,901,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of H.4293, the Stress Test Improvement Act of 2017. I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr.Zeldin), who is a real workhorse on the Financial Services Committee and a real leader in trying to ensure that we have affordable credit for our constituents so that they can achieve the American In his legislation, he will bring clarity and reasonableness to the stress test regime.  Currently, as we know, banks face two separate, legally mandated stress tests: the CCAR and the Together, these two programs constitute one of the greatest expansions of the Federal Reserve's supervisory powers in recent history. But what is important to note, Mr.Speaker, is that, in addition to these mandated stress tests, banks conduct stress tests every single week on one asset class or another.  It is important to know how banks can withstand tough, stormy financial weather, but this was taking place even prior to either DFAST or What has happened now, Mr.Speaker, is these particular tests are incredibly onerous to the point where the reports are not just measured in pages, they are measured in pounds, and it is doubtful that anyone actually reads them.  Then, to compound the challenge, Mr.Speaker, the Federal Reserve's stress tests have become kind of a cat-and-mouse exercise in which the Fed staff and compliance officers attempt to outwit each other in a game that has no rules and no transparency. In other words, it is a secret test. Nobody really knows what is on it. It is difficult for Congress, it is difficult for our markets, and it is difficult for the public to even assess whether or not these tests are effective.  Mr.Speaker, it is very important to note, if you don't know what is on the test, how can you adhere to the rule of law if you don't know what the law is? And so something really needs to change here.  Now, it is fortunate that yesterday the Federal Reserve finally took action to begin to simplify and refine the CCAR stress testing regime. Recognizing the opacity of the stress test regime, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randy Quarles said in a statement: ``Our regulatory measures are most effective when they are as simple and transparent as possible.'' I couldn't agree more, as does the gentleman from New York as well.[[Page H3113]]  Unfortunately, Mr.Speaker, this particular proposal is somewhat modest in its attempt to simplify the process. It does follow the results of a review undertaken by former Fed Chair Yellen, which found a need to reduce the burden resulting from stress testing requirements. Almost everybody agrees with that, especially on our smaller financial institutions. So that is one more reason why this is needed.  I am glad the Federal Reserve recognizes the need to reform the stress test regime because, again, it contributes to a climate of legal and regulatory uncertainty when the rule of law is so critical to the foundation of our society and it is so critical to economic growth.  But in light of the Fed's announcement yesterday, it is also important to point out what the Fed did can easily be undone next week, next month, or next year. That is why it is critical that Congress has to make improvements in the stress testing regime permanent, especially for the CCAR process, which is not--I repeat, not--a creation of statute.  The gentleman from New York (Mr.Zeldin) has come up again with just the right bill, H.4293, and it will help provide a commonsense, and, oh, by the way, bipartisan reform that will inject badly needed accountability, transparency, and targeted relief to reduce legal and regulatory uncertainty for financial institutions.  Why is this important, Mr.Speaker? At the end of the day, it is not really the banks that are the subject of these regulations. At the end of the day, it is their customers. And what this committee and what this House has to do is ensure that there is affordable and available credit to help fund people's American  I heard from a gentleman by the name of John in my district from Mesquite, He said:       Credit helped me obtain my first home, and 13 years later,      I am still in it. It has helped us grow from one child, when      we moved in, to four. We ran into some bad times, but I was      able to withstand it all with the help of the available      credit lines that I had at the time. Without the credit, it      would have been nearly impossible to still be where me and my      family are today.  That is why it is so important, Mr.People need credit to pay their bills, to buy their homes, to pay for their car repairs; and all of these regulations, the regulatory onslaught that has been taking place for almost a decade, makes that credit less available and more expensive. It shrinks the American Dream, and we can't allow that to happen on our watch, Mr. That is why it is so important that we bring some rationality to the stress test so that, hopefully, people like John in Mesquite can continue to get that line of credit. Mr.Speaker, that is why it is so important that we all vote for H.4293 today.  I reserve the balance of my time.

61,topic-id,558,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I listened very carefully to the distinguished ranking member, who observed that our banks have more capital today. And this is a good thing. To the extent that Dodd-Frank had anything to do with it, I would say congratulations to the Dodd-Frank But I also noticed that, for many of us, many of our banks are still undercapitalized.  And the ranking member had every opportunity to vote for the Financial CHOICE Act that would require 10 percent, far more capital than these banks that she is concerned about failing have today, but she rejected that.  She often uses the phrase ``Wall Street megabanks,'' but it is her side of the aisle that supports a taxpayer bailout fund for what she calls the Wall Street megabanks. That comes from our friends on that side of the aisle, Mr.Speaker; not on this side. She says we have to bail out these banks.  No, we don't have to. We don't have to. We should support bankruptcy over bailout. And we should support high levels of capital over incredibly intrusive Federal control, Federal control that ultimately gets resolved into less credit and more expensive credit for many of our constituents.  Again, Mr.Speaker, I would add, banks have stress-tested themselves long before the appearance of Dodd-Long before the appearance of Dodd-In fact, stress tests are taking place on some group of assets at every bank in America every day. Many, many banks, particularly the larger banks, may do up to 200 stress tests a week.  What the gentleman from New York is trying to do is add some level of clarity, sanity, and reasonableness to the federally instituted CCAR process, something that can take literally 40,000 pages--40,000 pages--can take tens of millions, if not over $100 million, to produce that could have been used to loan to our constituents to buy their home, to repair their car, to put groceries on the table, to pay for their healthcare premiums.                              {time}  1500  And some say, well, these tests have to be conducted semiannually. Why semiannually? What is wrong with annually? What is sacrosanct about semiannually? And, oh, by the way, why are we testing for both worst-case scenario and some mid- scenario?  Either you are going to survive the 100-year flood or you are not. If you can survive the 100-year flood, surely you can survive the 50-year flood. So why do we need that other test?  I mean, what we hear from our friends on the other side of aisle: Oh, my God, we can't question the Federal regulators. I mean, they come from Mount They have this great wisdom that we can never challenge them.  Well, the truth is we are Article I of the Constitution, and we are the ones who make the law, and that is why we have hearings, and we listen very closely. We listen closely to our regulators; we listen closely to our constituents; we listen closely to market participants; and then we make judgments. We make judgments.  So, yes, there is a balance. There is a balance between economic opportunity and financial stability. We want there to be strong financial stability, but we also want there to be strong, strong economic opportunity for all of our constituents.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

67,topic-id,435,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Well, the ranking member poses the question, ``Why?'' I can tell you why, Mr.It is because Therese from Waco has written:       I would like to express my disappointment at being rejected      for a home loan, which would cost less than the house I      presently have been renting for 5 years. As a small-business      owner, I run my design studio out of my home office and take      every tax break that is legal to offset the taxes payable if      I didn't.  We do it for Sherry from Eustace, who writes:       After a divorce 4 years ago, I needed to buy a car because      my car was over 10 years old. I have a checking account in my      name, I have a savings account, but they did not loan me      money.  There is an onslaught of financial regulations that is costly, intrusive, burdensome, and is causing credit to be less available--less available--to the people who need it. That is why we do this, Mr.Speaker, week after week after week. We do it to make sure that our constituents can buy homes, that they can have cars. If they have tough times, if they lose a job, if they go through a painful divorce, that is why we do it, Mr.                             {time}  1515  Again, stress-tests are important. That is why banks do it themselves every single week.  But the question is: How do we calibrate this?  We have used the ranking member's prescription, and that of my friends on the other side of the aisle, and it brought us 1.6 percent economic growth. Thankfully, today, with a new Congress and with a new President, we have 3 percent economic growth, and all types of opportunities are coming.  We should not listen and go back to those days. It is time to go forward to a better America with greater opportunity for all That means we have to reform the stress test to ensure that not only do we have financial stability, but we have financial opportunity as well.

69,topic-id,395,"Mr.Speaker, as the ranking member talks about the hundreds of millions of dollars of fines that these banks have paid, who have violated provisions of civil law, maybe that means the system is working. That is what ought to happen to wrongdoers. There ought to be fines.  No one can defend what happened at Wells I hope that the current management team is cleaning up what has been a mess and what has harmed consumers for many, many years under the previous team.  But I do know this: that Wells Fargo has been fined almost a half a billion dollars already. Their former CEO had $75 million clawed back in compensation. They lost $29 billion of market value--their investors--and investigations are ongoing, as it well should be.  But I would point out that our prudential regulators continue to have full authority to enforce all of our consumer protection laws: the Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Fair Credit Billing When they find violations, people are fined, as they well should be.  But what we are talking about, once again, is trying to create economic opportunity for all those who need it, to make credit more available and less expensive for people who are trying to buy a home, repair a car, and put groceries on the table.  What the gentleman from New York is saying, again, when it comes to a federally imposed stress test, after hours and hours of testimony, we believe that maybe that test ought to be administered annually, instead of semiannually. That would be a better balance.

234,topic-id,840,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.4061, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act of 2017.  I want to commend two friends, Mr.Ross from Florida on the Republican side of the aisle and Mr.Delaney on the Democrat side of the aisle, for their collective leadership on bringing forth this truly bipartisan bill, a strong, bipartisan bill, which has 58 different cosponsors, half from each side of the aisle.  Before talking a bit about the bill, there has been a lot of news today, Mr.Part of the news, that I just could not overlook, is the fact that my dear friend and colleague from Florida announced that he would be retiring at the end of this I do want to say what a pleasure and honor it has been to work with the gentleman from I have appreciated his leadership, I have appreciated his knowledge, and I have appreciated his calm demeanor and his ability to further strong, bipartisan measures that will help create greater credit opportunities for hardworking I would say I will miss him, but I will be gone as well. Maybe he will invite me down to the Florida coast for some deep sea fishing. I look forward to receiving that invitation at the appropriate time.  Now back to business, Mr. The Financial Stability Oversight Council is charged with identifying emerging threats to our financial stability. However, during the previous administration, the FSOC, as it is called, went far beyond identifying this risk and, instead, just concocted incredibly irrational speculative scenarios about sectors of the financial markets that had nothing to do with the financial crisis. In turn, they have caused more harm to the financial system than added stability.  It bears highlighting at the outset that this bill does not strip the FSOC of its ability to designate a nonbank financial company as a SIFI, or systematically important financial institution. Frankly, Mr.Speaker, it would be a better bill if it did. It also wouldn't be a bipartisan bill. That is not what this bill is trying to do. Rather, this bill simply brings needed transparency and accountability to the designation process.  Mr.Ross and Mr.Delaney, in H.4061, do this by reversing the presumption that government bureaucrats should dictate the business models and operational objectives of private businesses in requiring the FSOC to approach the potential designation of a nonbank by encouraging companies to address the risk prior to designating them as SIFIs in order to actually reduce systemic risk.  Let me sum it up, Mr.All this is saying is that a nonbank financial institution that the Financial Stability Oversight Council feels may be creating undue risk in the system, give them an opportunity to remedy that before you designate them as a too-big-to-fail institution backed up with a taxpayer bailout fund. At least give them an opportunity to remedy the risk that you are concerned about.  What could be more common sense? What could be more reasonable? That is why it is such a strong, bipartisan bill coming out of the House Financial Services                              {time}  1530  Specifically, Mr.Speaker, applying bank-like regulation to nonbanks, such as asset managers, broker-dealers, insurance companies, and private investment funds just doesn't make sense. Nonbanks do not have access to the deposit insurance fund, they don't have access to the Federal Reserve's discount window or lending facilities. Nonbanks take far larger capital haircuts on the assets they hold. Nonbanks, when they fail, fail very differently from banks.  If an individual mutual fund were to fail, the shareholders of that fund would bear the losses, not the taxpayer. There is no reason to apply the same system to them.  So the bill would bring, again, clarity and accountability to the FSOC designation process. That should be self-evident.  To date, the FSOC has designated four nonbank financial companies as systemically important financial institutions. Today, only one remains designated and it is unclear for exactly how long.  The de-designation of these companies seems to point to a recognition that these companies do not present a potential risk that FSOC first claimed that they did. MetLife, one of them, actually challenged FSOC's SIFI determination in court, and FSOC's designation was found by an Article III judge to be fatally flawed, arbitrary and capricious, and a critical departure from FSOC's own standards.  Based on that case alone, it certainly seems appropriate for Congress to ensure there are proper guardrails put in place in this designation, because at[[Page H3122]]the end of the day, the designation doesn't just affect, again, Wall Street, it is felt directly by Main Street households who are trying to save for college, save for retirement. They would see their costs rise and their investment returns fall on a mutual fund if it was designated, simply because investors would be required to bail out other too-big-to-fail firms.  So this is a common sense piece of legislation, it is strongly bipartisan, and I urge all Members to support it.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

255,topic-id,494,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, why is this important, and what does this bill do? Let me try to make it very succinct. Dodd-Frank gave the Federal Government the power to designate firms to be too big to fail and backed them up with a taxpayer fund, a bailout fund. We think that is wrong.  But that is not what this bill does. The bill doesn't repeal the bailout fund. It simply says to nonbanks--not banks, nonbanks--mutual funds, insurance companies: You know what? Before we knock you upside the head with a sledgehammer, we are going to give you a chance to get your act together.  That is essentially what this bill does. And why is that important? It is important because we have people who are trying to capitalize small businesses. It is important because we have people who are trying to save for their retirement. Enhanced prudential standards, which is the legal term of art for coming down with a ton of bricks onto a company, that can cost people.  In fact, it has been estimated that these enhanced prudential capital requirements imposed with a SIFI designation, a too-big-to-fail designation on a mutual fund, could trim as much as 25 percent or $108,000 for a mutual fund investor's returns over a lifetime of investing. That comes out of the pockets of our seniors. That is why this is so important.  Contrary to what you hear on the other side of the aisle, the FSOC, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, will still have full ability to designate an institution as too big to fail. But it says: You know what? Before you do that, consider some other methods: consider seniors, consider small businesses, and consider the impact of what you are going to do.  Look at what happened to GE This was one of the great financing companies in America, and they were basically a coyote in a trap that had to chew its leg off. There is hardly anything left of them. They used to fund furniture retailers, bread bakeries, Jack in the Box franchises. They provided credit to startups all over America, $31 billion in 2010 to 1.2 million small and midsized businesses, and now, next to nothing. Next to nothing, because they were designated as a nonbank  The ranking member brings up AIG, but guess what? AIG was regulated by a Federal regulator who had full ability to stop anything they were doing for safety and soundness. And guess what? The regulator, in which many on the other side of the aisle put total faith into, they missed it. They screwed up. They said under oath in our committee: Yeah, we had full authority to stop it, and we just missed it. We just missed it.

980,topic-id,643,"Mr.Speaker, I rise, today, in strong support of H.4296, an important bill authored by Mr.Luetkemeyer, who is a real leader on our committee. He is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit and has led many bills on this floor. This particular one addresses the burden that unnecessary operational capital requirements have imposed on our financial institutions and then, consequently, on our hardworking families and small businesses that are seeking credit.  The Basel Committee requires U.financial institutions to hold excessive capital based upon a look-back approach to an organization's risk, previous earnings, and other provisions that provide no indication of future risk.  Again, Mr.Speaker, this is about holding operational capital for past activities.  This methodology employed by the international standard setters has forced our banks to hold hundreds of billions of dollars in reserve rather than putting that money to work in the real economy--in loans and investments--for people to buy cars, to launch small-business enterprises, or maybe to make a downpayment on that first home.  Again, Mr.Speaker, let me say it so that all can hear. Hundreds of billions of dollars is currently sitting in banks across the country not being utilized to fund mortgage loans, car loans, and other day-to-day financing that American families and individuals demand.  On top of this is the increased cost of compliance that banks have had to shoulder under Dodd-Frank's onslaught of regulation. Banks like Coatesville Savings Bank, the only remaining bank in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, has told us that, now, 25 percent of their annual budget is nothing but compliance cost, Mr.This is detrimental to the Coatesville, Pennsylvania, community. That is 25 percent. That is a huge figure, Mr.Speaker, that cannot be used to fund the American Dream in Coatesville,  So, again, Chairman Luetkemeyer brings us a very commonsense reform and a very necessary reform.  Most agree and recognize the importance of our financial institutions to hold capital in the event of future crisis or distress. Nobody denies that, and this legislation does not remove those requirements. But, Mr.Speaker, requiring banking organizations to look back in the rearview mirror and hold operational capital against discontinued activities or products is just not nonsensical, it is crazy. It makes no sense.  H.4296 simply amends the method of how reserve capital is calculated by establishing standards based on an organization's current business activities, making the requirements more accurate and tailored to a bank's current risk profile. Again, Mr.Speaker, it is just common sense. That means banks would still retain sufficient reserves to weather an economic storm, but they would be able to put the billions of dollars currently sitting on the sidelines to work to help make the economy grow, to make it healthier.  In short, this method-based approach proposed by H.4296 properly calibrates operational capital while also ensuring strong, healthy financial institutions and, thus, a stronger economy for our constituents.  Again, to be very clear, Mr.Speaker, H.4296, does not prevent Federal financial regulators from instituting operational risk capital requirements. It does not eliminate the authority of a regulator to assess operational risk, nor does it prevent regulators from requiring that capital be held against riskier activities or businesses. The bill simply puts forth a thoughtful framework that sets parameters, while allowing regulators the flexibility needed to ensure that capital standards are appropriately tailored.  A healthy financial system, Mr.Speaker, will enhance individuals' financial freedom and will lead to a healthier and better regulatory system.  H.4296 has garnered strong, bipartisan support in our committee, passing by a vote of 43-17, again, because it is practical and common sense.  I again want to thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.Luetkemeyer), who chairs our Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee, for his leadership on this bill. I urge all of[[Page H1309]]my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bipartisan measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.

1001,topic-id,853,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, for the perhaps two dozen people who are watching us on C-SPAN at the moment, I think it is important to add a little bit of clarity to what we are debating here.  What we are debating is: What is the proper capital level for a federally insured financial institution?  We know that if that capital level is set too low, then perhaps the financial institution could fail. If it is set too high, then they will not have the capital to help fund the American Dream--car loans, home loans, and small business loans.  So we have heard a lot about a very simple bill that helps clarify one of perhaps two dozen different capital levels that are already applicable to our banking institutions, the total loss-absorbing capacity, the supplementary leverage ratio, the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, the liquidity coverage ratio, the G-SIB surcharge, and the list goes on and on and on.  We are talking, about, Mr.Speaker, one capital level, the operational capital--operational risk capital. So, number one, there are a multitude of different capital levels and liquidity levels that are already applied to our financial institutions.  What we are saying is, if we are measuring operational risk, we should focus on current risks. Then, if in doubt, Mr.Speaker, I always recommend that Members actually read the bills that are being debated. It is an always helpful exercise. If you would actually read the bill, you would discover in section 1 of the bill, Mr.Luetkemeyer's bill says that operational risk capital is based primarily on the risks posed by a banking organizations' current activities and business.  If you look at subparagraph (3) of paragraph (a), it says: `` . . . which is not solely based on a banking organization's historic losses.''  So it is not prohibited to look at historic facts, but, primarily, we must be focused on the current operational risk.  As I used earlier in the debate the analogy of who would want their life insurance premiums based on the fact that in an earlier point in their life they were a skydiver or a scuba diver and now today they are facing life as an accountant? Those are different risk profiles.  If you build a home 4 feet below sea level, yet you sell that home, I doubt you want your flood insurance premiums based on the home that you already sold. It makes no sense.  As I also said earlier in this debate, when it comes to proper levels of capital, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated earlier today before our committee, safety and soundness considerations trump all. The regulators have the power to adjust the capital levels.  Now, this friend on the other side of the aisle talks about, oh, my God, this is a huge risk to the economy. It is $22 million. Now, that is real money. But, Mr.Speaker, we all know that is not even a rounding error here; $22 million over the 10-year budget window is approximately a $2 million risk. And from the Congressional Budget Office report, they say that it is a small, small chance that the FDIC would incur additional costs. So this is not creating more risk to the system.  What we are trying to do is calibrate the appropriate risk. If we are going to measure operational risk as opposed to the other 20-some odd capital levels, then we ought to be focused on current risk, because if we are not, Mr.Speaker, hardworking Americans are losing current credit opportunities in order to pay for past operational risk. That is not right, that is not fair, and that is not smart.  We ought to ensure that we have the proper capital level not only to make sure that we have a safe and sound financial system but to make sure that we are capitalizing the American Dream for our constituents.  My constituents in the Fifth District of Texas, who live in places like Mineola and Forney, who are desperately trying to fund their American Dream and put that down payment on a first house, we have got to make sure that they are able to.  So many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. They need these credit opportunities, Mr.Let's calibrate one capital ratio properly. Let's add a little common sense, and let's not allow the good people in Basel, Switzerland--as good as they may be--de facto impose what is an irrational capital system on our banking system as we are trying to help our small businesses and our families.  So, Mr.Speaker, I encourage all Members to support H.4296, a strong bipartisan bill to help credit opportunities for all families.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Byrne). All time for debate has expired.  Pursuant to House Resolution 747, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended.

1003,topic-id,515,"Mr.Speaker, again, there are roughly two dozen different capital and liquidity levels that are applied to our banks. We are talking about, one, operational capital, and whether or not operational risk capital ought to be based on current risk.  Now, I know my friend on the other side of the aisle always likes to wave the Wells Fargo flag. Wells Fargo needs to be held accountable. There needs to be justice for all who have been wronged. There have been roughly $142 million now paid in restitution. There have been over $200 million in fines paid.                              {time}  1700  The board of Wells Fargo has been replaced. The CEO was fired, and the Federal Reserve capped their growth, all under existing authorities.  But under this motion to recommit, potentially, other financial institutions could be included. It is not the financial institution that counts, at the end of the day. It is capital that could be used to fund car loans. It is capital that could be used to fund homes. It is capital that could be used to fund the next Apple or the next Instead, that capital would be put onto the sidelines.  Again, we are talking about operational risk capital only and should it be calibrated for current risk or past risk. That is a completely different[[Page H1316]]issue from ensuring that customers of Wells Fargo, who clearly have been wronged, receive justice and that Wells Fargo has been held accountable.  Again, I would point out this might not have happened if the CFPB under the previous administration had been doing their business. They should have caught this. But they didn't. Instead, it was the LA Times and the Los Angeles city attorney. The CFPB was asleep at the wheel under the previous administration.  So, again, there is existing authority. But if the regulators and then-Director Cordray had been doing their job, this wouldn't have happened. The evidence was there and it was simply overlooked. We see way too many instances of that, Mr. Again, we want to properly calibrate one capital level, operational risk capital. That is what the bill of the gentleman from Missouri does. We should not be confused about the jihad against banks, because banks, ultimately, are still funding the American You punish our constituents, you punish small businesses every time you needlessly take away capital that can fund their American dreams.

1202,topic-id,813,"Mr.Speaker, I will yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in favor of my bill, H.5078, the TRID Improvement This important package will cut through the red tape and level the playing field for making sure that regulations are smarter, fairer, clearer, and more efficient, while, at the same time, ensure that consumers and investors are protected.  You know, Mr.Speaker, when the CFPB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was first initiated as a part of the Dodd-Frank Act, one of now-Senator Elizabeth Warren's goals was simpler regulation, that we would streamline regulation, that we would take bulky complex consumer forms and make them simpler. And the TILA-RESPA, truth-in-lending form and the real estate settlement form, were examples in those early days that they were going to make these forms simpler and easier for consumers.  Well, that is what we are talking about today, Mr.Speaker, for it did not become simpler and easier. It became costly, complex, and difficult for consumers.  Today, we are back on the floor on this issue. It is not a new issue or a new concern because the confusion related to TRID has been apparent for years.  In November 2013, the CFPB finalized TRID, combining, as I said, the truth-in-lending form with the real estate settlement procedures form necessary for consumers in this country to close a home loan to have that American The effective date for this final rule was originally set for mortgage applications received on or after August 1, 2015, but due to the administrative errors of the CFPB, the agency delayed it until October 3, 2015.  In October, the House of Representatives passed H.3192, the Homebuyers Assistance Act, which I proudly sponsored, and it passed with a bipartisan vote in this House of 303-121. It would have provided a hold-harmless period for those trying to make a good faith effort to comply with this complex rule.  In April 2016, with complaints pouring in from both homeowners, homebuyers, consumers, bankers, title companies, the CFPB decided to reopen the rulemaking on TILA-RESPA and the TRID rule. The CFPB issued a final rule clarifying and amending certain mortgage disclosure provisions.  So as you can hear from this long story, Mr.Speaker, this rule is complex. So we are here today to try to fix a part of it, a small part of it that will make it easier, better, and more clearer for consumers.  The American Bankers Association stated that if there was one thing to fix about the current regulatory system, it would be the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule, TRID--not qualified mortgage definitions, not the Volcker rule, the TRID rule. Mortgage lenders have seen regulatory change around every aspect of their lending for the last 8 years, and this rule is no exception.  Today, Mr.Speaker, over in the House Small Business Committee, the GAO testified. They have issued a report about the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule. They told the committee today that this rule was one of the most expensive facing community banking across the country, the most burdensome.  So here, the TILA-RESPA rule before our House Small Business Committee says that we are burdening community banks, and they, in turn, are not able to do the kind of work that we want, that we expect for our homebuyers of homes across this country.  CFPB Associate Director David Silberman said the Bureau agreed with the GAO's recommendation, that it assessed the effectiveness of the TRID[[Page H1307]]guidance and that it intended to ask the public for input on ways to improve regulatory guidance.  Well, Mr.Speaker, I am glad to have this report from the GAO, but we have been calling for this for almost 2\1/2\ years that we want this rule made simpler and more direct and better for our consumers.  H.5078 fixes the title insurance disclosures so that consumers actually know what their expenses are going to be for title insurance. And despite our best efforts, the CFPB has been unwilling to fix this problem on its own; so today, Congress comes to act.  The other aspect of this bill--and I want to thank my good friend from Minnesota (Mr.Ellison) and my good friend from North Carolina (Mr.Pittenger) for the second portion of this bill, the Credit Access and Inclusion Act of 2017.  The Credit Access and Inclusion Act amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to allow the reporting of certain positive consumer credit information for consumer reporting agencies. Specifically, a person or the Department of Housing and Urban Development might report information related to a consumer's performance in making payments either under a lease arrangement for a dwelling or pursuant to a contract providing utility or telecommunication services. This kind of positive reporting on a consumer's ability to make their payments on time will help more families in our country build a credit record.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

North Dakota is proud to be represented among the talented members of this team by two athletes, the Lamoureux twins, Jocelyne and These sisters are natives of Grand Forks, ND, and alumni of the University of North Dakota, where they played three seasons of NCAA women's hockey.

They have a tremendous collegiate record and a tremendous Olympic record now, as well. Across their Olympic careers, they have scored 13 goals and provided 17 assists, for a total of 30 points.

999,topic-id,312,"Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of this legislation because I think it addresses a fundamental flaw in how we have looked at operational risk capital.  Fundamentally, we want banks to hold capital necessary for the risks they are taking today and the likely risks that they may incur losses into the future. By purely looking backwards, we are driving down the Interstate in the financial system driving by looking in the rearview mirror only. That is a terrible mistake by only looking at past risks instead of the risks they have today.  If we want to encourage institutions to become less risky, then we need to ensure that they can reduce the amount of capital buffer if they are doing less risky activities. This is basically incentivizing the right behavior. If we continue to say to institutions: You are going to be penalized for the past irrespective of what you may be doing today, irrespective of the less risk you may be taking into the future, then we are essentially providing them no incentive to become less risky.  I think the lesson after 2008 is making sure that we allow the free markets and institutions to act with the right incentives, not the wrong incentives. We want them to become less risky over time by their own decisions and by their own elections.  This doesn't change anything about the basic operational risk capital that they must maintain, except that it says it should match what they are doing today and the activities that they are going to be engaged on in the future.  So I do think this is commonsense legislation. I do think this is a thoughtful response to a genuine problem that I hear about back home in Indiana frequently. So I continue to support H.4296, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.  ",CREC-2018-02-27-pt1-PgH1308.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2018.0,27.0,February

238,topic-id,578,"Mr.Speaker, I want to say I am going to miss both the chairman and the gentleman from Florida (Mr.Ross) after they leave this term.  I am going to try to address the ranking member's timing issue, but the fact is that much of this bill simply codifies what FSOC's current process is and, thus, is not changing that timing.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.4061, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act of 2017, which would enhance transparency and procedural fairness for the nonbank systemically important financial institutions designation process.  Dodd-Frank created FSOC and charged it with identifying risks to the financial stability of financial companies that would pose a threat to our overall financial stability. The problem with this is that FSOC has the authority to designate a nonbank financial institution, such as an asset manager or an insurance company, and subject the institution to heightened prudential supervision and regulation by the Federal  All you hear from the other side is that this is about megabanks. It is the exact opposite. It is about these insurance companies and these asset managers and broker dealers.  In 2014, FSOC designated MetLife, a life insurance company, for ``heightened prudential supervision'' by the[[Page H3124]]Federal However, in 2016, a Federal district court rescinded FSOC's SIFI designation of MetLife, finding that it was ``arbitrary and capricious'' and that the FSOC had ``made critical departures'' from its own standards from making designation determinations.  Now, I wasn't there when Dodd-Frank was created, but I have been dealing with the echo effect of it for the last 7 years, and I don't believe this is what Congress intended. I don't believe that the architects--in fact, I can't believe that the architects--of Dodd-Frank intended for bank regulators to rewrite the rules of insurance companies.  As The Wall Street Journal wrote: ``It's as if a committee of baseball umpires rewrote the rules of football despite protests from the NFL players, owners, and referees.''  Let me give a personal example. My political science degree should then qualify me to be a chemical lab scientist. Hey, they both have science in the title.  It doesn't make sense.  In fact, even Barney Frank, the law's namesake, told Congress that, in general, he did not believe that companies ``that just sell insurance'' should be designated as systemic.  Well, today we have the ability to right the ship. By passing this important bill, Congress has the opportunity to bring about commonsense, bipartisan reforms to this designation process. And this is what American, hardworking taxpayers expect out of us: an ability to find a solution.  Specifically, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act of 2017 would amend the Dodd-Frank Act to require FSOC to determine whether to subject a U.or a foreign nonbank financial company to supervision by the Federal Reserve, must consider the appropriateness of imposing heightened prudential standards as opposed to other forms of regulation to mitigate identified risks to the financial stability. In other words, as my friend from Florida said, don't go butterfly hunting with a sledgehammer.  H.4061 directs FSOC to reevaluate, both annually and periodically, final determinations of systemic risk regarding a nonbank financial company under supervision.  Finally, the bill directs the FSOC to study the impacts of its determinations to nonbank financial companies to Fed supervision and prudential standards and whether such determinations have the intended result of improving domestic financial stability every 5 years.

When you look at the number of bipartisan bills that have passed out of the Financial Services Committee this session, it is really impressive, and I am grateful for his work.  I also want to thank Dennis Ross and John Delaney and all my colleagues who have worked so diligently on H.4061, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act of 2017, which I strongly support.  I think it is fair to say that a Financial Stability Oversight Council chaired by Secretary Mnuchin is not extremely likely to subject nonbanks to enhanced prudential supervision.  In fact, I understand they are considering removing some designations.  However, Congress still should take the appropriate steps to make the law that provides this authority to the Treasury much more practical.  Furthermore, I would like to point out that although I was happy to see many great provisions of the regulatory relief package put together by Chairman Crapo over in the Senate, including a number of bills I have offered with my colleagues in the House, I was extremely disappointed with the fact that the legislation didn't include this legislation or something similar to it.  I don't understand how Congress can justify a regulatory reform package that does so little to ease Dodd-Frank's cost on investors, especially when the Financial Services Committee in the House has taken demonstrated steps, a strong record of bipartisan success, in making reforms to FSOC's nonbank SIFI designation authority.  The Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act amends the Dodd-Frank Act to require the FSOC, when determining whether to subject a U.or foreign nonbank financial company to supervision by the Fed, to consider the appropriateness of imposing heightened prudential standards.  In other words, it provides these nonbanks the opportunities to adjust their business models before being subjected to supervision by the Federal Reserve, thereby acknowledging that these companies might wish to change their business model after such a designation in order to be free of these substantial regulatory costs.  It is important that we have well-defined processes in place so these nonbanks understand the rules of the road. The government provides these companies some reasonable due process when proposing to dramatically interrupt their business with a slew of new regulatory requirements.  Finally, let's remember that investors bear the costs of inappropriate regulation being applied to nonbanks, like mutual funds.  The asset management industry is modeled in a fundamentally different way, and our regulatory system should reflect that. Investors take on the risk and manage those risks in order to receive returns to pay for things like retirement or education for their children. Safety and soundness regulation, as the Fed applies it to the banks, is completely inappropriate.  At a minimum, we should be providing nonbanks like mutual funds a chance to work with the FSOC to address their concerns before slapping investors with new regulatory costs.  Finally, we should never forget, again, that this was a strong bipartisan bill that received 45 votes in committee, and we ought to all consider supporting it here on the floor.

988,topic-id,432,"Mr.Speaker, I also want to thank Chairman Hensarling for all of his work moving this important regulatory reform through.  I speak today in support of H.4296, to place requirements on operational risk capital requirements for banking organizations established by an appropriate Federal banking agency. This bill is one of many that are being reported by the Financial Services Committee with bipartisan support.  I want to commend Congressman Luetkemeyer and Congressman Meeks for working together to get a very strong vote from the Financial Services I hope that is something we can accomplish today on the House floor.  This legislation acknowledges that we can make improvements to the regulatory framework that has been implemented or is still pending in response to the financial crisis. My constituents and I are very pleased to see the economic growth over the last year, but that does not mean we shouldn't take additional steps to ensure that we have an efficient regulatory system. For example, the Fed is likely going to continue tightening rates, and I am not sure Congress will always be able to provide the progrowth fiscal policy that we have seen as of late.  One of our other tools for affecting the performance of the economy is a progrowth but sensible regime that permits for investment, job creation, and financial security. H.4296 will ensure our banking regulators institute operational risk capital standards that make sense for the U.financial system.  This legislation ensures that operational risk-based capital requirements are reflective of the banking organization's current activities and businesses. This seems logical, but the current approach is dependent on historical performance and does not provide for adjustments based on changes made by a banking organization.  So, for example, a banking organization might suffer from a cyber attack that results in losses for the organization. In fact, cyber attacks and data breaches are considered to be one of the largest categories of operational risk. In response, this banking organization could choose to overhaul its ability to detect and respond to such operational risk incidents.  Shouldn't our capital framework reflect that work, or should the banking organization continue to suffer from a punitive framework that disincentivizes proactively addressing operational risk?  I, for one, am supportive of policies that will encourage investment by banking organizations to address reputational risk, such as those that might pose a risk for a data breach. I would encourage all of my colleagues to vote in support of this bipartisan legislation. I would encourage our financial sector to proactively address operational risks, and it will also free up capital to permit for economic growth.

1498,topic-id,535,"Mr.Speaker, I am next honored to recognize the gentleman from California (Mr.LaMalfa).  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I appreciate Mr.Hultgren for leading this effort here tonight but also his great spiritual counsel and partnership in this building here. It is very much appreciated. Indeed, he is one of God's great servants.  So, you know, as I harken back on my years of when we saw Billy Graham on TV and the inspirational character he was, and all my colleagues here tonight have alluded to it as well, he lived a very, very full life, a selfless life. And when I think about the leaders that have come through Washington, indeed, what is this town named for? George Washington, who is probably the single most selfless politician I can ever think of in terms of giving of service, putting himself last and the country first. He didn't want to be king. He didn't really want to preside so much, but he wanted to help. God was always on his side.  And I see in Billy Graham that same kind of greatness of the founding policies, the founding values of George Washington's and some of our Founders manifested, in a man who reached and saved millions in this country over those years with his crusades.  A couple of my colleagues already mentioned his interaction with And with this being Black History Month, the last couple of days of it here, I thought it would be appropriate to touch on that as well because Billy Graham helped be a force in the civil rights movement, showing the way for others who may have been hesitant or breaking down the barrier for those who still wanted to sustain segregation.  My colleague mentioned the Chattanooga rally there where he himself went down when the ushers would not do it, and he removed those ropes so it would be integrated because, in God's eyes, all are equal, and then setting out in the Constitution all are created equal.  So Billy Graham sustained that in his years of friendship with King, and showing that he was a nonpartisan, nonracial leader, helped saved the lives of all men who are created equal. So that goes so far that he is willing to put it on the line. He made people mad. He made the head usher resign that day when he made that courageous--but what he probably felt wasn't courageous at all--but the right action.  So Billy Graham, even to his last day when he made a short video, was all about informing people about Jesus, about the salvation they could have if they would just embrace Jesus and find what eternal life really is all about, that it isn't what treasures we store here on this planet but the ones we store in Heaven when we embrace  There will never be another like him, but we can always remember him with pride. And as he would say himself, that his stores of treasure are up in And he will be even stronger up there with his legacy and his memory and his family members that go on to do what he did.  So God bless Billy Graham, and I thank, again, Mr.Hultgren for this opportunity tonight.

1501,topic-id,1446,"Mr.Speaker, I am so grateful for so many of my colleagues who were able to join us tonight to remember Reverend Billy Graham, born November 7, 1918, and died February 21, 2018.  Billy Graham was a lion of the Christian faith and a believer in the all-encompassing love of God for all people.  I knew Billy Graham from such an early age: knew of him, knew of his ministry, and was struck even more so most of my growing up years in Wheaton, Illinois, where Billy Graham went to school, met his wife. Much of his ministry started in Wheaton and in that area around  His ministry spanned generations of American religious thought and culture, but his core message remained unchanged throughout his entire lifetime. His evangelistic gatherings attracted millions throughout the globe for decades. His name is known around the world, as many have said tonight, maybe one of the most recognized names and most respected throughout his entire lifetime.  I remember way back in 1971--I was 5 years old--my mom and dad brought me down to McCormick Place down in downtown Chicago, to be part of the 1971 Billy Graham crusade. My dad was a counselor at that crusade. I was a little 5-year-old boy, but I still remember that night. I remember the power of the message, I remember the power of this messenger of God sharing his love for us, but also the truth of the love that Jesus has for us. That he gave everything so that I could have hope, so that I could have new life.  Even as a little boy, that affected me. It moved me. It moved me so much that it had me ask more questions of my own mom and dad when I got home. And, ultimately, it was that same year, right around that time, when I recognized that I was sinful, even as a little boy, that I was selfish, that I needed help, I needed a savior, and that I needed someone to pay a price that I couldn't pay.  And as Billy Graham had stated, and as my mom and dad had taught me, and as my own grandpa had taught me, only Jesus could pay that price, and he wanted to do it to give me that free gift of redemption, the hope that we can have only through That was the story and the message of Billy  Jumping forward quite a few years, I had the privilege, just 12 years ago, of being down in I went to the Louisiana State It is also known as Louisiana State Penitentiary was known as the bloodiest prison in all of America for decades and decades and decades--more killings and more violence than any other prison. And then something happened.  God used some people, specifically a warden there, Warden Cain, who came, and others, to change the hearts of these inmates. They brought a seminary into this Louisiana State  Now, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of prisoners in Louisiana State Penitentiary have gone through seminary--New Orleans Seminary--that is right there in the prison, and have gained their own Bible graduate degrees of being pastors, although they are still in prison.  One of the things that changed in Louisiana State Penitentiary--it had been when prisoners died in prison, and almost all of them die there, because life means life in Louisiana--what happened before was, when prisoners died, they would just be thrown in a ditch in the back behind the cafeteria and thrown some dirt on top of them. The warden and others felt like this was absolutely inhumane treatment for anybody, even prisoners, so they changed something.  They have a woodworking program there, and the inmates of Angola, Louisiana State Penitentiary, started making caskets for their fellow prisoners who would die in prison. They handcraft these caskets so that they are actually gorgeous, handcrafted, recognizing that every life is of infinite value because God lived and died for that life.  Well, Franklin Graham, Billy's son, was down in Louisiana State Penitentiary a few years ago. He went on a tour there, saw these caskets that were being made for inmates, went back and talked to his mom and dad.  Billy Graham and Ruth Graham said: Do you know what? We want to be buried in caskets that were made by prisoners.  I am so excited. Tomorrow, this unbelievable honor of Billy Graham being laid in honor in the United States rotunda, one of only four people who have had that great honor, but also the story that is going to be told, that Billy Graham is going to be laid in the rotunda in a casket that was made by prisoners in Louisiana State What an amazing statement of humility of recognizing that we are all the same. We are all broken people, we all need saving, whether we are preaching to millions and millions of people, or whether we are in prison for the rest of our lives because of the mistakes we have made. We all cannot reach that standard, that perfect standard, to be with God forever. We need someone to help us reach that, and only Jesus can help us do that.  Billy Graham recognized that. The statement is going to be very clear in the rotunda, just outside of these doors tomorrow over the next day and a half, of recognition of his life, and then, ultimately, he will be buried there.  I remember back--and I will end with this--just the message of Billy Graham very clear. Two questions that I think were so important for Billy One he talked about in his book, ``Just As I Am.''  He said: The first question I have for God when I get to heaven is, Why me? Why me, a farm kid from North Carolina that could barely make it through school? Why me? Why did you choose me as an instrument?  And I think the answer to that question goes back to Isaiah 6:8. That when Isaiah heard the Lord say, ``Whom shall I send,'' Isaiah said, ``Here I am, Lord, send me.''  That is exactly what Billy Graham did. He said: Here I am, Lord, send me. Broken, imperfect, not a great speaker, but here I am, send me  And through that willingness, millions and millions and millions of lives were touched.  The last question was one that I heard when I went to that crusade in 1971. And it was: Who is Jesus to you? This person of Jesus that has impacted more people in this world than any other person, who is Jesus to you?  It was a question that I had to struggle with, even as a 5-year-old. I continue to learn and grow and understand And different people have different ideas of who Jesus is. No one can deny he was a real person who had more impact on this world than anybody else.  We talk about the impact that Billy Graham has had. Jesus is the reason for the impact that Billy Graham had.  So he asked the question: Who is Jesus?  And I think it is worth the study, to take the time to look into who was this man who lived 2,000 years ago, yet affected everything. Even our calendar is adjusted to his life.  Who is this Jesus?  As you dig in and you ask questions and study, the question is either: Is this Jesus who he said he is or isn't he? Is he a liar? Is he a lunatic? Or is he Lord?  Lord and Savior, the only hope, the light of this world, I believe that that is exactly who this Jesus is. It was what Billy Graham talked about.  Mr.Speaker, I want to close with a verse many people remember from the Billy Graham crusades. The closing of those crusades were led with a call for people to come forward, but also with an amazing hymn, ``Just As I Am.'' I want to read a verse or two, and then close.     Just as I am, without one plea,     But that thy blood was shed for me,     And that though bidst me come to thee,     O lamb of God, I come, I come.     Just as I am, and waiting not     To rid my soul of one dark blot,[[Page H1328]]     To thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,     O lamb of God, I come, I come.  Thank you, Billy Thank you for your faithfulness. Thank you for sharing this message of hope with so many people.  We are so honored to recognize him and to thank his family.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-02-27-pt1-PgH1322-2.txt,2015,RECOGNIZING IMPORTANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE,2018.0,27.0,April

Although there is no such thing as a former marine, he was a U.marine for 22 years. He met Graham at a crusade. He volunteered to help him in his off-duty time and so impressed Graham that Billy Graham asked him to join his crusades.  He said: I can't do it right now. I have 2 more years in my commitment.  Billy Graham said: If you come to me at the end of those 2 years, I will put you on my team.  Forty-eight years ago, Henry Holley joined the team of Billy He became his Asian representative. In fact, today Henry Holley is the last of the original Billy Graham team who is left alive on this Henry is 90 years old, living in east Cobb County, and witnessing every single day all that he learned from Billy Graham and what Billy Graham's crusades meant to him.  They set up crusades in Rio de Janeiro, Seoul, South Korea, and all over the world. Henry Holley has been in and out of North Korea more than anybody in this country. He goes there with Samaritan's Purse to help people who are oppressed, taking to them the message of Jesus Christ, working and doing everything he can to improve the plight of those people who are oppressed and depressed by a rogue regime.  Henry Holley is one of the finest people I have ever known. I know when Graham passed away, Henry was not sad but happy because he has always talked about knowing that ultimately Billy Graham's place in Heaven would be his just reward. Henry could not wait until he could join Billy Graham there so they could be together at the end.  So I know Henry is probably watching, or if he isn't watching, somebody will tell him about my mentioning his name. I am doing it to honor Henry but also to honor Billy Graham, because the one-on-one passing of the Word from me to someone else, from Henry Holley to someone else, from Graham to someone else, is the way Christianity was built over the decades and over the years and will continue to be preserved in the years to come.  So as we honor in the U.Senate and in the United States of America a great man, a great leader, a man of God, and a servant of God, I am just so thankful I had the opportunity to be in this Chamber on the day we honored Billy Graham and his life.

383,topic-id,403,"Mr.President, the opioid and addiction epidemic continues to devastate communities across our country today. One of the greatest challenges for the 21 million Americans currently impacted by substance use disorder is to obtain and maintain employment while sustaining recovery. For the benefit of our Nation, we must work to implement interventions to improve employment rates among this chronically unemployed and underemployed population in treatment and recovery.  Research demonstrates that alignment of job training and treatment services improves employment attainment, employee earnings, and substance use disorder treatment outcomes, including lower rates of relapse. By holding a job, an individual establishes a legal source of income, structured use of time, and improved self-esteem, which in term may reduce substance use and boost our economy.  The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) is the major source of Federal support for workforce development. WIOA programs provide education and training services to prepare individuals for work and to help them improve their prospects in the labor market through job search assistance, career counseling, occupational skill training, classroom training, or on-the-job training; however, no dedicated funding currently exists to integrate workforce training into recovery and treatment services to enable individuals to secure and maintain stable employment. Participants enrolled in WIOA--beyond core service--achieve an adult entered employment rate overall of 82%, which rises to 87% for on-the-job training and apprenticeship.  I am pleased to introduce today with my colleagues, Senator Young and Senator Jones, the Jobs Plus Recovery Act, which addresses barriers individuals in treatment face when seeking employment opportunities. The Jobs Plus Recovery Act amends WIOA to empower our primary workforce development driver to better support the needs of individuals with substance use disorders by including them in the definition of an individual with a barrier to employment. The bill also supports partnerships between substance use disorder treatment and recovery providers, education providers, and job services providers, such as the American Job Centers established in WIOA, to improve worker training, employment opportunity and retention for individuals in recovery.  Throughout my time as a public servant, I have remained committed to ensuring our Nation's workforce is as strong as possible. Virginia businesses continue to share their desperate need for more applicants with the necessary skills to thrive in their industries. I am proud to introduce this commonsense, bipartisan legislation to provide critical support services to equip workers with the training and supports necessary to gain and retain meaningful employment.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-04-10-pt1-PgS2042.txt,2176,"BILLY'' F.

1023,topic-id,2411,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk about the tragedy in Parkland and the responsibilities of the Senate to try to make our communities safer. I am going to talk very personally about my own experience in confronting gun violence as a mayor of an urban area, Richmond, VA, and as the Governor of the Commonwealth of  I will start by saying, I am a gun owner. I am a Second Amendment supporter. When I was an attorney in private practice, I was the lawyer who worked with an effort to amend the Virginia constitution to guarantee Virginians the right to hunt and fish. The Second Amendment and private gun ownership is an important part of our framework. I support it, but I obviously believe that we can do things consistent with the Constitution that will make our Nation safer, and I ask my colleagues to join in that effort.  When I was elected to the Richmond City Council in 1994, Richmond, at that time, was only on one top 10 list that I am aware of. It is not the one you want to be on. We had the second highest homicide rate in the United We were not a high-crime area generally, if you looked at all crime, but in homicides and aggravated assaults--assaults committed with weapons--we were unusually high. The weapons of choice in these homicides and aggravated assaults were guns.  I remember very early in my time at the city council getting called to a neighborhood, Gilpin Court, which is a public housing community in my city council district. There had been a gun crime that killed an entire family of five--adults and little children.  Over the course of my 8 years of working in local government, I went to too many crime scenes and funerals and wakes. In some ways, the things that were the most memorable were the meetings in church basements of the families of homicide victims. We embarked upon a set of strategies to make our communities safer. Amidst all the bloodshed and the tears, we actually found strategies--some dealing with reductions in guns, some dealing with law enforcement strategies, some dealing with police and community relations. We found strategies that, over the course of about 8 years, reduced the[[Page S1300]]homicide rate in Richmond by 60 percent and the aggravated assault rate by an equivalent number.  Out of the pain, what we learned is you can actually take concrete steps that will make your community safer and that will reduce gun violence. You will not eliminate it. That is beyond our power as humble people to do, but you can reduce it. If you know you can, then you must. You have a responsibility to do what you can.  I was elected Governor of Virginia in 2005, and I will never forget April 16, 2007. I had just embarked on a trade mission. I had landed in Japan with a delegation to recruit business to my I had gone to the hotel, and I got a call after midnight from my chief of staff, who said: There is a shooting under way at Virginia  I said: Book me on the next flight home. I have been here for just a few hours on what was going to be a 2-week trade mission, but let me fly back home.  I flew back to what, at the time, was the worst shooting in the history of the United In April of 2007, 32 people were gunned down on the campus of Virginia Tech by a deranged youngster who had been adjudicated mentally ill and dangerous and was thus prohibited from having a weapon. But because of glitches and flaws in the background check system, he had been able to purchase multiple weapons, and he committed that horrible crime.  I empaneled a commission. I told them: Let the lawyers and lawsuits be damned. I want to know everything that went wrong, and I want to make public everything that went wrong and everything we can do to fix it. Over the course of a number of months, they produced a report with hundreds of recommendations.  The recommendations were about campus safety. The recommendations were about mental health, but there were also recommendations about fixes to our State and Federal gun laws to reduce the risk of this happening. I was able to make some changes on my own as an executive. I took other changes to my legislature that they rejected.  Again, out of the painful situation--and it is a funny thing to say about your own State, about my State of Virginia, about a place I love like Virginia Tech--I always hoped it would be the worst. I had always hoped that would have been the worst shooting in the history of the United States, but the Pulse nightclub shooting and the Las Vegas shooting now have claimed more victims. Other shootings, like those in Newtown and now Parkland--if the number of victims aren't the same, the tragedy is nevertheless of equal magnitude.  We learn through pain that you can make changes and improve. When I fixed a piece of the background check system flaw, it made us safer. It reduced the risk of gun violence and gun deaths.  My experience as mayor and Governor were painful, but I learned a lesson in both, which is you can take steps, including steps dealing with the rules about firearms that will make your communities safer. That is a powerful thing. You can take steps that will make communities safer.  I dealt with three lies--three falsehoods--over the course of these efforts as mayor and Governor, as I tried to help us take steps to make us safer.  The first lie was it is not about guns. It is about mental health; it is about other things. But that is just false. Equally false would be if we said that it is only about guns. That would be false as well. To say it is not about guns is a lie perpetrated by an organization headquartered in Virginia, the National Rifle It turned out to be false.  The key to reducing the homicide rate in Virginia ultimately was that we embraced strategies to reduce the gun carry rate. That is a phrase that law enforcement professionals use for the percentage of time where people, in normal interactions with the police, are found to be carrying a weapon. In Virginia, the gun carry rate was unusually high, and that meant when something broke bad or there was an argument, there would often be an aggravated assault or homicide committed with a weapon. We undertook strategies that drove down the gun carry rate. That didn't make bad people good people, but it made it more likely that when things broke bad, there wouldn't be an aggravated assault or a homicide.  So it was about the guns. That is the first lie or falsehood that gets perpetrated: It is not about guns. It is not only about guns, but it is definitely about guns.  A second lie or falsehood perpetrated by the same organization is that they would always say: You can't improve. They would say: That will not solve every problem. You can't solve every bit of gun violence if you do this. They would say this over and over again with any shooting. They would point out the number of things that wouldn't have stopped it, as if not being able to eliminate gun violence means that you shouldn't do anything to try to reduce gun violence. That is just a lie or a falsehood. I have learned from my experiences that if you take steps, you can make communities safer.  The third lie or falsehood we had to confront repeatedly from the National Rifle Association was that gun safety rules violate the Second That is just flatout wrong. In fact, the Second Amendment is the only amendment whose text even uses the word regulation. The need for a well-regulated militia gives individuals the right to bear arms.  What does the term ``well-regulated'' mean? It is not a reference to the length of somebody's beard or the kind of hat they should wear. There is an understanding that firearms are dangerous, and if individuals are to have the right to have them, there also must need to be some appropriate level of regulation. We are familiar with this in the rest of the  I am passionate about the First There should be freedom of the press, but you can't just libel or slander without consequence. The Framers, Madison and others, who put these amendments together, understood that the amendments to the Constitution included some limitations because we have to live together, not just as individuals who are free agents, but we have to live together in society.  Those three lies--it is not about guns; we can't do anything about it; and the gun rules violate the Second Amendment--are wrong.  I came to the Senate after the shooting in Sandy The first meaningful debate we had after I came here was whether we would do something to respond to this horrible carnage of kids in an elementary school.  The Presiding Officer was not in the I know you followed this as a citizen. I remember standing here in this Chamber in April 2013, casting a vote on a bill that I thought would have been a very good bill to do background record checks. We were surrounded in the Chamber by Sandy Hook families. Many of them were sitting next to Virginia Tech families who had come to be in solidarity with them. There was a feeling of despair, with them around, that was like the great cloud of witnesses referred to in the letter of Paul to the We fell short. They were praying for us to succeed, and we fell short. In the aftermath of that horrible tragedy, this body did precisely nothing.  Well, now we have experienced yet another horrible tragedy. There have been others since Sandy Hook, but it is my deep hope that after this horrible shooting in Parkland, something may be different in this body. The reason I think this one might be different is that these students are standing up and challenging us. The children of our Nation are asking adults to be adults. They are asking us to look in the mirror. They posed the question starkly: What is more important to you, your children or campaign contributions from an interest group?  I think the advocacy of the children of Parkland who suffer, not only their advocacy but the advocacy of students all over the United States--I have held meetings with Moms Demand Action in Richmond and Northern Virginia in the last couple of days, and many students were in these meetings. The advocacy of students and their challenge to us may show us a way.  I will conclude with a story that gives me hope and that suggests there may be some resonance to this moment. Sometimes there is a movement, but there isn't a moment. Sometimes the movement needs a moment to achieve a victory.  Fifty-five years ago, in the spring of 1963, Martin Luther King was trying to desegregate public accommodations in Birmingham, AL, with the[[Page S1301]]Southern Christian Leadership He had been going from community to community. In some places, they were able to desegregate public accommodations relatively easily. Other places were tough but none tougher than At drug stores and department stores, King and others would have adults go sit in--African Americans and their allies--and be arrested. Yet wave after wave of arrests notwithstanding, including the arrest of King, the city leaders would not back down. They would not shed the discrimination that violated the equality provisions of the  As this was going on, children in the Birmingham schools started to come to King and say: We want to march too.  King and his lieutenants really struggled with this. They were parents. They didn't want their kids to be arrested. They didn't want their kids to face guard dogs attacking them. They didn't want their kids to face firehoses directed at them. They had a natural parental reaction: We are going to do this; we want to protect you.  But the children kept coming and saying: We want to march too.  Finally, they said: Isn't this about us? As much as it is about adults, isn't this about us, your children? And if it is about your children, why can't we march?  King, after a lot of prayer and discussion, finally said: It is about you.  Mr.President, you know this, and for our pages especially, it was those children advocating--and they marched, and they did have firehoses turned on them, and they did have guard dogs released on them. The photos of those children braving that ugly face of discrimination landed on the front pages of papers all over the United States and all over the world, and it was transformative of the civil rights movement.  Adults in the Untied States knew there was discrimination, but they had become complacent to it or indifferent to it or had even said: I think it is wrong, but it will probably never change. But their children demanded of them: Adults, just be adults. Adults, you say you care about children; prove to us you care about children. And when the adults of America were confronted with the example of their own young people, they had to shake themselves out of their complacency and indifference and shoulder the burden that adults must shoulder.  That is what these students at Parkland are saying to us now. That is what these students all over the country are saying to us now. They are saying: This is about our future. This is about your children. And they are asking us whether children matter more or political contributions matter more.  I urge my colleagues, finally, let's not produce another goose egg in this body. Let's not come together after a horrible tragedy--when there are meaningful steps, such as background record checks, that we can put on the table to make us safer--and fail them yet again.  I ask my colleagues and especially the majority leader to enable us to have this debate on the floor so that we can take meaningful steps of the kind that we know will make our communities safer.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                      Yemen War Powers Resolution  ",CREC-2018-03-01-pt1-PgS1295-6.txt,2176,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2018.0,1.0,April
1193,topic-id,333,"Mr.President, our Nation's ongoing success and economic mobility depends on the skills and education of the American workforce and its preparedness to meet and adjust to the demands of today's economy. Career and technical education (CTE) programs are an essential component to each student's education, giving students the opportunity to gain knowledge, skills, and credentials needed to secure careers in growing, high-demand fields. Today, approximately 12 million students are enrolled in CTE across the country with CTE programs in thousands of CTE centers, comprehensive high schools, career academies, CTE high schools, and community colleges. Through applied learning, these students obtain technical and employability skills that parallel workforce demand.  According to the American Federation of Teachers, 94 percent of parents approve of expanding access to CTE and other programs that prepare students for jobs. CTE ensures that competitive and skilled workers are ready, willing, and capable of holding jobs in high-wage, high-skill, and in-demand career fields. Throughout Virginia, I've heard manufacturers express discontent with shortage of qualified skilled production employees--roles that require the instruction and training offered in CTE classrooms. It is vital that we heighten awareness of CTE's role in helping the United States to meet the very real and immediate challenges of economic development, student achievement, and global competitiveness.  This is why today, with my Senate CTE Caucus co-chairs Senator Portman, Senator Baldwin, and Senator Young and 41 colleagues in the Senate, I am proud to introduce a bipartisan resolution to designate February as Career and Technical Education (CTE) month. CTE Month offers an opportunity for students, parents, counselors, educators and school leaders to become more informed about the educational opportunities attainable in their communities, and acknowledge the importance of CTE in cultivating a skilled and well-educated workforce in our nation.  Through formal recognition of CTE Month through this resolution, it is our hope that we can foster greater support for the importance of improving access to high-quality CTE for millions of America's students and our country's continued economic competitiveness.[[Page S1254]]                            ____________________",CREC-2018-02-27-pt1-PgS1253-2.txt,2176,FRA SAFETY DATA IMPROVEMENT ACT,2018.0,27.0,February

Somewhere between 12% and 25% of military spouses are unemployed.  Today, I am pleased to introduce with my colleagues Senators Boozman and Tester the Jobs and Childcare for Military Families Act of 2018.

Teachers and school support staff have a simple request: a fair wage, funding to replace decades-old textbooks, and updating the buildings in which our children are educated.  For decades, Republican-led States made dramatic cuts to schools, harming students, and undervaluing our teachers, while doling out huge tax breaks for the rich and big corporations. Yet, as we see these teachers take a stand, Republicans keep trying to sell their trickle-down tax scam.  Remember, the latest GOP tax scam gave away 83 percent to the top 1 percent.  From 1996 to 2015, teacher pay, adjusted for inflation, fell by $30 per week. And reports state that some Oklahoma teachers work three, four, five, and even six jobs to pay the bills.  Cutting taxes for the rich doesn't give teachers and hardworking people a leg up; it deprives already cash-strapped communities of much-needed resources.  We can't short education. Liberty depends on it. I stand in solidarity with these teachers and many in Ohio and across our country who are fighting to ensure workers get a fair shake.

As an original cosponsor of the End Banking for Human Traffickers Act of 2018, I would like to first thank my coauthors, Chairman Royce, Representative Maloney, and Representative I am proud of our bipartisan work on this important issue.  This issue represents actions that are abhorrent, coercive, actions that constitute modern-day slavery. They also are sustained because they are among the most lucrative criminal activities we have in the world right now.  This is ranked as the third most lucrative international crime in the world. And it is a unique one in the sense that, unlike drugs, where they will market their poison to individuals and they will be ingested and consumed and that ends the transaction, tragically, you see, time and time again, that these young women, many of them children, over and over again are used by these financial purveyors of criminality in their actions to redundantly gain profits at the expense of destroying and taking away years of innocent lives.  This legislation is a testament to how important our bipartisan collaboration is here in the House, as well as among our colleagues in the When we have the opportunity to work together, we take meaningful action to address real harms being suffered by[[Page H3077]]innocent people here and around the world. And this is, indeed, not only an international issue where we need cooperation, but it is a domestic issue as well.  In 2012, the International Labor Organization estimated that there were 21 million victims of human trafficking worldwide. In the United States alone, over 8,500 human trafficking cases were reported just last year, and those are cases where the investigation was fruitful and the prosecution commenced, an understatement by multiple effects of what the actual incidence of this crime is.  While there are current laws to combat the practice of human trafficking by criminalizing perpetrators and providing support for victims, the End Banking for Human Traffickers Act of 2018 works to dismantle the economic framework that enables it and sustains it. It empowers the Secretary of the Treasury with the ability to assist and directly get involved to a greater extent with all the other agencies involved. I know, from my own experience, that the importance of that coordination will more easily lead to good cases and more effective prosecutions and bringing people to justice.  I come at this issue from many perspectives; one of them being my position, as with Chairman Royce, on the Foreign Affairs Committee, where we look at the international factor that we are trying to work cooperatively throughout the world and here at home to better prosecute, better bring to justice.  I also represent the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence in the Homeland Security Committee, and it is important to note that this criminal enterprise is one of the most prominent ways that terrorists fund themselves.  While we have had effect trying to eliminate the caliphate and the taxing that goes with that, we have seen terrorists lose those opportunities to raise money. However, what we have seen is them move even further into other areas to sustain their terrorist activity; and primary among them is the use of human trafficking and the funding for their terrorist activity through that criminal enterprise.  Another way I have come to view this is as a former District Attorney myself. I worked with the regional task force in the Boston region in Massachusetts to try and work to coordinate activities to seek out, to investigate, and ultimately prosecute human trafficking.  There is one thing I did know through my term as a District Attorney and looking at this issue as well, more specifically: If we are going to be effective, one of the best tools we have in terms of investigating, seeking out this activity, and bringing it to justice, is to follow the money, and that is what this act does. It follows the money. It uses the economic tools we have here, through the Secretary of the Treasury, among many other assets we have in this country, and it seeks out and will find out, from the money laundering standpoint, just who is involved, where this is occurring, and how we can attack it.  Human trafficking is a multi-billion dollar industry. Its perpetrators rely on banking and financial systems to fund and profit their crimes against innocent men, women, and children, and this bill will strengthen our work to target, prosecute, and to bring to justice those who reap financial rewards from this abhorrent criminal practice.  This Congress, the House passed a number of important bills dealing with anti-trafficking measures. This is one of the most important, and it strikes it at its heart, where we can find out where this is occurring, where we can investigate further everyone that is involved in this. It is not just limited to the people that we find in the initial investigations with these reports, we will be better able to bring everyone involved in this activity to justice.  So let's continue this momentum by passing the End Banking for Human Traffickers Act of 2018.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

This bill does both. We have the information; we have the expertise; now we must act decisively to put the best tools in the right hands to end this injustice once and for all. And by focusing on the financial mechanism that enables this and sustains this, we will be best able to combat it, not just in seeking it out and destroying it, but making sure, in a comprehensive way, we deal with all those wrongdoers that are involved, not just a few at the bottom rung of the ladder.

I would like to begin by thanking Representative Smith for sponsoring 128, which expresses support for human rights and encourages inclusive governance in I am a cosponsor of this resolution, along with over 100 of my colleagues--a testimony to the work Mr.Smith has put into this effort.  This resolution acknowledges the partnership between the United States and the Ethiopian We have partnered together on many issues in the world: economic issues, global health issues, and security issues. Indeed, the Ethiopian military benefits from the U.counterterrorism and peacekeeping support programs that we work with them on. However, it also expresses concern at the unrest in the Oromo, Amhara, and Somali regions since 2015 and the human rights violations perpetrated against largely peaceful protestors.  With the recent election of Prime Minister Abiy last month, Ethiopia now has an opportunity to emerge from this crisis to undertake the reforms called for in this resolution, including lifting the repressive state of emergency, repealing or amending proclamations used to suppress human rights, holding accountable those responsible for human rights violations, and releasing all remaining political prisoners.  As the ranking member of the Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee on the Foreign Affairs Committee, we have done a lot of work in that subcommittee around the importance of the rule of law and of legitimate, accountable governance in making sure communities are secure and more resilient to destabilizing influences from criminal and terrorist networks.  This is not just an issue for us on the international front. I am also a member of the Homeland Security Committee, and this is an important issue in terms of our safety and security here at home.  Prison sentences for peaceful protest, restrictions on freedom of the press, and broad enforcement actions against civil society organizations is a recipe for instability--instability that impedes economic growth and leaves countries and communities vulnerable to security and other threats, both globally and, as I said, back here at home.  When a society witnesses the arrest of over 22,000 persons and the closing of over 200 NGOs, we should expect to see the trust between communities and their government suffer as a result. Instead, the government should work towards promoting this trust that is so critical to the right of Ethiopians to live freely and safely at home, as well as to their government's strength as a partner with the United States and others around the world.  In light of recent events in Ethiopia, it is important to view Prime Minister Abiy's election not as the end of the[[Page H3072]]crisis, but as a new beginning for social and political reform in I hope he will undertake this challenge and undertake these vital reforms.  In the spirit of a new beginning, I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

While Nevada has made a tremendous recovery since the recession, the scars are deep and still fresh.  In the wake of the financial crisis, the CFPB was created to protect Americans from unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices that led to the financial crisis, and to take action against companies that break the law.  The CFPB has cracked down on predatory lenders and aggressive debt collectors, and forced financial institutions to return over $11 billion to Americans who have been taken advantage of.

800,topic-id,552,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize David Cousens of South Thomaston, ME, who will soon retire from being the president of the Maine Lobstermen's Association after a tenure spanning three decades. Dave's skills as a leader and savvy as a lobsterman have steered the organization and members of the industry it represents with a strong and steady hand through a period of increased landings, innovative conservation, and improved regulatory structure. Dave's hallmark over his entire career was an ability to listen to and foster respect between a diverse crowd of harvesters, regulators, scientists, and other members of the industry.  When Dave became president of the Maine Lobstermen's Association in 1991, great change was afoot. Then, with annual landings in the range of 30 million pounds, lobstermen were not limited in the number of traps they fished, draggers were permitted to land large quantities of lobster, and, despite a vast majority of it taking place in State waters, the fishery was managed federally. Furthermore, many of the conservation measures that we now identify as integral to the fishery were, at the time, only practiced voluntarily by Maine lobstermen.  Over the past 27 years, while running one of the most prominent industry groups in the State, Dave has not backed off his primary occupation, that of a lobsterman. The time he has spent behind the wheel of his truck getting to meetings up and down the coast of Maine, in meetings from Washington, DC, to Nova Scotia and everywhere in between, and on the phone with anyone and everyone has not stopped him from continuing to fish a full complement of traps--800 these days. This commitment, personal and communal, to an iconic Maine way of life is a significant reason why the fishery, which recently landed a record annual catch of 130 million pounds, is today both a crown jewel of Maine's coastal economy and a shining example of sustainability envied around the world.  For generations, Maine lobstermen like Dave have known that to ensure their future livelihood and that of their children--(his three sons are also lobstermen)--they must responsibly shepherd the resource. Under Dave's leadership, the Maine Lobstermen's Association successfully helped transition management of lobster fishery from the Federal New England Fishery Management Council to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and, as a result, expanded the Maine practice of marking egg-bearing females and returning them to the water so they may continue to breed to other States and Canadian provinces. He also oversaw successful efforts to significantly reduce the large amount of lobster that was being caught in the Gulf of Maine as bycatch in draggers' trawls, limit the total number of traps that lobstermen fish and increase the size of escape vents that allow juvenile lobsters to escape a trap. Most recently, as the fishery moves further offshore amidst warming ocean temperatures and concerns about its implications on whale population have arisen--Dave's trademark leadership style has set the stage for meaningful exchange and beneficial compromise on an issue that will likely get a lot of attention in the coming years.  As Dave looks forward to spending a little more time with his family and friends, I wish to commend him on the exemplary leadership over the years--listening, learning, and always keeping a clear, insightful, and good-humored eye on the horizon.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-27-pt1-PgS1238-3.txt,1724,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2018.0,27.0,February

Mr.Speaker, when someone says ``human trafficking,'' oftentimes we view it as a problem far away from our shores that affects people who are not us. It is hard to imagine that this modern-day slavery is happening over here, hurting the people within our community every day. In my home State of Illinois, we have the fifth highest number of trafficking cases in this country; and the city of Rockford, in my district, is ranked second behind Chicago in human trafficking cases.  The most important thing we can do to combat this heinous crime is to raise awareness. That is what the SOAR to Health and Wellness Act is designed to do. This important legislation would expand on a pilot program with the Department of Health and Human Services by supporting the training of healthcare workers to identify victims and best care for them through established protocols and procedures.  Many times, when trafficking victims come to emergency rooms, healthcare professionals may not always spot the signs that their patient was a victim of human trafficking. Education is critical in combating human trafficking, and our awareness could, in fact, save a life.  Mr.Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support H.767. I believe it can have an impact towards identifying cases of human trafficking and helping the most vulnerable and at-risk individuals of this evil crime.

Billy Graham preached the Gospel, and his influence can hardly be quantified. His ministry career and crusades inspired and motivated millions, and carried out his mission to save souls around the world.  Early in his career, Reverend Graham served the Midwest as a pastor in Western Springs, He attended Wheaton College and in 1981, they opened a center in his honor. During his time in Illinois, Graham took on a radio ministry program based in Chicago and expanded his activism. From there, he began to completely transform American religious life through his compelling sermons and preaching. Billy Graham went on to serve across the country, in many ways and on many platforms. He provided spiritual counsel to every President of the United States from Harry Truman to Barack Obama, and was a strong figure in the civil rights movement urging for integration.  Mr.Speaker, Billy Graham was a humble servant to the Lord who changed countless lives for the better. His was a life well lived. And I know his legacy will live on forever.

1115,topic-id,700,"Mr.President, I rise today to congratulate Team USA and to recognize the contributions of so many Minnesotans at the 2018 Olympic Winter Games in South  I am happy to be joined here by my Senate colleague from Minnesota, Senator Why are Senator Smith and I here today? We are here because we had an incredible Olympics, with Minnesota really leading the way when it came to the gold medals.  Of course, our State is no stranger to the We have sent athletes to compete in women's basketball and cycling. But it shouldn't be a surprise that it is the Winter Olympics where the bold northern State really shines. We have a couple of things going for us. The weather is kind of cold. There is snow, so people are able to practice. We also have a great athletic program at our high schools, and we have a lot of team spirit, which is especially helpful in the teams we were a part of that won the gold, including men's curling and women's hockey.  Of the 243 athletes who were on Team USA, 23 have ties to Minnesota, making it the third highest represented These athletes competed at the highest level and showed the world just what our State could do. If Minnesota were competing as a country, it would be tied for 12th, globally in the number of gold medals won. But we are not a country; we are a proud This success is something all Minnesotans can celebrate.  Mr.President, here are some examples for you. Winning a gold medal was a first for Afton native Jessie Diggings and a first for the United Her road to the Olympics started on the cross-country skiing trails that cover Jessie worked to keep spirits high in training and during the Olympic competition. She put glitter on her cheeks as a reminder of what made her fall in love with cross-country skiing as a little girl. Her relentless energy and drive were on full display. She and her teammate, Kikkan Randall, became the first Americans to bring home a gold in cross-country team history. It is no surprise that they voted Jessie to be the flag-bearer for the closing ceremony.  Jessie and Kikkan weren't the only American women to bring home gold. The women's hockey team won their first gold medal since 1998.  It is no coincidence that the ``State of Hockey'' sent some serious talent. The American team included six current or former Gopher College players and two current or former Minnesota Duluth players. From Warroad to Minnetonka, the Minnesotans on Team USA brought pond hockey toughness and the experience that comes from growing up on the ice. This gold medal will help inspire the next generation of hockey players in  I want to make a special note of our incredible goalie, Maddie If anyone stayed up--which I did--to watch that shootout at the end, she showed such poise and such grace under pressure.  I also want to make a little note of Warroad, MN, which produced the incredible Gigi Marvin, along with many other gold medalists from the past.  While Americans were fans of hockey well before the 2018 games, these Olympics helped introduce the country to a sport already loved by so many Minnesotans--curling. I will note that Senator Cornyn of Texas sent out a tweet saying that curling was an obscure sport. I don't think anyone thinks that anymore. They might think it is kind of an interesting sport, but it has gone from obscure to cool. A lot of that has to do with the men's curling team. Four out of five of the members of that team were from our home State of In that game, the match went from 1 to 4 in the morning or midnight to 3. I can't tell you how many Minnesotans were up all night watching that and celebrating the gold medal.  The success of Minnesotans has been inspiring, and I know Senator Smith agrees. From frozen ponds to backyard hills, Minnesota helps bring the winter athlete out in everyone.  I congratulate Team USA and all Minnesota athletes who made these games such a success.

The reduction in the corporate tax rate enables U.companies to compete on a level playing field with foreign businesses without having to move their headquarters abroad.  Here in the U.S., in each of our districts, they can invest their savings back into their businesses. This is because the reform changes the equation for what will make them more profitable. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act now means that expanding factories and payrolls here in the U.make better business sense.  Northrop Grumman, which has a significant presence in my district, California's 25th, announced it would increase capital expenditures by 10 percent and provide a $1,000 per year contribution for each of their employees' retirement accounts.  Millions of Americans have received increases in their paychecks. Check your check.  The Treasury Department estimated that 90 percent of Americans will now receive more take-home pay.  The reform reinforced positive trends we have experienced over the past few years. U.jobless claims have fallen to their lowest level since 1973.

340,topic-id,2128,"Mr.President, let me do a quick history lesson with this body. In 1773, the Colonies we were getting more and more frustrated with King There were a lot of issues we raised with him--a lot of taxes, a lot of changes, things that were happening in the judiciary, things that were arbitrary that were coming down. Then it boiled to a head.  In December of 1773, a group of American colonists went out to Boston infuriated with the tariff policy over tea. The British East India Company had special access that no one else had. They had no taxes and everyone else had a tax--a tariff. It pushed out all of the other companies except for the British East India A group of American colonists went out to one of the ships, grabbed all the tea in the harbor, and threw it overboard, creating the legendary Boston Tea  That was an argument about tariffs. It was an argument about international trade. It was an argument about American companies and fair trade, and we still talk about it today.  It is interesting to note that in our letter that Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1776, which we now call the Declaration of Independence, in the long list of grievances that we wrote out to King George, we included this line: We are cutting off our trade with all parts of the world as one of our big grievances. That grievance fell between the grievance of the British Government allowing British soldiers to murder inhabitants in America and our taxes without consent. In between those was cutting off our international trade. We have been free traders as a nation since even before we were a nation, and we have been passionate about keeping it fair but keeping it free and keeping it open.  Free trade is a big issue for us, and for some reason it has become this big national conversation again. Should we have free and fair trade? Should we continue to engage? What does it mean to have a deficit in our trade? Does it have to be equal with every country, that they buy from us as much as we buy from them? Suddenly, this has become a brand-new dialogue again.  I wish to bring a couple of real world moments to this, beginning with the history lesson, by stating that trade--and international trade, specifically--was important to us even before we were a country. We were gathering supplies from all over the world to be able to do our basic production. We are still doing that today.  For some reason I run into people that think this international supply chain is something new in this generation. I tell them that they should look at our history and see that the United States has always had an international supply chain.  We are also 25 percent of the world's economy. There is no nation in the world that can afford to buy as much from us as we buy from them. We are the largest economy in the world, by far. We are going to buy more from other countries.  The issue is, How does this work in our economy and how do we make sure we protect American manufacturing and the American consumer at the same time? Let me walk through what this looks like.  Charlie and Mary Swanson are Oklahomans and third-generation farmers and ranchers who live in Roosevelt, OK, with a whopping population of 241. The agricultural products they produce help feed the world. They raise wheat, cotton, cattle, and milo.  Every year their crops are harvested using John Deere equipment. We look at the John Deere tractor and its beautiful green and we think: That is a great American company, except that parts of the equipment also come in its original form from Parts come from India, and parts from Most of the parts come from the United They employ 60,000 people in the United  It is a great American company--John Deere--but their cabs are made in Their hydraulic cylinders are made in The castings from the foundry are from Iowa, but the guidance products are from Some of the transmission and electronic parts come from India, and[[Page S2056]]other parts are from We see that as a great American tractor.  The crews that harvest some of the Swanson's crops are folks that come in--legally, by the way--from New Zealand, Ireland, or South The wheat they produce goes to export markets all over the world. Some of it goes to Egypt, some to India, Japan, and South  Their cotton is used all over the United States, but it is also shipped to China, as well, to produce fabrics. Some of the fabrics end up being made into garments that are shipped from Some of them end up right back here in the United States again, having started from the cotton from Roosevelt,  The milo they raise goes to feed. Most of that feed goes to If you are from Oklahoma, you may consider that international trade, but it is still domestic trade. A lot of the feed goes to  They raise cattle, our great American beef. We eat as much beef as we can possibly eat in Oklahoma, and the rest of it we ship all over the world. Their beef is used in Oklahoma and all across the United States, but it is also sent to Japan, Korea, and  Understand this, just as an aside: In 2017, U.beef producers exported 1.2 million metric tons of beef worth $2 billion. That is just American beef going around the world. Two leading partners in that are Canada and Mexico--$980 million in exports. It is a big part of what they do.  Charlie Swanson drives a Ford F-150 pickup. It is a great American product; isn't it? It is a great Ford truck. That F-150, by the way, is a fantastic vehicle. It is completely assembled in the United States, but the aluminum in that great American truck comes from About 15 percent of the components in that great American truck come from Some parts even come from That F-150 is not only used extensively in the United States, but it is also shipped around the world. There are a lot of F-150 trucks on the roads in Mexico, Canada, and, yes, even in  That F-150 rides on four good, solid American-made tires, but the steel cord in those good American tires comes from all over the world. The steel in most of our tires is not made in the United A lot of the chemicals that go into the production of those tires are from Europe, Asia, and Latin They are good American tires. A lot of them are made in Oklahoma in the Goodyear facility--a phenomenal facility--or the Michelin plant in They make great American tires for a lot of vehicles all across the United States, but they have parts and pieces from around the world in those American-made tires, and they are shipping them out as well. So just speaking about Charlie and what is happening in Roosevelt, OK, population 241, the products they produce are going all over the world. The products they use, such as the John Deere tractor and the Ford F-150 with the Goodyear or Michelin tires are American-made, but are dependent on trade from all around the world.  I could talk about Brent Hancock, born and raised in Kiowa County, He left Kiowa County and went to the big city of Stillwater to attend Oklahoma State University, where he received his doctor of veterinary medicine degree. He returned back to Kiowa County and opened a veterinary clinic in Hobart in 1995. For over 20 years, Hancock has been taking care of vaccinations for sheep, cattle, pigs, goats, cats, and dogs. It is also rumored that Hancock can operate on your rabbit, but that is a whole different story.  He vaccinates these animals with vaccines to provide some of the safest agricultural products in the world. Some of those vaccines come from companies like Bayer, which is an international company based in He also uses products from They have offices in 50 countries, and they produce and ship their products to 140 countries around the world.  Again, we look at him and say that he is a good American veterinarian. He must be all American, but he actually depends on products from all over the world to provide basic things.  I cannot talk about Oklahoma without talking about oil and gas. Most of the pipe that goes down the hole in most of our wells is produced from steel that is not made in That particular type of steel that is down holding those wells is produced around the world but not here. We are dependent upon oil and gas that goes in the F-150 pickup and the John Deere tractor, and a part of it relies on steel from around the world.  I can take you to Tulsa, OK--slightly larger than Kiowa County, I would say--to a manufacturing plant called They employ 100 people and produce components for refrigerators and air conditioners. They import products from Europe, and they combine them with products that they are making in the United States and assemble them. That final product is sold all over the country and is also sold to Canada and Mexico--all from one company in Tulsa,  Drive up the road from Tulsa to Bartlesville to a manufacturing plant operated by They create a lot of products that are in wells, pipelines, and refineries all across That company imports products from suppliers from Canada and Mexico, and they create a final product that is sold all over the United States, and they sell it right back to Canada and Mexico as well.  This shouldn't be shocking to anyone. This is the same structure that we have had since the 1700s as We produce some of our products and ship them out. We buy some to be able to use in manufacturing. This is a nation that is very interconnected to the world, and it is exceptionally important that our trade agreements get resolved as fast as possible.  I want fair trade. We had unfair trade in 1773 that we protested in the Boston We still want fair trade agreements right now, but those trade agreements need to be resolved as fast as possible. Farmers and ranchers in Oklahoma cannot wait a year to find out what is going to happen in our trade policy. Some of them are on the edge of the knife right now of bankruptcy. They can't get anything on the futures market to try to figure out what is happening in the now to be able to make the basic investments they need to make for this year's crops.  Predictability helps us, just like fair and free trade does. So while I understand full well that the administration is engaging in trade negotiations around the world, I encourage them to move from talking about these trade agreements to settling them--getting them resolved with Mexico and Canada and getting the best deal that we can have, resetting this agreement with NAFTA for another generation to prepare us for the future. Let's get that resolved. Those are our two largest trading partners. Resolve our trade agreement with Korea, locking that one in and finishing out all the area around Asia as well. Twelve of those nations have already resolved the trade agreements they are into, putting us behind. Those nations are forming contracts now. We need to engage as soon as we possibly can.  There are big issues with China and trade. They have not been fair in all their trade agreements. We need to resolve our issues with China, and I am pleased that this administration is leaning in to resolve a long-term issue with China trade. It is about time someone does it, but we also need to get it resolved. We don't need retaliatory tariffs moving across every industry in our Nation destabilizing what we are doing in the economy. Let's get these issues resolved.  Quite frankly, many of the trade issues that we have with the rest of the world aren't their tariffs, but they are our regulations. When our regulations and American redtape from our own government slow down our own economy, let's deal with our own house to make sure what we produce is competitive around the world, but in the meantime, let's move our trade conversations to trade agreements so we can continue to move on toward doing the same thing we have done since the 1700s as Americans; that is, trading with the entire world and leading the world with it.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (",CREC-2018-04-11-pt1-PgS2049-3.txt,2050,HONORING THE SESQUICENTENNIAL OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CONNECTICUT'S,2018.0,11.0,February
1429,topic-id,971,"Mr.President, it was an exceptionally moving service in the Rotunda today. For a man to be able to lie in honor in the Rotunda, for the Nation to pause for a moment, and for the leadership of the House and Senate, on both sides of the aisle, and the President of the United States to all stop and for a moment look at a wooden casket, simple as it was, and remember the legacy of a man who gave his life telling people that Jesus loves you, it is a remarkable day. It is not a common day in the U.Senate, in the House, to break in the middle of the day to be able to go to the Rotunda and just contemplate this simple fact: There is a God whom you can know who loves you.  It is interesting to think back on some of the legacy of He had been to Oklahoma many times. In 2003, I had the opportunity to be the chair for the Youth Night of that mission. It was a moving night, and there were a lot of people there, as there were at all of his events. That night, there were thousands and thousands of teenagers there, and Graham unpacked a message about Solomon, a person who had everything. He challenged them--for this person who had everything--but he always came back to say all of these things were vanity, and, really, at the end, it is knowing God that is going to matter.  He even challenged people of power. In that message that night in Oklahoma City, he said:       People like power and prestige. Solomon had more power than      any man in his generation. No nation dared to defy him. But      he looked upon all his mighty military power and said that      even power brings no sense of fulfillment, or joy, or peace.       The Bible talks about another power--the kind of power that      helps when the crisis comes. 2Timothy 1:7: ``God did not give      us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and      of self-discipline.''  And then he said this:       Jesus Christ said, ``All authority in Heaven and on Earth      has been given to me.''  Then he quoted Paul's words: ``For I am not ashamed of the Gospel, for it is the power of God to salvation.''  That night, many students responded to that simple invitation to be able to know a God who doesn't give you power, but He is power.  If you asked most Oklahomans, though, what was the moment they remember most about Graham coming to Oklahoma, they would say it was in 1995 after the Federal Building was destroyed by a domestic terrorism event. Graham was there the Sunday after that tragic attack on Oklahoma and on the He gave a message to Oklahoma City, to Oklahomans, and to the Nation, and he laid out a sense of hope. Toward the end of his sermon he said this:       This event also reminds us of the brevity and uncertainty      of life. It reminds us that we never know when we're going to      be taken. I doubt that even one of those who went to that      building to work, or to go to the children's place, ever      dreamed that it was their last day on earth. That is why we      each need to face our own spiritual need and commit ourselves      to       It's ironic that this terrible event took place just three      days after the churches of this city were filled with people      celebrating Just one week ago today. And throughout      the world, the Eastern Orthodox churches celebrate Easter on      this day. And Easter always brings hope to all of us. For the      Christian, the Cross tells us that God understands our      suffering, for He took upon Himself at the Cross all our sins      and all of our failures and all of our sufferings. And our      Lord on that Cross asked the question: ``Why? My God, my God,      why hast thou forsaken me?'' And he received his answer. He      knew: To redeem the world. To save you and me from our sins.      To give us assurance that if we died we're going to heaven.      He was saying from the Cross, ``I love you!'' And I know the      heartaches and sorrows and the pain that you feel.       Easter points us beyond the tragedy of the Cross to the      hope of the empty tomb. It tells us that there is hope for      eternal life, that Christ has conquered death. And it also      tells us that God has triumphed over evil and death and hell.      This is our hope, and it can be your hope as well.  Graham ended his conversation by saying: ``My prayer for you today is that you will feel the loving arms of God wrapped around you and will know in your heart that He will never forsake you, as you trust Him.''[[Page S1267]]  This was a significant day for Oklahomans to begin the healing process together.  It is quite remarkable to have America's pastor be laid to rest. Graham would assure all of us that the same hope he experienced, that he shared with as many people as he possibly could, was not unique to North It wasn't unique to his family. It wasn't even unique to It was God's great affection for all people. The offer of that love that could turn around a heart like his, could turn around the heart of a nation, and it could turn around the heart of all people.  It is a good day to remember. It is a rare moment for us to be able to stop and pause in the way we have today. I think it is a significant message that should not be forgotten.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

Local and foreign visiting artists alike make invaluable social and economic contributions to our communities. Today our complex, overloaded, and outdated immigration system often prevents foreign artists from coming to the United States and engaging in international cultural exchange.  That is why I am reintroducing the bipartisan Arts Require Timely Service, ARTS, Act with Senator Orrin Our bill would assist nonprofit arts organizations in obtaining visas for foreign artists by ensuring enforcement of current statutory requirements. The O visa is available to individual foreign artists, while the P visa is available to groups of foreign artists. The Immigration and Nationality Act currently requires that O visa and P visa petitions be processed within 14 days. However, artists and nonprofit arts organizations routinely confront lengthy and uncertain wait times in the adjudication process. Many nonprofit arts organizations are unable to afford the exorbitant filing fee necessary for expedited processing of petitions.  The ARTS Act would require USCIS to provide premium processing services, without a fee, if an O visa or P visa is not adjudicated within the statutorily required 14-day timeframe and if the petition is filed by or on behalf of a nonprofit organization.  The many problems plaguing our immigration system demand responsible reforms. This bill is just one small piece. As we look ahead to comprehensive immigration reform, I hope that Congress will consider commonsense legislation like this that will help create permanent solutions. Foreign visiting artists provide an important public service and support our international diplomacy. It is time we start working to create results that can best help our communities as a whole.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2018-02-28-pt1-PgS1288.txt,1383,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2018.0,28.0,February
1233,topic-id,1908,"Mr.President, on February 18, 2018, New Hampshire lost one of its finest lawyers and humanitarians, Maurice Duane He was 83 years old.  Some might ask why, as a Senator from Vermont, I would call the Senate's attention to a resident of our neighbor to the east. In fact, Maury Geiger not only had close ties to Vermont where, in 1982, he cofounded the Rural Justice Center in Montpelier, he was in every respect a global citizen. Over his long career, he worked to improve access to justice in Haiti, Bangladesh, Rwanda, and several other countries.  I met Maury Geiger years ago and will never forget going with him, my wife, Marcelle, and my staff member Tim Rieser to visit the national penitentiary in Port au Prince, A more squalid example of a corrections facility would be hard to imagine. It was overflowing with thousands of impoverished men of all ages, sweltering in the heat and humidity, crammed into cement rooms with nothing to sleep on but the floor, with little food and vulnerable to AIDS, tuberculosis, and other dangerous diseases, and the vast majority had never been formally charged with any crime. Some had languished there for 2 or more years, far longer than any sentence they would have received if tried and convicted. Almost none had lawyers.  After first laying eyes on that unforgettable scene of inhumane neglect, Maury returned to Haiti year after year, determined to do whatever he could to help improve the lives and protect the rights of those caught up in Haiti's corrupt, dysfunctional justice system. It was that same passion for justice that took him to the courts and jails of rural America and to distant places like Addis Abba and  As his obituary describes, Maury was born into poverty, and that experience, and his mother's guidance, shaped his character. He served as a naval aviator and then at the Department of He was as patriotic and as fierce a defender of the Constitution and Bill of[[Page S1213]]Rights as anyone I have known. He became one of our country's first experts in court administration, and he worked throughout his life to teach others about the fundamentals of a modern justice system.  Maury loved his work, and he cared passionately about fairness. He devoted his life to fighting for justice at every opportunity. Knowing what it means to be poor, Maury did not hold himself above anyone. He was not the least bit impressed by wealth or titles. He loathed the self-importance of so many government officials and the abuse of power, especially when it was at the expense of those without power, which is so common in places like Haiti where inequality is glaring and the rule of law barely exists. He was known for his irreverence, just as he was for his wonderful, dry sense of humor.  Over the years, I have met countless accomplished people, many of them of the highest integrity. Maury Geiger could match any of them. He was as ethical, selfless, compassionate, and determined a champion of the less fortunate as anyone I have known.  My thoughts are with Nancy, his wife of 58 years, and their four sons, Robert, Kevin, Tom, and I know they are all proud of the principled example Maury set for all of us.  I ask unanimous consent that the February 20 obituary of Maurice Duane Geiger in the Conway Daily Sun be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Conway Daily Sun, February 20, 2018]       Maurice Duane Geiger, 83, died 18, 2018, following a      long struggle with Parkinsonism, at his home in Center      Conway, surrounded by family at his bedside. He dedicated his      life to justice.       He was born on 20, 1934, south of White Cloud, Mich.,      and east of Newaygo, in an isolated log cabin with no running      water except the creek out back. He lived the first years of      his life in the cabin with his five siblings, spending much      of his time with the animals and plants of the surrounding      woods. The cabin, which his father had helped build, burned      to the ground when Maurice was 6.       His father was Lawrence Geiger, and his mother was born      Marguerite His parents separated while Maurice was a      child. His mother, whose grit and wisdom served as a support      and guide for Maurice, was a schoolteacher. She ended up with      a different post nearly every year, and Maurice said he had      moved about 15 times before he graduated from Clinton High      School in 1952.       He then attended Michigan State University, while he worked      40 hours a week at an Oldsmobile plant to support his family.      He received his bachelor's degree from Michigan State in 1956      with a major in police administration.       After college, he joined the Navy and graduated from flight      school at the Naval Air station in Pensacola, He was an      aviator on active duty in the Navy from 1956-1957. Following      his active service, he moved to Washington, D.C., serving in      the reserves for several more years, finally leaving as      lieutenant commander. In D.C., he first worked as a      corrections officer in the Bureau of Prisons and then as a      computer programmer for the During this time, he met      his future wife, Nancy Crocker, in a boarding house in the      nation's capital where they both rented rooms. They married      on May 27, 1960. They had four sons, each born two years      apart starting in 1962.       While working days, Maurice took night classes at      Georgetown University Law Center and he received his law      degree in 1963. He went to work for the U.Department of      Justice in 1965, becoming the director of the department's      Management Information Office the next year.       He left the Department of Justice in 1969, following the      election of Richard Nixon, saying that the department was      becoming too politicized and no longer interested in justice.      He was recruited by former U.Supreme Court Justice Tom      Clark to develop management systems capability at the Federal      Judicial Center, which serves as staff to the U.Supreme            In 1972, he and his family moved to Birch Hill in North      From 1972 to 1976, he was a staff attorney and      adjudication specialist for the New England region for the      Law Enforcement Assistance During the late      1970s and early 1980s, he worked with Ernest Friesen, dean of      the California Western University School of Law, studying and      working to improve court systems throughout the country by      helping them to reduce backlogs and delays.       In 1982, he co-founded the Rural Justice Center with      Kathryn They worked together to reform judicial      systems in rural areas and small towns throughout the United      Starting in 1995, the Rural Justice Center      concentrated on international programs. Maurice made scores      of trips to Haiti, spent 15 months in Bangladesh, and also      worked in Rwanda, Ethiopia, the Republic of Georgia, Armenia,      and other countries. He was awarded the New Hampshire Bar      Association's 2008 Daniel Webster International Lawyer of the      Year In 2016, he was honored by Haiti's Supreme      Council of Judicial Power for his two decades of service      working to improve the country's judicial system.       The United States Agency for International Development      issued him a certificate of appreciation ``in recognition of      Maurice Geiger's tireless advocacy for judicial and prison      reforms in Haiti, which have benefited thousands of      His unflinching and selfless quest for justice, taken often      at great personal sacrifice to his own health and finances,      have made him a hero to the Haitian people and to all who      have crossed his path.''       Over the years, he appeared on ``CBS News,'' ``60 Minutes''      and in front-page articles in The New York Times concerning      Haiti and judicial reform issues.       He was a member of both the Virginia and New Hampshire bar      associations.       ``Looking back over the last 50 years,'' Maurice told the      New Hampshire Bar Association's Bar News in 2013, ``I find      that I take the most satisfaction from helping to bring      relief to the . . . poor souls trapped in the godforsaken      prisons and jails wherever they exist.''       He later estimated that his work had helped free several      thousand Haitians who should have no longer been in prison.      Many of them had languished in prison awaiting trial for      longer than they would have been sentenced to serve if they      had been found guilty. Maurice spent considerable time with      children at an orphanage in Haiti and brought loads of      supplies to them during his many trips to the island. He      said: ``My most memorable experience was living through the      devastating earthquake that hit Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in      2010.''       Despite his travels, Maurice immersed himself in the civic      life of the Mount Washington       He was a delegate to the New Hampshire Constitutional      Convention in 1974. Beginning in 1976, he practiced law in      Carroll County, primarily taking pro bono and court-appointed      cases.       He served as president of the Eastern Slopes Little League      in 1977. He was elected to three terms on the Conway School      Board, serving nine years from 1975 to 1984. He was elected      Carroll County Attorney, and served as the county's      prosecutor from 1992 to 1994.       Maurice loved playing sports with his sons and with other      young people in the area. On weekends, he could often be      found playing touch football on the green in North Conway in      summer and fall, or boot hockey by Third Bridge on West Side      Road in winter. He also spent many hours playing basketball      and tennis. He served as an umpire at Little League games and      later as a line judge for the Volvo International tennis      tournament in North He was an occasional poet, and      several of his poems were published in Mount Washington      Valley newspapers.       U.Patrick Leahy of Vermont, where the Rural Justice      Center was based, honored Geiger by entering a tribute into      the Congressional Leahy said, ``The example he has      set of selflessness, of caring, commitment to human rights      and equal access to justice, and of an unwavering belief in      the basic dignity of all people regardless of their station      in life, is one that every law student, every lawyer, every      prosecutor, every judge, and every prison warden should      strive to emulate.''

1371,topic-id,409,"Mr.No American should have to relinquish all of their privacy rights in their cell phones, laptops, and other electronic devices, simply because they are coming home from a trip abroad. Yet that is exactly how our Government views it: currently, if a Vermonter crosses the border into Canada for a day, U.Customs and Border Protection (CBP) can search through the Vermonter's emails, text messages, photos, and anything else contained in their electronic devices without any reason to suspect the person is in violation of anything. Let me repeat that: without any suspicion at all. That is unacceptable.  That is why I am joining with Senator Daines to introduce legislation to require the Government to have reasonable suspicion or probable cause to search or seize Americans' electronic devices at the border. This legislation is a vital step toward protecting our Fourth Amendment rights, while also ensuring that officers protecting our homeland have the lawful authorities they need to do their jobs.  Last year, CBP searched the electronic devices of over 30,000 travelers, and this number continues to grow. These searches can take place at any international airport, or at any land border point such as U.S.-Canada border crossings in my home state of Vermont or Senator Daines's home state of  Nothing in this legislation will prevent CBP officers from doing their jobs to protect the homeland, detect contraband, and enforce the law. Our legislation simply says that if an officer of the Government wants to search an American's electronic device at the border, at a minimum they should have reasonable suspicion. If they want to seize the device, they should have probable cause. And if they want to conduct a forensic examination of the device, they should get a warrant from a judge.  Our legislation also requires the Department of Homeland Security to collect statistics on such searches and seizures and report them to This will significantly increase transparency on the Government's use of these invasive tools, providing Congress and the American people an opportunity to assess the balance between the needs of law enforcement and the imperative of protecting privacy and civil liberties.  I urge other Senators to join us in support of this legislation.

773,topic-id,2610,"Mr.Speaker, first, let me thank Congressman Dwight Evans for, once again, hosting this very important Special Order and for really continuing this fight for racial and economic justice both here in the House of Representatives but also in his congressional district. So I thank the gentleman very much for his tremendous leadership.  Fifty years ago at the height of the civil rights movement, violence erupted in cities across Over generations, systemic racism had produced what Martin Luther King, Jr., called a tale of two cities. One city was bright and full of opportunity for a select few, and another city was shrouded in darkness and locked in a never-ending cycle of poverty.  African Americans, suffocating under the pressure of institutional racism and discrimination, took to the streets.  After race riots erupted in Watts and Chicago; Newark, New Jersey; and Detroit, our government took notice. President Johnson convened the Kerner Commission, which Congressman Evans laid out, which had three goals to investigate the root cause of the unrest.  Many activists and civil rights leaders were concerned that the Commission wouldn't reveal the true facts. But to our surprise--and I remember this very clearly--the report was brutally honest.  According to the report, White racism was responsible for the rising tensions and explosive violence ripping our Nation apart. So that should have been a wake-up call.[[Page H1364]]                                {time}  2030  Racism had created two societies: one Black, one White, separate and unequal. The report identified the problem and proposed a series of targeted solutions that could right this terrible wrong.  According to the report, there were three options for our government:  One, do nothing, which would result in more riots and economic devastation and racial division in our country;  Two, we could make robust investments into African-American neighborhoods and schools;  Three, take racism and discrimination head-on, removing discriminatory barriers that lock African Americans into poverty and prevent them from accessing the basics and a basic standard of living.  Option three, of course, could have drastically changed the lives of millions of African Sadly, the Kerner Commission's report was largely ignored. Again, Congressman Evans laid that out.  Instead of investing in education, employment opportunities, livable wages, raising incomes, and pathways out of poverty, this country, unfortunately, has allowed institutional racism to divide this Of course, we have made some progress, but this updated report clearly shows that is not nearly enough. We really are still a divided country. As a result, the findings of the 1968 Kerner Commission's report remain constant to this very day.  In 1968, almost half of all students of color, primarily African Americans, went to majority-White schools. Today, that number has plummeted to 20 percent.  In 1968, the unemployment rate for African Americans was 6.7 percent. Today, 7.5 percent of African Americans are unemployed.  In 1968, African Americans were 5.4 times as likely as Whites to be in prison or in jail. Today, African Americans are 6.4 times as likely as Whites to be incarcerated.  Five decades have passed and economic inequality still prevents the African-American community from accessing the American  I represent the 13th Congressional District of California, which includes Alameda While some are witnessing and experiencing enormous wealth and economic growth in my district, 43 percent of African-American children in Oakland are living in poverty, 23.6 percent of African Americans in my district are locked in poverty, and the average income for African-American families in the San Francisco Bay Area is $46,571 a year, compared to White families, who make more than $109,000. That is in my district in the San Francisco Bay This gap is one of the hugest gaps in the country. It is a total disgrace.  We should be leveling the economic playing field for African Americans across the Instead, we throw Black workers meager wages and apply trickle-down economics that only benefit the rich.  Our Federal Government should provide the impetus, incentive, and investment for good-paying jobs for African-American workers. Instead, this administration is attacking unions and produced a budget that guts job training programs and a tax law that makes it easier to ship jobs overseas.  We should be investing in affordable housing, which, yes, is a basic human right for everyone, including the African-American community. Instead, this administration is weakening fair housing laws and rationing off affordable housing funding.  The majority of this administration's proposed budget--the cuts, especially--will disproportionately negatively impact African Americans and people of color. This really is a twisted and sick reality that shouldn't be possible in the United States of  But members of the Congressional Black Caucus are here tonight to say that we continue to be determined to change this reality because, yes, Black lives do matter. We are here to tell the truth about what is dividing America: racism. It is manifest in many forms in our policy, in our budget, in our funding priorities, and in many, many ways.  In January, a group of nearly 100 religious leaders came together to issue a unity declaration on racism and poverty. Mr.Speaker, I include in the record a letter, a document, entitled, ``Unity Declaration on Racism and Poverty,'' and a document entitled, ``Circle of Protection.''                Unity Declaration on Racism and Poverty       As leaders from diverse families of U.Christianity, we      are called by the Spirit to work together with new urgency      against the resurgence of racism and the persistence of      poverty in We see around us an increase of harmful      attitudes and policies toward people of color and people in      need. That painful reality and the current push for trillions      of dollars in cuts to anti-poverty programs are bringing us      together in a new way. While we have different positions on      other questions, we are united on the gospel and biblical      teaching on poverty and racism--feeling invited to do so by      the grace of God in Jesus       We believe that racism and poverty are theological issues       The integral relationship between poverty and racism      unifies us against both. They are both issues to which the      gospel of Jesus Christ speaks--which also calls us to love      our neighbors, without exceptions. Our unity on these issues      is because they are theological issues for us, not merely      political or partisan ones. These fundamentally biblical      concerns challenge all of us and both of the major political      parties.       Racism is a sin that goes back to the founding of our      nation. At its root, racism is in conflict with the opening      declaration in Genesis 1, that we are all made in the image      and likeness of Racism literally throws away the      biblical principle of imago dei--the image of God in all of      us, with no exceptions. Racism is a sin against God and all      of God's children. Therefore, the whole counsel of God calls      us to preach against the sin of racism from all of our      churches' pulpits and call for repentance.       The body of Christ is perhaps the most diverse racial      community in the world. When people of color in the body of      Christ suffer--while many white members of the body of Christ      do not acknowledge their pain--we are violating the principle      laid down in 1 Corinthians 12: that we are one body with many      parts, who suffer with and honor one another. As Galatians      instructs us, ``there is no more Jew or Greek, bond or free,      male or female, because we are all united as one in Christ''      (3:28).       The historical sin of racism lingers on in America today,      continuing and evolving in our social systems of economics      and education, policing and criminal justice, housing and      gentrification, voting rights and suppression, in our racial      geography, and, painfully, in the continued segregation of      our churches, which adds to our own complicity. Racism is      more than individual behavior, language, and overt hostility      toward particular people. Racism is systematic and structural      in America and harms people of color in very specific,      measurable, and tangible ways.       The failure to defend the lives and dignity of people      living in poverty, by individuals or governments, is also a      sin against God, with 2,000 verses in the Bible clearly      outlining God's fundamental concern for people who are poor,      vulnerable, and oppressed, instructing the people of God to      protect and help them and holding political leaders      responsible for them. Jesus says, in Matthew 25, that how we      treat the ``least of these'' is how we treat Christ himself.       The world and our country have made progress against      poverty in recent decades. It is possible to make further      progress--perhaps virtually end--hunger and extreme poverty      in our time. We see the alleviation of material misery as an      experience of God's loving presence in our own time, and      believe that God wants us to seize this opportunity.             To our churches: What we are doing and can do       Most of our churches are active in helping people in need,      struggling people within their congregations or in their      communities. We need to do more, but many of our churches      directly help millions of people every day. Local church      leaders often work to bridge the racial divides in our      communities, and many are searching for authentic and      specific ways to address the rise of white supremacy.       Since the God of the Bible requires social justice and      charity, our churches and many of our members also work to      influence public policies. Christians have a wide array of      political viewpoints. But a majority of the leaders of      national church bodies have spoken out repeatedly against      cuts to programs that provide help and opportunity to hungry      and poor people in our country and around the world. We have      also spoken out against renewed expressions of white racism,      ethnic nationalism, and hateful attitudes toward people of      color, immigrants, refugees, Jews, and Many of us      are active in support of immigration reform, criminal justice      reform, and voting rights for all.       We are deeply troubled by the budget proposals coming from      Congress and the president. They outline more than $2      trillion of cuts in programs for hungry and poor people in      our country and around the world. These cuts would hurt      struggling people of all races, including millions of low-      and middle-income people who need safety-net programs at some      time in their lives. The hardest hit would be African      American, Latino, and Native American communities, where the      poverty rate is already high, and among people in the poorest      countries in the world.       The threat over the coming year of this broad assault on      anti-poverty programs that[[Page H1365]]     support families struggling to make ends meet is unifying      us--bringing us together in a more vigorous, multiracial      Christian movement to maintain a circle of protection around      all people in poverty and God's children of color in      particular, who are disproportionally impacted.  To Congress and the White House: Our united appeal for healing and                     reform in our nation's politics       We appeal to the president and Congress to work together      for the common good. We especially call upon political      leaders who are also people of faith to protect all the      people in our country and world who are struggling with      economic deprivation and frustration, hunger and poverty,      disability and disadvantage--and racial bigotry that often      contributes to inaction and hard-heartedness.       God's love for all people moves us to reach out to people      and leaders all across the political spectrum. We respect and      pray for all those who are in authority--that our nation and      world ``may lead a quiet and peaceable life'' (1 Timothy 2:1-     2). Conservative and liberal people, and those with differing      political philosophies, may disagree on how to live up to our      nation's ideals, but our loving God calls all of us to work      together for liberty and justice for everyone.       We appeal to all people, especially Christians, to actively      work against racism and poverty--in their personal and local      engagement and as advocates for public policies that foster      racial equity and healing, shared prosperity, and peace in      our country and worldwide. The spiritual power of a fresh,      energetic, multiracial Christian movement against both racism      and poverty is our prayer. So help us                              SIGNATORIES       Eddy Aleman, Strategic Director of Leadership      Development and Hispanic Ministries, Reformed Church in      America       David Anderson, Founder/Senior Pastor, Bridgeway      Community Church;

This was an ecumenical group of over 100 religious denominations: ``Racism is more than individual behavior, language, and overt hostility toward particular people. Racism is systematic and structural in America and harms people of color in very specific, measurable, and tangible ways.''  Mr.Speaker, the Kerner report, unfortunately, was ignored, and 50 years later, we are still feeling and reaping the consequences. The difficult truth is that, until we address the impact of the middle passage and slavery of generations of African Americans and believe that truth and reconciliation must happen, 50 years from now, two cities will have destroyed the very fabric of our  As the unity declaration goes on to say: ``Racism is a sin that goes back to the founding of our Nation.''

776,topic-id,461,"Mr.Speaker, in many communities, housing was segregated. We passed fair housing laws. Affordable housing now is out of reach for many African This administration is now gutting all of our fair housing programs, our public housing programs, our Section 8 programs.  The banks, of course, did target African-American communities for these subprime scam loans. Unfortunately, any equity that had been built in the homes that we purchased after 1968 is gone. So the wealth gap is huge. It is greater than what it was probably in 1968.  When you look at the number of African Americans who were unemployed in 1968, I believe it was a little over 5 percent. Now we are looking at 7 percent.  When you look at the incarceration rates for the war on drugs, the marijuana laws in this country, especially in the eighties and the impacts of that, we have so many of our young African-American men incarcerated for misdemeanor and felony charges for marijuana distribution and use. We are looking at mass incarceration that has taken place since 1968 of African-American young men and women.  So, yes, we have made a lot of progress. I stand here as the 100th Black Member of Mr.Evans is here. We have a Congressional Black Caucus that has increased in size. We have many, many allies in our fight. But I think what we haven't addressed is the issue of racism and institutional racism, because it is so subconscious for so many people until many decisions are made which negatively impact the African-American community.  So from 1968 to now, we have made some progress. We have some great professionals, people doing wonderful things in our community. We have great leaders. We have great scientists, lawyers, doctors, teachers, firefighters, and workers. We have so many people who have been able to lift themselves into the middle class, but we have left so many behind.  That is the point, I think, that, while this new report shows that some of us have progressed, we didn't do what was necessary to bring everyone along with us, to lift everyone out of poverty in the Black community and provide for a level playing field for equality, for parity, and for a pathway into the American  That is really very sad and very shameful, but I have a lot of hope that our young people and that we here in the House and that the country really begin to understand that we have to address the root causes of what has happened in this country as it relates to the middle passage and slavery, and to understand that what we see today in these respects that cause these economic and racial disparities go right back to the unfortunate, devastating, and horrific middle passage.

I really appreciate our whip, Steny Hoyer, and our leader, Nancy Pelosi, for rallying around this concept of looking around all these issues of poverty, inequality, and opportunity.  We put together this task force to begin to look at the policies that not only we need to support that are lifting people out of poverty, but what we need to do to fight against some of the policies and funding priorities that would lead more people into the ranks of the poor.  This task force now has over 100 people. We have meetings with experts, with organizations that are doing wonderful work throughout the country in communities of color and low-income communities and the Black communities, really demonstrating that there are some grassroots efforts and community efforts that, while here in Congress we haven't been able to change many policies, at the grassroots levels and the community level there are some wonderful people doing some great things to help lift people out of poverty and into the middle class.

938,topic-id,1193,"Mr.President, 200 years ago this month, a man was born into slavery in a cabin not far from here in[[Page S1228]]The child knew his mother only briefly; they were cruelly separated when he was young. He knew his father only by the rumors. He didn't even know the exact day of his birth. Yes, even his birthday--for many of us, that foundational aspect of identity--was denied him by the cruel master of slavery.  This slave was whipped and beaten. His days were filled with toil. His nights were filled with restless turning on a packed dirt floor. But that is not where the story ends--no, it is only the beginning of the incredible life of Frederick Douglass, the great abolitionist, orator, and one of the greatest Americans ever to live. As Douglass would later write in his memoirs, ``You have seen how a man was made a slave. You shall see how a slave was made a man.''  For all its terrible might--its bloodhounds and its implements of torture--slavery was not built to withstand Frederick Douglass, just as it was not built to withstand the universal desire for freedom that lies within the heart of man.  Douglass knew that the first step to freedom was education, so he taught himself to read in secrecy because slaves were punished for learning to read. Around the time he was 12, he got hold of an old textbook called ``The Columbian Orator.'' Little did Douglass know that around that same time, the same textbook was being studied on the Illinois prairie by a young man named Abraham In that textbook, Douglass found speeches by George Washington and Benjamin Franklin--men who revolted against tyranny to claim their liberty. In that book, he also found a fictional dialogue between a slave and his master where the master brought forward ``the whole argument in behalf of slavery . . . all of which was disposed of by the slave.'' Douglass wrote: This exchange ``gave tongue to interesting thoughts of [his] soul.'' It kindled his burning conviction that slavery was wrong and he must escape it. From that moment on, Douglass was a grave threat to the very institution of slavery itself. He was free in his own mind.  Douglass' journey ``from the tomb of slavery, to the heaven of freedom'' would go through many dramatic twists and turns before its conclusion. When a notorious slave breaker tried to beat him for disobeying orders, Douglass wrestled him into submission. He insisted on being treated as a man, and from that day forward, he was never whipped again.  Douglass' first attempt at escape was a failure, thwarted at the last minute by a betrayal of confidence. He did not fail a second time. In 1938, traveling in disguise under an assumed identity, Douglass took a steamboat north to the blessedness of freedom. At this point in the story, you might expect Douglass to fade from history, to enjoy a modest and tranquil life with his wife and his children. But no--the former slave, who taught himself to read through the words of Cicero and Washington, went on to be history's most eloquent witness against slavery. He denounced the bloody institution in 1,000 speeches and from the pages of his own abolitionist newspaper, The North Star, and he denounced slavery firmly from inside the American tradition.  Like many radical abolitionists, at times Frederick Douglass was profoundly ambivalent about his own country. Indeed, there was a time in his early adulthood when he affirmatively hated the United States, preferring disunion to union with slaveholders. But Frederick Douglass later came to a different conclusion about When he read the Nation's founding documents, he did not find codified defenses of slavery; to the contrary, he found that the compromises the Founders had made to slavery were meant to undermine that institution over time, not to sustain it. What Douglass found in the Founders was quite different from what he had expected to find. He later said: Their message ``is `We the people'; not we the white people, not even we the citizens, not we the privileged class, not we the high, not we the low, but we the people.''  Douglass was an activist, yes, a militant, yes, who led recruiting drives for Black soldiers during the Civil But for all of his righteous anger, he did not want to cast aside the principles of his country. Douglass knew that the most powerful antidote to injustice was found within the American tradition, with its insistence on natural rights for all men.  Douglass wrote:       From the first, I saw no chance of bettering the condition      of the freedman until he should cease to be merely a freedman      and should become a citizen. . . . The liberties of the      American people [are] dependent upon the ballot-box, the      jury-box, and the cartridge-box; that without these no class      of people could live and flourish in this country.  Frederick Douglass has many lessons to teach us if we are willing to listen. I would like to highlight just one more, which I think is especially relevant to us today.  At the end of his famous autobiography, Frederick Douglass contrasted two societies: the slaveholder society he was born into and the northern society where he was reborn in freedom.  The slave society he described was built on force and fraud. Its religion had been perverted to serve earthly idols. Its families were torn apart at the auction block. Its workers toiled to no reward. This society had been poisoned by its rejection of the American creed, by its insistence that all men are not created equal. Indeed, it had become an authoritarian society that policed movement, association, even intimacy. And for what? To protect a hideous falsehood.  The free society Douglass described was different. Here, a man could hold an honest job, and he worked because his work was rewarded, not because he feared punishment. Here, a runaway slave could make a name for himself, rising to a position of esteem in his community through his service. Here, a family could put down roots and flourish.  Those are two very different societies, guided by very different beliefs. One is a weak community hiding behind a show of strength. The other is a strong and free community with absolutely nothing to hide.  Today we are blessedly free from the institution of slavery, but our communities have their own problems. The American family is in crisis. Our prisons are full, and our pews are empty. Heroin and opioids enslave millions. Many more are killed before they even get the chance to live.  Yes, we have our own battles to fight. In too many ways, we have fallen short of the high principles upon which our Nation was built. That ultimately is why the legacy of Frederick Douglass is so very important. He implored his generation to heal itself of its greatest disease. He calls upon us to do the same.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1061,topic-id,855,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Evans for his tremendous leadership and his friendship, and I thank him for hosting this very important Special Order hour. His leadership in our caucus to fight the epidemic of gun violence in America is bold, it is visionary, and I thank him for calling us together tonight.  Mr.Speaker, let me also just acknowledge my sister and colleague Congresswoman Robin Kelly, who spoke earlier. Congresswoman Kelly chairs our Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust, and she continues to demand that gun violence be treated as the public health crisis that it is.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus to say enough is enough. The epidemic of gun violence in America must be brought to an end.  Two weeks ago, the world stood in shock as yet another gunman massacred innocent students and teachers in an American school. The 19-year-old killer legally purchased an AR-15 assault rifle and killed 17 students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  My heart goes out to the victims, their classmates, families, and the entire Parkland community. We must take action so that this never happens again. Newtown, Aurora, Charleston, Orlando, Las Vegas, and now Parkland, this is not normal in a civilized society.  The United States of America is the only developed nation that experiences mass shootings with this level of frequency. This doesn't happen anywhere else in the world. Of course, we know it is because the National Rifle Association can't buy their votes in other countries, and the children's lives come first.  Speaker Ryan and the Republicans in Congress have been bought by the National Rifle Association, making it easier for mass shootings to occur.  Let me just say that mass shootings in public schools, unfortunately, are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to gun violence in Our communities, especially our urban communities, are war zones.  On an average day, 93 innocent lives in America are cut short due to gun violence. This year alone, there have been over 8,200 incidents of gun violence in America, including 24 mass shootings. These senseless acts of violence have taken more than 2,200 lives already.  I represent the 13th Congressional District of California in the bay area, which includes the city of Oakland, which has been brutalized by gun violence. Since 2014, 312 of my constituents have had their lives cut short by gun violence. Our community feels their loss every single day. Here are just a few of their names and tragic stories.  Davon Ellis: Davon was a star football player and an excellent student at Oakland Tech High He was shot and killed while walking home from school. My nephew was walking with him when he was gunned down.  Travon Godfrey: Travon was killed in 2016 while sitting in a car with his friends in front of his home. Every time I think about Travon, my heart breaks. Travon came to a town meeting that I held on gun violence in January of 2016.  He was worried about coming to that town meeting, and he shared the toll that gun violence had taken on his life and that of his friends' lives, yet he was determined to make a difference and finish school and go on to college. Less than a year later, on November 28 in 2016, Travon and his lifelong friend, Deante Miller, were shot and killed in broad daylight.  Anibal Andres Ramirez: Anibal was Oakland's youngest gun victim in 2017. He was only 13 years old and was shot outside of a community center.[[Page H1256]]  Francisca Martinez Ramirez: She was one of Oakland's first homicide victims in 2018, killed by her husband during a domestic dispute.  Sadly, these heartbreaking stories are all too familiar in communities across the country. More than 30,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence each year. Shootings now kill as many Americans as car accidents.  Last year, there were 77 gun violence homicides in my home city of                              {time}  2030  Already this year there have been 12. This is only February, Mr.How much bloodshed will we see this year?  We need action and we need it now. We need to pass, of course, the bipartisan King-Thompson legislation that strengthens background checks and keeps guns out of the wrong hands. And, yes, we need to reinstitute a ban on assault weapons to get these weapons of war out of our communities. We need to close the gun show loophole once and for all.  Passing our assistant leader Congressman Clyburn's legislation to close the 3-day loophole to require background checks to be completed before you can buy a gun, that legislation is long overdue. That is common sense.  At some point we have to stand up and say enough is enough and stand up to this Ninety-seven percent of Americans support some kind of gun violence prevention legislation.  So that is why I am standing here tonight with my colleagues from the CBC demanding that the Speaker take action and bring commonsense gun legislation to the floor for a vote.

511,topic-id,435,"Mr.Chairman, section 230 of the Communications Decency Act has been an important element of the law. It has allowed the internet to flourish. We support that.  But we never intended section 230 to protect people who are trafficking in human beings, who are abusing children, who are prostituting children. Really, modern slavery. It is an outrage.  And when we saw the court cases about Backpage where they basically used the CDA as a shield for action that was absolutely criminal, in my judgment, those guys belong in prison, as far as I am concerned. The good news is that the bill drafted by Representative Wagner actually fixes this problem.  We just got a letter from the U.Department of I just received it. This is what they say: ``Every day, trafficking victims in America appear in online advertisements that are used to sell them for sex. The Department works diligently to hold traffickers accountable for their crimes but faces serious challenges.''  It goes on to say that the ``high evidentiary standard needed'' is a problem; but it also says that that bill, as drafted and reported from the Judiciary Committee, addresses the issues that are preventing prosecution, and it ``would take meaningful steps to end the industry of advertising trafficking victims for commercial sex.''  I would just like to say thanks to the authors of the bill, as well as the Judiciary Committee, on which I serve. We worked together on a bipartisan basis to make adjustments. We had hearings so that we could have this bill that the Department of Justice says will allow them to successfully go after these guys who are trafficking these children and other victims.  A word of caution, however, and I will talk about this later when the amendment comes up, on the Walters amendment.  The Justice Department says in this letter that they believe ``any revision . . . to define `participation in a venture' is unnecessary,'' and, in fact, that the ``new language would impact prosecutions by effectively creating additional elements.'' In fact, they say the amendment will make it harder to prosecute.  We get told in law school that bad cases make bad law. One of the ways to avoid that is to have the committee process work through it. That did not happen in the case of the amendment that will be offered later.  So based on the Justice Department's admonition, I am grateful to their celebration of the underlying bill, and I am mindful of their warning that the amendment could undo all of the good work that we have done on a bipartisan basis.

523,topic-id,743,"Mr.Chairman, section 230 of the Communications Decency Act stands for a very simple, powerful idea: a website should not be liable for the actions of its users.  Because of section 230, we have the internet as we know it today. Also, because of section 230, the vast majority of websites can safely and effectively report and coordinate with law enforcement on various crimes, including sex trafficking, child pornography, and the like.  Unfortunately, section 230 has been utilized by bad actors, including a notorious one, Backpage, to traffic in children and to exploit victims. Really, they are slavery victims. The underlying bill, H.1865, puts a stop to that. As the Department of Justice has noted, it will allow for the prosecution of people who are trafficking in victims online.  The Walters amendment, however, for the first time, would carve a hole in section 230 and make it actually more difficult than the underlying bill to prosecute traffickers online. By creating potential liability for ``knowing'' that a user is using their website for facilitating sex trafficking, the Walters amendment would create what legal experts call the moderator's dilemma.  There is no obligation under law to moderate your website. In fact, if you[[Page H1303]]have 2 million users or 10 million users, you really don't know what is being posted by your users. But under this amendment, if you made any effort to try and find out what was happening among your users--as many websites do today, especially for child pornography, but also for trafficking--you would incur liability because you would then have a reason to know.                              {time}  1515  Other laws that deal with intermediary liability, such as a requirement to report child pornography or copyright safe harbors of the DMCA, have very clear and specific provisions on when a website has sufficient knowledge and what express actions it should take. The Walters amendment has none of these. There is no case law on it either.  So the amendment really would put web owners in a very weird place. If you do anything to moderate, you are risking liability. The safe incentive would be to not monitor at all. That would be tragic and it would be a gain for child predators, although I know that that is not the intention. You can't stop moderating just for trafficking. You either moderate or you don't moderate.  We do know that there have been tremendous advances for machine-operated filters to find child pornography. Actually, that is one of the easiest things to find, using filters, and it is very important that websites cooperate with law enforcement to catch those bad guys.  Under the Walters amendment, the disincentive would be huge not to do that. I think that is why the Department of Justice does not support the Walters amendment.  As I said earlier--and the chairman put the letter into the Record--the Department believes that any revision to define participation in a venture is unnecessary. They say that, while well-intentioned, this new language would impact prosecutions by effectively creating additional elements that prosecutors would have to prove at trial.  That is why it is a bad idea to adopt this amendment. As the chairman of the committee has said, section 4 of the amendment also violates the ex-post facto clause of the Constitution by attaching criminal liability to actions that preceded the enactment of the bill. This is clearly unconstitutional.  Although I don't have any doubt as to the good intentions behind the offering of this amendment, it would actually impair the ability to protect victims. It would make it more difficult to prosecute, as the Department of Justice has pointed out.  It didn't go through the Judiciary I think that is a major fault. One of the things we were able to do in the committee--and we did this together, on a bipartisan basis--was to sort through the unintended consequences of seemingly simple language.  Nothing in writing law is simple. Certainly, nobody wants a provision that is going to negatively impact prosecutions; have unintended consequences for State actions, as the Department of Justice has pointed out; and would provide a disincentive for people to moderate activities to try and catch bad guys and to work with law enforcement.  So, although the intentions are good, the amendment is flawed. I hope we vote ``no'' on it, and then I hope we give a resounding unanimous vote ``yes'' for the underlying bill.  Mr.Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-02-27-pt1-PgH1290-2.txt,701,CLOTURE MOTION,2018.0,27.0,March

928,topic-id,845,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from Colorado for yielding me this time to speak on this rule.  I have to admit, I was a little confused when I walked in, based on what I was hearing on the other side, of what bill we were actually discussing. And let me just say this, Mr.Speaker, before I get into why I am rising today in support of these important bills that have bipartisan support.  Being someone who has been on the receiving end of being shot at, we have to focus on how do we make our children safe. I think everybody in this Chamber is deeply, deeply concerned on that. We have to assume the next shooter is there and he already has a weapon, and the actions that we take must be focused clearly on how do we make these children safe. I don't think there is any person in this Chamber who would disagree with that, and especially, I know, on our side of the aisle, so we are committed to that.  But today, we are here speaking on a rule that is very important for two substantive bills that we are bringing up, and I rise in support of not only my bill, the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act, but also my colleague, Mr.Luetkemeyer's bill, which we are also discussing here.  This week, the House is continuing to take up strongly bipartisan bills from the Financial Services The committee has passed, so far, Mr.Speaker, 91 bills in this Congress, and we have taken our remarkable productivity to the floor by passing 36 bills out of this Chamber, and six of them have been signed into law.  My bill, which we are beginning to debate here today, is another strongly bipartisan bill which will provide regulatory relief for financial institutions and increase access to capital and credit for businesses and consumers.  Mr.Speaker, there is a historical trend for the government to overregulate after an economic recession. The recovery from the financial crisis of 2008 to 2009 was weak and slow for many reasons, not least of which was overregulation of the financial sector by the Dodd-Frank Act and the previous administration.  Some would argue that there is also a trend to underregulate during good economic times like we are living in now. Some say that the regulatory relief legislation that we passed out of[[Page H1283]]the Financial Services Committee will lead to abuses by big banks and other financial institutions and cause another financial crisis.  But these bills will not cause the government to underregulate banks and credit unions. They will simply implement smart regulation. In other words, these bills do not gut or eliminate regulation. They right-size regulation and make it more efficient.  Back in 1996, Congress did a good thing by passing the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, or as we call it, EGRPRA requires the banking regulatory agencies to go back once every 10 years--that is, once a decade--and review their regulations to identify those that may be outdated, unnecessary, or overly burdensome, and then they are to send a report to It also requires the agencies to eliminate regulations if they determine they are inappropriate.  Make no mistake, EGRPRA was a good idea back in 1996, and it is a very valuable tool, but far too often EGRPRA regulatory reviews have been viewed as merely a check-the-box exercise by these agencies and in the financial sector. Many believe the two EGRPRA reports, which were released in 2007 and then a decade later in 2017, were lackluster and could have produced more useful recommendations to policymakers; and under the current EGRPRA law, it will be another decade before we could actually look at those regulations again.  EGRPRA could also result in more action from the regulators to clean up outdated and unnecessary rules. That is why it is important for Congress to revisit EGRPRA and to revitalize this law.  My bill contains several reforms to the EGRPRA review process that will breathe new life into the law and make sure it is not simply a check-the-box exercise for regulators. This bill will require more frequent regulatory reviews by moving the review cycle from 10 to 7 years. It will expand EGRPRA to include all regulated financial institutions instead of only the insured depository institutions. It will expand EGRPRA to include the CFPB, and the bill will also codify the National Credit Union Administration into EGRPRA, since the NCUA participated in the latest review voluntarily.  The bill will also require the CFPB to use its findings from its Dodd-Frank regulatory reviews and its EGRPRA reports so the CFPB does not waste time on rules it has already reviewed. And most importantly, this bill will require the agencies to tailor rules they find to be unnecessary, outdated, or overly burdensome based on the size and risk profile of the bank or credit union--that is, the regulators making the determination, not the banks and not the institutions.

930,topic-id,762,"Mr.Speaker, I am wrapping up.  This bill passed out of the committee with a strong bipartisan vote of more than two-thirds of the committee members, including all Republicans and eight I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bills.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, with all due respect to my colleagues, I mean, let's be honest, the two bills that we are debating today are ``nothing burgers.'' I mean, you know, I just figured this out. In the Rules Committee, we have spent 43--43 percent of the bills that have come before the Rules Committee have been financial service-related bills, mostly to undercut Dodd-Frank and to reward big banks and powerful special interests.  But, you know, we could debate that, but no matter what you think about some of this legislation, most of it, I think, has been either, you know, destructive to our economy or it doesn't add up to very much of anything. But no matter what you think about it--and we could say that banking issues are important--they are not as important as protecting our kids.  I mean, 43 percent of the bills that have come before the Rules Committee have basically been attempts to reward big corporations and big financial institutions in this country. We have spent zero time, zero percent of our time, discussing legislation to ban bump stocks. We have spent zero percent of our time in the Rules Committee considering legislation to strengthen and expand universal background checks. We have spent zero percent of the time debating a bill to ban assault weapons. We have spent zero percent of our time discussing how we can restrict high-capacity magazines.  I can go on and on and on. We spent zero percent of our time on the issue of guns, notwithstanding that we are seeing massacres occur on a regular basis in this country. There is something wrong here, and, I mean, we have the time; and if this were a priority, we would be talking about some of this commonsense gun legislation today rather than, as I said, these ``nothing burgers'' that are now before us.  Mr.Speaker, less than 2 weeks ago, a gunman walked into a school in Parkland, Florida, and gunned down 17 students and teachers. Unfortunately, senseless acts of violence like that one are far too common. According to Everytown for Gun Safety, every day, 96 Americans are killed with guns; and every year, there are 13,000 gun homicides in the United  With this most recent tragedy in Parkland, Americans have stood up and said: Enough is enough. We have all been inspired by these eloquent and passionate voices of these young students from Florida who have had the guts to stand up and speak truth to power. But you know, Mr.Speaker, according to a Quinnipiac poll from last week, over 90 percent of Americans are in favor of universal background checks for gun purchases; and according to a CNN poll from yesterday, over 70 percent are in favor of stricter gun control laws generally.  The American people are clamoring for action on this issue, and we have yet to do anything about it, not one thing. As I mentioned, all of our time has been spent mostly on legislation to help the well-off and the powerful in this country. We have not spent any time at all talking about this issue of guns, which are killing our kids. But today, my Republican colleagues have an opportunity to put the safety of our children over the power of the gun lobby.  Mr.Speaker, I ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question, and if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up three commonsense gun safety bills: H.4240, the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act; H.3464, the Background Check Completion Act; and H.2598, the Gun Violence Restraining Order  These bills would close the dangerous gun show and internet sale background check loopholes, prevent the sale of guns without a completed background check, and ensure that people who are a danger to themselves or others can be prevented from purchasing or possessing a gun.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

1497,topic-id,592,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, Representative Hultgren, for taking this time to do something that is so worthy.  You know, we live in a city where we have vast monuments erected for people who have left an impact on this Nation or on the world. When you walk the Halls of this grand and beautiful Capitol, there are statues of those who have made significant marks and changes to this  As I stand here today, I think of the gentleman who is going to lay in honor in the rotunda tomorrow, how he left such an impact on the world. He is probably the greatest impact on this[[Page H1326]]Nation and this world of modern times. The monument to him is in the hearts of literally billions of people who he touched with one simple message: God loves you.  That was as simple as Billy Graham would speak to the hearts of millions of Americans that God loves you and he cares about you individually as a person. That resonated so strong that it is estimated that--and this was in 2008--that through his ministries and his radio and television and his crusades, he reached over 2.2 billion people with a simple message that God loves you, and it is a message of truth.  He has had such an impact, as had been spoken of earlier, on a number of world leaders that he impacted with that simple message. The words that he shared--and he left us many quotes, and many of us are inspired by those quotes--but the words that he used that were most impactful were the words of He just repeated the words that Christ had given us.  He was also a man of great, great courage. A lot of people don't realize the close relationship he had with Martin Luther King, And in the 1950s, when Billy Graham came to the south and he was going to preach at one of the crusades, he noticed that there was a rope running through the middle of the congregation, a rope that separated Whites from He was so offended, he went and asked that that rope be removed; and when the ushers refused to do it, Billy Graham went and moved the rope himself.  That sparked a friendship with him and Martin Luther King, When Martin Luther King, penned his famous ``Letter from Birmingham Jail,'' he condemned a lot of churches for not being engaged in what we believed that God created everyone in his image and that they should all be equal. But Billy Graham was not one of those. He stood strong.  In fact, in 1960, when Martin Luther King, Jr., was in prison, Billy Graham paid his bail. Billy Graham has left a mark, but we still fight some of the battles that he warned us of and he fought back then.  A couple of the quotes that have meant so much to me that Billy Graham left us with is one that God's will will not take us to where God's grace will not sustain us, knowing he was preparing us for battles that we have to fight.  He also stated that the Founders who pinned our Constitution believed in a freedom of religion, not a freedom from religion. And finally, even though we are in a time of crisis in this Nation, things are happening we don't understand, the last quote that I will leave you with that Billy Graham said is: ``I've read the last page of the It's all going to turn out all right.''

55,topic-id,306,"Mr.Speaker, when it comes to bank regulation, the job of the regulator is to balance the need for economic growth with the safety and soundness of the financial system. With fresh memories of the most recent financial crisis, it is natural for regulators to err on the side of being overly cautious so they aren't blamed when something goes wrong.  Unfortunately, this has led to a situation in which regulators are evaluating stress tests based on subjective and unclear standards. The stress tests are opaque; it is like asking banks to kick a field goal when they don't even know where the goal posts are. What is more, the regulators keep ratcheting up the standards.  For the stress tests to achieve their goal, however--the goal of keeping the financial system safe and sound--they need to be transparent and they need to be fair.  H.4293, a bill with bipartisan support, would approve the stress testing process for bank holding companies by repealing the ability of regulators to reject a financial institution's stress test based on subjective and opaque standards.  Another important improvement to the process would be the elimination of the overly burdensome midcycle review by shifting from biannual to annual stress testing requirements.  These reforms would make it easier for Congress, the markets, and the public to assess both the integrity of the findings of the stress tests and the effectiveness of the Fed's regulatory oversight.  Some critics, nonetheless, have claimed that this bill would weaken Dodd-On the contrary, H.4293 would improve the flawed standards of Dodd-Frank and strengthen the stress testing process to ensure that it produces the results we seek: a safer and more stable financial system.  Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York, Lee Zeldin, and Congressman  David Scott for supporting this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

256,topic-id,461,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.4061. Among other important provisions, a key component of this bill is the creation of a new subsection K within 113 of the Dodd Frank This section calls on FSOC to consider ``the imposition of prudential standards as opposed to other forms of regulation to mitigate the identified risks.'' I am confident that members of both parties in the House and the Senate share the common goal of avoiding future financial crises--our debates since the enactment of Dodd Frank have been around how best to achieve this overarching goal. That's why I believe that if we were considering language today calling on all financial regulators, both state and Federal, to meet on an ongoing basis, to compare notes and make recommendations on steps that each agency could take to achieve this goal, it would pass by unanimous consent.  Asset managers, insurers, and other financial intermediaries serve a critical role in helping our constituents manage the financial risks they will face throughout their lives and meet their financial needs and objectives. Managing assets, whether personal or as part of a retirement plan such as a 401(k), has increasingly become the responsibility of individuals who are well served by asset managers and the products they provide. And managing longevity and mortality risks are just two areas of expertise that insurers are uniquely situated to help. I think we would agree these essential products and services should be well regulated, but in an efficient manner that allows providers the room to innovate and serve their customers' needs  New subsection K of this bill is a charge for regulators to act, on an ongoing basis, to take the steps necessary to help companies operate in a safe and sound manner as the first line of defense against future economic stress. In other words, this bill encourages regulators to determine what activities are potentially risky, using, among other tools, the process set forth in section 120 of the Dodd Frank Act, and calls on the appropriate prudential regulator to ensure they appropriately address such activities on an ongoing basis. This approach makes eminent sense, can help prevent a future crisis, and I am pleased to support this provision and the entire legislation.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Mitchell).

932,topic-id,1382,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the combined rule for H.4296, my bill that addresses difficulties with operational risk capital requirements imposed on financial institutions, and H.4607, the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Both of these bills are commonsense reforms to regulation that will improve the efficiency of our financial system. My legislation, H.4296, will replace misguided capital standards imposed by the international standard setters, the Basel  The Basel Committee requires U.institutions to hold excessive capital based on a ``look back'' approach of an organization's risks, previous earnings, and other provisions that provide no indication of future risks. The methodology employed by this international body has forced our banks to hold hundreds of billions of dollars in reserve rather than putting the money to work in the form of loans and investments. That is money that could be used to fund mortgage loans, car loans, and other day-to-day financing for American consumers.  I recognize the importance of our Nation's financial institutions to hold capital in the event of a future crisis or distress, and H.4296 maintains those capital requirements. As a former regulator, I can tell you that it is important to have adequate capital to regard against loss. But there is a sweet spot that needs to be attained, and regulators can do that if you have proper regulation in place.  What this bill does is amend the method by which the reserve capital is calculated by focusing standards based on an organization's current business activities. This approach offers a better assessment of the amount of capital that should be held to withstand any future crisis.  The methods-based approach proposed in H.4296 properly calibrates operational capital requirements. It maintains strong and healthy financial institutions, while unshackling billions of dollars for lending purposes.  The second bill we are discussing here today provides another opportunity to advance a more practical approach to regulation. H.4607, the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act, sponsored by Mr.Loudermilk from Georgia, offers a holistic approach to U.prudential financial regulation.  This bill requires all Federal financial agencies, including the CFPB and National Credit Union Association, to participate in the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act's, or EGRPRA, comprehensive review of rules and regulations. The purpose of the review is to ensure that regulation is not overly burdensome, duplicative, or outdated, while maintaining standards to promote safety and soundness.  Additionally, H.4607 requires the agencies to meet every 7 years for a comprehensive regulatory evaluation, as opposed to the current 10-year cycle in statute.  I am hard pressed to think of a less controversial bill than this one. Requiring regulators to review the impact of their actions on a more frequent basis is a simple and straightforward way to improve efficiency.  H.4296 and H.4607 have garnered bipartisan support, Mr.Speaker, because they are practical solutions that will properly guide supervisors to enforce more effective regulation. The result of these modest bills will be the promotion of a vibrant and open economy that works for the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this rule and the underlying bills.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close.  Mr.Speaker, I want to repeat what I said at the outset. The rule we are considering would make in order two Financial Services bills that I think amount to ``nothing burgers,'' especially when compared to what we should be doing in terms of protecting our communities and protecting our kids from gun violence. That should take priority over this.  We have young people from Florida here, going door to door, talking to Members of Congress and Members of the Senate, begging us to do something. And what are we going to consider is the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act, and then we are going to consider the operational risk capital requirements for banking organizations.  I did a couple of townhall meetings over the weekend, and I can tell my colleagues truthfully that nobody in the audience asked a question about the operational risk capital requirements for banking organizations. Nor did they bring up the need for us to rush ahead and pass the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act, but they did ask what we are doing to protect their kids and to protect our schools.  We are living in a time when parents have to wonder when they send their kids to school in the morning whether they will come back alive. We are living in a time when going to the movie theater is a risk, when going to a concert is a risk, or when going to church is a risk. This is unacceptable, and people have had it.  I would say to my colleagues who are beholden to the National Rifle Association: I get it. If you don't want to stand up to them, that is fine, but don't stand in the way of this House having a debate on these issues and having a vote. Let the American people see where everybody stands, Democrats and Republicans alike.  It is unbelievable to me, in the aftermath of this tragedy, that we are here talking about the operational risk capital requirements for banking organizations, when we should be talking about strengthening our background checks and expanding our background checks; when we should be talking about banning bump stocks; when we should be talking about dealing with high-capacity magazines; and when we should be talking about banning assault weapons.  People don't have to vote for those things if they don't want to, but I think that is what the American people want. You see it in the polling data. I am hearing it when I go home and I talk in townhalls.  People are just frustrated that we are doing nothing. We hold moments of silence, and that is about it. I think some in the NRA are hoping that this is kind of business as usual. That we will have this terrible tragedy, then, as time goes on, people will focus less and less on it, the media will focus less and less on it, and then we will just kind of move on.  I remember, in the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, there was talk about banning bump stocks. The President said he thought that was a good idea. Even the NRA did. Time went on, the focus went off of what happened in[[Page H1285]]Las Vegas, and we did nothing. Maybe that is what some of my colleagues are hoping for, is that time will pass and we will do nothing. But it is such an abrogation of our duty and our responsibility, and I just don't get it. I don't get it.  This is another closed rule that makes a mockery of regular order. But what is even more disturbing to me is that we are prioritizing banking issues over protecting our kids and our families, and I just find that unconscionable.  I think the anger in this country is just growing more and more and more. I have great hope that these young voices, not just those from Parkland, Florida, but high school students all across this country, who want a future where they don't have to worry about going to school, their voices are getting louder and louder and louder, and they are not going to cave and they are going to demand change. It is their future, and they want us to give them a future where they feel safer and more protected.  Mr.Speaker, I ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that we can bring up some commonsense gun safety legislation. Again, if you don't want to vote for it, you can vote ``no,'' but we have to have the debate.  I think that is what is particularly insulting to so many people across this country who are frustrated with this House when it comes to gun safety legislation, is that we don't even have the guts to have a debate. We don't even bring it up. It is not a priority. I think we have an opportunity now, if we defeat the previous question, to make it a priority.  Mr.Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.

982,topic-id,588,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for his great leadership and for helping us with this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.4296, legislation that would set reasonable parameters for Federal financial regulators when establishing operational risk capital requirements so that banks can best leverage their capital to grow their local economies.  In the wake of the financial crisis, operational risk capital requirements were first agreed to at the Basel That is a foreign group of folks who get together. We have accepted some of their advice, unfortunately, and then it was implemented in the United States by the FDIC, the OCC, and the Federal  Like many concepts fashioned at the Basel Committee, the original intent may have seemed to be a good idea, but the implementation has brought about confusion and unintended consequences.  The committee, realizing it didn't get it right, has revised its recommended operational risk standards on more than one occasion in the last few years. The first was in the fall of 2014, when the committee found that its original standards were under-calibrated. The second came in 2016, when the Basel Committee suggested a requirement that would force banks to look back and hold capital against discounted activities and products. This is not an appropriate way to determine capital requirements.  So what does this mean?  It means that today a bank that exited a particular line of business must still hold the same amount of capital as another bank that is still engaged in that business. It also means that a bank that spends money to improve risk management will be saddled with the same capital standards as a bank that has done nothing to improve its risk management.  My legislation would instill confidence by instituting clear guardrails for operational risk capital requirements. This is particularly important considering that the European regulators have moved the goalposts on U.regulators and financial institutions several times.  H.4296 will also ensure that the imposition of forward-looking capital requirements focus on the bank's current activities and businesses.  Equally important, this bill would incentivize institutions to mitigate operational risk, creating safer banks and a safer financial system.  To be clear, this legislation does not prevent Federal financial regulators from instituting operational risk capital requirements. It does not eliminate the authority of a regulator to assess operational risk, nor does it prevent regulators from requiring that capital be held against riskier activities or businesses.  In other words, it would allow the regulators to continue their business of regulating, but putting some common sense in the regulation and allowing the flexibility to be able to use a forward-looking way of assessing risk rather than being forced to do a look-back-type of risk analysis.  This bill puts forth a thoughtful framework that sets parameters while allowing regulators the flexibility needed to ensure that capital standards are appropriately tailored.  Given my background as both a banker and a regulator, I am often one of the loudest voices in favor of strong capital standards. At the same time, those standards need to make sense, Mr.They need to reflect the actual risk posed by the institution to the financial system.  These standards have a tremendous impact on a bank's capital levels, and it is important that the regulators get them right so that they don't hamstring the bank's ability to meet the credit needs of its local economy and community.  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting in favor of this commonsense bipartisan legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I again thank the chairman for his support.

North Korea is a serious and ever-worsening threat to its people, to our allies and partners in the region, and to the United States, but the responsible course of action is to use all tools of American statecraft to reduce those threats.  We have an obligation to American families, servicemembers, and our allies to say, unequivocally, that we did everything in our power to curb North Korea's dangerous behavior without resorting to armed conflict.

North Korean military officers reportedly continued to assist and empower Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapons program in Syria, and the Kim regime's thugs made no efforts to scale back rampant human rights abuses.  Many smiled as the North Korean regime won a gold medal in propaganda at the All the while, it got ever closer to its ultimate goal of perfecting a nuclear weapon that could reach the United States of We missed an opportunity to engage in talks with North Korea, and we did that at our own peril.  While we must continue to ratchet up pressure on North Korea, other elements of President Trump's approach threaten to make an already bad situation even worse.  First, we are all too familiar with the President's reckless rhetoric. Promising ``fire and fury'' does not minimize tensions. Threatening to ``totally destroy'' North Korea only increases the[[Page S1308]]chance of deadly miscalculation. Boasting about the size of a nuclear button only makes the United States less safe. How does Donald Trump think Kim Jong Un would react if he believed his rule were under immediate threat? Would Kim restrain himself?  Second, contradictory statements from the Trump administration cause confusion that dampens the prospect of a peaceful solution. Is the Trump administration open to talks with North Korea? We certainly should be. If we are, what are the preconditions, and should we even have any? We hear different thoughts on different days. President Trump routinely undercuts his Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, and with it, our diplomatic high ground. Confusing our allies in South Korea and Japan, whose assistance in helping resolve the North Korean crisis is indispensable, only serves to embolden Kim Jong Un, who seeks to drive a wedge between the United States and our allies. We saw this during the Olympics, and we cannot allow that effort to ever take hold.  Third, the Trump administration's recently released budget request for fiscal year 2019 would drastically cut State Department funding. Yet there is no explanation as to why the President believes that it is prudent to cut diplomatic resources, especially in the middle of a crisis. The State Department is already alarmingly understaffed to handle the significant and increasingly more potent threats from North  Just this week, we found out that the Special Representative for North Korea Policy, Ambassador Joseph Yun--the lead American negotiator with North Korea--is stepping down tomorrow. He is one of the key players in any strategy with But wait--there is more. We still don't have a U.Ambassador to South Korea more than a year into the Trump administration. We still don't have a confirmed Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific We still don't have a special envoy for North Korean human rights issues. We still don't have a sanctions coordinator. It seems the only thing this administration has to show for its concern about North Korea is Donald Trump's Twitter account.  I sent a letter to Secretary Tillerson asking him to explain how the State Department is sufficiently staffed to execute a wide-ranging strategy of diplomatic engagement and pressure, but as I wait for his response, the talk of conflict persists and the drum beat of war grows louder.  Sadly, we have heard this before. In less than 3 weeks, we will mark the 15th anniversary of the U.invasion of To be clear, the current situation we face with North Korea is not the same as the one we faced in the runup to the Iraq war in 2003, but, as Mark Twain once said, while history does not repeat itself, it does tend to rhyme. We should recognize the similarities and learn the appropriate lessons regarding the use of military force.  Unlike Iraq, North Korea has nearly completed development of long-range missiles, which will be capable of creating nuclear mushroom clouds in our cities. We all agree that we need to act to ensure that this never happens, but nowhere is there a convincing argument for military strikes. There might be a military option for the North Korean nuclear threat, but there is no military solution.  According to July 2017 polls, 76 percent of Americans are worried that the United States will become engaged in a major war in the next 4 years, and 86 percent of Americans believe the military should only be used as a last resort. We should listen to the American people.  Congress must demand that the Trump administration exhaust all diplomatic and economic options in North Korea short of war. I am not the only one who thinks another Korean war would be horrific. Warnings about the consequences of conflict are coming from all corners, including from the senior-most national security and defense officials.  Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said that conflict on the North Korean Peninsula would be ``catastrophic.''  Former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry said that a U.strike ``could turn into a disastrous military operation'' and that ``a war in the Korean Peninsula that extends to Japan and that goes nuclear would be 10 times worse than the first Korean War.''  Victor Cha, who was to be nominated as U.Ambassador to South Korea before being removed from contention, stated that ``the answer is not, as some Trump administration officials have suggested, a preventive military strike.''  Reports suggest that John Bolton, whom President Trump may be considering to replace H.McMaster as National Security Advisor, apparently ``supports preventive war through a massive strike, if sanctions fail.'' He said that the United States would have to ``simultaneously destroy all known North Korean ballistic missile sites, submarine bases, and artillery, mortar, and missile installments along the North's border with South Korea.''  That doesn't include the sites we don't know about. In October, the Department of Defense stated that the ``only way to locate and destroy with complete certainty all components of North Korea's nuclear weapons program is through a ground invasion.''  Reports from a war game last week indicated that approximately 10,000 Americans could be wounded in combat in just the first few days of a new Korean war. Apparently GEN Mark Milley, the Chief of Staff of the U.Army, stated that the ``brutality'' of conflict on the Korean Peninsula would ``be beyond the experience of any living soldier.''  Even before these comments, 74 percent of Americans were concerned about a ``full-scale war with North Korea.''  So we must ask some fundamental questions. On what criteria will the administration judge that all nonmilitary options have been exhausted? Who will be the arbiter of that decision? Will the administration fulfill its constitutional obligation and come to Congress to ask for support? How will the Members of Congress respond to such a request?  It is because of these questions that I am here today. It is why I introduced the No Unconstitutional Strike Against North Korea This bill would prevent the Department of Defense and other Federal agencies from spending any money to carry out an attack, conventional or nuclear, on North Korea without congressional approval, because we must only use the U.military--the most powerful fighting force in the world--if it is absolutely necessary.  At the same time, I recognize that we must do more to stem the North Korea threat. That includes addressing actions by China, the primary enabler of three successful generations of North Korean dictators. We should seek China's partnership in this process, but we must not fear offending the Chinese Communist Party, nor fear China's reaction.  In the interest of our security and the interests of a peaceful resolution, we must, 1, cut off the flow of crude oil from China to North Korea--if we do not do this, then we are not going as far as we need to on a package of sanctions; 2, give the Kim regime a warning that we expect them to stop selling the slave labor of its people and, in fact, receiving the revenues from that slave labor in order to prop up their regime and to fund a ballistic missile and nuclear program; 3, eliminate North Korea's illicit drug trade; 4, halt the procurement of key rocket fuel chemicals; and 5, restrict its use of the internet to evade sanctions through theft of cryptocurrencies and the committing of other cyber crimes.  We must continue the pressure on North Korea, but it must be combined with simultaneous and direct engagement with North We have yet to use all of the sanctions that should be imposed upon the North Korean regime. We have a responsibility to ensure that we exhaust all sanctions, and that includes doing everything we can to shut down the flow of crude oil into North Korea, which props up the regime, props up the ballistic missile program, and props up their nuclear weapons program.  Talks with North Korea about these issues are not synonymous with concessions. Talks backed by targeted pressure and stronger alliances are the path pursued by countries that are strong, confident, and wise, while the drumbeat of war, on the other hand, is the sound of fear and insecurity.  We are talking today about sanctions on imported steel and aluminum that come into the United States of America, but we are looking at that as a[[Page S1309]]trade issue. If we want to do something about trade that truly endangers our country, we should be looking at the trade between North Korea and We should be looking at the crude oil that continues to flow into North We should not be talking about a military option until we have exhausted our diplomatic and our economic opportunities to bring North Korea to the table.  Without China's agreement on this, we will reach a debate on this floor talking about war with North Korea, but it will not be a debate that took place with the United States--the Trump administration--having exhausted all of the opportunities that a cutoff of crude oil would have and could have presented to bring North Korea to the table. It worked in 2006, it worked in 1994, and I expect, for the sake of the American people, that the President will try to make that work right now. He has not done that yet. This administration has not done that yet.  It is wrong to be hearing this talk about military possibilities and military options before we have exhausted the cutoff of oil, of slave labor, of drugs, of cryptocurrency. We have to do that first. We owe that to history so we are not judged to have rushed irrationally into a war with North Korea that could quickly spiral out of control.  Let's return to a United States of statecraft, allowing our diplomats to advance our interests using our economic tools, our economic strength, as a way of ensuring that we avoid a frivolous loss of life in our country and other countries because we did not pursue a course that would work.

1397,topic-id,1861,"Mr.President, I would like to speak on behalf of my constituents and the tens of millions of Americans who rely on a free and open internet.  Make no mistake, we are locked in a historic battle to preserve the core principles of competition, innovation, and consumer choice that have made the internet the world's greatest platform for commerce and communications; a historic battle to restore the hallmark of American innovation and democratization; a historic battle to protect America's innovation incubator and job generator--a battle for net neutrality.  In December, the Trump FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, eliminated net neutrality. These rules prevented your internet service provider--Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, and Charter--from indiscriminately charging more for internet fast lanes or slowing down or even blocking certain websites entirely, the very rules that allow inventors, entrepreneurs, and small businesses, the lifeblood of the American economy, to connect to the internet.  The reason why is simple. The Trump administration sides with the rich and the powerful first and consistently puts everyday American lives last. We have seen them wage an all-out assault on healthcare, on climate change, and now on net neutrality, but today the internet is fighting back, and we have a powerful tool at our disposal that will allow the average consumer to have their voices heard right here on the floor of the U. Today I am officially introducing a CRA--Congressional Review Act--resolution that will fully restore net neutrality. The entire Senate Democratic caucus is now standing with the millions of Americans who want to reverse the FCC's partisan actions and restore net neutrality.  Net neutrality is not and should not be a partisan issue. I thank Senator Susan Collins for supporting my CRA, and I encourage other Republican colleagues to stand with all of us who support net neutrality. We are just one vote away in the Senate from restoring net neutrality. There will be a vote right here on the floor of the Senate sometime this spring. The clock is ticking. We just need a simple majority for passage, and that is just one more vote.  When we take that vote, every one of my colleagues will have to answer the simple question: Whose side are you on? Do you stand with hard-working American families for whom the internet is essential or do you stand with the Big Money corporate interests and their army of lobbyists? We should all be on the right side of history.  Millennials are motivated. Momentum is building. Citizens are joining together demonstrating, writing letters, calling their Members of Congress, and taking this message to social media. They are joined by groups that include Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, Free Press, the Center for Digital Technology, the Center for Media Justice, Color of Change, Common Cause, Consumers Union, Engine, the National Hispanic Media Coalition, the Open Technology Institute, Public Knowledge, and many others out across the country that are organizing right now as part of an effort that is going to bring millions of voices into the offices of every Senator and every House Member in our country.  This fight is not limited to the Halls of We are seeing a historic groundswell of activity at the State and local level. The Governors in Hawaii, New Jersey, Vermont, Montana, and New York have issued executive orders promoting net neutrality.  State legislatures in more than half of the United States are currently considering net neutrality legislation. Just today, 76 mayors across the Nation signed a letter opposing net neutrality repeal, and 23 State attorneys general have filed suit to reinstate the rule, and we plan to stand by them throughout this entire battle, in the court and out here on the floor of  We cannot let net neutrality be another example of Congress disregarding public opinion and putting donor interests first. Net neutrality is our 21st century right, and we will fight to protect it. In fact, 83 percent of all Americans in polling say they want to protect net neutrality. By the way, that is pretty much every millennial, because for millennials, the internet is like oxygen. I will say that if you are 35 years old or younger, the poll is at pretty close to 100 percent.  I can see all the pages nodding their heads as I am speaking. They know no life without a device that they are carrying around. This is the world in which we are living, and they do not want to have any discrimination introduce itself into the relationship they[[Page S1232]]have between the internet and their ability to control their own lives. That is what the battle is all about, those nodding heads of the pages in the well of the Those are the people who are going to be making a difference, the millennials, the generation Z young people who want this to be open for entrepreneurial activity and for democracy.                              Gun Violence  Mr.President, I also want to speak for a few moments about the epidemic of gun violence in our country. Almost 2 weeks ago, a 19-year-old armed with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle entered Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, and killed 14 students and 3 teachers, and 14 others were injured. Time and again, we have seen this tragedy play out and time and again we are seeing Congress fail to act.  Each year we lose 33,000 American lives due to gun violence. In instances of disease, illness, natural disaster, this level of widespread death would be met with immediate and meaningful action by Yet we continually abdicate our moral responsibility when it comes to gun violence prevention. We don't have to accept this epidemic of gun violence in our country. It is not preordained. It is preventable.  So what should Congress do?  First, we should allow public health researchers to study the causes of gun violence so they can find solutions to this public health crisis. Right now, zero dollars are spent at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on gun violence prevention research. That is because since 1996, an appropriations rider has prohibited the Centers for Disease Control from advocating or promoting gun control.  Just last week, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said he would not let the rider impede the CDC's research into the causes of gun violence. So there is no reason now not to fully fund this critical research agenda.  I have introduced legislation to fund research into the causes and prevention of gun violence. My bill now has 32 cosponsors in the I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to cosponsor this commonsense bill. It is long past time that we treat gun violence like the public health emergency it is, but we must also keep guns out of the hands of those who should not have them.  Currently, anyone can use a handgun in America--whether it is the gun's owner, a thief, or, tragically, a young child, but it doesn't have to be this way. Technology exists now that can authorize handgun use only by its owner. In the 21st century, we have to use advances in technology to our advantage, and we can save lives by using it.  That is why I used the opportunity to introduce smart gun legislation that will require all handguns manufactured in the United States to be personalized for operation only by the authorized user. That means, unless you are authorized by fingerprint or other technology, you will not be able to fire that handgun. If we can do it for an iPhone, we should be able to do it for a handgun so that if a child gets ahold of a gun, if it is not their thumb, they cannot fire it. If someone steals a gun from a home, it will not work because it will not be their thumb that is on the barrel of that gun. That is ultimately a way to reduce dramatically the amount of harm we see in our country.  We must also ban these military-style assault weapons like the AR-15, which are the guns of choice for those who seek to inflict mass casualties on civilians. These are weapons that belong in combat, not in our communities.  We must also pass legislation to ensure that all gun purchases include a background check. In fact, 97 percent of all Americans now support expanded background checks--97 percent of all No one should be able to purchase a gun through Facebook or Instagram without a background check. Instagram should not mean ``Instagun,'' with no background check. That is crazy. That is crazy. You can go on Instagram and buy a gun without a background check. That is crazy in America in 2018.  We have the capacity to quickly do background checks to be able to find out whether somebody should be able to purchase a gun. It is crazy not to have that kind of a system put in place.  If you can buy a gun on Instagram, we should be able to check online whether or not that person, in fact, should be allowed legally to purchase the gun.  Let's close the gun show loophole, as well as the one that allows someone on the terrorist watch list to purchase a weapon. Let's close the loophole that allows domestic abusers to buy guns. Let's close the loophole that allows straw purchasers to buy guns and flood our streets with them. Let's ban bump stocks. Let's repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA, and take away the gun manufacturers' immunity from civil liability. These are sensible steps.  What is not sensible is hoping that thoughts and prayers will prevent the next shooting. This generation of young people recognize this truth, and that is why they are leading this children's crusade. They are picking up microphones and raising their voices. They are saying enough is enough. It is my hope that this might just be the movement that pushes Republican leaders, once and for all, to take action on gun violence and make the NRA stand for ``not relevant anymore'' in American politics. This is the time for that to take place on the Senate floor.  This generation of young people is rising up, and they are demanding that we protect this country from the scourge of gun violence. Like generations past, this one is making the change they want to see in our society.  So, to them, let me say: I hear you. I am with you, and I will fight with you to ensure that not one more student has to endure what you did, not one more person has to be damaged because we did not put the laws on the books that should have been there to prevent this harm from occurring. I will fight with you to ensure that this does not happen in one more school in our country.  That is our challenge. That is the goal we should set. That is what should be the agenda here on the floor of the Senate in 2018.  I yield the floor.

279,topic-id,285,"Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight my alma mater, Kansas State University, and the Kansas Wheat Innovation Center, which I had the honor and the pleasure of touring over this Easter work period. This[[Page H3066]]center works to strengthen the productivity of farmers both in Kansas and around the world.  The Wheat Innovation Center is the result of a public-private partnership. It was built in 2011 by the Kansas Wheat Commission, a grower-funded organization that promotes Kansas wheat through increased international trade and research.  The innovation center now encompasses 15,000 square feet of advanced plant breeding space and 20,000 square feet of greenhouse space dedicated to advancing wheat genetics.  In addition to the innovative center, Kansas State is also home to four Feed the Future labs, the most of any university in the country.  Feed the Future labs are funded by USAID and are focused on supporting research and land-grant universities to grow the agricultural production of target countries. Much of that research is tasked with improving the resilience and adaption of crops in arid climates, a climate not unlike that of  As the global population rises to 8 billion people by 2030, the technology developed by partnerships like the one in the Kansas Wheat Innovation Center will only become more essential. We must continue to be proactive in the fight to end global hunger by pooling resources to strengthen agriculture for developing countries abroad and our own Kansas farmers at home.  The collaboration and leadership shown by Kansas Wheat, Kansas State University, and the Feed the Future innovation labs is a blueprint for finding solutions to feeding our growing world and improving the global food system.

280,topic-id,261,"Madam Speaker, rural America is poised to reignite into an economic powerhouse, but its low population density and wide-open spaces have proven difficult for some businesses to operate, given its often outdated infrastructure.  Without Federal incentives to help bridge the financial gap, many rural American businesses struggle to access the same services as their urban counterparts at comparable prices.  This Congress recently made a more than $21 billion downpayment to improving our country's aging infrastructure.  While back in Kansas, I had the opportunity to sit down with a number of industry and community leaders from across the State to discuss how these investments will benefit our schools, businesses, and farmers.  From broadband deployment to highway and railway maintenance, community leaders could not stress enough the importance that this funding will have for economic development. Improving our infrastructure, highways, and railways will allow easier movement of Kansas agriculture and aeronautical products to ports for export.  With broadband expansion, our rural students will have the resources they need to compete with students across the country when they apply to the college of their choice. It will allow farmers and ranchers to better monitor equipment and utilize new technologies for precision agriculture and provide businesses access to new markets for their products.  All in all, I cannot stress enough how encouraged my constituents are because of our latest promise to invest in our country and our infrastructure initiatives. This funding will truly help rural America thrive, and I look forward to continued discussions on this here in D.C., as well as back home.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-04-10-pt1-PgH3065-5.txt,2328,CONGRESS MUST CONTINUE TO WORK TO PROTECT DREAMERS,2018.0,10.0,April
606,topic-id,412,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to progress on a critical nationwide initiative: American energy independence. Energy is a bedrock industry of the American economic machine. Energy fosters innovation and has seen substantial leaps in efficiency, which have led to a dramatic expansion in scale.  To highlight the important progress our oil and gas producers have achieved, we need to look no further than my home State of Kansas, even just to think back to my childhood being raised up in Butler County, Kansas, which, during World War I, was the world's largest producer of oil.  Kansas has long been known for our production in agriculture and aviation. It is the spirit of innovation that has pushed Kansans to utilize their vast and diverse energy opportunities. The Wheat State is, in fact, a top-10 State for crude oil production and has the Hugoton gas area, one of the top-producing natural gas fields in the United  These factors give Kansas the opportunity to be a leader in the national effort to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil. In fact, American energy exports now compete with Middle East oil for buyers in Daily trading volumes of U.oil futures contracts have more than doubled in the past decade.  I was reminded of the size of the export opportunity this past week when I was in Mexico City in NAFTA discussions. With improved delivery systems and more efficient extraction methods, the United States is now exporting more than 1.7 million barrels of crude oil each day, with an increase of 11 percent expected by 2019. The economic impacts of increased United States output are encouraging to everyone in the industry who has fought through tough times with low crude oil prices.  This expansion has shaved our Nation's oil imports by 20 percent over the past decade and provided 21st century careers in rural communities. Since the 2008 peak, we have lowered consumer prices for domestic gasoline by 37 percent.  Just a few short years ago, no one would have imagined the United States could have increased production of oil and natural gas while still cutting greenhouse gas emissions, which are now near 25-year lows, yet we have. These advancements are evidence of the ingenuity of our producers. Further, they show that we have balanced energy production and environmental stewardship.  For the first time in generations, American energy policy is focusing on domestic production, global leadership, and economic opportunity. And that is something worth recognizing.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-05-pt1-PgH1345-4.txt,2328,TUSKEGEE AIRMAN POST OFFICE BUILDING,2018.0,5.0,February
659,topic-id,375,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to address the issue of global hunger. Tonight, this very evening, 800 million people across the world will go to bed hungry. Throughout 2017, this very past year, this number has only grown, making this the first year in a decade that global hunger has increased.  This increase arises from violent conflicts and natural disasters that have worsened the situation for many living in extreme poverty. These crises demonstrate the need for lifesaving United States humanitarian relief around the world.  For 63 years, our Nation's signature food donation program, Food for Peace, has fed more than 3 billion hungry people. This program has benefitted people facing some of the worst humanitarian disasters of the century, averting famine, and providing medical care for those who need it most.  Today, USAID remains committed to providing for people in dire situations with emergency help. In countries like Yemen and Nigeria, where more than 70 percent of the population is facing severe starvation, USAID continues to step in to prevent famine and fight disease.  The USAID mission is to provide emergency food assistance, is vital to many countries around the world, and is a key pillar of President Trump's National Security Its purpose is to end the need for its own existence by responding to the disasters and helping our partners achieve self-reliance.  A world without hunger is in America's very best interest. Hunger breeds instability and conflict. These programs represent a small investment to prevent future conflicts.  I am proud that wheat is the most used commodity in U.hunger programs. Kansas is known as the breadbasket of the world and is the Nation's leading wheat producer. But today, while our growers have full grain elevators in my State, we still have four ongoing declared famines around the world. There is no reason that we cannot connect the starving with our ample supplies of food.  I look forward to working with the House Agriculture Committee as we reauthorize the Food for Peace and other critical antihunger programs in the 2018 farm bill so that USAID and the United States Department of Agriculture can continue to help provide for the hungry and strengthen our national security across the world.

That is because the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have started a movement to turn ``once again'' into ``never again.''  Unfortunately, too many of my colleagues act as if mass shootings are inevitable, when, in reality, they are preventable. The American people are sick and tired of it. That is why they have been so inspired by these students from  I saw it with my own eyes last A few of these Marjory Stoneman Douglas survivors came to visit New Jersey, and my constituents came out in droves to support them. Together with the Jewish Federation of Greater MetroWest and Moms Demand Action, we rallied well over 2,000 people in support of their ``Never Again'' movement.  What is remarkably refreshing about these students is, they are not yet jaded by the ways of They have spent their lives practicing active shooter drills. They have grown up being told that mass shootings are just a fact of life, but they know they deserve better.  After being thrust into a tragedy, they have turned their mourning into a movement. By speaking out, the students of Parkland have pricked the conscience of this country, and the American people are answering their call to action.  We see it at rallies across the country calling for tougher, smarter, commonsense gun safety laws. We see it in students across America organizing the March for Our Lives, and we see it in corporate  Companies such as United Airlines have already parted ways with the Retailers such as Dick's Sporting Goods have announced they will take AR-15s off their shelves and stop selling guns to teenagers.  As Americans take action, the question is whether Congress will do the same. Far too many of my colleagues still fear a backlash from the That is why, after Las Vegas, they refused to ban the bump stocks that make mass shootings more deadly. That is why, after Sandy Hook, they refused to pass tougher background checks. That is why, after Orlando, they refused to even consider my own bill to ban the sale of high-capacity magazines. High-capacity magazines are designed for one thing and one thing only--high-capacity killing. They are the grim hallmark of mass shootings in America, linking Parkland to Newtown, and Las Vegas to San Bernardino, and Aurora to  Certainly, I have been encouraged to hear some of my colleagues say they may consider supporting limits on magazine sizes now. I have a legislation here I introduced months ago to do just that. The Keep America Safe Act is narrowly focused. It doesn't infringe on anyone's right to bear arms. I challenge all of my colleagues to sign on. However, in my view, we must do more than ban high-capacity magazines.  I, for one, voted for the assault weapons ban of 1994, when I was in the House of Representatives, and I am a cosponsor of the bill to reinstate it today. These weapons have no place in civilian society. They are not designed for self-defense. They are modeled after weapons our soldiers use on the battlefield, but if we are going to get anywhere, we must stop letting the NRA set the agenda in  It is amazing to me that some of my colleagues are effectively holding gun safety legislation hostage until they can pass their NRA-backed concealed carry bill.  I spent a lot of time hearing from my colleagues, particularly on the other side of the aisle, talk about State rights--State rights. Well, apparently, New Jersey's right to enforce our own gun laws doesn't count when it comes to State rights.  Our State has some of the toughest gun laws in the country, and it is no coincidence that we have the sixth lowest rate of gun deaths in the We want to keep it that way, but this bill, hot off the NRA's wish list, would let concealed carry permit holders from States with looser standards bring their weapons to New  At the end of the day, the NRA has 5 or 6 million members. We are a nation of 320-plus million people. While millions of responsible gun owners believe in the Second Amendment, poll after poll tells us they also believe in universal background checks and commonsense gun laws.  It is time we call out those who spout the same old NRA talking points, such as ``Guns don't kill people, people kill people.'' Well, that is why we don't run background checks on guns; we run them on people.  The NRA would have us believe that all we need to do is to have comprehensive background checks, when in reality what we need are universal background checks. This means requiring background checks for all private sales, transfers, and online sales on the internet. Why should you be able to buy, with a click of the mouse, a significant weapon without ever going through a background check?  Likewise, they say it is time for teachers to be armed and our schools to be ``hardened.'' Well, I haven't met many teachers who want to be charged with assessing threats and taking lives in front of their own students. Let's be serious. Arming teachers wouldn't stop the next Las Only we can do that by passing sensible and reasonable gun safety measures that limit the sale of deadly weapons and keeping guns out of the wrong hands.  After running for their lives on February 14, the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas will march for their lives on March 24. It is inspiring to see that despite all the dysfunction in Washington, young Americans still believe in their power to make change.  How tragic would it be if we in Congress proved them wrong and, once again, let business as usual in Washington prevent us from taking action to save lives? For my part, that is not going to happen.

693,topic-id,448,"Mr.President, we heard a whole lot about the tax bill the Republicans passed, and it basically works like this: We borrow $1.5 trillion from our children and we give that money to the richest And then when there is a little bit of help for middle-class workers--and I mean a little--we say: Well, that is really cool.  I like that we are doing a little for the middle class, but I don't like the fact that for every dime to help a middle-class worker, we gave away a dollar to the richest In other words, America has been robbed in the biggest bank heist ever, and then it was justified by distributing a modest amount to our workers. Even then, they included a provision that will drive up the premiums for healthcare by more than 10 percent next year, on top of whatever rises are driven by the drug companies. So whatever modest gain there is for the middle class is wiped out by more expensive healthcare in  So we hear these big, sophisticated arguments: Oh, well, a worker here or there got a bonus. A worker here or there got their wages increased. But they don't tell you that they gave $1 trillion to the richest Why not? Why not be honest about the whole entire scope of this tax rip-off, borrowing from our children to enrich the richest Americans?  As one House Member said, here is what this is all about: This is about the fact that my rich donors won't vote for me and won't support me in the next election unless I vote to give them all this money.  That is what happened here, and it is not OK because we see the consequences. We have a budget that attacks the foundations for families to thrive. It takes a trillion dollars out of healthcare. Well, that trillion dollars went to the richest Then the President gets to the budget and takes a trillion dollars out of healthcare, takes money out of affordable housing. Housing is a very important foundation for families to thrive. So it attacks healthcare and housing, and then it attacks public education.  Quite frankly, because all those resources were taken off the table that could have been invested in infrastructure and jobs in America, it also undermines the concept of a living-wage job, which is the principle that nobody who works full time in America should live in poverty in  The majority has conducted the biggest bank heist in history, and they come to the floor and defend this time and time again without sharing the honest facts with the American people, as I have just shared them with you.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-28-pt1-PgS1262.txt,1900,RACISM AND POVERTY 50 YEARS AFTER THE KERNER,2018.0,28.0,March

1449,topic-id,1911,"Mr.President, let's turn to another attack on workers. Our entire Constitution had a theme, had a mission statement, and that mission statement was ``we the people,'' government of, by, and for the people. My colleagues might be surprised to discover that the Constitution didn't say ``we the privileged; we the wealthy; we the well-connected; we the powerful'' because they bring bill after bill to the floor of the Senate that is exactly government of, by, and for the wealthy and the well-connected.  Now we see that the Supreme Court is getting in on the act in this effort to undermine the ability of workers to organize, to get a fair share of the wealth that they create.  Former President Jimmy Carter once said:       Every advance in this half-century--Social Security, civil      rights, Medicare, aid to education, one after another--came      with the support and leadership of American labor.  Well, he was absolutely right. I would also add a few more things to the list, such as 8-hour workdays, the 40-hour workweek, overtime pay, the minimum wage, family and sick leave, health and safety working standards. When workers have organized, they have fought for better conditions for every American--better pay, better safety, better and fair working conditions--and America is a better nation because of it. It is a much better nation because of the men and women of the labor movement who have fought tirelessly to ensure that our country lives up to that ``we the people'' vision statement. Thanks to their work, an honest day's work means an honest day's pay for millions of But that is exactly what the Supreme Court is poised to undo. All the powerful and the privileged--they want even more squeezed out of the workers, so they have spent decades really demonizing and attacking the ability of workers to organize.  During the three decades after World War II, workers got a fair share of the wealth they were creating. Their wages went up as productivity went up, and it turned out that this is good for business as well because workers who have paychecks are able to buy products, and then the companies can sell more. The companies do well when people get paid fairly, but that concept is about to be undermined in a massive way with an attack on what are called fair share fees.  When workers organize and bargain for better benefits, there is a cost of developing that organization and conducting those negotiations, and every[[Page S1263]]worker who benefits chips in a share under fair share fees. Everyone wins, so everyone contributes.  This is not about contributing to political activity. It is not about contributing funds that are distributed to causes. This is simply the cost of the negotiating process. For this foundation to be able to negotiate successfully, people have to share in that effort.  The heart of the right to organize has been absolutely embodied in law for well over half a century in a case called Abood v. Detroit Board of Collective bargaining among workers doesn't work if you create a strategy for workers to freeload; that is, to get all the benefits without putting in any of the effort.  I am reminded of a story that I read as a very young child just learning to read. It was about the barnyard. It was about some member of the community baking bread and asking for help from all the other animals--would they help with this aspect or that aspect of making the bread. They all said: No, we are not interested in helping. At the end, when the bread was baked, all the animals in the barnyard wanted their share. They wanted a share of it without having contributed a thing.  That system is what the Supreme Court is trying to foist on America, undermining the fundamental right to organize and allowing freeloaders to essentially create a situation where you can't afford to represent the group. Well, that undermines the success of our workers to get a fair share of the wealth they create. It undermines their ability to negotiate for a safer workplace.  Again, this is not about political activity; this is simply about the function of representing a group in negotiations with the owner.  That is the case in Illinois, where Mark Janus works as a specialist for the Department of Healthcare and Family He works under a contract negotiated between the State of Illinois and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, or He is not a member of the union. He is not required to be a member of the union. But Mark Janus says: I want all the benefits that are produced by the union organizing and negotiating on my behalf, but I don't want to have to share any of the costs.  Everyone knows that if people are given a permission slip to not share in the cost of organizing, the ability to organize is undermined. It is a fundamental part of it: You negotiate together; you benefit together. He is challenging that portion of the contract.  The powerful and privileged titans of industry have been waging a decades-long campaign against the workers of They are excited about this. Don't worry, the Koch brothers are in control. Well, we have certainly seen their control here in the This certainly bears on the case right before us. They invested vast sums in 2014, and they supported and pushed campaigns in Arkansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, Iowa, Colorado, and Alaska, and they turned those seats in favor of folks who supported the Koch brothers. They took a majority of this body.  What happened in 2016? Well, there was a vacant Supreme Court seat. We have all taken a pledge to support the We have an advice and consent responsibility. But the majority leader came down here and said: We are not going to do our responsibility of advice and consent on any nominee from President Obama--none. It doesn't matter who the nominee is; we are not going to do this. Why? Because the Koch brothers said: Don't allow a debate or a vote on a nominee from President  The majority leader said that this was justified because it was an election year. Let's look at American history. Fifteen times in an election year, there has been a vacancy on the Supreme All 15 times previous to 2016, the Senate debated and the Senate voted.  There were Members of my colleague's team across the aisle who thought we should honor that responsibility of advice and consent. You can vote somebody down or you can vote somebody up, but we should have the debate and we should have the vote. As soon as they said one word about how there should be a debate or there should be a vote, they got their chain yanked. In one case, the Koch brothers said they would immediately put in millions of dollars against their primary opponent.  That is why the Koch brothers are known as the puppet masters of this body right here in which I stand right now. When they say ``jump,'' the majority says ``how high?'' That certainly came to fruition in 2016 when they refused to exercise their constitutional responsibility to debate and vote on a nominee for the Supreme That was done so that the empty seat would be passed on to the next That is the first time in U.history a Supreme Court seat has been stolen and passed on to the next President--the only time.  Well, what does that result in? That results in a Supreme Court that now has been selected where we know four people stand on one side of the issue and four stand on the other side. Then you have, essentially, an illegitimate process for the ninth Justice--a Justice who by every indication is willing to join the other four in attacking the foundation of the right to organize in our That right to organize was envisioned in the Constitution, in the ``we the people'' Constitution, not ``we the powerful,'' not ``we the privileged,'' not ``we the wealthy,'' and not ``we the well-connected.''  Mr.Janus is being represented and funded by the National Right to Work Let's call it the right to freeload because that is what it is. You don't contribute your share, but you get all the benefits.  It reminds me a little bit of the conversation about citizenship in People talk about the rights of citizenship and their responsibilities of citizenship too. There are responsibilities of being part of a group when you bargain for wages. That means paying your fair share. So it is their share. It is the heart of the ability to organize versus the position orchestrated by the Koch brothers to assault the ability to organize in this country so that workers can get a fair share of the wealth they work to create.  We have seen these right-to-freeload bills pass with the influence of the titans across this country in State after Here is what we know. In those States that protect the constitutional vision of the right to organize, workers earn over $5,000 a year more than in other In the right-to-freeload States, workers earn a lot less. And that is apparently why the owners of the companies love that action so much--because they can squeeze more out of the workers. The right-to-freeload States have higher poverty. They have higher infant mortality. They have higher workplace deaths than other They support public schools less than other  It is a mistake to have a Court assembled through an illegitimate process of stealing a Supreme Court seat proceed to gut the constitutional right to organize and assault the workers of this Nation just to put more zeros on the bank account statements of the millionaires and billionaires and titans and wealthy and powerful  Let's have a remedial course in this Chamber about what our Nation and our Constitution are all about. It is not about coming here and getting elected by the wealthiest Americans to serve the wealthiest Americans; it is about coming here to form laws that serve ``we the people.'' Thomas Jefferson made this point again and again. He said that if you concentrate power in the few, you will get power from the powerful--you will get decisions from the powerful. You will never get the will of the people if you concentrate power. He called on every voter to have an equal voice--not just a vote but an equal voice.  So let's remember Let's remember that our Forefathers put together this document so that we wouldn't have government by the few and the powerful, such as they have in Europe, but this would be different here in the United States of America, where we would try to forge laws that gave all families the opportunity to thrive.  We can see the impact that the reversal of this principle has had. We spent half of last year on a healthcare bill or versions of a healthcare bill designed to rip healthcare from 22 to 30 million Americans, depending on the version. Then we spent the other part of the year on a tax bill designed to borrow[[Page S1264]]$1.5 trillion from our children and deliver the vast amount of the benefits to the wealthiest of That is government for and by the powerful. Let's return to government for and by the people.

Mr.Speaker, the STB Information Security Improvement Act requires the Surface Transportation Board to develop a timeline and plan to implement the recommendations and improvements outlined in its information security system.  After a concerning report from the Department of Transportation inspector general that outlined deficiencies in the STB's information security system, it is imperative that changes be made and there are improvements in that system rapidly.  When the STB separated from DOT, Department of Transportation, in December 2015, the agency gained full responsibility and control of its IT system, and it currently lacks any meaningful or strong cybersecurity system.  The improvements needed include basic building blocks, such as changes to policies and procedures. The STB is encumbered by a number of weaknesses, and its information security program has been determined by the OIG to be at a low level of maturity according to OMB standards.  A summary of the bill is it requires the STB, the Surface Transportation Board, to create a timeline and plan to implement recommendations made by the DOT Office of Inspector General in their report. Additionally, it requires the Surface Transportation Board to annually update Congress on its progress until it has effectively been completed and updated.  This bill ensures that the Surface Transportation Board addresses these deficiencies so the agency can reduce the risk of an attack or compromise to this critical information system.

Mr.Speaker, the FRA Safety Data Improvement Act requires the Federal Railroad Administration to develop a timeline and plan to implement improvements to its safety data collection and reporting system.  Rail safety is critical to our Nation, and in order to ensure that regulations are rooted in accurate data, the FRA must make improvements to its data collection system.  Safety data is important to railroad safety, and failures of that concern us. Effective safety data collection and reporting is critical to ensuring railroad safety.  The Department of Transportation inspector general published a report outlining issues with the data collection and reporting for safety data. The report made a number of recommendations to standardizing certain procedures and implementing effective and uniform training programs. Additionally, the report recommends the FRA update its reporting guidance to clear up discrepancies in their reporting forms.  In summary, the bill requires the FRA, the Federal Railroad Administration, to implement the recommendations from the DOT Office of Inspector General report.

Forty-six percent of those surveyed say tax policy changes will have a positive effect on their business, up from 38 percent in the fourth quarter. The number of those same tax policy changes that have a negative impact fell sharply to 23 percent. Only one in three respondents expect to receive a tax cut. The independent Tax Policy Center estimates that four out of five Americans will actually see a tax cut at the end of the year.  Not quite the Armageddon some of our colleagues predicted.

It also allows those businesses to immediately write off the full cost of new equipment, rather than expense it or amortize it over 7 years, because money out of their pocket now means it is real money out that they can't wait for 7 years to get back to the Tax Code--significant differences allowing businesses in my district and throughout the country to invest in growth.

486,topic-id,421,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for joining me this evening.  Mr.Speaker, I did want to, at this point, wrap up this evening's version of the Tax Truth  Since the tax reform bill was passed and signed into law, let me state again that more than 400 companies have given a pay raise; bonuses; increased 401(k) contributions; or, in the case of utilities, lowered rates--lowered rates dramatically.  At least 4 million Americans are receiving special tax reform bonuses. Direct bonus announcements have already topped $3 billion; $3 billion into our economy, into people's pockets, decisions they can make about what they want to do with the money rather than turning it over to the government, rather than turning it over to the IRS, rather than having it spent on bureaucracy.  In my home district, we will talk about that more next week, but I want to reference that Fiat Chrysler is moving jobs here from Mexico, moving to Macomb County, investing $1 billion--yes, you heard that right, investing $1 billion--in expanding a plant and creating 2,500 new jobs in Michigan just in that one plant.  By the way, they also announced a bonus--a tax bonus separate from their bonus in their contract, which some people said: Oh, it was in their contract.  No, it wasn't. It was a bonus of $2,000 per employee as a result of the tax bill.  These are major cuts that people overlook. Look at these companies, look at the list of them, and it grows every day.  Let me suggest real quickly: I don't know about you, Mr.Speaker, but I know my district and I know my constituents, and $1,000 is not crumbs.  I referenced earlier the note I got over the weekend from Mark in my district who says his projected taxes next year save him $2,700 in his pocket.  Now, I know where you live, I know where I live, that is real money. Maybe for some of my colleagues, it doesn't matter as much, but that is why we passed this bill. That is why we worked so hard on this bill. That is why we support it. And that is the truth about taxes.  That is what we want the American people to understand: we are putting money back in their pockets, money back in the economy, rather than taking money and putting it in government and hoping they do something productive with it.  I thank the Chair for the opportunity this evening.

672,topic-id,1050,"Mr.President, I hope we rise to the moment before us and get something done, over the course of the next week or two, to try to make this country safer. I am glad to be joining the President in a few hours to hear more about his thoughts on how we can put the safety of our kids ahead of any political considerations and try to figure out how to make sure that Parkland is the last.  As I have told some of the kids from Parkland who have come into my office, the ripples of grief will never, ever end. Newtown, CT, is a place that has been fundamentally changed. When you lose that many young lives in a short period of time, there is no true recovery. Unfortunately, Parkland will find that as Charleston did, as Orlando did, and as so many did before them.  We need to remember that while the country tends to pay attention to the epidemic of gun violence when there is a mass shooting, this is an epidemic that doesn't take a day off. Yesterday, it is likely that 80 to 90 people died from gunshot wounds. The majority of those were suicides. That is an epidemic in and of itself. A chunk of those were accidental shootings, another chunk of those were gun homicides; but the rate of gun deaths in this country just has no parallel anywhere else in the world. There is not another First World nation that has the rate of gun violence we do. In fact, it is not even close. The rate of gun violence in our country is 20 times higher than the average in the  We have to remember that when we try to craft a public policy response, it just cannot be about school shootings. One is much more likely to die from an accidental gunshot than in a school shooting. We have to be comprehensive in our approach, which is why the Fix NICS Act just isn't good enough.  I am proud Senator Cornyn and I and many others in this body came together to put forward a piece of legislation that will improve the background check system. It will make sure people who shouldn't buy guns aren't able to buy guns, but it is a modest change. In fact, it is really just about making sure people who are in law enforcement and inside the NICS system comply with existing law. It doesn't actually add any new background checks, it doesn't solve the gun show loophole, and it doesn't solve the internet loophole. So my hope is, we can bring this bill before the Senate, but then we can have a debate on other measures that might enjoy bipartisan support that will do 10 times more than fix NICS to keep this country safe.  Let's talk about expanding background checks to make sure everybody who is buying a gun in a commercial sale has to prove they are not a criminal and prove they are not seriously mentally ill. Let's talk about the experience that Connecticut and Indiana has had in allowing courts to use protective orders to take away guns from people who are showing evidence of doing harm to the people around them. Let's have a conversation about whether we think it is right for people to be able to walk into schools with a gun equipped with a 30-round or 100-round magazine.  I don't know if any of those measures will get 60 votes, but I think we owe it to the American people to not limit debate, to not shut down debate in the U.Senate  I know it is probably a scary thing for some Republicans that votes are changing. Many of my Republican colleagues have acknowledged they might be thinking about supporting things today that they might not have supported before. Because minds are changing, it behooves us to make sure we have a full debate on the floor of the U. I am supportive of the bill that Senator Cornyn and I have worked on. I hope it can become the foundation of a much more comprehensive set of measures that we take a look at in the coming days. I think we have to pay attention to where the American public is on this issue. I understand polls shouldn't dictate all of the decisions we make here. We pay attention to public opinion, we respond to it more often than not, but it doesn't guide every single decision we make because public opinion changes.  On this issue, it has been a slow and steady build, the number of Americans saying the U.Congress bears responsibility for the epidemic of mass slaughter in this country because we have not changed a single gun law, except to make them weaker, since Sandy Remember, the only thing this Congress has done since Sandy Hook is allow hundreds of thousands of seriously mentally ill people to get weapons. That law was passed last year by the President--nothing to restrict guns.  In fact, 97 percent of Americans want us to pass universal background checks. Apple pie isn't as popular as background checks are in this country today. No other public policy we are considering gets a 97-percent approval rating from the American public than universal background checks. Let's listen to that. Let's listen to them.  I encourage Senator McConnell not to limit debate, not to constrain the Let's use this week and next week to have a set of measures we can debate and have up-or-down votes on, and let's hope, in the meantime, the President fleshes out what he is for and against.  The President tweeted that he is in support of comprehensive background checks. Maybe later today we will find out if that is really true. Comprehensive background checks tend to mean the closing of the loopholes that exist, but hopefully the President can help lead us to a conclusion that is something much more than Fix As my colleague from Florida who has lived through the last several mass shootings in his State remarked, Fix NICS is simply not enough to meet this moment.

110,topic-id,798,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today for two reasons. Before discussing the nomination at hand--John Ring for the National Labor Relations Board--I do want to take a couple of minutes to mark Equal Pay  Today, it takes women more than 3 additional months to make what their male colleagues made in 2017. In the 21st century, there is absolutely no excuse for the reality that women are still being paid less than men for the same work. It is wrong, it is harmful, and it has to change.  What is even more unacceptable is that for women of color, the pay gap is even worse. African-American women, working full time, only make 63 cents for every dollar their White male colleagues make, and on average, Latinas earn 54 cents for every dollar their White male colleagues make.  The wage gap doesn't hurt just women; it hurts families and our economy. Women are actually the sole or cobreadwinner in two-thirds of families with children. Families increasingly rely on women's wages to help make ends meet--to buy groceries, pay the bills, or pay for childcare.  In order to help women and all working families get ahead, I am very proud to be a sponsor of the Paycheck Fairness The Paycheck Fairness Act provides transparency and support for women who are being paid less than their male colleagues. It protects women from retaliation for discussing salary information with their coworkers, it allows women to join together in class action lawsuits, and it prohibits employers from seeking salary history, so the cycle of pay discrimination cannot continue.  As President Trump now continues to roll back worker protections and prioritize corporate profits over working families' wages, I think it is time for Congress to act and pass the Paycheck Fairness Act because workers do deserve to be paid fairly, end of story, no matter their gender.  Mr.President, I want to turn to the nomination before the Senate today, the nomination of John Ring for the National Labor Relations  First, I have to object to the unprecedented nature in which we are jamming this nominee through.  It is standard practice that Board nominees are always confirmed in pairs--one Democrat and one We do this to keep the Board as fair and balanced as possible in hopes that workers have a fair hearing when corporations violate their rights or bargain in bad faith, because the Board is the only place to which workers can turn to enforce their rights under the National Labor Relations Workers cannot sue in court. So I must ask, why is this nominee being forced through without also filling the Democratic seat that is about to be vacated, especially at a time when so many other nominees have been waiting significantly longer--some more than 6 months--to be confirmed? I have to believe that it is because special corporate interests are putting immense pressure on my colleagues across the aisle to confirm someone who will advocate for corporations, no matter the cost to workers.  Right now, the Board's credibility is damaged because another Trump-appointed Board member, William Emanuel, chose to cast aside his ethics pledge and commitment to me by participating in Board actions that would directly benefit his former employer. Because of those actions, Mr.Emanuel--the Board's independent watchdog--opened an investigation, and because there was a clear conflict of interest, the Board was forced to vacate the decision that overruled Obama-era worker protections.  With a cloud of ethics controversies surrounding the current Board members, it is clear to me why corporations and special interests are trying to get Mr.Ring confirmed so quickly. Mr.Ring has spent his career as a corporate lawyer representing the interests of companies, not workers. He has opposed the Board's reforms that stop companies from unnecessarily delaying union elections. He has encouraged the Board to undermine long-established rights, including the right for workers to have coworker representation in disciplinary interviews. I find it difficult to believe he will advocate now for workers, as this Board desperately needs to be doing.  This administration has spent more than a year undermining workers' rights and making it easier for corporations to take advantage of them, and the Board, under Republican control, has been leading that charge by ignoring longstanding practices in a rush to overturn precedents that protect workers.  At a time when corporations in this country and the richest among us are getting richer and working families are left behind, it is so critical today that the Board be independent and able to advocate for workers. Now is not the time to break precedent and vote on a nominee without the Democratic pair.  For all these reasons, I will be voting no on this nominee. I urge my colleagues to do the same.

Mr.Pizzella has a record that is time and again at odds with the goals of the very Department he would help to lead as Deputy His track record is one of not merely failing workers but of failing to enforce laws to protect the health and safety of workers, seeking to diminish workers' rights and protections, and undermining the unions that represent and fight for them.  In fact, his record includes working with convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff on behalf of causes that are counter to the mission of the Department of  In the 1990s, Congress was moving to expand labor and immigration protections to the Northern Marianas Islands, a U.Territory, to end the operation of sweatshops that did not follow Federal labor laws. The law at the time let companies bring in foreign workers to toil under inhumane conditions. The workers were underpaid. They were forced to sign contracts signing away their rights to protest labor conditions, and some were even coerced to have abortions.  The companies operating under these inhumane conditions were able to print the words ``Made in the U.S.A.'' on their products.  While Congress was looking to take action to change the law so we could better protect workers, Pizzella was working with Abramoff to coordinate all-expense-paid trips for dozens of Republican lawmakers and staff and seeking to maintain the sweatshop status quo.  Patrick Pizzella chose not to work for workers but for corporations. These efforts are not just counter to the mission of the Department of Labor, they are counter to our national values.  The rest of Mr.Pizzella's record shows that he has taken equally extreme positions throughout his career. Take, for example, his radical record as the sole employee of the Conservative Action Project, a far-right group funded by billionaire donors like the DeVos family, or his record when he last served in the Department of Under his leadership, the Department of Labor cut its budget in part by cutting down its own employees' collective bargaining rights and decreasing official time.  Then there is his long record championing anti-union policies and arguing to limit collective bargaining rights.  At the Federal Labor Relations Authority, Pizzella not only ruled consistently against workers and unions, but he repeatedly broke with longstanding policy by calling out the names of individual workers in his decisions. He chose to call out defendants by name and put them in the public spotlight. The pattern of Mr.Pizzella's anti-worker ideology is clearly unchanged today. Throughout his career, Mr.Pizzella's record has been alarmingly consistent. From his years serving as the right hand to Jack Abramoff until now, he has shown that he is not going to fight for workers. He will fight against them.  It would be irresponsible to put a man with such a strong track record of anti-worker conviction a tweet away from leading the Department of It is unconscionable that someone of Mr.Pizzella's background would be the 2 leader at the Department of It is unacceptable that he could be in line to serve as Acting Secretary should Secretary Acosta leave the  I strongly oppose his nomination.

That is why I am here to tell you that teachers, students, and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School returned to school for the first time since that shooting 2 weeks ago. Some were ready. Some who returned were scared. Some didn't go back; they are going to a different school.  What happened at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School 2 weeks ago should never happen anywhere in this country, ever, ever, never again.  Look at those faces so full of promise. Here is the coach. He saved some of the kids' lives. He jumped in front of them. This is another adult who tried to save lives. Here is another adult who tried to save lives. It shouldn't happen in a school. It shouldn't happen at a nightclub, like It shouldn't happen in an airport or a church or an outdoor concert. It shouldn't happen.  So why does it happen? Why does this keep happening over and over again? Well, I am going to tell you why. It is because of us. It is because all 100 Members of this Senate and all 435 Members down the hallway in the House of Representatives--it is our refusal to act. It is our failure to convince one another that there are some things that should be done regardless of party politics or polls or what the special interests want. They ought to be done simply because they are the right things to do.  What about a commonsense approach, like a background check every time somebody buys a gun? What about a comprehensive or universal background check that would expand if there is a restraining order? How about if there is a mental problem other than just an adjudicated mental order? How about the terrorist watch list? If you are on that list, you can't get on an airplane because you are suspected to be a terrorist. Why should they be able to buy a gun? How about if you had been on the terrorist watch list and are no longer? That would have caught the shooter in Orlando because Omar Mateen had been on the terrorist watch list and was no longer when he walked in and bought that Sig Sauer MCX and mowed down 49 people.  It is our refusal to act. It is our failure to convince one another that there are some things that should be done. If you take the commonsense approach of requiring a background check, that is the right thing to do. Banning the military-style assault rifles, that is the right thing to do.  People get confused. There is a difference between a semiautomatic rifle and an assault rifle. Ever since I was a little boy, I had a .22 semiautomatic rifle with a clip. That is not an assault weapon. Even a bullet coming from a handgun--as one of the trauma surgeons who tended to some of the victims in Broward County points out--that handgun bullet will go in and come out through a victim the same size as it went in. If it goes through an organ such as the liver, they can save that person. That is in contrast to an assault rifle weapon--a bullet that has three times the speed of a handgun bullet and that has three times the energy when it hits the victim. So if it goes into an organ such as the liver, it doesn't go through like a handgun bullet. It pulverizes the liver, and when it comes out on the other side of the body, it is as big as an orange. That is what an assault rifle is. Listen to the trauma surgeons. They will tell you.  We could take up commonsense legislation right now and enact these simple, commonsense measures to make our communities safer and help prevent another mass tragedy, but unfortunately I think it is going to be very difficult. For weeks now, even in the face of parents, students, and teachers across this country calling for action, we have done nothing. We have seen an entire community turn its grief and its outrage into a massive call for change, and we have done nothing.  Across this country we have seen gun owners destroy their own assault weapons. We have seen major corporations distance themselves from groups like the NRA and their discounts. Just today, we heard announced that private companies such as Dick's Sporting Goods are taking it upon themselves to stop selling these weapons of war. They are not going to sell AR-15s anymore. They are not going to do it because they were told to, because Congress passed a law, but because it was the right thing to do.  So if Congress fails to act now, when will we act? If these brave, young students who lost their fellow students and faculty aren't enough to break through the gridlock in Congress, what is it going to take? If this tragedy doesn't spur us to action, lead us to change, what will? When will enough finally be enough?  I say to my colleagues, the time to act is now. Let's not let what happened at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High fade into memory like so many other tragedies. Let's take this tragedy and make it a pivotal moment in our Nation's history. Let's not have to go through these massacres again. Let's let this be the last one.  Let's come together as a Senate and do what needs to be done.

It shouldn't have happened in It shouldn't have happened in It shouldn't have happened in It shouldn't have happened at the Lauderdale airport or It shouldn't happen, period. Now it is up to us to make sure that it never happens again.  This Senator grew up on a ranch. I have always had guns. I have hunted all my life. I still hunt with my son. An AR-15 or a SIG Sauer MCX, the gun that was used at the Pulse nightclub, is not for hunting; they are for killing. Yet, despite these horrific events, these devastating tragedies are occurring throughout our country over and over, and Congress refuses to act. Why is it that we can't enact the most commonsense measures to protect the people we represent?  We need a comprehensive background check on the purchase of a weapon, a commonsense background check that would not only include if there is a criminal record or if someone has been adjudicated mentally incompetent but all the other myriad reasons, all the other things surrounding mental health. Was the shooter on the terrorist watch list? Had Omar Mateen, the shooter, been on the terrorist watch list, he would have been caught. He was the shooter in We need to get assault rifles off the streets.  Protecting our fellow citizens should be a top priority. If making it more difficult for someone to walk into a store and purchase a weapon of war will do that, why can't we get that done? Why? I will tell you why. Because there are folks who are more concerned about an A-plus rating from the NRA than they are about providing those commonsense solutions to the problems.  I want to read something that appeared in a national magazine, reprinted in the paper that is published in Broward County, where the shooting occurred. It is from a radiologist who is in the trauma center at Broward Health, which is a hospital chain organization in the area of Broward Her name is Heather She was working the day of the school shooting, and she went to work in the trauma center on some of the victims. She has treated countless gunshot wounds in trauma centers throughout her career, but this one was the second time that she had treated someone shot by an assault rifle like the AR-15. Here is what Sher had to say:       Routine handgun injuries leave entry and exit wounds and      linear tracks through the victim's body that are roughly the      size of the bullet. If the bullet [from a handgun] does not      directly hit something crucial like the heart or the aorta .      . . chances are, we can save the victim. The bullets fired by      an AR-15 are different.  She continues:       With an AR-15, the shooter does not have to be particularly      accurate. The victim does not have to be unlucky. If a victim      takes a direct hit to the liver from an AR-15, the damage is      far graver than that of a handgun bullet injury. Handgun      injuries to the liver are generally survivable unless the      bullet hits the main blood supply to the liver. An AR-15      bullet to the middle of the liver would cause so much      bleeding and tissue loss that the patient would likely never      make it to a trauma center to receive our care.  She continues:       As a doctor, I feel I have a duty to inform the public of      what I have learned as I have observed these wounds and cared      for these patients. It's clear to me that AR-15 or other      high-velocity weapons, especially when outfitted with a high-     capacity magazine, have no place in a civilian's gun cabinet.      . . . Banning the AR-15 should not be a partisan issue.  The senseless shootings are not going to stop until we change ourselves as a culture. I believe, with these students who have been so strong in their statements, so determined to make a change, that time might be now. It didn't happen after Sandy Hook Nothing happened. It didn't happen after the myriad of others. It didn't happen just 2 years ago after the Orlando nightclub shooting. Again, it did not happen after the Lauderdale airport shooting.  Is it different now? It certainly is time for us to come together and enact commonsense gun measures to keep our communities safe. It is time for us to come together--not as Republicans or Democrats but as human beings--and to say that this time it is going to be different.  You hear so many different things. You hear about mental health, and that is certainly a part of it. You hear about school protection, and that is certainly a part of it. You hear about the miscues not only in the FBI, and that is certainly a part of it, but the miscues in the Florida Department of Children and Families a year prior that had noted that this shooter--all of those things ought to be a part of the solution. If you get right down to it, we ought to come together, not as Republicans or Democrats but as human beings, and say that if we want to solve the problem, the solution is commonsense background checks in order to purchase a weapon and getting assault rifles off the streets.  Let's do this. Let's use this tragedy as the catalyst to enact real change in our society--changes that are going to have a real impact. Let's make what happened at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School a significant moment in this country's history, not because it was one of the largest mass shootings but because it was the last.

1357,topic-id,1227,"Madam President, it has been almost 6 months since Hurricane Irma struck It has been about a month since we passed the most recent disaster supplemental appropriations bill, which finally included the money for Florida's fisheries, citrus growers, and communities across the State that we have been fighting for since day one, since the storm passed.  Today, I spoke to the Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, and I asked him to immediately release this critical funding to help the people of our Florida's fishermen are still waiting for their help too.[[Page S1331]]  Hurricane Irma caused extensive damage to vessels, facilities, docks, equipment, and gear, especially in the Many in the spiny lobster industry lost all of their traps. The disaster supplemental appropriations gave NOAA $200 million for Federal fishery disasters like the one that Secretary Ross declared for Where is the money?  Let's talk about the broader impact to the oceans. Did you know that Florida's coral reef tract is the third largest barrier reef in the world? It is a reef that starts south of Key West and goes all the way up the coast, almost all the way to Fort The coral supports the spiny lobsters and the stone crabs, which are served in restaurants around the country. This industry is important to Florida's economy.  Hurricane Irma tossed all manner of debris around. Monroe County has already spent almost $20 million to remove over 2 million cubic yards of waste--roofs, appliances, bicycles, trailer homes, and boats. The debris was also swept into the water, which is threatening the corals, and into the canals, where it blocks transportation.  I want you to take a look at this picture. This is one of the canals in the Look at what is sitting in the canal--a whole mobile home that was lifted up from the mobile home park on this side of the canal. There it is, in the water.  Take a look at this. Do you see what is in the canal? Do you see out here? That is the ocean. This canal is coming right in. What happens is that eventually some of the debris goes into the It gets near the reef. Some of it submerges. The wave action is sending it back and forth.  You can imagine any one of those pieces of debris knocking constantly into delicate coral that is already diseased, that is already overheated because the rising temperature of the water. You can imagine what is happening. Whether it is a mobile home sitting in the canal or whether it is all of this junk that is sitting in the canal and that eventually goes out, this is what we need help with.  It has been over a month since we passed the disaster supplemental appropriations bill. Why isn't the money flowing? That is what I called the Secretary of Commerce about this morning. I told him: Mr.Secretary, my request is very, very simple. Just get the money out. The money is appropriated. It is there.  I said: Mr.Secretary, will you please crack the whip on NOAA so that you can get this money out and we can get this place cleaned up, as well as protect those coral reefs from the damage they have already undergone?  Then I said: What happened in this storm is, whether for lobster or stone crab, the traps were all swept away. The poor fishermen don't have any traps. They need help too. That is what this disaster appropriations bill is for. Mr.Secretary, you have to crack the whip to get them going.  Unfortunately, this is not the only issue we are facing. Florida's citrus industry suffered over $760 million in losses from the storm. Why? Because the trees were full of fruit that was going to be picked within just a few weeks. Along came the storm; the winds were severe. In Southwest Florida, some of the citrus crops were 100 percent lost. In fact, the winds were so high that they ended up uprooting citrus trees. Further north, in Central Florida, the groves there lost 50 to 60 percent of their crops.  The citrus industry cannot survive those kinds of losses, and that is why we have a disaster appropriations bill. There were losses of over $760 million from the storm. The rest of Florida's agriculture took a big hit, too, with an estimated $2.5 billion in total damages.  In February, we finally came through with $3.8 billion for the U.Department of Of that money, $2.6 billion was supposed to go directly to farmers and ranchers. It is March, and those folks haven't seen a dime.  After I talked to the Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, I put in a call to the Secretary of I have called several times today. I have yet to connect with him. If any of his staff are listening, there is a bottleneck at the USDA that is preventing this money from going to the families who desperately need it. I will continue to call Secretary Perdue to ask him to do what I asked Secretary Wilbur Ross to do: Crack the whip on his organization to get the money flowing. That is why we passed supplemental emergency appropriations. Now the Federal agencies need to get the money out the door.  This is so frustrating because the administration knew that Congress was discussing a disaster supplemental bill when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas in Then Irma hit, and then Maria hit.  Six months later, most of the Federal agencies are just starting to dust off their pencils and figure out how they are going to allocate the funding. What is wrong with you? People are hurting. They are going bankrupt. You have to get that money out.  Can you imagine how you would feel if your family's entire citrus crop had been wiped out and you had been holding your breath waiting for disaster assistance funding, which finally came over a month ago, and then you were told by the folks at the USDA that you were going to have to wait for several more months until USDA figures out how to get you the money? It is no wonder that people are fed up with bureaucracy.  Additionally, many of our cities and counties have yet to see any reimbursements from FEMA for Hurricane In fact, many have yet to be fully reimbursed for Hurricane Matthew, which struck almost 2 years ago. Unbelievably, all those counties that were devastated had paid for the debris removal. The State of Florida missed the deadline--didn't turn it in on time. Of course, what we had to do to cover the State of Florida's mistake was to plead with FEMA: Forget the mistake; it is the local counties and cities that need the money.  Not getting the money out is totally unacceptable. While we are still waiting for reimbursements from these storms, how can we expect these local governments to prepare for the 2018 hurricane season that will start in just a few months, right around the corner?  Let me say it again. This is unacceptable for the slow-walking--the foot-dragging--that is going on in getting the money out the door. I am going to keep pounding on this until the folks in Florida start getting the help they need and deserve.  I yield the floor.

1358,topic-id,1049,"Madam President, since I see no other Senator who seeks recognition, I thought I would take the occasion to bring the Senate up to date on what is happening down in Florida in the aftermath of 17 people being gunned down at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  As we know, we have seen those students speak out with a boldness and clarity that is rarely seen, and they are not being intimidated at all as to what needs to be done. As a matter of fact, in the aftermath of the shooting--and while some of the funerals have still been going on--since our Florida State Legislature is in session, over the course of 2 weeks, the students have gone to the capital city of Tallahassee and have held individual meetings with State legislators. They have held a rally outside of the capital and insisted that maybe--just maybe--this might be a time that the State legislature should confront this issue head-on: that, in fact, there was something to the fact that a weapon that was originally developed for the military, an AR-15--the semiautomatic version of a military weapon--could do such damage and quickly go about killing so many people. It was 17 in the case of the high school.  Just 2 years earlier, it was 49 people in Orlando at the Pulse nightclub. In between, we saw several mass killings with high-powered, military-style assault rifles in Texas, as well as 59 people being gunned down in Las  Last week, I talked about the assault weapon, and I have since had, over the weekend, constituents in Florida ask me to come back and speak on the floor of the Senate about the difference in the damage--the mayhem, the carnage, the slaughter--that occurs as a result of an assault rifle as compared to a handgun. You don't have to take it from this You can talk to the trauma surgeons. You can talk to the radiologist in the trauma center. As a matter of fact, several articles in the past week have been written in various publications in Florida and in the national press, along with there being[[Page S1332]]photographs to show the difference. Let me paraphrase the words of one of the trauma surgeons in Broward County who attended to some of the victims.  He cited that on any normal night, particularly on a weekend, they have to treat gunshots. If that gunshot is from a handgun--say, a .22 pistol or, say, a .9 millimeter pistol--the bullet will enter the victim, and unless that bullet goes to a critical organ, such as the heart or, for example, to the blood supply going into the liver, that bullet will continue through. If it comes out the other side, it will come out with a hole that is the same size as when it penetrated the body in the first place. It is not so with a bullet from an assault rifle because those weapons, which are developed for the military, are clearly for killing.  The bullet, first of all, comes out at three times the speed--three times the velocity. Therefore, when it hits its target, it hits with three times the energy. Often, the bullet is designed so that when it hits the target, it will tumble and just tear through and destroy any flesh in its path, including bone and organs.  The trauma center's radiologist explains that if a handgun's bullet, such as a .9 millimeter, goes through the liver, they can usually save the patient's life. They point out that of almost all handgun wounds, they can save the life unless the bullet hits a major artery or organ, like the heart, or a major blood supply. It is not so with the bullet from an assault weapon. The bullet enters at three times the velocity, with three times the energy. It starts tumbling, ripping away flesh. If it goes, for example, to a kidney or to the liver, it pulverizes that organ and comes out the other side of the victim with a hole as large as an orange.  That is the difference between a handgun wound and a wound from a high-velocity assault rifle, whether it is a semiautomatic or whether it is an automatic. It was made automatic, with what we saw in Las Vegas, with the bump stocks. He made a semiautomatic, which was legal to purchase, into an automatic rifle. It is because of that carnage that one has to ask oneself: Would any American citizen want to have those kinds of assault rifles loose on the streets for people who want to use them for dastardly purposes? I think the answer is no.  This Senator grew up on a ranch. I have hunted all of my life. I still hunt with my son, but an AR-15 is not for hunting; it is for killing. It is an understanding of the difference of these weapons that is causing the American people to gradually understand that these kinds of weapons have no place on the streets of  One can imagine the SWAT team. Had they been there while the shooter had still been inside and had they entered that school and tried to find the killer and known that what they were going to come up against was an AR-15 instead of a handgun, that would have been a terrible thing. One can imagine, if there had happened to be an armed guard with a pistol and he had gone after the shooter but the shooter had had an AR-15, that would not have been a fair firefight. With a pistol against an AR-15, one can imagine who is going to win that fight.  These are the questions that the American people need to have answered as we go through these discussions about what to do. Thus, when these students all gather in Washington and in 100 cities around this country on March 24--a Saturday--and start marching in untold numbers, they are going to be asking: Isn't enough enough?

He was a track star, a silver medalist, 1936 games, Olympic games in In World War II, he flew B-24 bombers. That was a dangerous plane. Twice, his plane crashed. The second time, he floated the Pacific Ocean for 47 days. He said: ``God, if I survive this ordeal and get back to America alive, I'll seek You and serve You.''  He was captured by the Japanese and spent the rest of the war in a prison war camp in A guard there he called, ``The Bird,'' knew of Louis' fame, and he beat him to a pulp every single day. Louis said: ``I was constantly being tormented by the guy. And you talk about hate. I wanted to kill him.''  His nightmares of the POW camp came home. He was consumed by anger. One night, Louis dreamed he was strangling The Bird to death. Instead, he woke up to find out he was strangling his wife, He started getting drunk as a skunk every night to forget about the horrors that plagued him.  With her husband getting drunk every single night, Cynthia filed for divorce, and that is when a friend invited her to see the Reverend Billy Graham crusade in a Los Angeles tent dubbed, ``The Canvas Cathedral.'' She accepted Christ that night.  She convinced Louis to attend Reverend Graham's service. After storming out of that tent the first night, Louis returned for one more evening. That time, the Bible verse Billy Graham quoted went straight to Louis' heart. He said: ``Of all my near-death experiences, my life never passed before my eyes. But when Billy Graham quoted Scripture, my life did pass before my eyes.'' For the first time in years, Louis remembered the promise he made God when he was floating in the South  That night, he went forward and accepted Christ, and the biggest miracle of his life was set in motion.

This bill names the post office at 1900 Corporate Drive in Birmingham, Alabama, after Lance Corporal Thomas Rivers,  Corporal Rivers was a resident of Hoover, Alabama, and a graduate of Briarwood Christian  Both of Rivers' grandfathers served in the military, and he desired to follow in their footsteps. Corporal Rivers wrote in a high school essay that he ``wanted to be a marine since he was 10 years old,'' and that he believed ``joining the Marines would be a good experience for him because it would teach[[Page H1350]]him to rely on God to make it through.''  Two weeks after graduating from high school, Thomas fulfilled his dream by joining the He was known by his fellow marines as a man of devout faith who was always looking for ways to serve his fellow marines.  In the early morning hours of April 28, 2010, while deployed in Helmand province, Afghanistan, Rivers ordered his men to take their positions. However, the marine assigned to stand watch was exhausted. As a patrol leader, Rivers was never required to stand post, but Thomas had been reading in the Bible about how love isn't an emotion but is demonstrated in laying your life down for your friends. Rivers told the weary marine: ``I'll stand post for you; you rest.''  Tragically, while replacing the exhausted marine, Rivers activated an improvised explosive device. Rivers gave his life for his country and exemplified the attitude in John 15:13:       Greater love has no one than this, that he should lay down      his life for his friends.  This bill pays tribute to Corporal Rivers' sacrifice. Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

1494,topic-id,712,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, Mr.Hultgren, for arranging this opportunity to honor Billy  Mr.Speaker, tomorrow will we witness something that we have never seen before: the laying in honor of the body of an American who was not a government official, didn't lead a political movement, and wasn't a war hero or social movement hero.  The Nation will mourn a man who was single-minded in his devotion to one thing, whose life and vocation centered on one thing and one thing only: proclaiming the saving grace of God through Jesus  I hope we pay close attention to this. We will most likely never see it again.  In Mark, Jesus tells his disciples to ``go into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature.'' Few people followed this instruction more faithfully than the Reverend Billy Graham and with as much success and impact.  Billy Graham has been called America's But the fact of the matter is that he was, for many decades, the most recognized and respected evangelical in the world.  Reverend Graham preached the Gospel to more than 200 million people during his more than 400 crusades and rallies in more than 185 countries and territories. The impact of those reached through TV, radio, video, and the internet is unquantifiable.  Reverend Graham did this sacrificially, giving up opportunities for other, much more lucrative opportunities that most people would have jumped at were they given the opportunity. Moreover, Reverend Graham estimated that he was gone from home for about 60 percent of his children's adolescence.  Despite being a pseudo-single mom, his wife, Ruth, understood the importance of the sacrifice. She once said: ``I'd rather have a little of Bill than a lot of any other man.''  At a time when Christians are so often shunned and ridiculed, particularly those who have major followings, Billy Graham was almost universally regarded as a steady and well-respected voice. He appeared on Gallup's list of most admired men in America 60 times since 1955. That is every year since the research firm began asking the question.  He counseled and covered in prayer every President, from Truman to Former President Clinton said: ``When he prays with you in the Oval Office or upstairs in the White House, you feel he's praying for you, not the President.''  That is the magnitude of this man: no matter how big or small you were, he cared about you, not your position. Titles and wealth and social status didn't matter to Reverend The only position of a person that mattered to him was their eternal position before Race did not matter either.  Reverend Graham was courageous. When other church leaders remained silent, he was an outspoken advocate for racial equality, consistently stating: ``Christ belongs to all people.''  In 1951, he called for the Southern Baptist Convention to accept Black students at their colleges. At a 1953 crusade in Tennessee, he personally took down ropes segregating the audience. In 1957, during his crusade in New York, he invited Martin Luther King, Jr., to open one night with a prayer. Despite his actions, he later said he wished he would have done more to help  In 1964, just months after the bombing at the 16th Street Baptist Church, Reverend Graham brought his crusade to Birmingham, Before he agreed to come, Reverend Graham insisted that the audience be integrated. Over 30,000 people attended, making it, at the time, the largest integrated audience in the history of  The next year, he spoke to an integrated audience in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, with University of Alabama President Frank Rose and head football coach Paul ``Bear'' Bryant with him on the stage.  Mr.Speaker, I don't believe there is or will be anyone else in our lifetime who so clearly and effectively called people out of spiritual darkness into the light than Billy                              {time}  1900  Untold millions were exposed to the saving message of the Gospel through his ministry. I mourn the void of moral and spiritual authority that, with his death, has been left in this world, but I rejoice in knowing that he is finally at home and at rest with  As it is written about David in Acts 13:36, so it can be said of Billy He served God's purpose for his generation.

But last week, the Trump administration released a budget proposal that would gut this critical lifeline by a third and completely change what food they get and how they get it.  Instead of being able to go to the store and select fresh food at the supermarket, the corner market, the rural market, or even the farmer's market, half the benefits would now come in a periodic delivery of a cardboard box filled with cheap peanut butter, canned goods, uncooked pasta, dry cereal, and something called shelf-stable milk.  I get that we want to get people who can work to work, but on the central coast of California, 63,000 people rely on over $127 million worth of SNAP benefits to meet their own family's needs.  Those same benefits provide local businesses with over $227 million in economic activity. That is why the administration's proposal to change SNAP won't work for the families and the store owners that I represent, and it will not work for many of the Americans that you represent.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-27-pt1-PgH1321.txt,2309,OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKING ORGANIZATIONS,2018.0,27.0,February

He has demonstrated great leadership during this time, and the issues that we are tackling during these Special Order hours are very important to this country as we move forward.  As has been stated today, it has been 50 years since the Kerner report warned us that the Nation was headed into a separate and unequal future. The Kerner report was supposed to be a wake-up call for the United States to break the cycle that kept African-Americans in poverty. It called for government to invest in job creation programs, to expand public housing, and to guarantee minimum family incomes. The Kerner report understood that such actions were necessary for the United States to confront its legacy of race and inequality.  Unfortunately, 50 years later, the same problems persist. The rate of child poverty in the United States today is greater than it was in 1968. The percent of Americans who live in the depths of poverty has grown as well. Welfare reform has failed. African-American unemployment is still nearly double the rate of our White counterparts. Labor unions, once a great equalizer for workers, have shrunk, and inequality has grown.  Rich people in the United States are healthier than poor people. They live longer. They go to better schools, get better jobs, and generate more wealth. They are also more likely to be White than to be  Our schools are more segregated than they were in the 1980s. Our prisons are darker. The Voting Rights Act, a landmark achievement of the civil rights movement, has been gutted.  These and other barriers to equality threaten our democracy.  The resegregation of our schools means that people of color and those who struggle with poverty are often forced to go to underfunded schools. Their education suffers. They aren't given adequate preparation for college or a trade school, and they ultimately make less money than their White counterparts.  A recent Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco study found that Black men and women earn persistently lower wages compared to their White counterparts, a gap that cannot be fully explained by differences in age, education, job type, or location.  So what can Congress do? We need to invest in housing programs that help desegregate communities once again. We need to make it easier for people of color to get federally backed loans to buy homes and finally do away with red lining.  We need to invest in public schools. We need to expand preschool education. We need to spend money on job training programs and public universities.  We need to increase the minimum wage, and we need to strengthen oversight of mortgage lenders.  We need to restore the Voting Rights Act, because people who cannot vote cannot lead.

342,topic-id,719,"Madam President, our Nation's middle class was built by the hard work of American workers. At a time when our country has become increasingly polarized, we should all be able to agree that everybody should have a fair chance to succeed if they are willing to work hard and play by the rules.  These truly American values have inspired generations of workers who stand together and collectively bargain for basic workplace protections such as fair wages, safe workplaces, and reasonable hours. These protections allow American workers and their families to be productive members of the economy and achieve their version of the American dream, but the American dream only exists if hard work is rewarded with the opportunity to earn a good living, provide for your loved ones, and, when it is all said and done, be able to retire with dignity.  This is deeply personal to me. As a nurse's aide, my mother found opportunity and led the effort to organize her workplace. She went on to serve as an SEIU union steward.  Unfortunately, in the years since I grew up in Rochester Hills, it feels as though the American dream has moved out of the reach for too many American families. Joining or staying in the middle class can be a daily struggle.  We must fight every day to support and build the middle class, not chip away at fundamental worker rights. The laws, regulations, and administrative decisions that come out of Washington have a direct impact on American workers, unions, and the middle class.  The National Labor Relations Board plays a central role in protecting the rights of American workers. The NLRB was created to safeguard their ability to unionize and engage in collective bargaining for fair workplace conditions.  To work as intended, the NLRB must be made up of members deeply committed to representing the interests of American workers. Unfortunately, the nominee we will be considering shortly, Mr.John Ring, does not share this commitment. In fact, he is the third labor attorney President Trump has nominated to the committee with zero--let me say that again--zero track record of representing workers. He has only represented clients on the corporate and management side of labor issues.  During Mr.Ring's tenure at one of the country's largest firms, he advised corporations on how to undermine worker protections. He also posted blogs opposing commonsense reforms to modernize union election procedures, classifying the NLRB actions as ``some of the biggest assaults on employer rights in recent history.''  Mr.Ring would join recently confirmed Board member William Emanuel, who quickly ran into ethics trouble based on his history of representing corporations. Just 5 months after Mr.Emanuel's appointment, the NLRB was forced to vacate a major decision related to employer liability due to his conflicts of interest. Yet the administration continues full steam ahead with new nominees with extensive corporate ties and conflicts of interest.  This administration is also breaking precedent and all conception of fairness by refusing to nominate new NLRB members in bipartisan pairs. Despite a pending Democratic vacancy on the panel, the President and Senate majority leader have instead chosen a partisan approach--doubling down on the one-sided nature of a supposedly independent Federal agency. This is simply an unacceptable development, and it is an ongoing effort to silence our Nation's workers. Protecting American workers, the American middle class, and the American dream should not be a partisan issue.  I am deeply concerned with Mr.Ring's appointment to the If confirmed to the five-member Board, the voting majority of an agency charged with protecting workers' voices will be stacked with members who are focused on undermining fundamental worker rights. I think employers should be treated fairly but not at the expense of our Nation's workers and the American middle class. We need a balanced and fair NLRB, and we need NLRB members who will stick up for American workers and the middle class. Mr.Ring will not be that kind of NLRB member. The administration and the majority are actively preventing seating someone who will stand up for workers.  I will be voting against Mr.Ring's confirmation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

On one such occasion, I picked him up at the airport in 1975 here in Washington and was taking him back to the hotel. He said to Bright: the next challenge we have in the world today is terrorism. He said that this group who doesn't honor God and they don't honor Christ are going to be the force we deal with.  How remarkable that it was Billy Graham who helped heal our Nation after 9/11 as he spoke to that National Cathedral to bring the message of hope in  Yes, I went with Billy to his crusades in Cleveland, Dallas, and In fact, the first time he ever brought together young people, he had a Friday night big crusade for young people.

He died on the cross for our sin, that we could receive Christ, know Him, and know eternal life.  He gave that message all over the world. I have met people in Romania, Czech Republic, and the former Soviet Union--now Russia--all over the world who met Christ because Billy Graham came, and he took the gospel to them.

106,topic-id,2983,"On another topic, Mr.President, today is a big day in the fight against sex trafficking.  I just got back a couple of hours ago from a meeting at the White House where the President of the United States signed legislation that we have been working on for several years to be able to push back against the sex trafficking that is occurring online. It was very emotional. We had a lot of survivors, victims of sex trafficking, who were there.  One of them was standing next to the When he signed the bill, he asked whether she wanted to say anything. Fighting back tears, Yvonne Ambrose said: I want to tell you about my daughter.  She told the President about her 16-year-old daughter who was trafficked on backpage.com, a website that has most of the commercial sex traffic, and how she got a call on Christmas Eve a couple of years ago. Her daughter had been murdered. As she said, no mother[[Page S2080]]should ever have to accept or take that call.  She talked about how her daughter got dragged into this issue of trafficking and said that she hopes the legislation we passed will be able to save other daughters, other granddaughters, other Americans who otherwise would become part of the sex trafficking tragedy we have seen unfold in our country.  This legislation came out of experiences we have all had when we go back home. We talk to victims and survivors, and we have learned over the past several years that trafficking is actually on the increase in this country, in this century. People think: Well, trafficking is going on, but it happens in Africa or it happens in Asia or it happens in Latin It happens here. It probably happens in your community. Unfortunately, it happens in my State of Ohio way too frequently.  Through our investigation and studies of this, increasingly, we heard about online trafficking. Survivors have told me: Rob, this has moved from the street corner to the smartphone.  Groups, including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, showed that from 2005 to 2015 there was an 800-percent increase in reports of trafficking. All of the experts agree that there is an increase in trafficking, and all agree that most of this is attributable directly to one thing--the movement to the ruthless efficiency of online selling of women and children.  One website in particular kept coming up--backpage.com, which I mentioned earlier. So we launched an investigation over a 2-year period in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair. We decided to dig deep and find out what was going on, why it was happening, and what the nature of this was. What we found was shocking.  Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri is the ranking member of the committee. She and I did this investigation, together with our committee, and we issued the report together. It was bipartisan from the start. I would say it was even nonpartisan, and it is to this day.  The investigation involved asking backpage.com for a lot of information that they were unwilling to give. We had to subpoena them, and they still refused to provide the information. We had to come to this Chamber, to the U.Senate, and get a vote of the entire Senate--the first time in 21 years we had to do this--to be able to enforce these subpoenas. Every Member of this body got engaged and involved in this, and by the end of the process, we had a unanimous vote from the Senate to say: Yes, you should be able to force people to provide relevant information to the committees that are doing oversight, like ours.  We got permission to enforce it, which meant potential criminal sanctions, and they still wouldn't give us information. They fought us at the district level. They lost there. Then they fought us at the circuit level. We fought and won there. Then they fought us at the Supreme Court of the United We had to take it all the way to the Supreme  Then, yes, they did provide us with about a million documents. They still refused to testify. They took the But they did provide us with the documents because they had to under the threat of penalty of law. Through those documents, we found out something shocking, which was that not only were they selling women and girls online and making a lot of money doing it, but they were purposely selling underage girls and trying to hide the fact that they were doing it. Think about that. They were not only selling girls and women online, but they were taking ads for underage girls, knowing they were underage and running the ads anyway.  In fact, they would go to the people who were trying to place the ads and say: You know what, you need to change this word. You can't use the word ``schoolgirl'' because this indicates the girl is underage. You can't use the word ``cheerleader'' because that shows that she is underage. You can't use the word ``Lolita,'' which is a novel about a young girl being trafficked and an older man.  You can't use the description of the girl and put her age in there if she is underage, but they want your ad anyway. They edited the ads, so they were complicit in this.  You would think a prosecutor would be able to go after these people, right? They are engaged in illegal activity online. If that activity were happening offline, on the street corner in your community, it would be illegal. When the prosecutors went after these people online and when the victims of trafficking, like the woman I talked about earlier whose 16-year-old daughter was murdered while she was being trafficked on backpage--when they went after backpage in that case, they were unsuccessful. Why? Because they said: Yes, Desiree died. Yes, Desiree would have a lawsuit here, as well as other women and families who came to testify before us. Kubiiki Pride is one, and her daughter was there today. But there is a Federal law that says: We, the courts, can't even take up this case because the Federal law provides an immunity, a shield, to these websites.  We had a court in Sacramento last year actually tell Congress, basically: Please change this law. They said: We can't stop this exploitation--this alleged exploitation of women and girls. We can't stop it because Congress has passed a law that protects these websites. No one can go after them.  The more we learned, the more we dug, the more we found out what was really going on, we determined that our report, which you can see here--and I encourage you to check out this report. You can find it online. ``Backpage'' is the search, and look on Portman.senate.gov. Go to Portman.senate.gov, and you will see this report, if you are interested in it. The summaries will help. What it says, basically, is that they are trafficking these individuals, and they know they are doing it. Yet they are immune.  Once we determined that was our issue, we determined it was time for us to figure out legislation to actually change our Federal law that was permitting it. The culmination of that was today when the President of the United States signed that into law.  For a couple of years, we had quite a legislative struggle because there were a lot of individuals who said: Well, you can't touch these internet companies because of this law.  The law was passed 21 years ago, at the infancy of the internet. It was well-intentioned, but I do not believe that any Member of this body intended, when they passed that law, to say that you should be able to traffic people online knowingly and not pay some consequence for it, not be accountable for it.  We made a very narrow carve-out for trafficking of individuals online. We made sure that it was consistent with the Federal criminal law that was already in place if you were to do it offline. We ensured that there was a Good Samaritan provision so that if a website was in good faith trying to clean up its site and edit its site and get this information off of it, they would not be liable. That Good Samaritan or safe harbor provision was in our legislation. We proceeded to get it passed.  We had a lot of pushback, particularly from the tech community--not everybody in the tech community but certain people who believe strongly that this legislation was somehow a threat to internet freedom. I do not believe that to this day. I believe it is targeted, it is responsible, and it certainly is an issue on which you would think everybody would agree.  Just because you are online does not mean you are not accountable and responsible for selling people online--again, in the context of more and more trafficking in this country. As you look into it, you determine that is because of this online presence, the ruthless efficiency of the online selling of women and children.  We were able to bring it to the floor for a vote after a committee process. We went through the Permanent Subcommittee on We went through the Commerce At the end of the day, we got a vote in this Chamber of 97 to 2. That rarely happens around here--rarely, if ever. Again, today, finally, the President signed the bill.  It looks like it was easier to do at the end. I will tell you, a couple of years ago, we were told: This will never happen. You can't make this happen. You can't beat us. We have a lot of[[Page S2081]]power. We have a lot lobbyists. We have a lot of abilities to stop you in the committee.  Yet, through persuasion and, frankly, through the personal testimony of victims and survivors who were willing to come forward and courageously share their stories, we were able to prevail. Today, it was a victory--not for this body, not for the legislative process, but it was a victory for those victims and those survivors.  One mom told me today: This means my granddaughter won't have to worry about this issue. It means that when my kid goes to the mall, I don't have to worry as much about what might happen, who might try to take her into this web of trafficking.  My hope is that this legislation will be able to curb the online trafficking in a significant way. We are already seeing the results of that. I was told today, in fact, that websites that trafficked people online are shutting down all over America because they don't want to be sued, because they are losing their immunity. It is not affecting the freedom of the internet, but it is affecting those evil websites that were engaged in criminal activity and hiding behind section 230 of the Communications Decency I am told that as many as 80 percent of those trafficking websites have shut down just in the last several days because they don't want to be subject to these lawsuits.  We also had something else that was very interesting happen this week. The Department of Justice went after backpage.com. They actually indicted seven individuals. If you look at the indictment, which I have here--you can find this by going on the Justice Department website, I am sure; it is in the district court in Arizona--you will see that they named seven individuals. These are the same seven individuals we named in our report. They also used the information from our report about the fact that backpage was changing ads, editing ads. In other words, they were knowingly allowing ads about underage girls to be run because they wanted the profits. That is exactly what is talked about in this indictment.  The work of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations was very important because it enabled us to provide to the Justice Department information they used for these indictments. We provided that information 10 months ago, and the indictments came out in the last several days.  My hope is that now, because this law passed, we will see a lot more prosecutions because we have now allowed State prosecutors and attorneys general around the country and local prosecutors, district attorneys, and county prosecutors--who are the ones who ultimately are going to be much more effective and more able to go after this kind of activity--to do so.  Backpage has been in existence for 14 years. Until this week, the Federal Justice Department had not made these indictments. It was great that they did it. It is also about time, in my view. Now we have this tool to allow other prosecutors to be more aggressive, to do what should have been done years ago--to save the lives of so many girls, women, and boys whose lives have been taken off track because of the trauma associated with this. We also now have the opportunity for the victims themselves to file lawsuits.  This is already having a chilling effect. In other words, it is already taking down these websites that don't want to be sued. They know our legislation--although very narrowly crafted--applies to them because they are knowingly involved in, supporting, assisting sex trafficking.  I think this is a victory for the victims, the survivors, and, maybe most importantly, the potential future victims. It is also an opportunity for us to celebrate something that this Chamber accomplished in a bipartisan way, going through the right process, doing the research, coming up with the facts, narrowly crafting legislation that works, which doesn't have a negative impact, but in fact, it helps to change behavior. We are already seeing it.  My hope is that we will do more of that around here. We have many other issues to address. Earlier, we talked about the opioid crisis. Congress passed some good legislation, but we need to do more.  We have an issue with getting people back to work who are in the shadows of our economy, some of whom have a felony record, some of whom are addicted to opioids, some of whom don't have the skills to engage in a modern economy. That is a huge challenge. To me, it is unbelievable that we have so many people who are in our country but not in our labor force. Our labor force participation rate, as economists call it, is as low as it has ever been for men in the history of our country. There are probably 9 million men between 25 and 55 who are able-bodied and not working today. That is wrong.  There are many issues we need to address. If we can do those studies in the same way and come up with sensible solutions based on research, based on good practices, keep it not just bipartisan but nonpartisan, and say: Let's get the politics out of this, and let's try to figure out how to help people--which is our job around here; that is what we were elected to do--maybe we can make progress in a number of different areas.  Today, at the signing ceremony for this legislation, the SESTA legislation, I had the opportunity to see a friend of mine, Theresa Flores, who runs a group called Save Our Adolescents From Prostitution, S.O.A.the reason she uses the acronym S.O.A.is that Theresa, who is a survivor--she was trafficked years ago and now has a passion for this issue. She calls her organization S.O.A.because she goes to major events around the country, sporting events, where there tend to be an increase in trafficking. What she does is she goes to the hotels and asks them to put a bar of soap in the bathroom. On that bar of soap, she has listed the national hotline for sex trafficking. A girl can call that number and have someone come rescue her, and she can escape from her trafficker.  That simple act of making these bars of soap and getting hotels to place them in these bathrooms has been remarkably effective. Think about it. These girls or women may have no other time where they have privacy, where they don't have the trafficker with them, where they are not feeling under duress. When they have their private moment in the bathroom, they see the number. Many of them have called that number and have been able to escape this life and get back to a productive life, with treatment, with support, with the kind of longer term recovery that is needed to get through the trauma, to get through, in many cases, the drug addiction. Drugs are involved in this, as you can imagine, as a way to make these women, girls, and boys dependent. In fact, in Ohio, unfortunately, that is a common practice, is that drugs are involved.  Theresa Flores has done something incredible. She has channeled her frustration and all of the trauma she went through into something very constructive. She was there today, and her comment to me was that, by this act, by passing this law, we are going to save lives, and we are going to enable future generations to not go down the tragic and dark road she had to go down. That should make us feel good in this It should make us feel good for those whose lives can be helped through this and for those victims to at least have the opportunity to have their day in court, to be able to seek justice.  I thank the President of the United States for signing the legislation today. I thank Ivanka Trump in particular for her support on the legislation all along the way. I hope this legislation will be a model for others to come.  I yield back my time.

1367,topic-id,3521,"Mr.President, I want to address a critical issue today in Westerville, OH, and, frankly, every community I represent in my State and communities all over the country. Today, I want to talk about the opioid epidemic that is gripping our country.  Every State represented in this Chamber has had too many communities devastated, families broken apart, and lives taken by the opioid overdoses. The Centers for Disease Control now tells us more than 63,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2016, the last year for which they have records. It also looks like it was worse in 2017. More Americans are dying from drug overdoses than the total number of casualties during the Vietnam war. Every year, more Americans are dying from drug overdoses than the total number of casualties from the Vietnam war. Think about that. It is a staggering statistic.  On average, more than 174 Americans died every single day from a drug overdose in 2016. That is up from 143 Americans in 2015 and 105 Americans in 2010. In other words, it is getting worse, and 2016 was the deadliest year on record. Initial estimates for 2017 suggest it is going to be even deadlier, including in my home State of  Opioids--prescription drugs, heroin, and synthetic forms of heroin--are increasingly the reason why. Opioids were involved in about two-thirds of all overdose deaths in 2016. Opioid overdose deaths were five times higher in 2016 than they were just back in 1999. In the past 17 years, we have seen a fivefold increase in these overdose deaths. It is a national epidemic.  It has unfolded in three different waves. It started with prescription drugs, overprescribing of prescription drugs--pain pills. The pill mills we saw in Southern Ohio and around our State exploded about 15 to 20 years ago. Next, there were the heroin deaths. Heroin moved in and spiked as people moved to less expensive and more accessible alternatives than prescription drugs. Now, I hate to tell you, there is a new danger and a threat, and it is deadlier than ever. It is these synthetic opioids--fentanyl, carfentanil--that have moved into our States, overcoming our law enforcement, and the results have been deadly.  By the way, it is a crisis that does not discriminate. Opioid addiction affects everybody, regardless of age, area code, class, or color. In Ohio, drug addiction and acts committed to support it have now become the 1 cause of crime in our communities--probably the same in your community.  Employers, of course, are increasingly pointing to the inability to find workers who can pass a drug test. They can't fill vacant positions. There is new data out with regard to people who are not showing up on the unemployment rolls but have given up looking for work altogether. There are probably 9 million men between 25 and 55 who are considered to be able-bodied who aren't even looking for work. Some really troubling statistics out there indicate that maybe as many as half--one study says 48 percent--of those individuals are taking opioids on a daily basis.  This is affecting all of us. Every aspect of our communities is affected. Everybody has a role to play overcoming this epidemic. There is an urgency coming up with better strategies to turn the tide on addiction. Although I believe progress has been made recently--and it is starting to be made in my State and other States--much more needs to be done and done urgently.  Part of that starts with understanding that addiction is a disease, and it is treatable. Too often it is not treated like that. The appropriate response should include much more aggressive prevention and education, absolutely, and more aggressive law enforcement keeping deadly fentanyl out of our communities through the STOP Act and other means, of course, but we also have to get more effective treatment strategies. We have a couple hundred thousand people in Ohio who are addicted. We need to get them into treatment, including more effective detox, medication-assisted treatment, and longer term recovery. We know, coupled with the right kind of therapy, the right kind of support and help, people can get into recovery and get back to their families, get back to work, and get back to being productive citizens.  We also know recovery results are a lot better with that kind of continuous support. Closing the gaps that occur is key to overcoming addiction. There is a gap between the crisis response, which is often a first responder--like the two brave officers I talked about earlier--finding someone who has overdosed. Often it is firefighters as well providing Narcan, this miracle drug that reverses the effect of the overdose. That is incredibly important to saving lives.  Narcan alone is not sufficient. The key is to get those people into detox and into treatment and longer term recovery. The gaps we have out there between the crisis response and Narcan,[[Page S1246]]then going to detox, then going to treatment, and then going to recovery are creating a lot of the inability to solve this problem.  I have probably met a couple of thousand addicts or recovering addicts in the last few years. What they tell me is: I tried treatment, but it was for 6, 7, 8 weeks, and then there was nothing for me. It didn't work for me. Then there are people who overdosed, not once or twice but several times, and they had never been in detox and treatment.  One young man I spoke to last weekend has been an addict for 7 years. Finally, his brother convinced him to seek help. The last time he overdosed, he did go into detox. He did go into treatment, to a facility where those gaps were closed, where there was no waiting time, where he was able to get the help, rather than going back to his old community and his old friends and a situation that was going to lead him back into more use and more addiction.  The key, again, is to get those who have overdosed into the treatment they need. Overdose reversal provides a second chance at life. Let's face it. Some of these people who are overdosing come out of this after Narcan is administered. They have seen their life flash before their eyes, and they are ready for something. We have to be ready for them. Just as the overdose reversal provides a second chance at life, it is treatment and longer term recovery that provides that second chance to live addiction-free--again, to get back with your family, get back to work, and get back to a productive life. It takes a comprehensive solution because it is a comprehensive problem.  That is what led some of us in this body, including my colleague Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and me, to introduce the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, back in 2015. We developed that bill over time by relying on experts in the field and those most affected by addiction.  Beginning in 2014, when we were in the process of putting together the legislation, we hosted five national forums here in Washington, We brought experts and practitioners in from around the country--prevention, treatment, law enforcement, and recovery communities. We wanted to get the best practices to find out what was working, what wasn't working, and how we could improve the response. What role could the Federal Government play in all of this? We had forums focused on the science of addiction to understand it better, evidence-based prevention strategies that actually work; treating pregnant women who are addicted and babies at risk of being born drug-dependent. There is nothing more heartbreaking than going into the neonatal units in the hospitals in my home State and seeing these babies who were born dependent and watching them go through the painful withdrawal process as infants Every neonatal unit in our country has seen this. If you go to your own hospital, they will tell you this is an increasing problem.  We had veterans come in, and we had experts come in to help veterans make that transition because, sadly, the use of opioids among veterans is also increasing. They sometimes use opioids for injuries, for accidents, for PTSD, and they become addicted. How do you build support around those veterans? We also had people come in and talk about longer term recovery and housing and how, over time, you can get better results if you provide those kinds of services. Our goal was to leverage the expertise and perspectives of everyone involved in this epidemic, to find best practices, and to create an evidence-based education, treatment, and recovery bill that works.  With strong bipartisan support, we moved from hearings, to a unanimous committee markup, to Senate passage of this legislation. By the way, it passed with a vote of 92 to 2. That is not typical around here, certainly not for something so comprehensive. Yet everybody has experienced this back home and is desperate to figure out strategies to help. In July of 2016, President Obama signed CARA into law. It was the first comprehensive addiction reform in more than 20 years. It was the first time Congress had ever provided any support or help for this longer term recovery piece.  The CARA law targets prevention and education resources to prevent abuse before it even starts--the most effective way. It helps first responders reverse overdoses to save lives. It devotes resources to evidence-based treatment and recovery programs. It expands prescription drug take-back programs to get addictive pain pills off the bathroom shelves. More than $180 million was authorized to assist communities in these efforts to combat this epidemic. Frankly, because of this crisis, the appropriators decided: You know, we need this so badly, we are actually going to appropriate more than the $180 million. Last year, as an example, they appropriated $267 million--almost $100 million beyond our authorization.  Again, I think it is beginning to make a difference. I see it back home in I see some of these strategies beginning to work. It is going to take some time, and we need to do more. In Ohio, we received about $4 million. When I say ``we,'' I mean groups, people who are in the trenches doing the hard work.  We have also made progress in this fight with separate opioid legislation that was part of the 21st Century Cures legislation. That legislation was for substance abuse and mental health. Many of us successfully fought to help secure a 2-year commitment there of $500 million a year, totaling $1 billion. It goes directly to the This money goes to States that are hardest hit, and States are allowed to decide how to spend that money. The first installment of funding from that legislation awarded my State of Ohio with $26 million, and we are using every penny of it.  I was at a facility over the weekend that gave me hope. It is called the Maryhaven Addiction Stabilization Center, and it is in Columbus, They talked about the gaps, where people who overdose are provided Narcan, and then they go back to their community, and what first responders will tell you is that sometimes in the same week or even on the same day on some occasions, there is another overdose. The revolving door continues without any treatment and without any solution. Maryhaven Stabilization Center is a response to that. They used the Cures money we talked about, they used some CARA funding from the county--the county is a part of the broader strategy of where the CARA money went--and they said: Let's put together an institution where there is an emergency room that focuses on overdoses.  I have been to other emergency rooms in Columbus, OH, and I have seen what they do with the people who overdose. They save lives, and that is fantastic, but frankly these emergency rooms are equipped for everything, and they have to be--for gunshot wounds, car accidents, trauma.  This emergency room would be focused specifically on overdoses, which makes it more cost-effective but also more effective for those recovering addicts, those addicts who are coming in. But most importantly, in that same facility, there is a detox center. In that same facility, there are 50 treatment beds. Whereas in the typical case when somebody overdoses, they go to the emergency room and end up going back to their community, back home, back to the gang, back to the family, in this case, 103 people who have gone through in the last month--it has only been open a month--80 percent of them have gone into treatment. I had the opportunity to meet someone who had been through that process, and we talked about the difference this makes. You literally walk through the door into treatment, there is strong encouragement to do it, and it is working.  These are the kinds of things that are going to make a difference in our communities. It seems to be common sense, but frankly it is not happening in other places. Programs like these are what are going to help us overcome addiction and are examples of how Federal funds can be used more effectively to leverage, in this case, a lot of private dollars, some State dollars.  Both of these landmark laws--the CARA Act that we talked about and the Cures Act--are providing increased resources to local communities, but this problem is not getting better, it is getting worse.  One of the problems is the availability and the low cost of these highly addictive, even more dangerous drugs coming in. There are synthetic opioids. Fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin on average. It is coming in through[[Page S1247]]the mail. We need to do more to stop it through law enforcement, but we also need to acknowledge that it has been sprinkled in other drugs and is creating a lot of these addiction overdoses and higher rates of death.  The degree of damage this is causing to our communities, our families, our local budgets, and our criminal justice system requires us to take a more aggressive stance, to do more to figure this out. We need to strengthen our resolve. We made progress recently with the bipartisan budget agreement President Trump signed into law just a few weeks ago. We included in there an additional amount of funding--$6 billion over 2 years--to help combat the opioid epidemic. So instead of the $500 million a year and the $260 million a year that I talked about, it would be $3 billion a year and then $3 billion the year after.  I believe that the evidence-based programs we set out in the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act provide a good framework as to how to spend that money effectively. That is why I am pleased to stand here today as we introduce the next stage of this--CARA 2.0--to help provide a framework for how these funds to combat opioid addiction can be spent wisely. It is a roadmap for Congress to build on CARA's successes since becoming law.  The bipartisan CARA 2.0 act is being introduced by Sheldon Whitehouse and me and also by six other colleagues--Senators Shelley Moore Capito, Amy Klobuchar, Dan Sullivan, Maggie Hassan, Bill Cassidy, and Maria Cantwell--a bipartisan group of four Republicans and four Democrats who are passionate about this issue. It authorizes $1 billion a year for specific evidence-based drug prevention, education, treatment, and recovery programs.  It is very important to have this $6 billion of funding over the next couple of years. We need it. But we have to be sure it is spent wisely. It is not a matter of just throwing money at a problem; it is a matter of being sure we are effectively addressing the real issues.  As I mentioned earlier, the longer term recovery programs are what really help those gripped by addiction to overcome this disease. That is evidence that we have. I have certainly seen a lot of evidence of that firsthand and countless examples of this, where this longer term recovery and the support networks are what get people back on track, back with their families, back to work. We need to expand access to them to those communities that are in need and give everyone a second chance of living up to their own God-given potential. That is why, in this new CARA 2.0, we increase funding for recovery.  In addition to expanding the reach of CARA's evidence-based programs, this bill puts in place new policy reforms to strengthen the government's response in so many ways. We take what some would consider a pretty dramatic step by limiting opioid prescriptions to 3 days for acute pain. Some will push back against that, but this is based on good evidence and good research. When someone goes in for a simple procedure--say, a wisdom tooth extraction--and that young person is given a bottle of opioids when he or she leaves, too often, that leads to addiction. I don't want more parents coming up to me and saying: My kid, when he or she was a teenager, was given these opioids by a doctor or a dentist, so we thought they were safe. Our child then turned to heroin because the pills became too expensive and less accessible and then turned to fentanyl and overdosed and died.  I have had two such parents from Ohio come to me and tell me their story. You probably know others. We need to ensure that these prescriptions are limited. For those who have chronic pain and those who have cancer, it wouldn't apply. And after those 3 days, you can go back to that doctor and tell them why you need it and explain it.  Experts say that about 80 percent of those who overdose from heroin started on prescription drugs. I am sure the same is true with regard to fentanyl. Four out of five heroin addicts in my State of Ohio who overdosed started on prescription drugs. We do need to deal with this overprescription problem.  By the way, the evidence is that after that fourth day, fifth day, sixth day--that is when you get into the bigger risk of becoming addicted to prescription drugs.  As I mentioned, this epidemic started with an explosion of pain pill use 15 to 20 years ago. We need to stop the addiction at the source, and for most people that begins with prescription drugs. By ensuring that clinicians prescribe the appropriate strength and supply of pain pills for non-life-threatening injuries, we can keep so many more people from becoming addicted.  The bill also includes legislation very similar to that which passed the Senate in 2015 but was dropped out in the House-Senate conference. It is very simple. It requires doctors and pharmacists to use the prescription drug monitoring programs to ensure that we are not overprescribing opioids for certain individuals. That helps us identify where the problems are and to get people into treatment. It also requires States to share data with other States to prevent people from crossing State lines to get prescriptions. One of our big problems in Ohio is people can cross the State lines in West Virginia, Kentucky, or other States and get their prescription filled even though it has already been filled once in Across State lines, we need to have prescription drug monitoring programs that work.  CARA 2.0 is going to help turn the tide of this epidemic. The bill increases Federal funds for specific evidence-based programs to better protect vulnerable groups--including infants, young adults, pregnant and postpartum women, and veterans--as well as resources for community programs, medication-assisted treatment, and first responders.  As the title indicates, it is a comprehensive solution. Every aspect of our communities is affected, so every aspect of our communities needs assistance. The opioid epidemic is one of the most urgent challenges we face as a country.  By the way, ultimately, this crisis is not going to be solved here in Washington, It is not going to be solved by legislation we pass here. We get that. It is going to be solved in our communities. It is going to be solved in our families. It is going to be solved in our hearts. But this is a national crisis, and the national government needs to be a much better partner with State government, local government, communities, and nonprofits--those who are out there doing the hard work.  The $6 billion commitment over the next 2 years is a real opportunity to help turn the tide--not by just throwing more money at the problem but by being sure that money is well spent on an epidemic that is taking too many lives and devastating too many communities.  CARA 2.0 will build on our accomplishments and continue to give communities the resources they need to address this issue. Yes, we have made some progress around here, and that is good, but we need to do much more. CARA 2.0 gives us that opportunity. It represents the next step toward helping our communities address this epidemic and helping our communities heal.  Thank you.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2018-02-27-pt1-PgS1245.txt,924,HONORING THE LIFE OF BRIAN FRASER,2018.0,27.0,February

Eddie first made his way into Chicago's collective heart as a member of the 1984 U.Olympic Hockey Team at the young age of 17. From there, he went on to play 16 seasons in the NHL and later coached the Pittsburgh In 2012, Eddie was inducted into the U.Hockey Hall of  Eddie currently works as a broadcaster for both the Blackhawks and nationally as a color commentator for NBC He is the best in the business. Those outside of Chicago may know Eddie from his time covering horse racing for  Today, Eddie is facing another battle. This one is off the ice. Last year, he was diagnosed with colon cancer. As he describes it, sometime last summer, he began feeling pain in his lower abdomen. Initially, the pain was intermittent and he thought nothing of it. But when it persisted for several days, he decided he should get things checked out. It was then that his doctor found a tumor, and he was quickly scheduled for surgery to have it removed. For the past 6 months, Eddie's been undergoing chemotherapy, and he just completed[[Page H1270]]his 11th treatment. Thankfully, he has one more treatment to go.  Clearly, Eddie knows what it means to be tough. But to really be tough, men in particular must know that it is okay to say something when things don't feel right.  The American Cancer Society estimates that 1 in 22 men and 1 in 24 women are at risk for developing colorectal cancer in their lifetime.  Colorectal cancer is currently the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United In 2017, it is expected to cause over 50,000 deaths. That is particularly important for men who don't want to consider the dangers of colon cancer. This doesn't have to be. When detected early, treatment for colorectal cancer is effective, especially when polyps are removed before they become cancerous.  More young men are being diagnosed with young-onset colorectal cancer than ever before. According to the Colorectal Cancer Alliance, 11 percent of colon cancers and 18 percent of rectal cancer diagnoses occur in those under the age of 50.  Young men, even those in their thirties and forties, must be aware of the risk for this disease and advocate for their health. Talk to your doctor regularly if you are feeling pain, and get screened regularly.  Back in his playing days, Eddie would have been nervous about what a coach or teammate would have thought if he complained of pain. But, in part, to voices like his, the sports culture is changing and more athletes are speaking up when something is wrong. We should all learn from his and their example.  After he was diagnosed, Eddie felt like his pride took a hit. Like many others who have faced cancer, he was concerned that he was letting people down and he began to question his mortality. But as he went through treatment and reflected on this ordeal, he started to recognize that it was okay to be scared.  He has used this platform to speak out about colon cancer, about the need for screening, and for research for a cure. He knows it is important to emphasize that there is nothing wrong with people getting colonoscopies at an earlier age. He knows that if he can help just one individual get a checkup sooner, he will feel like his battle was worth it.  Eddie has many people to thank for their support; most importantly, his family: his wife, Diana; and four children, Eddie, Nick, Zandra, and Tom; the entire Blackhawk organization, especially John McDonough and Jay Blunk; his broadcasting partner, Pat  To Eddie and to all fighting cancer, stay strong and know that we are with you.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-27-pt1-PgH1269-5.txt,1967,TRIBUTE TO DONALD GUIMOND,2018.0,27.0,April

965,topic-id,783,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of 772, the AMBER Alert in Indian Country I strongly favor this important legislation because it will provide Indian Tribes with the ability to respond quickly to child abductions, thereby increasing the chances that we can avert catastrophe.  Through the grant program reauthorized by 772, Tribal law enforcement agencies would develop the capacity to immediately initiate their own AMBER Alerts and allow Tribal alert systems to be integrated with the more advanced AMBER Alert communications plans of State and regional law enforcement.  The AMBER Alert program is a powerful tool that engages geographically targeted networks of law enforcement, broadcast and transparency agencies, digital signage companies, internet service providers, and the wireless industry to issue urgent notifications in[[Page H1234]]the most serious cases of child abduction. Such alerts can instantly galvanize an entire community in the search for an abducted and endangered child.  From its inception through January of 2018, the AMBER Alert program has directly led to the rescue of more than 900 children. Presently, the AMBER Alert program is used in all 50 States, here in the District of Columbia, in Puerto Rico, and the U.Virgin  AMBER Alert systems have evolved to utilize all available technology in notifying the public of a child abduction. Native American Tribal communities, however, are unable to take full advantage of this lifesaving program. Currently, Tribal law enforcement must rely on State or regional law enforcement agencies off-reservation to issue the complete AMBER Alert on their behalf. This is unfortunate, and indeed it is notable because the rate of child abduction is reportedly down across the country with the sole exception of Indian  As we all know, time is of the essence when a child is abducted or goes missing. AMBER Alert plans provide comprehensive, rapid-response system, which is critical to success in such cases. Statistics show that roughly 74 percent of abducted children who are murdered are killed within the first 3 hours of their abduction.  The time spent to coordinate with State or regional law enforcement before issuing an AMBER Alert can be lengthy and can have a dire consequence.  In 2003, the PROTECT Act established a grant program to be administered by the attorney general for the States, with the goals of strengthening AMBER Alert communications plans nationwide and developing a seamless network through the Nation, which dramatically increases the likelihood that abducted children will be recovered swiftly and safely.  772 would reauthorize $10 million for the program and would make Indian Tribal communities eligible to receive grant funds for the very first time. With this funding, Tribes will be able to develop and implement AMBER Alert communications plans of their own, and also integrate their AMBER Alert systems into and with State and regional communications plans.  Awarded funds may also be used for education, training, and law enforcement tools and equipment related to the AMBER Alert plans.  If enacted, this legislation will help build a truly national and cohesive network of AMBER Alert systems. Tribal law enforcement will have the ability to directly issue AMBER Alerts without having to rely on outside law enforcement, while outside agencies will be available to fill in any gaps when necessary through the improved coordination.  Mr.Speaker, accordingly, I encourage my colleagues to join us in supporting this crucial piece of bipartisan legislation.  772 was introduced in response to a fatal abduction that occurred on the Navajo Nation in New Eleven-year-old Ashlynne Mike was kidnapped after school, along with her brother. Her brother escaped, and, alas, she did not.  That case focused attention on gaps in communication and coordination between Tribal and off-reservation law enforcement.  In the past, the Navajo Tribe has relied on New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah to activate AMBER Before an alert issued, Tribal officers have been required to meet a list of requirements to establish a case. If the criteria are met, the officers may only then begin the process of requesting States to issue the AMBER  Based on several accounts of this case, the AMBER Alert was issued 10 or more hours after Ashlynne was abducted.  Her abductor confessed to brutalizing her and leaving her alive to fend for herself in the desert. It was too late for Ashlynne when she was found dead a day later.  Children are precious to us, and they deserve our protection wherever they may live, either on reservations or off reservations.  Mr.Speaker, because we should do everything that we can to ensure that appropriate resources are allocated to efforts to recover missing or abducted children, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

1455,topic-id,4020,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to give the first of several speeches on Russia's hybrid warfare operations against the Today, I want to highlight one aspect of this ongoing destabilization effort: the Kremlin's malign financial influence.  It is clear we need a whole-of-government approach and a comprehensive strategy to counter Russian aggression. A particular focus should be devoted to reducing secrecy in our financial system. It is a simple fact: Bad actors need money to conduct their activities. Yet our current financial system's opaqueness serves the interests of malevolent forces.  Greater transparency will make it harder for the Kremlin and its cronies to exert malign financial influence on our shores. The lack of transparency in our system is problematic for our banks here at home. The global nature of our financial system means that foreign actors can take advantage of our institutions for their own gain, which has implications for our national security.  I have looked at this issue through the lens of my work as ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, as well as my service on the Banking Committee and the Select Committee on Money laundering and other financial crimes are among the tools deployed by Russia as part of the Kremlin's larger influence campaign, which has been used against the United States and our allies and partners to advance the strategic and political goals of These activities are being used as weapons which threaten U.national security.  The Kremlin's use of malign financial influence is subtle and is part of a larger, coordinated operation of hybrid aggression by the Kremlin using a broad spectrum of military and nonmilitary tools at its disposal. Russia recognizes that, for now, its military capabilities are limited relative to the United States and NATO, and it will seek to avoid a direct military conflict with the Instead, Russia deploys tactics that leverage its strengths and exploit our systematic vulnerabilities.  As laid out in the Russian National Security Strategy of 2015, the Kremlin's approach to conflict includes weaponizing tools and resources from across government and society. The Russian strategy states: ``Interrelated political, military, military-technical, diplomatic, economic, informational, and other measures are being developed and implemented in order to ensure strategic deterrence and the prevention of armed conflicts.''  This describes what may be called a Russian ``hybrid'' approach to confrontation below the threshold of direct armed conflict, a method that has been developing and escalating since the earliest days of Putin's rise to power in The main tenets of the Kremlin's hybrid operations are: information operation with cyber tools--which people commonly think of as hacking--propaganda and disinformation, manipulation of social media, and malign influence, which can be deployed through political or financial channels.  As a nation, we are beginning to unpack what happened in the 2016 Presidential election with respect to certain aspects of Russian hybrid operations. For example, we are learning how the Russians combined hacking operations with the release of information timed for maximum political damage. We have also learned more about Russia's manipulation of social media with Kremlin-linked cyber armies. But we have yet to understand the depths of how the Kremlin has used money as a weapon and how it has harmed our national security and our democracy. For this aspect of its hybrid arsenal, Russia is using money as a tool of warfare to exploit the vulnerabilities of our democratic institutions to its advantage.  The Russian system of corrupt financial influence rests on Putin's domestic power structure. The Putin regime is fundamentally a kleptocracy, which is a system where corrupt leaders use their power to exploit their country's people and natural resources in order to extend their personal wealth and personal power. Putin has systemically fostered kleptocratic conditions by exploiting state funds and resources to reward a group of close associates, commonly referred to as oligarchs. Many of these associates have a personal connection to Putin and have gained their positions of power or fortune due to their relationship with him. Often these political and personal relationships were forged in childhood, early adulthood, or during Putin's days in the KGB and the Petersburg government.  In exchange for wealth, privilege, and often impunity, this group of Putin's cronies are readily deployed to act on behalf of Kremlin interests. As Russian scholar and journalist Joshua Yaffa detailed, ``Oligarchs finance the `black ledger,' . . . money that does not go through the budget but is needed by the state, to finance elections and support local political figures, for example.' Funds leave the state budget as procurement orders, and come back as off the books cash, to be spent however the Kremlin sees fit.''  Russia's kleptocratic system reinforces Putin's power in several ways. First, he controls who profits from state coffers, making the recipients of state largess indebted to him. Second, he can outsource projects of financial influence, which provides him with access to private wealth streams and gives him plausible deniability if the projects have a nefarious aspect. Finally, this system allows Putin to ensnare oligarchs who may have enriched themselves through a corrupt deal or committed crimes that were state-sanctioned.  Not only has Putin been able to use corruption to protect his power base at home, but he has then exported his kleptocratic system as part of his arsenal of hybrid warfare. The Kremlin has studied the gaps in Western society and leverages the oligarchs' wealth through the system of power Putin created, to buy our influence, distort our markets, and warp our democratic institutions.[[Page S1269]]  As the Center for Strategic and International Studies report, ``The Kremlin Playbook,'' notes, ``Corruption is the lubricant on which this system operates, concentrating the exploitation of the state resources to further Russia's networks of influence.'' A byproduct of this malign financial influence is the use of ill-gotten gains to further fuel the cycle of corruption and fund other aspects of the Kremlin's hybrid aggression.  As I mentioned, Putin and his inner circle often deploy these financial influence tactics through an oligarch. These intermediaries are not officially affiliated with the government and appear to operate independently, which makes them harder to detect and gives the Kremlin plausible deniability.  In conventional warfare, the tools of war are implements of physical destruction, but under Putin's tactics of financial malign influence the tools are the same as any large-scale criminal organization: offshore tax havens and banking centers, shell companies, money laundering, with the addition of Russian majority-owned state banks.  Russian malign financial influence and the proceeds from this activity are harming our national security and corrupting our democratic institutions. As described in ``The Kremlin Playbook,'' ``The mechanisms of Russian influence are designed to thrive in Western democracies because they use Western rules and institutions and exploit their systematic weaknesses.''  And these tactics appear to be updated versions of similar tools used against us in the past. As Russian expert Brian Whitmore wrote, ``In many ways, Russian corruption is the new Soviet communism. The Kremlin's black cash is the new red menace.''  He further described this threat as ``a web of opaque front corporations, murky energy deals and complex money laundering schemes which ensnare foreign elites and form a ready-made Kremlin lobby.''  Let's think about that for a second. The Kremlin is buying off foreigners to do its bidding within its own societies. And the way they are buying influence is obscured through exploiting Western banking laws and international financial systems. We have no way of knowing whom this money is going to or what it is buying. Russia is using our blind spot to advance their political and strategic goals and, in the process, corrupt and warp our institutions from within.  Let's take a look at how they are doing it. One way the Kremlin is asserting malign financial influence is through personal relationships, established by oligarchs or through other Kremlin-linked business executives. As Vice President Biden and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Carpenter warned in a recent article in Foreign Affairs, this arrangement ``gives the Kremlin enormous leverage over wealthy Russians who do business in the West and over Western companies that do business in Moscow can ask (or pressure) such businesspeople and companies to help finance its subversion of political processes elsewhere.''  One oligarch who used this method is Oleg Deripaska has been a close Putin ally for decades. Deripaska is transparent about how his wealth was deployed as a tool for the Kremlin, stating:       If the state says we need to give it up, we'll give it up.      I don't separate myself from the state. I have no other      interests.  He served as the benefactor for a variety of political activities that advanced Kremlin interests. According to the Wall Street Journal, this financial backing included paying Paul Manafort, who later became Trump's campaign manager, $10 million a year to advance Kremlin interests in Ukraine, Georgia, and Investigations from NBC News and the New York Times found that Deripaska fronted Manafort an estimated $60 million for other business ventures and loans, moving the funds through shell companies in Cypress and the Cayman  A second way these influence activities can be deployed is through Russian majority state-owned banks. These banks do not function like the ones we deal with every day. In fact, these banks often don't care about making profits at all. Instead, they are using money as a weapon of influence, to advance the Russian state or enrich people who may ultimately advance the Kremlin's aims.  An example is the Vnesheconombank, commonly known as The U.Treasury Department described VEB as a ``payment agent for the Russian government.'' This bank is essentially controlled by Putin's inner circle as the President picks the chairman and the Prime Minister sits on its supervisory board. Foreign Policy journalist Elias Groll deemed the bank ``a precision-guided diplomatic weapon.'' As such, VEB has taken on a range of projects with one common goal--to advance Kremlin interests. VEB financed a large share of the $50 billion Sochi Olympics, attempted to shore up the troubled Ukrainian steel industry, and underwrote the losses of key Putin cronies whose financial interests were hurt by U.and EU sanctions.  VEB is under sanctions for its role in financing Kremlin aggression against Crimea and eastern VEB garnered headlines because it was used as a cover for a spying ring with efforts to recruit people such as Carter Page, who later became a Trump campaign associate. According to the Department of Justice, conversations recorded between these Russian spies reveal that they saw tactics of financial influence as a way to gain Page's cooperation. In addition, VEB Chairman Sergey Gorkov, a close Putin ally, met with Jared Kushner in December 2016, while VEB remained under sanctions. While the Trump administration said that the meeting was in Kushner's capacity as an incoming government official, a spokesman for Putin said that it was for business reasons. This bank is losing billions of dollars funding projects of political and strategic value to the Kremlin, bailing out oligarchs and being used as cover for spies. These activities don't match with those of a ``normal bank.''  Another tool of Russian financial influence is offshore banking centers or tax havens, which refers to financial institutions in a place that is different from where the depositor lives. Usually this is done for the financial and legal advantages the location provides, including secrecy and little or no taxation. The Russians have used these centers to facilitate the movement of money out of Once money finds a home in an offshore banking center, it can be relabeled as ``foreign'' and then can move back to Russia or to a third destination with the origin and ownership of the funds obscured.  The Panama Papers--a leak of over 11 million files from one of the world's largest offshore law firms--showed that between 2007 and 2013, nearly $2 billion had been funneled through offshore accounts to those in Putin's inner circle. Top centers for Russian offshore banking include Cyprus, the Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands, Switzerland, and Russian experts, Michael Weiss and Peter Pomerantsev, noted: ``These destinations, prized for their secrecy laws and tax havens, often make cameos whenever Russian corruption scandals are exposed in the international press.''  Cypress became a particularly important haven for the Kremlin after the United States and the European Union issued sanctions against Russia for its aggression in Crimea and eastern Cyprus provided a haven for Russian oligarchs and others from Putin's inner circle to keep their money safe from sanctions and served as a launching point for the money to be used to finance further malign influence activities.  Often the Kremlin and Kremlin-linked actors utilize offshore tax havens and shell companies together. Shell companies are legal entities that generally have no physical assets or operations and may be used solely to hold property rights or financial assets. Russia has exploited these shell companies as a tool to obscure true ownership, fund shady deals, launder ill-gotten gains, and further the cycle of corruption.  One Kremlin-linked money laundering operation, commonly referred to as the laundromat, moved an estimated $20 billion out of Russia through Eastern Europe and then to banks around the world. The Russian journalists who uncovered the scheme found that the beneficiaries were Russian business executives who had state contracts with Russian Government or government-owned entities worth the equivalent of hundreds of millions of U.dollars.[[Page S1270]]The money was laundered by 21 shell companies based in the United Kingdom, Cypress, and New  While it is easy to dismiss this as a problem that occurs in other countries rather than our own, Kremlin and Kremlin-linked actors are also exploiting our own laws in the United States to deploy these tools of financial influence. They are taking advantage of laws that do not require disclosure of who really owns a company or whose money is really funding these entities. They are taking advantage of the secrecy permitted in our system to continue their corrupt practices and intertwine their money into our systems.  As Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Day testified at a recent Banking Committee hearing, ``the pervasive use of front companies, shell companies, nominees and other means to conceal the beneficial owners of assets is one of the great loopholes'' in the anti-money laundering regime of the United Similarly, the 2015 Treasury Department's National Money Laundering Risk Assessment estimates that $300 billion is generated annually in illicit proceeds of the United States and cites shell companies as a means to move these funds into our domestic banking system.  The global, interconnected nature of our financial system has also been manipulated by Kremlin-linked actors to hold or move illicit funds and launder their ill-gotten gains across the In one prime example, Deutsche Bank was revealed to be helping Russian clients illegally launder $10 billion between 2011 and 2015 in a mirror-trading scheme in which rubles were surreptitiously converted into dollars. This scheme would begin with Deutsche Bank's Moscow branch buying Russian stocks in rubles. Shortly after, sometimes on the same day, a related party would sell the same Russian stock in the same quantity and at the same price through Deutsche Bank's London office, but in dollars.  The New York State Department of Financial Services found that the parties doing the buying or selling were closely related to both sides such as through common ownership and that none of the trades demonstrated any legitimate economic rationale. The New York State Department of Financial Services concluded: ``By converting rubles into dollars through security trades that had no discernible purpose, the scheme was a means for bad actors within a financial institution to achieve improper ends while evading compliance with applicable laws.'' Deutsche Bank paid $425 million to New York State in fines and an additional $204 million to U.regulators for this money laundering scheme.  Kremlin-linked actors have also used real estate to launder illicit Russian funds in the United States and elsewhere. Often the purchase of real estate is done through an intermediary, which both obscures the true ownership of the property and hides the origin of the funds. These purchases are often all-cash deals, which is particularly problematic to trace and cut banks out of the process, which removes a crucial layer of oversight. Indeed, FinCEN, the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, called out all-cash real estate deals in August of 2017 as an area of particular concern due to its lack of anti-money laundering protections.  One recent example of using all-cash real estate as a means to launder funds is the case of the Russian firm Prevezon is a firm owned by Denis Katsyv, the son of the former Kremlin Transportation Minister and a key Putin ally. Prevezon was charged by the Justice Department in connection with laundering the proceeds of an elaborate $230 million tax refund fraud scheme, including buying real estate in Manhattan with some of the profits from this scheme.  As described, these tactics of financial influence, part of the Kremlin's hybrid arsenal, have a corrupting and destabilizing effect on our democracies. Beyond the tactic itself, which is deployed to advance Kremlin aims, the ill-gotten gains created from these tactics continue to serve to concentrate Putin's hold on power and fund other aspects of Russian hybrid warfare operations.  Profits gained from tactics of financial influence have underwritten the following malign activities: raising private militias to fight in Ukraine and Syria; assisting Russian military intelligence with conducting signals intelligence operations and other specialized technology and training against the United States in the 2016 election; funding troll operations that manipulate social media platforms in information operations against us and our allies; paying construction costs for a bridge between Crimea and the Russian mainland, which, once completed, will help the Kremlin to solidify its illegal annexation of  The common link through all of these tools is secrecy. Putin and his kleptocratic system thrives on secrecy and on hybrid operations that blur the lines between legitimate economic activity and corruption, and between conflict and cooperation.  We need to take a serious look at how our government is organized to counter Kremlin hybrid operations in their totality. But one thing is for certain; we need to reduce secrecy in our banking system, which leaves us more vulnerable to the manipulation of our free market system by the Kremlin and Kremlin-linked actors.  We are getting a reputation around the world as a place to go if you want to hide money. This is contrary to both American values and the traditional role of the United States as the enforcer of international norms.  Starting in May of this year, many financial institutions will have to collect and verify the identity of the beneficial owners of companies at the time of an account opening as a result of Treasury's customer due diligence rule. While this is a start, we need to go further and pierce the veil of secrecy that has shrouded our system. We heard testimony in the Banking Committee on ways to improve U.disclosure requirements, including requiring disclosure of all beneficial owners, regardless of ownership stake.  I applaud those who have already been thinking about this issue. This includes recommendations, put out earlier this month by the Center for American Progress, that call for concrete reforms, including curbing abuses of shell companies, increasing FinCEN's budget, and amending portions of the Bank Secrecy Act and Money Laundering Control Act in a way that would provide greater transparency and regulation regarding the sale of real estate.  There are also legislative fixes that have been proposed in the I appreciate that my colleagues Senators Whitehouse, Feinstein, and Grassley have introduced legislation, the True Incorporation Transparency for Law Enforcement I also recognize my colleagues Senators Wyden and Rubio for introducing the Corporate Transparency Act in the I know similar efforts have been made in the House of  I intend to take a close look at these legislative proposals but the key, in my opinion, is making sure that we are able to trace these shell companies back to who is specifically benefiting and directing them; that is, any serious effort to determine ownership must stop only when a specific individual or individuals have been identified. Too often we take one step and find another shell company and stop right there. That doesn't lead us to anyone. We have to find the individuals who are benefiting from and directing these activities.  The use of these shell companies, as I have said repeatedly throughout my comments, has a real effect on our national security. As the Special Counsel indictment against what is commonly called the ``troll factory'' shows, close Putin ally Yevgeny Prigohzin was funding an organization conducting what it called ``information warfare against the United States.'' Prigohzin used 14 affiliated shell companies to fund this operation as a way to hide the true source of funds. Without the full investigatory power and subpoena power of the Special Counsel's office, we probably would not have uncovered the true ownership behind this operation. The Kremlin designs it that way, and we can't let them keep getting away with it.  Part and parcel with exposing beneficial ownership would be to stand up an interagency task force led by FinCEN to follow the flow of illicit Russian money into the United This task force should leverage the intelligence community, the State Department, and other relevant government agencies to take a comprehensive[[Page S1271]]approach to uncovering where the money is going and how these ill-gotten gains are being spent. Remaining passive and waiting, is not going to deter, disrupt, and finally defeat these deliberate Russian efforts to undermine our basic institutions.  I will continue to work with my colleagues on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, the Armed Services Committee, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and others to ensure that our national security apparatus has the requisite authorities.  What we need now is initiative by the administration to fully resource and to direct a comprehensive approach to detect, disrupt, and prevent this Russian interference. We need to put the appropriate resources against this threat. The heart of our democracy--our election process--was attacked by the As we learned yesterday from Admiral Rogers of Cyber Command, it is under attack as we speak today, and we can expect the attacks against the 2018 election cycle to increase with both frequency, boldness, and, unfortunately, effectiveness if we remain passive--indeed, paralyzed--as we are today. We have to recognize that the money that is being generated through these malign financial activities is being used not only to enrich Putin and his cronies but is being used to attack the United States very effectively. Putin has exploited our own laws that favor financial secrecy and has used clandestine tactics to his advantage at a relatively inexpensive cost.  Increasing, for example, resources to FinCEN in the Treasury Department or standing up and funding a task force, as I described, and devoting the necessary resources to tracing shell companies back to the people responsible would be a small fraction of what it would cost to use conventional forces to deter Russian aggression. Indeed, deploying a combat team to the Baltics is more expensive, I would suspect, than setting up a team of experts here in Washington that will go after these funding streams, and without the money, they cannot conduct their operations.  Mr.President, we often hear the expression ``follow the money'' as a way to identify the cause of a problem, and that is true here. Today, we know that our democracy and many others are under attack by the Government of Responding to this reality will require a comprehensive strategy to counter Russian asymmetric and hybrid tactics. However, as I laid out, an immediate step we can take is a concerted effort to bring greater transparency to our financial system. If we fail to do so, we will continue to have that very secrecy used against our national security interests and the interests of all of our allies.  Now is the time to act. We are being attacked. To sit back and absorb the punches will lead only to defeat, not to a final victory over our adversaries.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-28-pt1-PgS1268.txt,1982,EXPANSION OF CHICAGO O'HARE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT,2018.0,28.0,March
1048,topic-id,746,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for, once again, leading the Congressional Black Caucus's Special Order hour, where we get to address the American people and talk directly to the American people about what it is that is going on in Congress, what we would like to do.  Tonight is a very somber but important Special Order hour. We are talking about protecting American lives. It would not be Black History Month without a quote from Martin Luther King, a Morehouse graduate. He says: ``At some point, silence becomes betrayal.''  I want us to just think about that: silence becomes betrayal. When it comes to our communities being inundated with guns, this Congress has been far too silent. In fact, what we do is just take moments of silence, one after another, whether it is Virginia Tech, moment of silence; Sandy Hook, moment of silence; Pulse nightclub, moment of silence; First Baptist Church, moment of silence; Las Vegas, moment of silence; Mother Emanuel, moment of silence.  So far in 2018, we have already seen 8,200 incidents of gun violence in America, including 34 mass shootings. These acts of violence have taken more than 2,200 lives. That is 2,200 families affected by gun violence.  I would just say that it is time for Congress to do something, at least have the debate, but we ought not become coconspirators with the crimes that are being committed across this country.  I know that many people will say: Hey, you all are in Congress, you all deal in theory. We deal in reality. Banning assault weapons wouldn't have kept this kid from being able to buy an AR-15.  Well, let me just tell you, that is not true.  An AR-15 from the store ranges about $500 and $600. A kid could probably get $500 or $600, but during the days of the assault weapons ban, those guns, the street value became three times as much. So that means that $600 gun that he bought would have been $1,800. The question is whether he would have had access to get to that $1,800, whether good common sense would have prevailed before he got to $1,800, whether somebody would have caught on to his plan while he tried to get $1,800.  At some point, we can't not do anything because we say it wouldn't have made a difference.  The one thing I will say is it is amazing to see these young people rise up and speak out with one voice that they want something done.  It is a sad day in America when our seniors can't go to church without fear[[Page H1253]]of gun violence, when families can't go to the movies because of fear of gun violence, and when children can't go to school because of fear of gun violence.  We as a Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have an obligation to this country to make sure that we protect people who are vulnerable. I don't think it is too much to ask for both sides to come together and ignore the will of the National Rifle Association, but to listen to the people in our country who are demanding that we do something.  When we start talking about background checks, assault rifles, high-capacity cartridges that go in these guns which allow people to shoot large amounts of people in a very short order of time, those guns--let's just be clear, and I want Congressman Evans to understand what we are talking about: nobody is talking about ending the Second The right to bear arms is as fundamental and as protected as anything else in this country. However, when we start talking about AR-15s and these assault weapons and these automatic things, we are talking about weapons of mass destruction.  We went to Afghanistan looking for weapons of mass destruction, when they are right here in this country. We don't have to go to Iraq, we don't have to go to If you are looking for weapons of mass destruction, they are sold in our sporting goods shops all across this country, and they are being used to slaughter American citizens.  So I would just ask, in closing, that at some point, silence is betrayal. As for me, because of my conviction, because of my conscience, and because I don't lack any courage, I will not be silent.  I would just urge this body that we can't be silent anymore as weapons of mass destruction destroy our communities.  ",CREC-2018-02-26-pt1-PgH1251-2.txt,2023,KENNA JR.

Well, joy is not going to come in the morning if the same thing keeps happening and Congress will not do anything about it, because that means those lives were lost in vain, and that is just as big a sin, in my estimation. I just think that we have to do something about it.  It is one thing when the cameras are there and the family has the support at the funeral of all these people, the Congressperson comes, family comes, and says, ``Oh, we are going to be with you, and we are going to support you and pray for you during this time,'' but at the end of the day, that mother and father goes back to that house, and that kid's room is empty.  There are no words of comfort that we can give to that family when they walk by that room every night and it is empty because we let somebody with mental issues get their hands on an AR-15 and slaughter a bunch of kids in school.

949,topic-id,658,"Mr.President, setting out to start a small business in America is not for the faint of heart. In many cases, it takes a great deal of self-sufficiency and perseverance, and, for most, success does not come easily. Success is often built through years of hard work, sacrifice, and dedication.  Today, I would like to recognize a small business from my home State of Idaho that exemplifies these very traits. As chairman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am proud to recognize a Grangeville, ID, small business, Advanced Welding and Steel, as the Small Business of the Month for February 2018. This small business demonstrates a dedication to producing quality goods while providing a unique service. Their story reminds us that, with hard work and dedication, Americans can accomplish almost anything to which they set their minds. With over 20 years in business, Advanced Welding and Steel has served as a great example of the determined entrepreneurial spirit found all across  Advanced Welding and Steel's story is the quintessential story of American entrepreneurship. Ryan Uhlenkott grew up in a hard-working entrepreneurial family. He learned valuable traits such as a strong work ethic, timeliness, and honesty while working on the family farm, splitting wood for the winter, and helping out at the family water well drilling business. While a college student, he worked part time sweeping floors in a welding shop, which led to a full-time welding job.[[Page S1239]]Before he set out on his own, Ryan gained experience in a variety of positions across the fabrication industry, including as a crane operator, planner, mapper, welder, erecter, and fabricator. After receiving certifications in boiler and pipe welding, he decided to introduce his own approach to fabrication. He drew upon his knowledge, experience, and his innate entrepreneurial mindset in 1998, when he founded Advanced Welding and Ryan started out with one welder mounted on the back of a pickup truck. The company quickly grew in both employees and capacity, going from a 6,000-square-foot shop in 2003 to the current state-of-the-art 60,000-square-foot shop with paint booths, shot blasters, and a railings shop. A major motivating factor in starting his own business was Ryan's desire to spend more time with his family. To this day, he considers his family and his employees' families to be the center of his business model.  Today, Advanced Welding and Steel delivers its products across the western United States, including Alaska and The company's attention to detail in its processes of estimating, detailing, and project management has turned the small business into one of the most respected fabricators in the region. A team of 15 highly qualified professionals work at the company, and over the years, they estimate that they have delivered over 15 million pounds of steel to their customers. Their hard work resulted in Advanced Welding and Steel being recognized in the July 2017 edition of Modern Steel Construction for their outstanding work as the prime fabricator for the new student center at Gonzaga University in Spokane, The company is committed to excellence in their craft and also to the sustainable use of their products, as over 90 percent of the steel they work with has been recycled, adding to the overwhelmingly positive impact they bring to local Idaho communities.  The hard-working team members of Advanced Welding and Steel have decades of experience in multiple fields within the steel industry. Through their commitment to their customers, Ryan's team provides an excellent product with exceptional service, and they make a sizable impact in the local and national fabricating industry. They ensure that their projects are well planned and seamlessly executed. The State of Idaho is proud to be a home for small businesses like them who go above and beyond in pursuit of the American dream.  I extend my sincerest congratulations to Ryan Uhlenkott, his family, and the entire team at Advanced Welding and I look forward to watching your continued growth and success.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-27-pt1-PgS1238-4.txt,1896,REMEMBERING MAURY DUANE GEIGER,2018.0,27.0,April

It has been sobering, to say the least, to hear some of the personal accounts of sex trafficking victims, and several from my home State of Alabama.[[Page H1291]]  It is our responsibility to provide justice for these victims and to do everything we can to protect the most vulnerable members of our society from trafficking. This is modern-day slavery.  As it stands now, the sad truth is that criminals can easily and anonymously purchase women and children on the internet using various websites.  Thanks to broad interpretation of existing law, specifically section 230 in America's courts, these websites are, essentially, immune from State and local prosecutions. These websites make millions by enabling sex trafficking while facing very little risk of being punished for these crimes.  The bill we are considering today would change that by amending this law to ensure that websites that unlawfully contribute to the exploitation of sex trafficking victims are no longer immune to punishment.  H.1865 will finally hold bad actor websites accountable for these unspeakable wrongdoings.

Mr.Speaker, I wish to also thank the staff of the Financial Services Committee in the work they have taken on behalf of the people of this country.  Mr.Speaker, as some of you may know, the Financial Services Committee has been operating at a breakneck speed in the 115th In fact, we have had Financial Services bills on the floor 17 of the last 18 weeks that the House has been in session.  I am proud to highlight that the majority of these bills have been passed out of this Chamber by strong bipartisan majorities.  Throughout this process, we have demonstrated that the House can find bipartisan agreement on commonsense measures that will benefit our constituents.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill that continues this streak of bipartisanship in the service of Americans back home, H.4061, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement  My good friend from Maryland, Congressman  John Delaney, and I have been working this bill for nearly 5 years, with the shared goal of improving resiliency of our financial system, while protecting Americans from costly and unnecessary regulations that create barriers to achieving their financial goals.  By codifying procedures to increase the transparency of the nonbank systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, designation process, and providing a chance for nonbank firms to work with their primary regulators to reduce risks prior to designation, our legislation achieves this goal.  Mr.Speaker, we must be clear that simply designating more companies as systemically important financial institutions does not make our system safer. That is especially true for nonbank firms, like asset managers and insurers, that don't fit well into the bank-centered regulatory regime for  Handing down a SIFI designation to a nonbank financial firm is like using a sledgehammer to catch a butterfly. Not only are you unlikely to succeed, but you are also likely to destroy the very thing you set out to protect.  After all, it is the family saving for the downpayment on a home or retirement or the children's education that suffer when FSOC uses a heavy-handed regulation of last resort as the primary line of defense against threats to our economy.  The American Action Forum has found that additional capital requirements resulting from a SIFI designation of asset management firms could cost American retirees at least $100,000 in potential savings over the lifetime of their investment. That is significant.  That is why these reforms included in H.4061 are critical to the more than 90 million investors who rely on the services of asset managers to achieve their most important financial goals.                              {time}  1545  To be sure, FSOC has begun to recognize the benefits of providing increased transparency and, in 2015, FSOC made welcome reforms to improve the nonbank SIFI designation process. Many of these are codified in this bill.  Importantly, our legislation will also give FSOC the authority it needs to work with primary regulators who have institutional knowledge, skill, and experience overseeing nonbank firms to address threats to our economy without jeopardizing our constituents' financial opportunities.  After 8 years, if we don't take steps to address the obvious shortcomings of FSOC, like the nonbank designation process, the regulator intended to protect the financial stability could very well become the liability.  Again, I am proud to have worked with my colleague and friend,  John Delaney, on this great bill, and I appreciate the support of Chairman Hensarling in moving it through committee and now onto the House floor.  This bill does have 58 original cosponsors--29 Democrats, 29 It passed out of the Financial Services Committee 45-10. Our legislation demonstrates that there can be broad bipartisan support for increased transparency of the FSOC SIFI designation.  I believe we can do even more, and I welcome the opportunity to work with my colleagues on additional bipartisan reforms beyond those we are considering today to better address systemic risk by firming up the cooperative relationship between FSOC and the primary regulator to ensure substantive engagement that can result in swift resolution of FSOC's concerns prior to all SIFI designations.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  ",CREC-2018-04-11-pt1-PgH3119.txt,2003,REPUBLICAN TAX BILL,2018.0,11.0,February
65,topic-id,317,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.  I rise to express my support for H.4293, the Stress Test Improvement  I also want to commend my colleague Representative Zeldin for his work on this important issue.  Those of us who travel our districts to speak with the men and women who work at financial institutions are well aware of the high costs and lack of clarity in the stress test process. Companies are being forced to dedicate substantial resources and immense amounts of time to go through the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, and the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests,  I have spoken to compliance staff who reported submissions in the tens of thousands of pages. For each dollar or staffer put towards CCAR or DFAST, there are fewer resources being dedicated to innovation or helping customers.  Of course, we all believe that stress tests can and should be useful experiences. Some of the information turned up in stress tests could be helpful, but we are desperately in need to enact meaningful reform to provide better transparency, clarity, and reduce undue burden.  Columbia University Professor Charles Calomiris described the process as one in which ``regulators punish banks for failing to meet standards that are never stated.'' Let me repeat that: ``. . . failing to meet standards that are never stated.'' It is sort of a Kafkaesque creature of our bureaucracy.  Zeldin's bill improves the stress testing process by requiring the Federal Reserve to follow regular notice-and-comment practices and issue clear regulations on economic conditions and methodologies and to assess the effectiveness of the Fed's models. It also alleviates the compliance burden on firms by spacing out CCARs and These are targeted, reasonable reforms that can greatly improve the process. This will enhance, not hurt, financial stability and leave us with a healthier more vibrant economy.  Again, I urge my colleagues to support the Stress Test Improvement  ",CREC-2018-04-11-pt1-PgH3112-3.txt,2158,THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE,2018.0,11.0,February

1027,topic-id,1899,"Mr.President, it was 2 weeks ago yesterday that the tragic incident in Parkland took place--one of many that have impacted our country over the last decade and beyond. That community in Parkland, FL, and the residents of the State of Florida whom I represent--and, frankly, the entire Nation--have demanded not just action but immediate action.  We know--and anyone who watches this process is well aware--that there are deep differences on how far and how much we should restrict the Second Amendment right of every We know there are deep differences about whether some of those proposed restrictions work. I imagine those debates and those differences will not be easily resolved and will continue, but I also know there is widespread support and agreement that we must act now--as soon as possible--to do everything we can to prevent another tragedy like Parkland from happening anywhere else ever again. That is a consensus position. No matter where one falls on this debate, no matter how one feels about how far or how restricted restrictions on gun sales in America should be, no matter what your views are on that, I don't know of anyone who is in favor of school shootings, and I don't know anyone who is in favor of seeing another one happen. There is common ground in that regard.  What I have tried to do, over the last couple of weeks, is undertake efforts to determine what changes in Federal law not only could have prevented this attack but could prevent future ones. In that vein, I have met with State and Federal law enforcement investigators involved not just in this case but in gun laws in general. I have met with students and with teachers from Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School, including two teachers who were injured in the attack. I have met with school board administrators. I have met with the community at large, including an appearance last week at a nationally televised townhall. I have been in contact with several of the parents of the victims who lost their lives. I have also spoken to experts in firearm sales. I have spoken to a number of federally licensed firearm dealers who talked about some of the frustrations they have with our existing law and their inability to address people who ultimately turn out to be individuals who should not own any gun of any kind.  So based on these meetings, based on all of this input, and based on all of the other research that is out there leading up to now, the first thing I want to say is, I actually believe this attack could have and should have been prevented if current law had been fully enforced.  This killer was a well-known danger to the school district. He was a well-known danger to the Broward Sheriff's office. He was a well-known danger to his neighborhood. He was also the subject of two separate and specific warnings to law enforcement agencies: a call to the Broward Sheriff's office last November, a call to an FBI hotline in  In essence, we are always telling people, if you see something, say something. People saw something and people said something and other people saw it as well over a course of time. Yet somehow this deranged and violent individual was able to pass a background check and purchase not 1 but 10 separate firearms, and this deranged and violent individual was ultimately able to walk right into the school a few minutes before dismissal and take the lives of 17 innocent  This tragedy is the result of a massive multisystemic failure--a failure involving Federal agencies, State agencies, and local authorities who all failed to both identify the threat he posed and coordinate a response to stop him before he took action. It is this failure I hope we will focus on by addressing the shortcomings and vulnerabilities in our current laws and in our current policies. We may still have a debate on the broader issues of regulating gun sales, but irrespective of that debate, we still must and should do this.  So today I wanted to come here for a few minutes and announce a comprehensive plan--not a simple bill you just vote on and move on but a series of measures I believe could prevent these attacks before they happen and that also help schools protect their students and their teachers. I believe these ideas should all enjoy bipartisan support, and, if passed, could and should help prevent the next potential mass shooting.  These are ideas I outline not just because they work, but because I believe we can get the votes to pass them. Sixty votes in the Senate, a majority in the House, and the signature of a President--that is what it takes to turn an idea into a law, and these ideas I am about to outline both work and, I believe, could enjoy that widespread support.  One of the things we have learned is, our schools are woefully unprepared to prevent an attack before it occurs. Furthermore, during my visits to the site of the attack and my followup meeting with teachers at the school, I learned of various changes to school facilities and practices which could have stopped this attack or improved the response. Therefore, I will be joining later today with Senator Orrin Hatch and others in introducing the STOP School Violence  If passed, this law would provide Federal grants to do some important things that would have been really helpful in this case: strengthen school security infrastructure of the school, provide school training for everyone--administrators, teachers, even students--to be able to identify threats and to report them. Something that really would be helpful is the creation of a school threat assessment and crisis intervention team. There is a successful program in Los Angeles that does this. That is a team that is a coordination between law enforcement, other State agencies, school districts and the like where they are all talking to each other about students and former students who may pose a threat of violence and intervene before they act.  A second issue we identified is that even if law enforcement, school administrators, or family members believe an individual poses the risk of committing an act of violence, they have very few options to prevent them from purchasing any gun or taking away the guns they already have.[[Page S1304]]  Therefore, I intend to present a new law--perhaps in coordination with others who are working on it now--that will lead to the creation of gun violence restraining orders, something that will give law enforcement and close family members the option of obtaining a court order to prevent gun sales or remove guns from individuals who pose a threat. To be clear, the due process in such a situation would be on the front end, not on the back end.  The third issue we uncovered is, Federal law appears to discourage school systems from reporting dangerous students to law enforcement. I don't support criminalizing all school misconduct, but a student who has threatened violence, who has exhibited violent behavior needs to be reported to law enforcement. A student who has committed a crime by issuing a threat of death using social media--a crime under Florida law--that needs to be reported, but under Broward County school policies, pursuant to something called the PROMISE Program, reporting a student, a dangerous one, to law enforcement is the sixth step--step 6--in their plan. Therefore, I intend to propose changes to the Federal Youth PROMISE Program so a school district plan under this program does not delay and does not discourage law enforcement from being alerted to dangerous and violent or hazardous behavior.  Fourth, we need to strengthen background checks. That is why I have joined with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle pushing for the immediate passage of Fix NICS--something that will require all Federal agencies and incentivize every State to fully report relevant information to the national background check database--because a background check is only as good as the information that is on it. This deranged killer was able to buy guns on 10 separate occasions because he would have passed any background check because none of this stuff that was known about him was reported to that system.  Fifth, we must begin to prosecute the purchase of guns by people prohibited from doing so. Next week, I hope to be joining a bipartisan group, led by Senators Toomey and Coons, in filing the ``Lie and Try'' bill, which will require the FBI to notify States when someone who is not allowed to buy a gun, tries to buy a gun and fails the background check, so they can be investigated, so they can be prosecuted.  In addition, we will be presenting a new law to provide more prosecutors to go after straw purchases, which is where someone buys a gun on behalf of someone else because that someone else could not pass the background check.  Now, there are some additional reforms that I am open to: the possibility of looking at age limits on semiautomatic rifles, the notion of looking at what could be done with high-capacity magazines. We will continue to explore and look at those. These reforms do not enjoy the sort of widespread support in Congress that the other measures I have announced do, and, in order to successfully pass, these ideas will have to be crafted in a way that actually contributes to greater public safety but also do not unnecessarily or unfairly infringe on the Second Amendment right of all law-abiding adults to protect themselves and their families, to hunt, or to participate in recreational shooting.  Ultimately, there are things we can do that have widespread, bipartisan support that we can act on, that we can get passed, that will actually make a difference. These are impactful things.  I urge the Senate and the House, all of my colleagues here, do not hold hostage a piece of legislation that would work and that we all support because it doesn't have everything you want. There are things we can act on and do, and there are things we can continue to argue over, debate, and perhaps do in the future, but on the things we agree on--and they happen to be things that could have prevented this attack and will prevent future attacks--let's get those done. I have outlined those here today. There may be others, but we owe it not just to the victims and the families of Parkland but to all Americans everywhere; for this attack may have happened in Southern Florida, but there is no reason it can't happen somewhere else and, I fear, will happen somewhere else if we do not fix the deficiencies and the flaws in our policies, in our laws, and in the way they are enforced.  We have learned from this incident what is wrong with our system. Let us fix it. We have an opportunity to do so while we continue to debate and work on the issues we do not agree on. That is what I hope we will do, and that is what I commit to doing everything I can to achieve.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING All time has expired.

1024,topic-id,902,"Mr.President, there should be no issue of more importance to Members of Congress than the issue of war and peace and when it is appropriate to send the young people of our country into harm's way, knowing that some of them will not return home alive.  It goes without saying that every armed conflict the United States of America is engaged in must be consistent with the Constitution of the United States and be lawful.  Let's make no mistake about it--article I, section 8 of the Constitution states in no uncertain terms that ``Congress shall have the power to . . . declare war.'' The Founding Fathers gave the power to declare war to Congress because Congress is that body most accountable to the people.  For far too long, Congress--under Democratic and Republican administrations--has abdicated its constitutional role in authorizing war. The time is long overdue for Congress to reassert its constitutional authority. If you think that a military intervention makes sense, then let's have that debate on the floors of the Senate and the House and cast a vote. But that is not what we have been seeing for a number of years.  What Senator Lee and Senator Murphy and I are doing with privileged resolution S.54 is demanding that Congress once again take its constitutional responsibility for war and peace seriously. I thank Senators Durbin, Warren, and Booker for coming on board that resolution. I hope this bipartisan resolution will gain more and more support in the coming days.  Many Americans are unaware that the people of Yemen are suffering today in a devastating civil war, with Saudi Arabia and their allies on one side and Houthi rebels on the other.  In November of last year, the United Nations emergency relief coordinator said that Yemen was on the brink of ``the largest famine the world has seen for many decades.'' So far, at least 10,000 civilians have died, 3 million have been displaced, and over 40,000 have been wounded in this war. Fifteen million people lack access to clean water and sanitation. More than 20 million people in Yemen--over two-thirds of that country's population--need some kind of humanitarian support, with nearly 10 million in acute need of assistance. More than 1 million suspected cholera cases have been reported--1 million cholera cases have been reported--representing potentially the worst cholera outbreak in world history.  Many Americans probably are not aware that U.forces have been actively engaged in support of the Saudis in this terrible war, providing intelligence and aerial refueling of planes whose bombs have killed thousands of people and made this crisis far worse.  We believe--and I speak for Senator Lee and Senator Murphy--that as Congress has not declared war or authorized military force in this conflict, U.involvement in Yemen is unconstitutional and unauthorized, and U.military support of the Saudi coalition must end. Without congressional authorization, our engagement in this war should be restricted to providing desperately needed humanitarian aid and diplomatic efforts to put an end to this terrible conflict. That is why yesterday we introduced a joint resolution pursuant to the 1973 War Powers Resolution calling for an end to U.support for the Saudi war in  The War Powers Resolution defines the introduction of U.Armed Forces to include ``the assignment of members of such armed forces to command, coordinate, participate in the movement of, or accompany the regular or irregular military forces of any foreign country or government when such military forces are engaged, or there exists an imminent threat that such forces will become engaged, in hostilities.'' That is from the War Powers Assisting with targeting intelligence and refueling warplanes as they bomb those targets clearly meets this definition.  This is not a partisan issue. Support for the Saudi intervention in Yemen began under a Democratic President and has continued under a Republican one. Senator Lee is a conservative I am a progressive Independent who caucuses with the  In November of last year--and it is important that Members of the Senate hear this--the U.House of Representatives, by a vote of 366 to 30, passed a nonbinding resolution stating that U.involvement in the Yemen civil war is unauthorized. Every Member of the Democratic leadership voted for this. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi voted for it. Minority Whip Steny Hoyer voted for it. The ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, voted for it, as did the Republican chairman of that committee, Ed  Here is the bottom line: If the President or Members of Congress believe that support for this war is in the U.interest and that we should be involved in it, then let them come to the floor of the House and Senate, make their case, and then let's have a vote.  I believe we have become far too comfortable with the United States engaging in military interventions all over the world. We have now been in[[Page S1302]]Afghanistan for nearly 17 years--the longest war in American history. Our troops are now in Syria under what I believe are questionable authorities, and the administration has indicated that it may broaden that military mission even more.

1395,topic-id,1377,"Mr.President, this morning, I had the opportunity to meet with some extraordinary young people. These were students from Parkland, FL, who attend the school where the mass shooting took place 2 weeks ago. What was amazingly impressive about these young people is that in the midst of their grief, in the midst of the unbelievably traumatic experience that they went through in seeing their best friends being shot and wounded in cold blood and their teachers killed, they resolved not just to mourn and grieve for their friends and neighbors; they resolved to stand up and fight back and come to Washington, go to Tallahassee, FL, and go around the country to do everything they can to make certain that no more children--no more young people--are mowed down and slaughtered in schools.  Nobody thinks that the issue of gun safety is going to be an easy issue to solve. There are literally hundreds of millions of guns throughout this country, and there are 5 million assault weapons throughout this country today. Tragically, there are many thousands of people, I expect in every State in this country, who are walking our streets and are at their wits end emotionally, who are suicidal, who are homicidal. Many of those people have access to guns and guns of mass destruction. I think that in some respects, the slaughter at the high school in Parkland, FL, was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back.  Several months ago, the American people were stunned to see some very sick person in Las Vegas break a window and start mowing down people. He killed some 58 Americans and wounded 500 people within a period of a few minutes. That was on top of Sandy It was on top of so many gun slaughters that, I think, what has finally happened--maybe because of the extraordinary efforts of these young people from Parkland--the American people are saying that enough is enough, that we have a difficult problem. We may not be able to solve it completely overnight, but we have a moral obligation to do everything we can to make certain that no more children--no more people in this country--are mowed down by some sick person with a weapon.  That is not just I who is talking, and it is not just the young people from the high school in It is pretty much what the American people want. Let me refer the Presiding Officer to a few polls that were conducted fairly recently.  A Quinnipiac poll was done on February 20, just a week ago. This is what that poll showed.  It showed that 97 percent of the American people support universal background checks, which is not a radical idea. What the American people are saying and what gun owners are saying is that we should keep guns out of the hands of people who are not responsible and should not own guns. Universal background checks are almost universally supported by the American people.  In that same Quinnipiac poll, 83 percent of the American people indicated support for a mandatory waiting period for all gun purchases. You don't want somebody who is angry, who is upset, or who had something terrible happen to go running to a gun store, buying a gun, and then going out and using it.  There are 75 percent who, basically, want the Congress to address the issue of gun violence and to start taking action.  There are 67 percent of the people polled by Quinnipiac who support a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons. They believe and I believe that assault weapons are designed as military weapons to kill human beings. That is what those weapons are designed to do. I believe and have believed for 30 years--and a majority of the American people believe--that we should end the sale and distribution of those weapons. That was in a Quinnipiac poll.  According to a CNN poll that was done more recently, just a few days ago on February 25, 70 percent of the American people want stricter gun laws. This is the highest number that CNN has registered since way back when the Brady Bill passed, in 1993.  According to CNN, 87 percent support laws to prevent convicted felons and the mentally ill from owning guns. There are 71 percent who support banning anyone under the age of 21 from buying a gun. There are 63 percent who[[Page S1231]]support a ban on the sale and possession of high-capacity magazines. There are 57 percent who support an assault weapons ban, and 56 percent say that stricter gun laws would reduce gun-related deaths.  We have a difficult issue which is not going to be solved overnight, and nobody thinks that it will. Yet the American people are demanding that we have the courage to stand up to the NRA and finally take some action that will move us in the right direction. Let me just suggest some of the ways I believe we should go forward in a bipartisan way.  Once again, the American people believe and I believe in universal background checks. That means, among other things, ending the so-called gun show loophole, because background checks don't mean anything if somebody can go to a gun show or on the internet and buy weapons without undergoing any background check. Overwhelmingly, the American people say that before somebody is able to purchase a gun, we need to know: Is the person a killer? Is he a person who has engaged in domestic violence? Is he somebody who has a history of mental health problems? If that is the case, that person should not be buying a gun.  I think serious gun safety legislation must include addressing the so-called straw man purchases. This is a provision by which people can legally go to gun shops, buy the weapons that they want, but then they are going to sell those weapons or distribute those weapons to people who should not be owning those weapons and who could not have purchased those weapons on their own. I have indicated it is my view that we should ban assault weapons in this country--weapons that are designed for no other purpose but to kill human beings.  Furthermore, I think it is clear that we are a nation that is facing a mental health crisis. I know that in my office--and I expect in the offices of other Senators--we get calls all of the time from people who say: I am worried about my husband. I am worried about my brother. He is at his wits end. I don't know what he is going to do to himself or what he is going to do to somebody else. We have been searching for mental health treatment, but we cannot find anything that is available now or that we can afford.  I believe we should be moving forward to pass legislation which says that Americans who suffer today from mental health crises should be able to get the mental healthcare they need now, not 2 months from now, because 2 months from now may be too late.  We also need to address the fact that, every year, women are being killed by their husbands or their boyfriends and that if somebody is a stalker, if somebody is convicted of domestic violence, if somebody is under a restraining order, we should be clear that that person should not be owning a gun. This is just some of what I think needs to be done.  We are at a moment when the American people have had it up to here. They do not want to turn on their TVs tomorrow or next week or next month and see the horrible, unspeakable things that we have seen in schools throughout this country.  At this particular moment in history, I hope that in a bipartisan way we can come together and do what the American people want us to do, which is to pass commonsense gun safety legislation that is supported by the overwhelming majority of the American people.

I saw new applications and design, additive manufacturing, robotics, and more. And at every turn, innovation is creating new, quality, well-paying jobs.  Second, we have to close the skills gap.

87,topic-id,1434,"Mr.President, yesterday FBI agents, at the direction of the U.attorney for the Southern District of New York, seized information from President Trump's personal attorney, Michael It was reported that the referral to the U.attorney's office originated with Special Counsel Mueller, but the raid itself was under the direction of the U.attorney's office and New York FBI agents.  We don't know the reason for Special Counsel Mueller's referral. We do know that any referral must have been signed off by Deputy Attorney General Rod Furthermore, the U.attorney's office in New York would have to be convinced that whatever information Mr.Mueller passed along was worth pursuing, and the U.attorney would have to convince an independent magistrate or judge--nonpartisan--that there was probable cause to believe that seizing information from Mr.Cohen would yield evidence of a crime. That is a serious and high standard that had to be met.  I go through these details because it is important to understand that yesterday's events could only have been the result of a rigorous legal process, with checks every step of the way and with a very high burden of proof. Yet, last night, President Trump said the FBI raid was a ``disgrace,'' part of a ``witch hunt,'' an ``attack on our country,'' and mentioned that many people have encouraged him to fire Mr.``We'll see what happens,'' he concluded.  Let's break this down. The President suggests that the latest events are part of the partisan conspiracy against him. I remind the President that the source of the referral, Special Counsel Mueller, is a lifelong The Deputy Attorney General who signed off on the referral, Rod Rosenstein, is a Republican, appointed by President The Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, is a Republican, appointed by President The U.attorney for the Southern District in New York, who sought a search warrant based on that information, is a Republican, appointed by President The agents in New York who carried out the seizure are under the direction of Christopher Wray, a Republican, appointed by President  If President Trump believes this to be a partisan conspiracy, he once again ignores the fact that every major player is a Republican, and all but the judges are appointed by President Trump himself. The partisan affiliation of those involved really doesn't matter. These are all law enforcement officers simply doing their job--a job enshrined by the Constitution of the United  The President also tweeted this morning that ``attorney-client privilege is dead.''  Mr.President, attorney-client privilege is alive and well, but there is an exception when the attorney might be involved in a crime or fraud. It is well known as the crime-fraud exception. That exception is obviously in play today. Law enforcement officers believe there is a good chance that the attorney for the President committed a crime or was involved in fraud or they couldn't have gotten the OK from the magistrate to make these seizures.  President Trump also said, the implication of his personal attorney for potentially serious Federal crimes constitutes an ``attack on our country.'' That is what he said, an ``attack on our country.''  With due respect, President Trump, America has been around for over two and a half centuries. An investigation of your personal attorney is not an attack on our country. The Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor was an attack on our country; 9/11 was an attack on our country. When Russia interfered with our elections, that was an attack on our country. Investigating your personal lawyer, with a high standard to be met, is certainly not an attack on our country. It is what America has always been about and still is--the rule of law.  President Trump said the raid was a ``disgrace.'' I say to the President: Mr.President, you have it wrong. Interfering with the investigation would be a disgrace. Calling it an attack on our[[Page S2025]]country is a disgrace. What matters is the rule of law. In this country, no man is above the law, not even the Mr.President, your comments were the disgrace.  If the President is thinking of using this raid to fire Special Counsel Mueller or otherwise interfere with the chain of command in the Russia probe, we have one simple message for him: Don't even think about it.  Special Counsel Mueller has uncovered a deep and detailed pattern of Russian interference in our elections. It has led to several indictments and guilty pleas. It has also led the Trump administration itself to level sanctions against Russian individuals for meddling in our elections. That is proof positive that Mueller's investigation is not a so-called witch hunt.  If the President's own administration has leveled sanctions against Russian individuals for meddling in our elections, how can the President say it is a witch hunt? It is being pursued by his own administration, independent of the Mueller investigation. The investigation by Special Counsel Mueller is critical to the health of our democracy and the security of future elections. It must--it must--be allowed to continue.  The President seems to have a view that the Department of Justice's sole purpose is to protect the President and go after his enemies. I emphatically state to the President, that is not the role of the Department of Their role is to enforce the law and go after anyone who breaks it. That is their role, and it is not subject to the President's political interests in any way.  President Trump should not have any contact--any contact--with the new U.attorney in the Southern District, with his office, or the Department of Justice officials overseeing an investigation of Mr.Any attempted contact by the President or the White House should be reported to the Department of Justice immediately.  One final point. When President Trump implies that the Mueller investigation is an assault on our country and our values, he is not only dead wrong, he is wrong in a very dangerous way. Special Counsel Mueller, the FBI, Federal prosecutors, and U.attorneys are following the due process of our legal system. Calling that an attack on our country undermines the rule of law--a bedrock principle of this great Nation for centuries, the reason, above all, the rest of the world looks up to these great United States of  The only person engaging in an attack on American values, what we all stand for--the rule of law--is, unfortunately, President It needs to stop. It is gnawing at the core of  It is difficult to know when you are living through a historic time in this country. Our Nation has prevailed through many dark times. We all hope that, in the sweep of history, our current moment is not one of peril, but we have witnessed a sustained attack by the President of the United States on the rule of law in this country, and we may be getting to that point.  We have seen that any institution with the power to check the President's power--the Federal Judiciary, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Congress, the press--suffers his disdain and derision. If we fail to defend these institutions, which represent the rule of law, the Constitution, and the balance of power in our country the Founding Fathers so brilliantly enshrined, then we are letting our grand democracy diminish.  I beseech my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up and say what the President is doing is wrong. Make it clear that firing Mueller or interfering in his investigation crosses a redline and is a threat to our constitutional order. Let us also be clear that the President does not have the authority to order the special counsel's firing without cause.  Finally, let us take steps to protect the special counsel from political interference. We have several bipartisan bills designed to do just that. Majority Leader McConnell should bring them to the floor and let us debate them very soon.  For months, Republicans have said that legislation to protect the special counsel is not needed because they have been assured by nameless people that the President will not fire the special counsel. That assurance has been shaken by the President's comments last night. By his own words, it is clear the President may--may--be considering firing the special counsel. This Congress must respond forcefully, and on a bipartisan basis, by reaffirming our belief that the President cannot fire the special counsel without cause and by passing legislation to ensure that any attempts to remove Robert Mueller will be unsuccessful.  We should not abide the President's attempted assault on the rule of law in The eyes of history are upon us.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The majority whip.

I don't know how long the President can believe people will swallow the bold mistruths he spews out day after day after day, but what he said--that the people the investigation was being headed up by are all Democratic loyalists or people who work for Obama--is patently false, and the President should retract it.  These kinds of remarks make it all too obvious that the President, who cares so little for truth, may be considering the firing of the special counsel or the Deputy Attorney So I would like to direct my remarks to my Republican colleagues. I say to my Republican colleagues, you can no longer rely on anonymous sources as a reason for delay or inaction on legislation to protect Mr.Mueller and avoid a constitutional crisis. The evidence is staring us all in the face. We cannot ignore the elephant in the room any longer because the consequences of the President taking action against Mueller or Rosenstein or issuing political pardons is just too dire. As Democrats have said, and as many Republicans have said, such action would precipitate a constitutional crisis in this country. The President doesn't seem to realize it, but I know my Republican colleagues do.  No person is above the law in this country--not even the He is not a He is the If the President were to interfere in any way with the chain of command in the Russia investigation or clean house at the Justice Department in order to install lackeys who will carry out his orders, we would be no better than a banana republic. The kinds of things we see happening in other parts of the globe would be happening here. In those places, leaders use the levers of power to subvert or avoid accountability in all ways. President Trump seems to wish he could do just that.  I want to be crystal clear on this point. If the President were to take action against Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, it would be every bit as grave of a mistake as removing Special Counsel America, as we know it--as we love it--would diminish. I know Republicans and Democrats agree on that.  So why not take the bull by the horns? Why wouldn't we take immediate action to potentially prevent a constitutional crisis from coming to pass? Why don't we head it off at the pass and move bipartisan legislation that has been introduced this morning, through the Judiciary Committee--which I am told Senator Grassley is seriously considering--on to the floor of the Senate, where I hope Leader McConnell will place it. A bipartisan group this morning--Senators Graham and Tillis, Booker and Coons--have introduced legislation that would help protect the special counsel. Why not pass this legislation now and avoid a constitutional crisis? Why not avoid an injury to the body of this great country and then try to stitch it up? Why not avoid an injury instead of sustaining it and trying to stitch it up? That is what we should be doing.  Let's not wait until it is too late. Let's head the constitutional crisis off at the pass by passing the bipartisan legislation introduced by Senators Graham, Tillis, Booker, and Coons and take the threat of a crisis off the table right now.  So I urge Senator Grassley to schedule a hearing and markup on this bill and to report it out of his committee. He must be sure not to water it down with amendments or accept changes that would render it useless. I urge Leader McConnell to then take that bill and put it on the floor where we can debate and pass it. Surely, something this serious deserves the time and attention of U.I dare say, if bipartisan legislation like this came to the floor, it would pass by a large majority--Members of both parties--and the pressure on the House to do the same would be large.  The rule of law cannot be a partisan issue and should not be a partisan issue. We cannot let it become a partisan issue. The Congress must clearly, loudly, and with one voice pass legislation to ensure that any effort by the President to remove Special Counsel Mueller or Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein would be rendered unsuccessful.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

422,topic-id,305,"Thank you, Mr. Before I get to the substance of my remarks, I remind my dear friend the majority leader that the vast majority of the benefits of this tax break, this tax cut, went to the wealthiest of Americans and large corporations. What are they doing with the money? They are using most of it for buybacks. That was a buyback. They buy back their own stock. The CEO--already a rich guy--is making more money. The shareholders, one-third of whom are out of the country and most of whom are in the top 10 percent of America, make more money. The middle class and rural America particularly are left behind in this bill.  We could have done a tax bill where the benefits went to the middle class--not just some--10, 20 percent--but all. So this bill is a bit of a fake. There are small benefits for the middle class, along with harm to their healthcare. The things put in this bill are going to raise many people's premiums far more than their small tax break.  Let's be honest about this. This bill was done for the rich and the wealthy in power, and there were some benefits to the middle class, but it could have been so much better. Our Republican colleagues listened to the wealthy special interests, the large contributors, and that is how this bill came about.  By the way, because it creates a deficit of $1.5 trillion--and I remind our leader that rural America really cares about deficits--there are a lot of Republicans, particularly the more conservative ones, who say: Now let's cut Medicare and Social How is an elderly person in rural America going to feel about that?

According to several reports, Kremlin-linked bots continue to stoke political divisions in the United States via misinformation on social media. Here is what Admiral Rogers said:       President Putin has clearly come to the conclusion that      there's little price to pay and that therefore [he thinks] `I      can continue this activity.' Clearly what we have done hasn't      been enough.  He is absolutely right. It is extraordinary, confounding, and dangerous how little the Trump administration is doing about Putin's campaign to undermine our grand democracy. President Trump refused to punish Putin after he took office, despite the consensus view of 17 American intelligence agencies that Putin interfered in our elections. President Trump has still refused to fully implement the package of sanctions passed by this Congress with only five dissenting votes combined in both the House and Senate, two here and three there. Yesterday, when my friend, the Senator from Rhode Island, asked Admiral Rogers, the Director of NSA, if the Trump administration had directed him to counter Russian meddling, he replied: ``No, I have not [been directed].''  That is astonishing. A hostile foreign power interferes in our election, continues to interfere with our democracy, is planning to interfere in our next elections, and the President of the United States is hardly lifting a finger. It is as if they were preparing for war and tanks or planes were lining up, and we decided to do nothing. Cyber attacks and manipulation of the news media are other ways that hostile powers attack us.

824,topic-id,894,"Mr.President, in the wake of the horrific shootings at Stoneman Douglas High School, the deadliest school shooting since Sandy Hook, there has been a broad national conversation about the epidemic of gun violence in this country. It is being led[[Page S1204]]by a group of brave high school students, the friends and classmates of the fallen, whom I will be sitting down with tomorrow. Their passion and eloquence have been a moral course for change.  Thank God for these students. They are urging us now to have a debate in Congress about something very straightforward: What can we do to stop very dangerous guns from getting into the hands of very dangerous people? How can we keep Americans safe at our movie theaters, at night clubs, at concerts and churches, and above all, at our schools?  We need to get something real and significant accomplished. The problem of gun violence in this country is too immediate for another delay, too severe for half measures.  President Trump has been talking about comprehensive background checks. We are glad to hear that. We are glad that folks are finally starting to talk about the real issues of gun safety again. Democrats believe that, at the very least, in the wake of Parkland, we should strive for comprehensive background checks--closing the loopholes that allow anyone, regardless of a violent history or a history of mental illness, to walk into a gun show or go on the internet and purchase a gun. More than 90 percent of Americans and the vast majority of gun owners support comprehensive background checks. What are we waiting for?  There seems to be a discussion about a more limited proposal, the Fix NICS bill, sponsored by Senators Cornyn and Murphy, which improves the existing background check system in a few ways. I support the bill and I am a cosponsor, but the Fix NICS bill is not what President Trump has been talking about this afternoon and at other times when he says ``comprehensive background checks.'' Fix NICS was written to address one specific issue that was brought to light after the horrific shooting in a church in Sutherland Springs, It is a proposal to address that specific problem, but it leaves unaddressed a host of crucial gun safety issues, including, and especially, the loopholes in our background check system. If we only pass Fix NICS, we will be right back here after the next shooting in nearly the same place. If all Congress does in response to the Parkland shooting is to pass Fix NICS, we will not be doing our job. We must do much more than that.  This week, the Democratic caucus will discuss what policies we believe will most effectively curb the uniquely American epidemic of gun violence. We will propose them and work with our Republican colleagues to perfect and, hopefully, enact them. I sincerely believe we can make progress even on an issue as fraught as this one, but it will require our Republican friends to break free from the iron grip of the  Our Republican friends face a simple choice: Do something real on guns or please the Doing both is impossible.  The NRA's 1 goal is to make sure nothing meaningful on gun safety ever happens. When there are national issues, when there are horrible shootings, they make a feint as if they might try to do something, but then they pull right back because they want nothing to be done.  As an example, after the shooting in Las Vegas, Senators tried to do something here in the Senate about bump stocks, the modification that allowed the perpetrator to automatically fire his arsenal of assault weapons. The NRA and many Republicans said that they would be willing to work on it, but then what? The NRA pushed the weakest possible measure--a simple review of the issue by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, which had already said that they couldn't do anything about the bill. And then what happened?  Now the NRA has pushed the House Republicans to attach the Fix NICS bill--the Cornyn-Murphy bill, a very modest improvement focused on one issue that happened in Texas, but it was not relevant to what happened here in They tried to attach that to the NRA's 1 legislative priority, concealed carry reciprocity, a bill that undermines our existing gun laws, defeating the entire purpose of the legislation.  Even when it comes to the most modest improvements to gun safety laws, the NRA always finds a way to stand in the way of progress. If we are going to get something significant done to keep our schools and our kids safe from gun violence, for the first time in a very long time, President Trump and congressional Republicans will have to buck the  It is our hope that Republican leaders will work with us in a bipartisan way to pass legislation that makes a real difference--not half measures, not baby steps, and certainly not attaching good legislation to legislation that would make the overall problem even worse.  We hope Republicans will work with us to pass serious changes to our gun laws, whether the NRA supports them or not. That is the only way we will make progress on an issue that has frustrated Congress and the vast majority of the American people for far too long.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-26-pt1-PgS1203-2.txt,1036,KENNA JR.

956,topic-id,1420,"Mr.President, after Columbine, Sandy Hook, Charleston, Orlando, Las Vegas, and too many more to name, the Nation convulsed, and we talked about reforming our gun safety laws to prevent more names and places from being added to the list. Each time, we talked, but the Senate, the House--this government--did nothing.  Now, in the wake of the tragic shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School that took the lives of another 17 Americans, we must try again to pass meaningful changes to our laws to keep our children safe. That is our duty, and there are many things we could and should pursue.  Yesterday, I suggested that comprehensive background checks would[[Page S1224]]be an excellent and necessary place to start. It doesn't make sense that we allow anyone, regardless of his criminal history--felons--or a history of mental illness, to walk into a gun show or to go online and buy a gun with no questions asked. There is no sense in that. When I wrote the Brady Law back in 1993, gun shows were not popular, and we didn't have internet sales to worry about at the time because there was no internet. These loopholes grew and grew and grew over time. Now, it is hard to know the exact number because we don't record the number of guns that are sold at gun shows or online, but about one-fifth of all gun sales happen without there being background checks.  It is likely that criminals and others who are up to no good have a higher percentage because they do not want to be detected and go through background checks. It is outrageous that so many guns are sold with there being no background checks whatsoever--whether you are a felon, one who is adjudicated mentally ill, or a spousal abuser. It is outrageous. We should close those loopholes and close them now. We should have comprehensive background checks, not just a little something here and a little something there. Comprehensive background checks are supported overwhelmingly by the American people.  Later this morning, just in about 15, 20 minutes, I will be meeting with several of the students--the brave, courageous students--from Stoneman Douglas High I want to hear what they have to say. These brave students, whether at the Florida statehouse or on national television, have spoken out with passion, with eloquence, with grace. I believe they are changing the way our country thinks about this issue. I hope--I pray--they compel us to do something significant because we cannot settle for half measures, not after what happened in Florida, not after so many tragedies.  The fix NICS bill is an idea that has wide support in this Chamber, but it is tiny. It is a grant program that addresses one specific issue. Now, we have a whole host of issues to address, not just one. Fix NICS was aimed by the Senator from Texas at a particular tragedy in Texas by which a member of the Air Force had a record that would have disqualified him from getting a gun, but the Air Force failed to send the statement to It is a good thing to make sure that doesn't happen, but we should not be aiming our gun legislation simply at one past tragedy. We must look to the future and what will prevent future tragedies. Comprehensive background checks will; the Fix NICS bill will not.  So let's not set our sights too narrow and squander this moment. Let's try for significant, bipartisan legislation that will make a real difference in keeping our children safe. Even as our caucus discusses what legislation is best--and in our leadership meeting, we had an outstanding discussion this morning--I look forward to working with our Republican colleagues to see if we can get something real done.                             Net Neutrality  Mr.President, on another matter, today Senate Democrats will be introducing our legislation to reverse the FCC's repeal of net neutrality. It has the support of every single Democrat and one Senate Republican, Senator Collins from the State of  I say to all my Republican colleagues: This CRA is the best way to undo the terrible decision to repeal net neutrality. It is an important debate. At stake are two opposing visions of the future of the internet.  For its entire history, the internet has been free and open, accessible to all It has been a true public good, just as our highways have. Whether you are on Main Street or Wall Street, you have the same internet. Whether you are a consumer or big corporation, you have the same internet. Whether you are a teacher in a wealthy school or an underresourced school, you have the same internet. Equality of access has driven innovation and entrepreneurship and so much of what we value in the American spirit and the American economy. It is the American way.  Net neutrality rules were put in place to ensure that the internet remains that way--open and equal access to all, no matter who you are, how much money you have, how much power you have. But the repeal by the Republican-led FCC has opened us to an entirely new universe where internet service providers--the big boys--will have the authority to sell quality internet to the highest bidder. That means they could restrict customers' access to their favorite websites by forcing them to buy internet packages or pay more for premium services.  Big companies could pay to get faster internet service, while startups and small businesses and average Americans are left in the slow lane.  Everything from Netflix, to Amazon Prime, to Spotify, streaming television, sports, and movies could be slower if you don't pay up.  Public schools that don't pay for premium service could be put at a significant disadvantage.  Startups that are looking to get their businesses off the ground but aren't large enough to negotiate faster internet delivery with ISPs might never take off. Our startups in New York are scared to death of the elimination of net neutrality, and they have created hundreds of thousands of jobs in my city and millions throughout the country.  The internet without net neutrality is a tale of two internets, where the best internet goes to the highest bidder and everyone else loses.  We have an opportunity to save the internet with our CRA, which would reinstitute net neutrality rules that keep the internet just the way it is now. Democrats believe that the future of the internet must be as free and open as in the past; that the startup founder living in her parents' basement should be able to compete with the world's largest corporations; that the young student in an underserved school district should be able to find all the information he needs online; that every American should be able to afford easily accessible internet. If we start gradating the internet, it could dramatically hurt our economy and hurt equality in America--something we are all striving for.  Right now, unfortunately, only one Republican has signed up for the fair, open vision of an internet that we need and want to keep. All we need is one more. On this net neutrality day of action, I urge all Americans to contact their Senators and demand they sign up with us to save the internet.                          Republican Tax Bill  Mr.President, finally, a word on the Republican tax bill. When President Trump and congressional Republicans were trying to sell their tax bill, all we heard about was how it is going to be a boon to workers, stimulate investments in new factories, raise wages, and create jobs. It is a few months after the tax bill, and the promises have not been backed up by the evidence.  Now the evidence is flowing in that corporations are spending the lion's share of the benefits they reap on the tax bill not on workers but on goosing their own stock.  A headline from Monday's New York Times states ``Trump's Tax Cuts in Hand, Companies Spend More on Themselves Than on Wages.'' The article goes on to document how the Republican tax bill has unleashed a wave of share buybacks and stock repurchasing programs, things which help out rich executives and shareholders but don't accomplish much for everyday American workers. If you are a CEO of a company, you are judged by whether your stock is going up. The quickest hit on that is to buy back your shares, reduce the number.

1354,topic-id,1164,"Mr.President, it is nice to hear my colleague's words. I would also want to mention a few things about the same issue.  Mr.President, it has been nearly 3 weeks since the shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Still, unfortunately, the majority leader hasn't committed to any floor time for the debate on the issue of gun safety--no time to debate universal background checks, a policy that over 90 percent of Americans support, including the vast majority of gun owners; no time to debate protective orders to allow law enforcement to temporarily disarm individuals who have shown credible signs of being a harm to themselves or others, especially relevant after Parkland; no time to at least have a debate on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines on the floor of the  The kids who survived that horrific shooting are speaking up and speaking out and are demanding that we address this issue head-on. I believe they are moving the conscience of the I met with them. They are fine young men and women. Instead of just cursing the darkness after what they went through with the losses of friends and colleagues they suffered, they are trying to light a candle, urging us to debate and do something real. Yet, the majority leader is moving to a banking bill today with no promise of time to consider a package of commonsense gun safety measures.  We need to debate them on the floor. We can't just try to do one little bill by UC with no debate or put it into some other big bill. This needs a national debate. This issue is consuming America, and for the Senate to turn its back and do nothing, or to try to just slip some minor measure through, doesn't work.  Last week, America watched President Trump whipsaw on gun safety issues in a matter of days. All of America felt pretty good when the President met with a bipartisan group. He seemed to be open to tackling gun safety in a bipartisan way in a nationally televised meeting. Then, the next day, he met with the NRA behind closed doors and seems to once again have backed off.  It is a show we have seen before, and it is getting old. Too many times we have watched the President say the right things when the cameras are on but refuse to follow through the moment they are switched off--oftentimes doing a 180-degree reversal of his position.  On the issue of gun safety, just like the issue of immigration, we could find a bipartisan consensus. It is very possible, but it requires the President to show some leadership, some followthrough, and some consistency. Otherwise, Congress will do what it has done after every mass shooting for the past decade--nothing.  Those brave, young students will be here in a few weeks, having watched Congress do nothing again. What a black mark that will be--lowering the even low ratings of this body.                          Republican Tax Bill  Mr.President, on to another matter, the Republican tax bill. Over and over, we have heard the Republican mantra that their tax bill was aimed at giving working Americans a boost. Yet every analysis showed that when you looked at the actual policy, the lion's share of the tax cuts are going to corporations and the richest 1 percent. According to one study, 83 percent of the benefits from the Republican tax bill go to the top 1 percent of earners.  Don't worry, our Republican friends say, that money will trickle down to workers, but trickle-down economics has never worked. It has failed time and again. Most of our Republican colleagues are even afraid to admit that the majority of the tax cuts go to the very wealthy. They simply say it is helping working people, but their mechanism of trickle-down is something they will not utter in public.  Instead of giving workers major wage increases, hiring new workers, or investing in new equipment and research, the most popular use of the savings from the tax bill for corporations is corporate share buybacks. That is from the big corporations. Already, big corporations have announced more than $200 billion in share buybacks this year. We just started March, and already, corporations are on pace to spend over $1 trillion this year buying back their own stock.  The problem here is, share buybacks don't really help workers. They don't really help grow the economy. They are a quick way for a big corporation to take more of their stock off the market, raising the value of the shares. Who benefits? Well, corporate executives who own lots of these shares and wealthy shareholders who hold the vast preponderance of the shares.  As one economist told Bloomberg, ``You're not going to get the macro-economic benefit the administration thought it was going to get from its tax cuts. It's going to go to the areas that don't stimulate growth,'' namely, buybacks, dividends. An analysis by Just Capital, which the New York Times called ``one of the most detailed accountings to date'' of how companies are spending the windfall from tax reform, finds that ``just 6% of capital allocated so far is going to [employees], while 58% is going to shareholders in the form of dividends, share buy-backs, or retained earnings.'' That is 6 percent for the workers and nearly 60 percent to share buybacks and other corporate benefits.  Today, the Joint Economic Committee, led by our wonderful ranking member, Senator Heinrich, pointed out that if you distributed the savings that went to just one big company--Berkshire Hathaway, which gained $29 billion as a result of the tax bill--you could give a $1,000 bonus to 29 million  This is amazing. That is the equivalent of every employee in Arizona, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia combined from just one company's worth of savings. The public is beginning to realize what is going on here. They see they are putting their children and grandchildren into deep debt, not to benefit themselves, the workers, preponderantly, but to benefit corporate leadership, owners of shares--the vast preponderance of whom are in the top 10 percent of American wealth.  Corporations are not putting the vast preponderance of the money where they should be--raising the salaries of workers or increasing productivity of the company by investing in new machinery and new techniques. No; it is that quick hit, the stock buyback.  It goes to show how beneficial tax reform could have been if it were aimed[[Page S1329]]at the middle class and those struggling to reach it. Instead, the Republicans made a conscious effort to give corporations and the wealthiest Americans the bulk of the tax cuts and promised it would trickle down to everyone else. Unfortunately, past is prologue, and corporate America will invest in what is best for corporate America, while working America is getting left behind.  I yield the floor.

All of them--the students of Stoneman Douglas, parents from Newtown, parents of the victims in Orlando, Las Vegas, Columbine, Charleston, and everyday gun violence in cities and towns all across our country--all of them are calling on us to act. The slow-motion massacre of American children must end. The time has come to make meaningful changes to our laws to keep Americans safe from the epidemic of gun violence.  Let me tell you, the students of Stoneman Douglas will not stop until we achieve meaningful change. They know small measures will not get the job done. That is why they told me, every one of them: The Fix NICS bill is not close to enough of what we need to do. Fix NICS has wide support in this I am a cosponsor. But it is just the first tiny step that addresses one specific issue. We have a whole host of other issues to address, not one.  It is true that the records of NICS need to be fixed, but it is also true that we need to close the gun show loophole. It is also true that we need to make sure online sales go through background checks so that felons or those adjudicated as mentally ill or spousal abusers can't get guns. Over 90 percent of America agrees with that. But our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are so afraid of the NRA that they can't even embrace universal background checks, which 90 percent of America addresses. Special interest lobbying--the kind of thing President Trump campaigned against, the NRA is doing it. The NRA is doing it.  We need to stop writing bills that address only the last shooting and start[[Page S1258]]making laws that prevent the next one. When you have a sick patient, you don't just treat one symptom; you cure the disease. That is what universal background checks will do. Fix NICS would be a good thing to do, but it is a tiny step when we need a giant leap. It can't be the only thing we do. In fact, the only reason it hasn't cleared this Chamber already is that the Republican Senator from Utah objected to it. Such is the vice grip that the ideologues from the gun lobby have on the entire Republican They are so against what America wants. They are so against what rank and file Republicans want. Even on something as limited as Fix NICS, the gun groups find a way to get in the way.  I believe the priority of this Chamber should be to pass universal background checks. That would accomplish what Fix NICS does and a lot more. President Trump has said that he would push ``strongly comprehensive background checks'' in the wake of We Democrats are calling on him today to keep his word. We sent him a letter asking him to support existing legislation, bipartisan legislation, to close the loopholes that allow anyone to purchase a gun at a gun show or on the internet without a background check. These loopholes make no sense. Leaving these loopholes unclosed would be as if we checked someone's ID at the liquor store but not at the bar. That is what you could say about Fix It would be as if we checked someone's ID at the liquor store but not at the bar. We should have the same checks across the board.  Today, I call on President Trump to come out in support of legislation that would close dangerous loopholes in our background check system. The NRA vehemently opposes that, but I say to President Trump: Show some leadership, buck the They are way out of touch with the American people, with gun owners, and rank and file I say to the President: Show some leadership, buck the NRA, endorse these policies, and you can finally break the gridlock and get something meaningful done.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-28-pt1-PgS1257-8.txt,1036,TUSKEGEE AIRMAN POST OFFICE BUILDING,2018.0,28.0,February

761,topic-id,690,"Mr.President, as we close out Black History Month this week, I wanted to recognize a few people and initiatives that we are really excited about.  Yesterday, I joined Congressman Mark Walker, Chairman of the Republican Study Committee in the House, to host our Second Annual Historically Black Colleges and Universities Fly  We hosted Presidents and Administrators from HBCUs throughout the country, including four from my home State of South Carolina--South Carolina State University, Claflin University, Allen University and Benedict  We were able to host some great panels on ensuring curricula are matched with the needs of the workforce, how to best encourage entrepreneurship among students, and what steps we are taking at the Federal level to help our HBCUs provide an invaluable education for students for generations to come.  Representatives from the HBCUs heard from Google, McDonalds, Starbucks, Bank of America the Morehouse College Entrepreneurship Center, John Deere, Wal-Mart, the Center for Entrepreneurship & Economic Development, and the Koch I also want to thank my friends Senator Lankford and Congresswoman Terri Sewell for joining us on our member panel.  For decades, HBCUs provided Americans of color with educational opportunities they would not have otherwise had. For generations, they have given low-income students an education they could not otherwise afford.  We have stood by them with the restoration of year-round Pell Grants, a top legislative priority from last year's fly-in, which benefits more than one million students.  I joined a bipartisan group of members of Congress, including Representative Alma Adams, to ensure an increase in the Department of Defense's HBCU and PMI grant program, boosting funding for this important collaboration to $40 And earlier this month, we saw the Environmental Protection Agency renew its partnership with Bowie State University to provide professional experiences and advanced resources to Bowie State students.  We will continue to stand with our HBCUs, and help ensure they are providing the opportunities sought by so many people of color and low-income families from across the  I also want to talk about legislation my friend Senator Booker and I introduced today to help combat Sickle Cell  Our Sickle Cell Disease Research, Surveillance, Prevention and Treatment Act will do exactly what the title suggests . . . aid in fighting sickle cell through research, surveillance, prevention and treatment.  Currently, we don't really know exactly how many people have Sickle Cell There's no real surveillance and reporting in place at the Federal level, and only a handful of states have a reporting process.  To best battle Sickle Cell, we have to know the universe of what we're fighting against. So, our bill establishes the National Sickle Cell Disease Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment program to collect data on the demographics and prevalence of Sickle Cell as well as identify and evaluate strategies for prevention and treatment.  We're also reauthorizing the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Demonstration Program (SDTDP) for four years, making some smart reforms and expanding support services for kids and young adults making the transition to adult care.  If you've ever met someone with Sickle Cell Disease, you know the pain they go through. You see how hard it is on their families to watch them suffer.  The Medical University of South Carolina has put so much effort into finding a cure, and over the past few years I've gotten to know some of the patients. Their perseverance is amazing.  We have taken some great steps forward, but we have to keep that momentum going. I want to thank Senator Booker again for joining me in this effort, and I look forward to our colleagues supporting the Sickle Cell Disease Research, Surveillance, Prevention and Treatment  Mr.President, Black History Month allows us to not only study and learn from our past, but to see where we can go in the future.

476,topic-id,1474,"Mr.Speaker, tonight I join to talk and to thank the leadership of the Republican Party, who made a firm decision during the last elections that our party needed to stand for not only making America great again, but every single American who needed an opportunity to join in that endeavor.  Tonight, I stand in this beautiful time that we discuss the tax bill that Republicans passed last year and talk about the effects of it and how much it has helped in  I think a story needs to be told about what the goal of the tax bill was. Why did Republicans work so hard to move these ideas forward?  The bottom line to it is Americans watched as the Democratic Party and President Obama not only had their control of the country, but economically, as the policies of the Democratic Party became more apparent to people, Americans and the world watched as America dwindled in economic activity and economic growth.  This took place because of the policies that the President, President Obama at the time, brought forth and Congress passed: trillion-dollar spending plans, trillion-dollar increases in the budget, and talk of raising taxes another trillion dollars.  What happened is, for some 8 years, there was GDP growth of about 1.2 percent. Mr.Speaker, that means, very plainly, that it would take about 70 years to double the size of our economy, which means that communities and States and companies and individuals lag behind as they would watch other cities and other countries and other people around the globe not only have economic activity, but opportunities that came to their doorsteps. IPOs, or initial public offerings, and all the acronyms that go with economic growth and development went overseas; they went other places.  So Republicans began this discussion with the American people going into 2010 that said: We need to be careful about government spending, but, on the same side, what we need to do is to grow our economy. That is exactly the discussion that took place during the last Presidential election.  So as soon as the election was over, Republicans began the process of not only making America great again, but doing it by empowering every single State and every single American to be a part of this growth. Essentially, there was a look at some $12 trillion worth of economic tax components.  Kevin Brady, who is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, from Houston, Texas--actually, Spring, Texas--was in charge, as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, of looking at how we were going to move our economy forward. I call that pop.  How we were going to take economic activity and, instead of perhaps helping an individual or a company or necessarily one particular part of the economy, we wanted where it would go and add pop or generationally develop more economic activity than just for a singular entity.                              {time}  2100  And Kevin Brady, as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, looked at some $5.6 trillion out of this $12 trillion and said: We need to take that and make that the engine of the economy.  So a decision was made to move that directly to the free enterprise system. Mr.Speaker, it is the free enterprise system that stands as the greatest activity for freedom in the world, an activity that not only brings opportunity and investment and entrepreneurship, but more than that, wealth. It has brought wealth to the United States of America, a free enterprise system that is there to produce for anyone that chooses to be participatory in that environment--an opportunity to begin by investing your own money, by hard work where you show up at work, and having customers or consumers that go and generate economic activity, and that is what America has been, and that is what we were slowing down.  The engine of that economy was slowed down because our predecessors, not only in the Presidency but also our friends who are Democrats, believed that they would engage the free enterprise system in such a way that did not allow it to grow, did not allow it to expand, and did not allow itself to build.  So what Kevin Brady did, as chairman of the Ways and Means, was propose a tax bill that would take $5.6 trillion worth of tax components and move it directly to the free enterprise system. By moving it to the free enterprise system, we reduced taxes. We reduced taxes from the 37 percent range for corporate down to 21 percent.  What does that do? Well, that takes America, an American business as seen by the world, from 24th in the world to number one. So instead of us being what might be on a list of 24th place of easy-to-do business, that was generating not only goods and services, but was the ease of doing business with, that people wanted to be a part of, that has taken us to first in the world.  That means that America will begin building back not only jobs and job creation, but it will build back with the intellectual capacity to build the newest, finest ideas and products that the world needs for tomorrow because America will be a place that is not only easy to do business but is less priced, and because we can be less priced, we can become the products of choice all around the world.  So, Mr.Speaker, I want to say: This is working. This is working to take America not only where they are in first place, but it means Americans and American companies can be in the same position.  As a Member of Congress from Dallas, Texas, I have an opportunity to see firsthand not only how this impacts people and companies but how it impacts the workers. And it wasn't but 2 weeks ago when I was at what was called the National Write Your Congressman, which is headquartered in Dallas, Randy Ford is their President; and Randy gave me good news. He said that of the small businesses that they had talked to, that they believed that 74 percent of small-business owners expected revenues to be higher in 2018, and even higher the next year, which meant that they felt positive about not only economic growth but, more importantly, their companies.  I also visited Texas Moving Company, which is a family owned business of some 40 years old that is in Richardson, Texas, and they told me, point-blank, that as a result of us making sure that we would reduce the cost of doing business by reducing taxes, that they had increased their driver's pay by over $2,400.  That means that it does come directly to the employees that are able to have not only more take-home pay, but they are able to know that they can fall into more easily knowing that they may take a part-time job to a full-time job, a full-time job to a career, and a career as an opportunity to make sure that they better the lives of not only their family but their children also in their community.  And this is why Texas Moving Company made a decision then, as they saw this money that they would have; they made a determination that they would increase their employees by $2,400, but they also increased their health insurance reimbursement to where they now pay $3,484 a year to help their employees to pay more of their healthcare costs because they can do that on a pretax basis.  Mr.Speaker, it is all these things that the Republican majority has done. When others said it would simply be crumbs or unimportant, we said we are going to focus on making America great again; and when you do that, you will find that you not only make America great, but you make Americans and their families greater also.  Mr.Speaker, this is why we, as Texans, stand up not only as proud Members of the Congress, but also as proud Americans who say: We want to make[[Page H1260]]sure that everybody, no matter where they live in the United States, that they would be a part of making their city, their State, their company, and their family even stronger.  I appreciate Mr.Mitchell allowing me to be here tonight. It is my hope that the discussion that we have with the American people and the Chair, Mr.Speaker, that you will recognize that if we are going to do this, it will mean that we are going to have to understand it is not up to government to make this work; it is up to the American people. We are giving them the tools in this tax bill, and I think they will do the right thing for everybody.  Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me this evening.

490,topic-id,645,"Mr.President, I want to recognize the leadership of Kateri Callahan, who has served as president of the Alliance to Save Energy since 2004. As the honorary chair of the alliance, I have been a firsthand witness to many of Kateri's most recent accomplishments. Before Kateri starts the next chapter of her career, I want take this opportunity to look back upon her 14 years with the alliance and thank her for her contributions to Federal energy-efficiency policy.  In 1977, Senators Charles Percy and Hubert Humphrey--a Republican from Illinois and a Democrat from Minnesota--founded the alliance as the leading energy-efficiency coalition of businesses, governments, environmental groups, and consumer advocates. The goal of the Alliance from the start has been simple: ``Use less and do more.'' In the wake of the oil embargoes and energy shortages of the 1970s, that message resonated loud and clear, and it still does.  Energy efficiency saves money, improves national security, reduces pollution, encourages innovation, boosts U.competitiveness, and creates jobs. Without the economywide improvements in energy efficiency made since 1973, it is estimated that today's economy would require 60 percent more energy than we consume now. In fact, savings from energy-efficiency improvements over the last 40 years have reduced our national energy bill by an estimated $800 billion, all while growing and expanding our economy.  Since its establishment, the alliance has taken great care to cultivate and maintain bipartisan support for policies supporting energy efficiency. While doing so, the organization has been led by a distinguished groups of energy efficiency thought-leaders and advocates like  For my colleagues who have not met Kateri, you need to know she is persistent and tenacious. Once she gets ahold of something, believe me she never lets go and sees it through to the end. I am thankful for Kateri's leadership, and on behalf of my House and Senate colleagues who are also part of the alliance, I am thankful for the coalition's support for my proposals over the years.  Highlights abound during Kateri's tenure at the alliance. She was a key negotiator on many of the most impactful energy-efficiency provisions of the 2005 and 2007 energy bills that passed Congress with strong bipartisan support and were signed into law by President George She helped ensure that the 2009 stimulus package provided significant investments in energy efficiency and encouraged states to adopt updated building energy codes. In 2015, she stood with me and my colleagues, Senator Rob Portman and Representatives David McKinley and Peter Welch, as President Barack Obama signed our bipartisan and bicameral bill, the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act, which was the first significant energy-efficiency legislation to pass Congress in nearly a decade.  In addition to her work in Washington, Kateri has spurred initiatives to connect directly with energy consumers and educate the public about[[Page S1338]]the economic and environmental opportunities of energy efficiency. She produced a series of award-winning consumer education campaigns, including the Power is in Your Hands, Energy Hog, Drive$marter, LUMEN, and Six Degrees of Energy She also led the establishment of the Southeast Energy Efficiency Alliance to ensure that American families and businesses in the southeastern States have the knowledge, resources, and opportunities to optimize energy use.  The alliance's reach does not stop at our borders. Under the leadership of Kateri, the alliance created the European Alliance to Save Energy and established EE Global, the world's premier gathering of energy-efficiency leaders to discuss new ideas and chart new paths to do more by using less.  Serving 14 years as president of an organization like the alliance is its own commendable accomplishment, but Kateri has had a more profound and positive impact on Federal energy-efficiency policy than can be counted just in years. I congratulate Kateri and express sincere thanks for her support over the years. I wish her the best in her future pursuits and good health and good luck.  Thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-05-pt1-PgS1337-3.txt,1901,1715,2018.0,5.0,February
250,topic-id,367,"Mr.Speaker, I support the committee system. The Democratic Caucus has put roughly 25 of its members on the Financial Services We are the members of the Democratic Caucus assigned to study and debate legislation on Financial Services issues.  We did just that. And 60 percent of the Democrats assigned to the Financial Services Committee, 15 Democrats, voted in favor of this bill, while 10 opposed it.  So if members of our caucus wonder what would our caucus position be if all the members of our caucus had a chance to really analyze bills in this particular technical area, one would expect that 60 percent of our caucus would support this legislation.  The reason for that is that the purpose of regulation is to reduce risk rather than having risk be the reason to have regulation.  This bill focuses on getting companies to reduce their risk. There are those that say if we just designate more companies as SIFIs, we will get more regulation.  No, you won't.  What you get is more companies designated, but then you get pressure to have less regulation on all the designated companies.  What we need is to reserve the SIFI designation for those who are clearly exposing our economy to the risk of another meltdown, and we need to encourage companies to be less of a risk to our economy.  The ranking member, who is bearing a substantial oratorical challenge, being, I think, the only speaker opposing the bill, correctly points out that AIG was a risk to our economy.  That is right.  This bill would have put it to AIG that you are going to get designated and regulated if you don't get out of the credit default business.  Had they done that, the meltdown in 2008 would have been much less significant.  So let us encourage these companies to de-risk, and let us have heightened regulation on those who refuse to do so or who by their very size pose a risk to our entire economy.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the Democratic Caucus to have some faith in the 60 percent majority who have been assigned to the Financial Services Committee and voted in favor of this bill.

I mean, it has been festering for decades--for decades--so how urgent is it?  You know, we haven't had a major accident yet, but there are tens of thousands of tons of high-level nuclear waste sitting in relatively exposed conditions, so what could possibly go wrong? I mean, high-level nuclear waste is so radioactive that it emits heat. It emits an immense amount of heat. So we could--I will give you a couple of things that could go wrong.  The waste could be commandeered and then made into weapons. It doesn't have to be made into a nuclear fission bomb. It could be made into a dirty bomb. Just put a bunch of nuclear waste with explosive material in some city and that city would be uninhabitable for the rest of our lifetimes, for sure.  There also could be waste leakage. We have nuclear waste sitting on the banks of the Missouri We have nuclear waste, tons and tons of nuclear waste, high-level nuclear waste, sitting a quarter mile from the Columbia River, and this is pretty serious stuff. And my friend from Illinois, my colleague from Illinois, I am sure, will tell us about nuclear waste that is on the Great Lakes ready to go. So we have a problem. We have been pretty darn lucky so far.  You know, I worked as a graduate student. I was a graduate student in mathematics. I worked for an engineering professor to study the nuclear waste project at WIPP, a waste isolation pilot project near Carlsbad, New Mexico, and I can tell you the technical solutions are there. Nuclear waste can be safely engineered for tens of thousands of years, as long as it needs to be stored. Transportation can be done safely. I have seen train cars that are designed to hold high-level nuclear waste slammed into concrete walls with no damage to the interior of the car.  This stuff can be done. It is not an engineering problem. I mean, the engineering and the geological solutions are there if we put our minds to making it happen. It can be done in engineering.  However, nuclear waste is a political problem, and it hasn't been managed so far. The politics of the Yucca Mountain waste project were very badly managed from the very beginning. A successful nuclear waste storage project will need complete transparency from the very beginning with the local community. There will always be some amount of opposition, but without local buy-in, the project is going to fail. Local buy-in is absolutely essential. This can be done if there is complete transparency, if the local people understand what the risks are and what the benefits are. This can be done.  Mr.Speaker, we need to devote the resources to finding a permanent solution to nuclear waste. Meanwhile, H.3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 is a step, a very important step in the right direction.  I want to thank my colleague from Illinois (Mr.Shimkus) who has worked on this tirelessly for year after year. I know that some people think that he has gone too far in Nevada, but, nonetheless, if we work together and can become transparent, maybe Nevada will never accept nuclear waste, but we have to find a permanent storage solution that can be done. This is a step in the right direction, and I urge my colleagues to support H.3053 and give this legislation fair and honest consideration.

1150,topic-id,1781,"I do that, Mr.Speaker, because we have had Members from Oregon--I am from Illinois--Tennessee, Minnesota, California, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas, Connecticut come down. Many, many Members from all over this country also wanted to join me here tonight, but they could not, so they will be submitting statements for the I appreciate the Chair allowing us to us do that.  Mr.Speaker, I also want to highlight a few things and just follow up on some of my colleagues, who I really appreciate coming down and spending their time to talk about the importance of this issue.  This issue has national support, I think identified by the 49-4 vote out of the Energy and Commerce People are very diverse, from all over the country, on the Energy and Commerce I would encourage people to go to the Energy and Commerce Committee website and look at the members of that committee and how wide and how diverse we are. We are all united on this issue.  The national newsmakers and the recorders of what is going on are starting to take interest in solving this problem. We have a couple editorials and statements from some major papers and some smaller ones.  Here is The Washington Post: ``Put Yucca Mountain to work. The Nation needs it.''  As was stated, the law was passed in 1982 and it was amended in 1987. Congressman Duncan said it right. This is the law of the land. For the last 8 to 10 years, we have been breaking the law by not moving forward. People have heard me say that numerous times before.  Here is The San Diego Union-Tribune: ``Revival of Yucca Mountain nuclear waste project overdue.''  Well, it is 20 years. We should have been receiving spent nuclear fuel and defense waste 20 years ago. Now we are paying judgments because of our inability to comply with the law.  Wouldn't you like the government to do what it says it wants to do and then is planning to do it? And then shouldn't they do it?  Here is Aiken Standard: ``Fed should proceed with Yucca Mountain.''  Here is the Reason: ``Open the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository.''  Here is the Los Angeles Times and their statement on this issue: ``The Federal Government needs to renew its efforts to bring the Yucca Mountain site into operation.''  There is a lot of support in California because they are closing nuclear power plants and they have spent nuclear fuel on the beach, as Congressman Carbajal has said. He is talking about San Luis  I think I will show a chart later on that shows San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, or SONGS, which is being decommissioned.  Here is the Chicago Tribune, from my State: ``Yucca Mountain is the only viable alternative to the jury-rigged status quo. We hope the Trump administration and Congress will revive it because if they don't''--well, you can read it, right?[[Page H1362]]  So let me give you an example. It was mentioned by one of my colleagues, and I will talk about Illinois for a little bit. Zion Nuclear Power Station is decommissioned. On the shore of Lake Michigan is spent nuclear fuel.  Part of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act Amendments of 2017 does a couple things. It makes sure the authorization language is in place so that we start moving forward on a final repository.  We have listened to my colleagues from around the country to say it is not going to move fast enough, even if you start it.  Can't we find some regional temporary locations.  Now, in the nuclear timeframe, ``temporary'' is about 40 years. That is temporary when you are talking about nuclear stuff. So we want to be able to consolidate.  What this shows is licensed and operating nuclear spent fuel storage installations. These are just locations where you have nuclear power. And you can see the red dots all over the place, and other nuclear registered locations.  I am not talking about the other issue, which is defense locations. That is why I am glad my colleague Joe Courtney came down to talk about Connecticut and the nuclear  A colleague that really wanted to be down here was  Dan Newhouse, who represents Hanford is the epitome story of why we need to get our act together as a nation and fulfill our obligations to clean up these sites.  This is a defense site. We created waste in the production of our nuclear arsenal. Decades, stored in tanks, toxic sludge underneath the ground that needs to be glassified, as Chairman Walden mentioned. And where that glassified toxic sludge is supposed to go is underneath the mountain in a desert in Yucca  So these are the different locations we have here across the country. As was stated tonight already, 39 States, 121 locations. Thirty-nine States, 121 locations.  So let me give you a few examples of what we are talking about.  My colleague Jason Lewis was down here earlier, and he mentioned Prairie These are old charts, but they are oldies but goodies because we haven't done anything. I can go into the dustbin of history when I talk about this on the floor, and the only thing that has changed is there is more spent nuclear fuel on these sites.  So you have Prairie You have waste stored aboveground in pools and in casts. You have, in the Mississippi floodplain, on the Mississippi River, 50 miles from Minneapolis-Paul versus Yucca  Now, what do we have at Yucca Mountain?  Now, Yucca Mountain is where, by law, we are supposed to be receiving long-term repository.  I refer people, there is no nuclear waste on site. Here is the mountain in a desert. The waste will be stored 1,000 feet underground and 1,000 feet above the water table.                              {time}  2015  The Colorado River is the closest body of water 100 miles away. So that is the example. That is what we want to show to the American people.  Would you rather have nuclear waste or defense waste next to your major cities and by major bodies of water, or would you rather have them in a desert underneath a mountain?  I had a few Californians down here tonight. Why? Because they are decommissioning nuclear power plants. This is the one I visited just maybe 14 months ago. It is no longer an operating nuclear power station. They are decommissioning it. The waste will be stored onsite. It is the San Onofre Nuclear Generating It is between L.and San Diego right on the Pacific At this time, there are 2,300 waste rods onsite. That has probably increased by a number I don't know. Waste is stored aboveground. It is adjacent to the Pacific Ocean, and it is located 45 miles from San Diego, versus Yucca Mountain which is located here, which is a mountain in a desert. The waste would be 1,000 feet underground, and that is 1,000 feet above the water table.  So I have listened to my colleagues from In fact, in this picture, this green area, these are all the counties around the Federal land site that have passed resolutions in support of moving forward.  Now, what do the Nevadans tell me? They want to make sure it is safe. How do you make it safe? You decide to adjudicate the science. We give Nevada, as per law, their last chance to question the science. That is what we are trying to do in the appropriation process is get the money to do the final adjudication so that the question can be answered. To my friends from the State of Nevada: Is a mountain in a desert a safe place to store the defense waste and spent fuel?  Now, the red part is Federal land. Yucca Mountain would be about right here, a little pinhole. That yellow there is--when you hear people say local consensus, the yellow here is a local consensus from Sweden, and if you notice, it is smaller than the Federal land that we have. So I would argue the local consensus is the Federal Government since it is all that property. Now, why do we have all that property? Because Yucca Flat is there. Because we put nuclear fuel--nuclear waste, in some short and some shade, is already housed there. So, again, it is a great location.  I was given a pin tonight from Nye County, and it says, ``Host of Yucca Mountain.'' So with all due respect to my colleagues from the State of Nevada, when they say that everyone is against it, they are not talking to everyone in the State of I have been to Las Vegas, I have been to Reno, and I have been to Pahrump, and there are people that--if proven safe.  So I would ask the Governor, allow us to have the litigation to fight the science. That is what he wants to prove, that is what we want to prove, and that is what we need to appropriate the money, get the final adjudication, and then I am convinced that our nuclear scientists, the studies, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that issued a safety and evaluation report will come out and say: You are not going to find a safer place on this planet; there is no more of a studied location on the planet than Yucca  So, again, I want to thank my colleagues for coming down to do a couple things. First of all, we want to highlight to our leadership in this House and our appropriators that we need to get money into the final omnibus to do the adjudication to fight for the science, and we have to do that now--issue one.  Issue two, there is a bipartisan consensus, as proven by the 49-4 vote in the committee and by 108 cosponsors, and when we get the bill on the floor, a passage of a bill that we probably would project to get 300 votes out of 435.  So the nuclear era started in World War It was started to beat Hitler to make sure they didn't win World War Then we had the arms race with the Soviet It has helped protect our freedom and liberty. There was a price to pay, environmental degradations across this country. We owe it to these communities and to ourselves to safely gather, store, and protect the environment and protect our citizens. We do that through the appropriation process. We do it by passing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act amendments of 2007.  Mr.Speaker, I want to again thank my friends from both sides of the aisle for coming down this night.

812,topic-id,503,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, too often, our laws passed with the best of intentions fail to keep pace with technology, and that is what we are seeing today with the Communications Decency  The bill was passed in 1996 as Congress' first attempt to regulate inappropriate material online. This law prevented hosts and visitors of a website from being treated as a publisher for legal purposes. It is what allowed classified websites like eBay to flourish while being legally protected from third-party content posted on their sites.  But 20 years is an eternity in the digital age, and bad actor websites have created platforms designed to facilitate illegalities like child prostitution and sex trafficking, and they use provisions in this law to shield them from any liability.  One of the most notorious examples is online advertiser Backpage.com. Since 2011, more than 20 civil action lawsuits have been brought against this site for willingly facilitating sex trafficking and the prostitution of minors. However, each time a legal action was brought against Backpage, Federal law shielded them from liability.  Last year, The Washington Post reported that a contractor for this site was soliciting and creating sex-related ads, despite Backpage's repeated insistence that they had no role in the content of their ads. Backpage used longstanding Federal protections under the Communications Decency Act to shield itself from all liability.  In the Doe v. Backpage ruling by the first circuit, the judges held that, even if Backpage had facilitated the crime of sex trafficking, this law shielded the company from the claims that were filed by the child victims. The first circuit recently reiterated that when it threw out yet another lawsuit against The courts weren't able to help these victims, instead, encouraging them to pursue legislative changes, and that brings us here today.  H.1865 finally creates a legislative solution to hold these bad actors accountable and allow the victims to seek the damages that they deserve. It creates a new offense in the Federal code for websites that facilitate this criminal activity and gives, to prosecutors, the tools they need to hold the wrongdoers accountable.  The bill is a product of a lot of great work, and I want to thank Congresswoman Wagner for introducing it. The Rules Committee, last night, made in order an amendment from Congresswoman Walters that substantially strengthens the legislation and has Congresswoman Wagner's full support. Its inclusion attached the text of bipartisan Senate language to drastically improve its implementation. This is language that has the support of both the tech industry and the victims advocacy groups.  Mr.Speaker, it is so nice to see Members of both parties from both sides of the Capitol come together on this. Through collaboration, we have crafted a bill that does more than just update a 20-year-old law. It fulfills our moral responsibility to protect the children that we represent.

818,topic-id,507,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, in closing, many of my colleagues today, as well as I, discussed the need to protect America's children. This bill is a great piece of that, and I am very grateful to have it on the floor today. But there is more that we can do. It must include acting to curb the Nation's gun violence epidemic.  Every day in America, 91 people are killed by a gun. Since Sandy Hook, there have been close to 1,000 mass shootings. A mass shooting is one where three or more people have lost their lives. Imagine that, thousands of them. Our Nation is still mourning the loss of 17 lives just last week when a gunman using an AR-15-style rifle opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, That gun is a weapon of war and should only be in the hands of the military and never on the streets of the United States.[[Page H1280]]  Assault weapons were the weapon of choice not just in the Florida shooting but also in the mass shootings at the concert in Las Vegas; the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado; and the elementary school in Sandy Hook,  They were prohibited under the assault weapons ban that Congress let expire in 2004. I was here when we established that ban, and we saw a great decrease in gun deaths from that. So they should be prohibited today and not in the hands of people who simply want to kill the most people they can in the shortest time.  Why would we allow an insanity like that?  So I was pleased to cosponsor legislation this week to re-implement the assault weapons ban.                              {time}  1145  The students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School are inspiring the entire Nation to push Congress to do our job and to act on gun violence.  I will tell you that I understand the pain that everybody feels from all of this, but we can't maintain it. We go from one to the other, as though nothing had ever happened before.  But we have to also do what the NRA has forbidden us from doing, which is to have gun research at the Communicable Disease That certainly should be lifted, as well.  We certainly should expand and strengthen the background check system. Keeping people on the terrorist watch list and the no-fly list from being able to purchase firearms and explosives seems to me to be a no-brainer, but we won't even do that. And, yes, reinstating that weapons ban again, I think, is critically important.  Perhaps the voices of those injured and grieving children can break the gun lobby's stranglehold on I hope so. The majority should heed their call because we, as Members of Congress, are in a unique position. Unlike the clergy or grief counselors or elected officials, we can actually do something to combat this violence. It certainly is, Mr.Speaker, past time that we do.

As I am sure Senator Klobuchar knows, as you have just heard from her, once a Minnesotan can walk, you can bet that his or her parents will try to get them on skis, skates, a sled, or maybe even on the curling rink. That early start--not to mention the fact that Minnesotans are the hardest working and most resilient people I know--helps explain why 23 of our athletes took part in this year's Winter As Senator Klobuchar said, that is the third most of any State in the country. And, boy, did they steal the show. Minnesotans brought home gold medals in women's hockey, women's cross-country skiing, men's curling, and a bronze medal in women's downhill skiing.  I want to talk about Afton, Minnesota's own Jessie Diggins, who carried the Olympic torch for Team USA at the closing ceremony. As Senator Klobuchar said, Jessie began skiing at 4 years old and started racing against high schoolers at age 11. She earned her spot on the Olympic cross-country team and was the only woman to compete in all six women's cross-country events--and compete she did.  Along with her teammate, Kikkan Randall, Jessie won the first Olympic Gold Medal ever for the United States in cross-country skiing--and in dramatic fashion. Jessie came from behind during the final stretch of the race, inching out her competitor as they crossed the finish line.  I am amazed, but not all that surprised, by the accomplishments of my fellow I am so happy to be able to join Senator Klobuchar in[[Page S1307]]saying we are glad the whole world had the chance to witness what we see every day in our jobs as Senators from Minnesota--Minnesotans doing amazing things.

985,topic-id,239,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.4296, sponsored by my colleague Blaine This bipartisan bill makes important corrections in the bank capital requirements for operational risk. Under the legislation, regulators would continue to be able to consider the bank's operational risk, but would do so in a forward-looking manner.  Currently, financial institutions are required to hold risk-based capital, even for discontinued activities and products. Accounting and the capital markets often use the concept of pro forma financials, which means you consider the ongoing operations, or the way that it would look if it looks like it is today, going forward. This bill would institute that same approach for regulators to use pro forma operational risk, so they wouldn't have to continue to charge a capital charge on operations that have been discontinued.  I think the chairman made a great comment about you don't buy home insurance on a home you have already sold. My colleague, Mr.Luetkemeyer,[[Page H1311]]during the markup of this bill, talked about how the Basel Committee has revised this specific capital requirement several times, but it is still a work in progress. This legislation is just a commonsense change to make sure that banks are not charged capital charges against things that they aren't doing anymore.  This approach will free up capital that is needlessly on the sidelines and put it back in reach of America's job creators. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.4296.

341,topic-id,1572,"Madam President, as we all know, our country is facing a lot of challenges, particularly overseas, and a lot of them are in the news--Iran, Syria, North When you[[Page S2057]]look out across the landscape of what the big, long-term, geostrategic challenges are that face our Nation, in my view, there is no doubt that the 1 challenge economically and from a national security standpoint is the rise of China as a great power. We need to be thinking about that a lot more because that is going to be the issue our country faces, not just this year or next year but for decades.  I come from the great State of We are an Asia-Pacific We are always looking to that region--as a matter of fact, we are in that region. My hometown of Anchorage is closer to Tokyo than it is to Washington, What I see as a positive on this issue--having been someone in this body for a little over 3 years, I have come down to the floor and talked a lot about this challenge, the rise of It is a little concerning that a couple of years ago nobody was talking about it. Very few people were talking about it, but that is changing, and I think that is positive.  It is changing. This administration is focusing, and it is changing with my colleagues--Democrats and Certainly, this is an area where, I think, there is a lot of agreement. I was just presiding for the last hour. The majority whip and the Senator from Oklahoma both were talking about issues dealing with China and trade and strategy, and that is positive.  The administration is talking about it. If you look at the national security strategy of the Trump administration, they are starting to focus on this issue. Front and center is the return of great power rivalries, with China as the leading, pacing threat and challenge, but it is also an opportunity for this great Nation of ours.  When you look at the history of our country, particularly post-World War II, the United States set up the international system--the international trading system and security system. We have been leading them, and so many countries--hundreds of millions of people in the world--benefited from that. The irony, of course, is that the one country that benefited probably more than almost anyone is  The rise of China was not only helped, but it was spurred by the American international trading system, the sealanes of commerce that we have kept open for decades. So there was a moment in the last couple of decades where we reached out very much--there was a great speech by our former Deputy Secretary of State in the Bush administration, a gentleman by the name of Bob Zoellick, who went on to become head of the World He asked in a speech to the Chinese: You need to now become a responsible stakeholder in this system that we created because you have benefited so dramatically. You are big, you are powerful, and now help become a stakeholder in the international order that we set up. Here is the offer to you.  Well, unfortunately, whether it is a Democrat or Republican, in the national security and foreign policy realm, most people are sensing that China has rejected that notion. No, we are not going to be a responsible stakeholder in your system. We are going to set up our own system. As a matter of fact, we might even try to undermine your system--the global system set up by the United States of America by Democrats and Republicans over decades.  You see it everywhere, whether it is decades-long theft of intellectual property, whether it is high tariffs, whether it is any American company coming into China and being forced to transfer their technology. No other countries do this to China, but they are doing it to our companies and have been doing that for decades.  So there is a rethinking right now. Clearly, the Trump administration is thinking about what the new strategy should be. The national security strategy of this administration, which I commend people to read--it is quite a good document, written by the outgoing National Security Advisor, H.McMaster--focuses a lot on this issue of reciprocity and great power rivalry again.  So as we are thinking about it, I would like to briefly touch on three principles I think will be key as we debate this. As we help formulate this--hopefully, in a bipartisan manner--this issue is going to be with us for decades. There are three key principles.  The first key principle is reciprocity--true reciprocity. The majority whip was just talking about this. The national security strategy of the Trump administration talks a lot about it. The President talks a lot about this. This is just a fairness issue. As I mentioned, there is IPR theft; high tariffs; the forced tech transfer from American companies to China; giant, subsidized, state-owned enterprises and state-backed investment funds buying up companies all over the world. No other country does that to  So when you look at the issue of reciprocity, I would like to break it down into a positive and negative. You have negative reciprocity. If we can't do that in your country, you shouldn't be able to do it in our country. It is pretty simple, pretty fair, and everybody understands that.  Then there is positive reciprocity. One thing I have been encouraging the Chinese to do for many years--and I have been over there a lot and spent a lot of time with senior leaders in that country. The United States has been going over and investing in China for decades. Factories have been rebuilt from the ground up and we have employed tens of thousands of Chinese with American capital. Well, you know what, China is getting big enough. They can do that in The Japanese did that in the 1980s. We had major trade disputes with them. What did they do? They started coming to our country and investing in our States with their capital, greenfield investments--auto factories, for example--and employing tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of We would welcome that. As a matter of fact, in Alaska, the Chinese are talking about helping us develop a large-scale Alaska natural gas project. Greenfield investment, employing Alaskans would be positive if that is going to happen. So that is the way we need to think about reciprocity.  The second key principle is allies--allies, allies, allies. The United States is an ally-rich nation. Our adversaries and potential adversaries--think about whom that might be: Russia, North Korea, Iran, potentially They are ally-poor. No one wants to join the North Korea team or the Iran team--well, maybe Syria--but the United States for decades has had allies because they trust us. We are not a perfect nation, but they trust us. Look all over the world.  So what we need to do with regard to our strategy on China is make sure we remember not only our allies and deepen current relationships with Japan, with Korea, with Australia, but expand them--The Presiding Officer and I went to Vietnam with the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, a war hero who spent time in prison in Vietnam, Senator The Vietnamese are very interested in doing more with us. India, there are incredible opportunities to have a deeper alliance between the oldest democracy in the world, us, and the biggest democracy in the world, them. So allies have to be a key part of our strategy as we look at how we deal with the rise of China for the next two or three or four or five decades because all of these countries--all of our allies--are having the same challenges.  Finally, the third principle we cannot lose sight of--and for too long this body lost sight of it--is robust American economic growth. Since the founding of our Nation, we have been growing at about 3 or 4 percent GDP growth. I have a chart, and I talk about it all the time down here. Yet, over the last decade, because of policies we inflicted on the American people, we were barely growing at 1-percent GDP growth. What does that mean? Everybody talks about numbers, wonky. That is a proxy for the American dream, and we were not growing. We weren't growing. In Asia, the coin of the realm of power more than anything--more than military power--is the power of your economy, and we have not had that. We have not shown up, and that matters.  What we are trying to do in this body now--tax reform, regulatory reform, unleashing American energy--is we are going to start growing this economy again, and that is going to help the American people, that is going to reignite the American dream, but that is going to be key with any policy we deal with China.[[Page S2058]]  So as we are thinking through this challenge--and I am going to talk about this a lot, and I know all my colleagues are interested in this. I know my colleague from Michigan is interested in it--we need to continue to focus on these core principles--reciprocity, our allies, and robust economic growth as we all struggle with and put together a long-term strategy to deal with the rise of China, the challenges and the opportunities.

57,topic-id,291,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.4293, the Stress Test Improvement Act, bipartisan legislation by my great colleague, the gentleman from New York (Mr.Zeldin).  We keep hearing about megabanks, but all banks affect industries, small businesses, and large businesses. So every time we adjust the marketplace and we make more regulations, you also impact small businesses as well, and our ability to survive. As the owner of a small business, this affects me as well.  But stress testing is an important tool that can encourage the safety and soundness of an individual depository institution and the overall health of the banking system, including all banks, across all sizes and sectors. However, the Federal Reserve has implemented its stress testing in a manner that imposes unnecessary burdens without providing proportionate benefits. This is especially true for smaller institutions for which the cost of this exercise is disproportionately burdensome. It can also affect larger banks.  H.4293 would fix the tests so they can properly show smarter ways to strengthen a financial institution's planning. This legislation improves the Federal Reserve's stress testing processes mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act by requiring a select group of banks, or bank holding companies, to conduct internal, company-run stress tests once a year rather than semiannually.  I want to thank Mr.Zeldin again for sponsoring this, as always, a bipartisan piece of legislation. And it is important to note that, if we are going to reduce regulations and burdensome fees and procedures on companies, it has to be across all sectors, not just one. And I think this legislation shows that and shows the sponsor's willingness to do that.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation.  ",CREC-2018-04-11-pt1-PgH3112-3.txt,2344,GUN VIOLENCE,2018.0,11.0,February
226,topic-id,1492,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from California and her hard work on this really important issue.  Taxes are, of course, extremely important in New York State as being one of the highest taxed States in the Nation, along with California, an undistinguished honor that we don't want to have.  But I rise today to actually recognize the thousands of hardworking families across the 22nd District of New York, and throughout upstate, who have felt the real impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our Tax Code was broken. It was riddled with loopholes that penalized success and hurt hardworking families and hardworking taxpayers. Our middle-income families were the ones who suffered as the economy and wages remained stagnant.  As I traveled from Sandy Creek to Vestal, Little Falls to Cortland, I heard real stories from families, small-business owners, single parents, veterans, and seniors detailing the damage of our oppressive Tax It held our small businesses back, crippled our family farms, and left our families feeling hopeless and overwhelmed.  That is why we stepped up to the plate, took our constituents' concerns and stories to Washington, and passed legislation that reflected the values of fairness and hard work. No longer is our economy stagnant. No longer will American businesses and families suffer under an unfair and oppressive Tax Code from  Here in New York, tax reform has provided once-in-a-generation relief from the failed status quo, a status quo that was created in part and mostly by Albany politicians whose seemingly only intent is to tax and spend, and I dare say, waste our hard-earned money.  Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the typical middle class family of four in New York's 22nd District, which I represent, will see a tax cut of $2,439. Imagine what kind of money that could do for a family of four.  Now, families will have the opportunity and means to save for college, plan for the future, invest in their retirement, and provide their children with increased educational opportunities.  Families know how to spend their resources much better than the Federal That is why we are putting real money back into the pockets of hardworking families, money they earned, and money they deserve to keep.  Throughout the debate on tax reform, I, along with my fellow colleagues from New York, fought an uphill battle to include provisions facing elimination that are vital to seniors, single parents, struggling families, and overly burdened job creators.  One of the key provisions that we New Yorkers fought tirelessly to include is the State and local tax deduction or, as you heard often, the SALT deduction. I would like to thank Chairman Brady and everyone on the Ways and Means Committee for understanding the importance of this deduction and what it means to my constituents. As a result of our advocacy, nearly all of my constituents in the 22nd District will be able to continue to claim a SALT deduction.  It is also flexible, which means it can be used for property sales or income tax, and not just restricted to local tax.  In the 22nd District, 99 percent of itemizers deduct less than $10,000 in property taxes. This provision will cover the overwhelming number of property owners who own homes of less than $450,000 in value, which is a very nice home in my district, a little different than in the coastal areas and sometimes you will see in the southern tier of New  The reason the SALT deduction matters stems from Albany politicians who have no regard for the taxpayers they represent. For example, all eight of the counties that I represent are in the top 36 highest property tax rates compared to home value nationwide per county.  This bill provides relief on the Federal level, while finally taking a step to encourage fiscal responsibility from I have always put the taxpayers I represent first, and it is long past time for politicians in Albany to do the same, and we are hoping that this bill will incentivize them to do that to help our taxpayers.  The benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act do not stop there. Earlier this year, I heard from Frank Frank is the president and CEO of Suit-Kote Corporation, a family owned, multigenerational paving company in Cortland, New Frank wrote to me to share the impact tax reform has had on his business and nearly 800 employees.  First, in direct response to the new tax law, Suit-Kote announced plans to match the Federal tax cut and provide its employees with a 2 percent retroactive pay increase and has begun to accelerate 401(k) contributions for 2018 by 4 months to provide employees additional funds in their retirement accounts.  Our goal in passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was to deliver this type of relief to hardworking families like those employed by Suit-Kote, and it was an honor for me to actually go to Suit-Kote and meet with the employees and hear from them, firsthand, just how great their benefits were from the Tax Cuts and Jobs  We also heard that NBT Bank, a local bank in my region, with dozens of locations throughout the 22nd District, has used tax reform to invest in its employees. NBT decided to raise the starting hourly rate of pay from $11 to $15 an hour, without a mandate coming from the government, merely because of the benefits from tax reform. Employees earning $50,000 or less will receive a permanent minimum increase of 5 percent this year.  Another great little business in my community, fairly new, started by a young guy, A&P Masters Images, LLC, in Utica, a small printing business, has hired another full-time graphic designer and is now weighing the options of putting on an addition to its building in the city of  Howard Potter, CEO of A&P Masters, said with everyone's increase in pay he can already see a morale boost coming from his employees. He said the end-of-the-year tax relief for businesses will help them afford to be more aggressive with investing in their growth, to build or buy, or hire more staff, and buy more equipment.  While these companies are based in the 22nd District, there are dozens of other companies with branches in my district that are reaping the benefits of tax reform. For example, CVS is increasing its wages for hourly employees from $9 to $11 an hour.[[Page H3088]]  Home Depot, with a location right next to my New Hartford office, is giving employees a bonus of up to $1,000, with the chairman and CEO of the company stating it was directly made possible by the tax reform bill.  Lowe's and Walmart are also giving back to their employees as a direct result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs All three of these corporations have numerous locations across my district and employ hundreds of hardworking citizens throughout NY's 22nd.  Critics of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act have called this law and its benefits crumbs, or Armageddon, as you famously heard. They have also called this law a handout to the 1 percent. Time and again, they have been proven wrong.  Just this past weekend, our very own New York Post declared, and I am paraphrasing: GOP's tax cut isn't actually a gift to the rich. They come to that conclusion from an analysis done by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, who found that the top 20 percent of wage earners will pay 87 percent of all Federal income taxes in 2018, up from 84 percent last year. Additionally, the analysis found that most families earning under $50,000 a year will pay almost no Federal income taxes at all, and many will see a refund.  Mr.Speaker, this does not sound like middle class Armageddon to me. These benefits certainly do not sound like crumbs. This is money that can be used to get ahead on car payments, to pay rent, to pay mortgages, so much more that everyday Americans struggle with in a tough economy.  Businesses like the ones I mentioned are proof that providing desperately needed relief from the Federal side for the failed tax-and-spend status quo that we see in New York is the most effective way to improve the lives of  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for her advocacy on this and for asking us to join.  One added note I would like to say is we found also from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center that New York is going to be one of the gainers. We are actually going to see a growth in our economy and a growth in jobs, in spite of what Albany may or may not do; but we are really grateful for that, and I just want to say it is an honor to support the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and to advocate for the things in that bill that helped our district.

997,topic-id,329,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me the time to speak on this important bill and also for his tremendous and strong leadership on our committee.  H.4296 would set reasonable standards for regulators that are based primarily on the risk posed by a banking organization's current activities and businesses, not on past activities, as you have heard.  Operational risk standards were created and are a product of the European Basel Committee and have been amended twice, actually, since that time. But their adaptation still doesn't hit the mark, and that is why, though the Basel Committee's proposal is well intentioned, this bill and this proposal will amend that to tailor it to the needs and to the effectiveness and efficiency of our banks.  The current framework is based on past activity and will hold operational capital on discontinued products, products that banks don't even have in their portfolios. This bill will correct those errors by allowing our U.S.-based financial regulators to tailor the capital requirements they need based on their unique business model.  H.4296 limits the burden of operational risk capital requirements to a bank's current activities and businesses, gives the bank the ability to determine risk under forward-looking assessment, and would permit adjustment on risk-mitigating factors.  This bill, as you have heard over and over, does not eliminate the Federal Government's ability to assess operational risk or alter the regulators' authority to set capital requirements when doing business on high-risk customers.  Mr.Luetkemeyer's bipartisan legislation would create a commonsense reform to the Basel standards, and I urge all Members to support it.  I also want to thank Congressman Meeks, a fellow New Yorker, for cosponsoring this legislation.  Again, I want to thank Mr.Chairman for his great work on our committee and also Mr.Luetkemeyer for his hard work, his bipartisan work on this bill, for a person who is a banker, a business person from a rural area of our country who really understands the need to protect consumers.

129,topic-id,2006,"Mr.President, as my colleague from Pennsylvania has pointed out, the recently passed tax bill is already having a profound impact on the economy, and, as the Congressional Budget Office report points out, over the course of the next decade, it will significantly increase economic growth in the economy and increase the number of jobs. It said that over 1 million jobs would be created as a result of the passage of the tax bill.  To his point, as well, they talk about deficits and debt projected out into the future, which clearly are major issues but, again, I would point out, are a result of the rate of growth in spending and not of the impact of the revenues generated by lowering taxes because when you get greater growth in the economy, it means that more people are taking realizations and more people are paying taxes. The Congressional Budget Office, as a rule of thumb, suggests that for each percentage--a 1-percent increase in growth of the economy--you get about $3 trillion in additional revenue over the course of a decade.  If we assume, and I believe we will--even the CBO, which I think is very conservative in terms of growth estimates, suggests that there is higher growth attributable largely to the changes we made in the Tax Code, reducing taxes on families in this country and reducing taxes on our small businesses, which incentivize them to expand and grow their operations and, therefore, create better paying jobs and higher wages, but also will generate more revenue coming in to the Federal coffers.  Clearly, the issue that we have in terms of the debt picture in the long term is not about revenue; it is about spending, which is growing dramatically over that next decade, particularly in what we refer to as mandatory spending or entitlement programs. This cries out, I would argue, for reforms in entitlement programs. But to say that somehow tax reform is contributing to that is a far cry from the truth, and I think the Congressional Budget Office numbers bear that out. Again, I would argue that in terms of what they suggest we are going to see in growth as a result of the changes we made in the Tax Code, I believe it is going to be dramatically understated.  When it came time to draft tax reform, Republicans really had two goals in mind. First, we wanted to put more money in the pockets of hard-working Americans, and we wanted to do that right away. Second, we wanted to create the kind of economy that would give Americans access to economic security for the long term.  Less than 4 months after we passed this bill, I am proud to report that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has already achieved the first goal and is well on its way to achieving the second.  To put more money in Americans' pockets, we lowered tax rates across the board for American families, nearly doubled the standard deduction, and[[Page S2065]]increased the child tax credit to $2,000, doubling the amount that families can deduct per child in terms of the child tax credit.  In February, that relief started to show up in Americans' paychecks. According to Treasury Department estimates, 90 percent of the American people are seeing bigger paychecks this year, thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs And thanks to the IRS's new withholding calculator, families with children can adjust their withholding to take into account the individual tax relief provided in the new tax law, in particular, the increased child tax credit. That means even more in the paychecks of hard-working Americans without their having to wait until they file their 2018 tax returns next year.  When it came to our second goal, we knew that the only way to give Americans access to real long-term economic security was to ensure they had access to good jobs, good wages, and real opportunities. We knew that the only way to guarantee access to good jobs, wages, and opportunities was to make sure businesses had the ability to create them.  Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our Tax Code wasn't helping businesses to create jobs or to increase opportunities for workers. In fact, it was doing the exact opposite. Large and small businesses were weighed down by high tax rates and growth-killing tax provisions, and all the regulatory and compliance burdens that came along with them.  Our outdated international tax rules left America's global businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the global economy. That had real consequences for American workers. A small business owner struggling to afford the annual tax bill for their business was highly unlikely to be able to hire a new worker or to raise wages. A larger business struggling to stay competitive in the global marketplace while paying substantially higher tax rates than its foreign competitors too often had limited funds to expand or increase its investment here in the United  When it came time for tax reform, we set out to improve the playing field for American workers by improving the playing field for businesses as well. To accomplish that, we lowered tax rates across the board for owners of small and medium-sized businesses, farms, and ranches. We lowered our Nation's massive corporate tax rate, which until January 1, was the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. We expanded business owners' ability to recover investments they make in their businesses, which will free up cash that they can reinvest in their operations and their workers. We brought the U.international tax system into the 21st century by replacing our outdated worldwide system with a modernized territorial tax system so that American businesses are not operating at a disadvantage next to their foreign competitors.  The goal in all of this was to free up businesses to increase investments in the U.economy, hire new workers, and increase wages and benefits. I am happy to report that this is exactly what they are doing. Since tax reform became the law of the land, we have seen a steady drumbeat of businesses announcing good news for American workers. So far, more than 500 companies, and counting, have announced pay raises, bonuses, 401(k) match increases and other benefits, business expansions, and utility rate cuts: Starbucks, McDonald's, Jergens, McCormac & Company, Apple, Best Buy, Walmart, Bank of America, ExxonMobil, Hormel Foods, UPS, and American And the list goes on and on.  I don't need to tell anyone that Americans had a tough time during the last administration or that our economy had stagnated. But under Republican leadership, we are finally starting to see the economy turn around, and tax reform is playing a very big part. Unfortunately, Democrats seem unable to accept the fact that tax reform is benefiting middle-class In fact, Democrats recently introduced an infrastructure plan that they want to pay for by repealing features of the tax law that are producing so many new benefits for American workers.  Republicans wanted Democrats to join us in the process of drafting tax reform. After all, a lot of the provisions in the final bill were the result of years of work by Republicans and I was a part of that process. We had working groups that spent a good amount of time looking at every element and feature of the Tax Code--bipartisan groups of Republicans and Democrats, working together, making recommendations about things that we could do to reform our Tax Code in a way that would incentivize greater growth and expansion and better jobs and higher wages.  Democrats had previously expressed their support for things that became key parts of the bill, like lowering our Nation's massive corporate tax rate. Unfortunately, instead of working with us, Democrats chose to play politics. Apparently, it was more important to them to attempt to score political points against Republicans than to work on a bill that they knew had the potential to help the American people. Almost 4 months after the bill's passage, they are still playing politics, despite the fact that in the face of the bill's success, their attempts to criticize it are sounding pretty desperate.  Take their attempt to portray the bill's benefits for workers as ``crumbs.'' Let me tell you that a worker whose salary just increased by $3 an hour does not see that additional $500 a month as crumbs, especially when you combine it with the rest of the tax relief in the new tax law. A worker who gets an increased match in her 401(k) account will see her retirement savings increase significantly as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and she will not see that benefit as crumbs.  It is too bad that Democrats can't accept the fact that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is working. At the very least, they should stop trying to undo the benefits that it is bringing to the American people. Over 500 companies across this country have announced increases in wages, increases in benefits, and bonuses--direct benefits to American workers, to the tune of over 5 million Americans who already have benefitted from this. That is the short-term impact that we have seen already.  The American people spent long enough in a stagnant economy. It is time to get this economy jump-started and to see those wages and those good-paying jobs come back into this economy so that American families can benefit, can experience, and can enjoy a better standard of living, a higher quality of life, an opportunity to do more for their children, to help them with their college education, to set aside a little bit for retirement, and to take care of those day-to-day bills.  Fifty percent of the American people, according to polls, say they are living paycheck to paycheck. One thing we can do to help them is to make that paycheck bigger and, hopefully, to put them in a position where they can put aside a little bit for retirement and where, maybe, they can help save up for their kids' college education, and maybe take a vacation with the family.  There are so many ways in which the benefits of this bill are delivered to the American people and to American families and can help them in their daily lives. We shouldn't try and go back. We ought to try to go forward and recognize that the near-term benefits of this bill are very real to American workers. The long-term benefits are going to be, I think, even more beneficial to American workers, to American businesses, and to American families because not only now will they benefit from the lower tax rates that are delivered to the entire tax table, but they are also benefiting from the doubling of the standard deduction, the doubling of the child tax credit, and all the other benefits that are included in this bill. American businesses, small and large, are also seeing those benefits on a daily basis, so much so that they have already made these commitments to over 5 million That is 500 companies that are paying out bonuses, higher pay, and bigger benefits for their workers. That is only going to increase over time as this economy starts to take off because they now have an incentive to expand and grow their operations through reduced rates, when it comes both to large and small businesses, through the ability to recover their costs more quickly and to free up that capital with which they can invest in and expand and grow this economy and create those better paying jobs.  This is a win-win for the American people. It is a win-win for our country.[[Page S2066]]I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will quit referring to it as ``crumbs'' because I know the American people don't see it that way.

1392,topic-id,1011,"Mr.President, tax reform is working. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been the law of the land for just 2 months, but it is already helping American workers.  When it came time to draft tax reform legislation, we had one objective, and that was to make hard-working Americans' lives better. To accomplish that, we focused on two important priorities.  First, we focused on immediately increasing Americans' take-home pay. We lowered tax rates across the board, we nearly doubled the standard deduction, and we doubled the child tax credit. All of those provisions went into effect on January 1, and by the end of this month, according to the IRS, 90 percent of the American people should see lower paychecks.  While immediate relief for hard-working Americans was crucial, we wanted more than that. We wanted to give the American people access to the kinds of jobs and the kinds of wages and opportunities that would set them up for long-term security. We wanted to give them the kinds of jobs and wages where they wouldn't be forced to choose between sending their kids to college and saving for a secure retirement or between paying the mortgage or medical bills. So in addition to lowering the tax burden on Americans directly, we set about improving the playing field for American businesses so that we could make things better for American workers.  Needless to say, in order for American workers to thrive, the American economy has to thrive, and that means that American businesses have to thrive. It is pretty hard for a small business to hire a new worker or to raise wages if the owner can barely pay the tax bill. It is unlikely that an American company is going to have a lot of spare cash for investing in its workforce if it is struggling to compete with foreign companies that are paying far less in taxes. It is unlikely that America's global companies are going to focus on reinvesting in the United States if they face a tax penalty for bringing foreign earnings back home. So we lowered our Nation's massive corporate tax rate, which, up until January 1, was the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. We lowered tax rates across the board for owners of small- and medium-sized businesses, farms, and ranches. We expanded business owners' ability to recover investments they make in their businesses, which will free up cash that they can reinvest into their operations and their workers. We brought the U.international tax system into the 21st century by replacing our outdated worldwide system with a modernized territorial tax system so that American businesses are not operating at a disadvantage next to their foreign competitors.  The goal in all of this was to free up businesses to increase their investments in the American economy and in American workers, and that is exactly what businesses are doing. The list of tax reform good news keeps growing--wage increases, new jobs, increased investment, bonuses, benefit increases, and the list goes on and on.  Take utility bills. Lower utility bills might not be the first result we think of from tax reform, but tax reform is saving utility companies money, and they are passing those savings on to consumers.  Washington, DC, radio station WTOP reports:       In a flip-flop related to tax reform, [utility company]      Pepco now says it wants to cut rates instead of raise them.       In December and January, the utility announced plans to      raise rates in D.and Maryland respectively. . . . But the      sweeping Federal tax bill signed into law late last year      meant a significant tax savings for the utility. As a result,      Pepco is now asking the Maryland Public Service Commission to      approve a rate cut.  That is right--they were talking about a rate increase, but now they are talking about a rate cut in their utility rates.  Take this story from the Daily Energy Insider titled ``Federal Tax Cut More Than Reverses Eversource Rate Increase in Massachusetts.''  The Daily Energy Insider:       Many Eversource Energy electricity customers in      Massachusetts who were expecting to see a rate increase this      year instead will see a rate reduction because of the recent      Federal corporate tax cut.       ``What was expected to be about a $36 million annual rate      increase has turned into a $20 million annual decrease,''      said the Massachusetts Department of Public  In my home State of South Dakota, Black Hills Energy in Rapid City is working with regulators to pass tax savings on to South So far, utility companies in at least 39 States are passing tax savings on to consumers, and that can be a real help to family budgets. Everybody knows how much gets spent out of every family's budget on utilities, on energy, and certainly in my part of the country in South Dakota, with the cold winters, that is even amplified. It can be a real help to family budgets, particularly families who are living paycheck to paycheck.  In Florida, Florida Power and Light Company announced that thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it will no longer require its customers to pay a surcharge for Hurricane Irma restoration. Instead, the company reports:       Florida Power and Light plans to apply federal tax savings      toward the $1.3 billion cost of Hurricane Irma restoration,      which will save each of Florida Power and Light's 4.9 million      customers an average of approximately $250.  Thanks to tax reform, good news for American workers seems to just pour in daily, whether it is lower utility bills, new jobs, bonuses, or, as Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina announced last week, lower rate increases on health insurance.  I am proud that tax reform is accomplishing our goal of making life better for hard-working Americans, and I look forward to seeing even more benefits for American workers in the weeks and months to come.[[Page S1230]]  I yield the floor.

I am happy to be a proud Senator from the State in which he was born. In fact, I live only about 20, 30 minutes from where he lived his early years. I look forward to going to the funeral on Friday to celebrate his life, to celebrate his legacy, and to celebrate the many lives that were changed because he had brought the Word of God to them wherever they may have been on this planet.

Mr.Speaker, the Dodd-Frank Act introduced into our Nation's capital a new culture of regulatory burden where a select few Washington bureaucrats dictate how our Nation's financial institutions should run themselves. While I support the necessary regulations from our Nation's fiduciary rule makers that upholds the goals of safety, soundness, and fair play, far too often our regulators have overstepped their boundaries and entered into dangerous territory of overregulation.  Section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act gave the Financial Stability Oversight Council immense deliberate power to declare nonbank financial companies as systemically important to the financial stability of the United  Once that determination is made, these nonbank financial institutions become subject to extraordinarily stringent prudential supervision and regulation by the Federal This is a power that should not be taken lightly.  FSOC's systemically important designation carries with it a significant regulatory burden, a new public perception, and a new regulator.  Mr.Ross' legislation would require the FSOC, when deliberating on whether or not to designate a nonbank as systemically important, to consider the appropriateness of imposing new burdens on the institution, as opposed to pursuing other forms of regulation to mitigate identified risk to the financial stability of the United  Mr.Speaker, Mr.Ross' legislation would help end the culture of overregulation in Washington and alleviate the intense burden that has been imposed on many institutions that have unsparingly received this designation.  This is not to say that FSOC's power to designate institutions as systemically important should not be used, but rather that FSOC should exercise its authority judiciously and in its intended manner.  Mr.Ross' bill ensures that the FSOC's designations going forward will be prudent, shrewd, and most important, necessary.  The good news out of Washington is that the culture of overregulation is changing. A new era has been ushered in that thinks twice before regulating, thoughtfully revisits the necessity and effectiveness in past regulations, and considers the burden of future regulations.  Much of this has to do with the changes in leadership at the regulatory agencies and the good work being pursued there. But changes in who creates and enforces the regulations aren't enough.  In order for our small towns to be able to prosper, our small businesses to grow, and our families to succeed, we must continue to pursue legislative changes to regulations that sustain[[Page H3126]]this new era of regulatory cautiousness and predictability.  By pursuing legislative fixes to regulatory problems, we can provide the certainty required by our financial sector, both big and small, to once again provide a bright future for the American economy and for American families.  Mr.Speaker, Mr.Ross' legislation being considered on the floor helps to cement that certainty, and I encourage my colleagues to support the measure here today.

There are design flaws that the NRC's own analysis show lead to radioactive waste leaking into the water table, and transportation plans would ship more than 70,000 metric tons of nuclear waste by train and truck through 329 congressional districts for years to come past your homes, your businesses, your schools, and your churches.  Now some of my colleagues want to make this bad situation even worse by busting the caps on the amount of allowable waste to be stored, increasing the danger and invalidating any existing studies.  If the proponents of Yucca Mountain and their industry donors are really serious about solving the problems of nuclear waste storage, they would follow the Blue Ribbon Commission's recommendations and pass my consent-based bill rather than dumping nuclear waste into a State that does not produce it and does not want it.

128,topic-id,2081,"Mr.President, it was about 2 weeks ago that I had the opportunity to tour a steel plant in Redding, The plant is owned by Carpenter It is a company that was founded in 1889. It is quite extraordinary. It is a vast complex in Redding, They have 2,000 employees in Berks County, which is where Redding is located, and they have an additional 1,200 or so folks throughout other parts of  Carpenter Technology is a leading producer and distributor of specialty metals, including what they call soft magnetics. As I understand it, soft magnetics increase the efficiency and the power and the battery life of electric motors. That is one of the main applications of these soft magnetics. It is a feature in steel and other metals that allows the magnetic properties to be turned on and off very rapidly. It is an amazing technology. It is an absolutely essential component for all kinds of products, including aircrafts, electric cars, even medical devices. It is quite a range of products. One of the things I learned, of the many things I learned while I was at Carpenter Technology, is that tax reform is working for Carpenter  While I was there, the CEO announced a $100 million investment, right there in Redding, Berks County, PA, to upgrade their capabilities and their capacity to produce these soft magnetics. To be more precise, they are buying an entire new hot rolling steel mill in Redding, It is a $100 million investment in a new mill that will allow them to expand their output and meet increasing demand for this really fascinating product that they make.  One of the things the leadership of Carpenter Technology made abundantly clear in their press release and in their public statements was that they were able to purchase this mill and make this $100 million investment in their company now because of the tax reform we passed. This is exactly the type of capital investment we envisioned when we passed the tax reform bill. It was exactly for this kind of economic activity and expansion that we wanted to lower the cost of deploying this capital and expanding business and generate the economic growth and prosperity that comes with this.  By the way, Carpenter Technology is not an outlier. This kind of investment is consistent with the sentiment we are seeing all across the country.  Just at the end of the first quarter--the quarter that just ended--there was a large survey of American chief financial officers--CFOs--across the country. It was carried out by Deloitte It was exploring the question of growth expectations for capital expenditure. The fact is, their conclusion is that these CFOs anticipate greater growth and more hiring. In fact, the sentiment is at a multiyear high. Why is that? Here is what Deloitte had to say about it:       Clearly, there's a high desire for investment in the U.S.,      and that is coming from just the structure of tax reform.      [CFOs] are expecting higher domestic wages, almost 40 percent      are anticipating and planning for higher and front-loaded      capital investments, and about a third higher research and      development. What they've said is because of tax reform      they're going to take those actions.  It is very straightforward. It is very clear.  So here we are, just 3\1/2\ months since passage, and the tax bill has already and continues to benefit workers and businesses, and, boy, these are not the crumbs some of our friends on the other side of the aisle have tried to suggest they are. There are over 500 businesses that we know of--businesses that are sufficiently high profile that we have read about and we can track their announcements. These 500-plus businesses employ over 4 million workers. Over 4 million workers across America have already received bonuses, wage increases, enhanced benefits, and increased contributions to their pension plans. It has already happened, and it is attributable entirely to the tax reform. So the benefits from this tax reform are clearly already flowing to the very workers we intended to benefit from it.  So my friends on the other side have had some struggles in thinking about how they can disparage this tax reform. They have come to realize that calling $1,000 bonuses and multi-thousand-dollar pay raises crumbs is probably not such a good idea. So they have shifted the argument to be a kind of class warfare argument.  I hear two varieties of this most frequently. One is this idea that, well, the benefits all flow to the rich. The second is this idea that, well, these are greedy corporations that get this tax savings, and they just use the money to buy stock back.  Let's unpack this a little bit. What about this argument that it all flows to the rich? Well, there is one problem with that argument. That problem is it is not true; it is not true at all because when we did this tax reform, we did it in a way that makes the Tax Code more progressive. What does that mean? That means that upper income Americans--the wealthiest Americans--have an increased percentage of the total tax burden. So while everybody gets a savings in percentage terms, the savings disproportionately go to lower and middle-income workers and a disproportionately small amount of the savings go to upper income workers. So when the dust clears, the net effect is wealthier people are paying a larger percentage of the total tax bill than they paid beforehand.  So, clearly, the benefits of this tax reform are flowing to everyone and disproportionately to low- and middle-income people.  What about this idea that stock buybacks are such a terrible thing? There have been some stock buybacks. What does that mean? That means companies have taken the additional pretax cash flow they have, and they have decided in some cases that they will take a portion of it and return it to the owners of the company.  It just so happens that about 40 percent of the owners of the public companies in America are the people who have saved in their retirement plans--401(k) plans, IRA savings accounts, 529 plans, defined benefit pension plans. These are middle-income Americans whose savings are invested in the stocks of companies.  In some cases, yes, there have been stock buybacks. That means these savers have had cash introduced into their accounts, which then can be deployed by the managers of these accounts into new investments, which is what happens for anyone who is selling their stock in response to a buyback. They get cash.  What do they do with that cash? They get the chance to reassess where they invest their money, making new[[Page S2064]]investments, making different investments, reallocating capital, and shifting capital to where there is the greatest demand for it. This is exactly the way a free enterprise system should work. This is exactly the mechanism that allows capital to flow to its highest use and helps to encourage still more economic growth.  Better still, this is just the beginning. We are only 3\1/2\ months into this. We haven't yet even begun to reap the benefits--as a country, as a society--of this reformed Tax Businesses are already responding to the incentives, and with the lower after-tax cost of capital we have created, we are seeing increased investment. Whether it is a tractor or a new factory or a piece of machinery or a steel mill in Redding, PA, that investment invariably requires workers to produce that investment, so there is greater job security and more opportunities for those workers. But then the company that actually deploys that investment, such as Carpenter Technology in the case I just mentioned--their workers become more productive; their workers have new tools that allow them to command higher wages and a better standard of living. That is what is happening, and that is going to continue to develop as companies are just now beginning to have the opportunity to deploy that capital only 3\1/2\ months into this new tax regime.  I am just delighted that every week that goes by, I learn about more Pennsylvania workers and more American workers who are working for businesses that are benefiting and enhancing their investments. It is a really good-news story.  Now I will shift a little bit to the CBO report that came out earlier this week, which said a few things worth noting. One should be on all of our radars, and that is the fiscal challenge we face. We have too much debt, and that number is growing too rapidly.  This fiscal year, the gross amount of Federal debt is $21 trillion. By the end of this 10-year window, CBO contemplates that number will go up to $33 trillion. This is a huge problem. But I think it is important that we stress where this problem comes from. This is a spending problem; this is not a revenue problem, and we can see this in CBO numbers.  In June of last year, almost a year ago, CBO projected that over the 10-year window they were considering at the time, we would have $43 trillion of tax revenues flowing into the Federal Government, with $53 trillion of spending--a net deficit over that period of $10 trillion.  One year later, CBO has updated its projections, and now it is calling for $44 trillion in revenue over the current 10-year window. So there will be $1 trillion more in revenue, but $56 trillion in spending--$3 trillion more in spending. So we go from a 10-year window that looks as though the CBO is projecting a $10 trillion deficit to a $12 trillion deficit. Clearly the deficit is growing, and clearly it is driven by the increase in spending.  The bottom line is, whether it is $10 trillion or $12 trillion, this deficit is way too big. But tax reform is going to enhance the revenue collected by the Federal Government by helping us create a larger economy to tax. The spending is our fault. That is something we have to get under control.  CBO has observed a couple of other things. They talk about our tax reform, and they talk about terrific things. They say in the report that the tax reform results in ``higher levels of investment, employment, and GDP.'' We can see dramatically different projections of economic growth post-tax reform, according to the CBO, than we had pre-tax reform, according to the  In January of 2017, they projected that this year the economy would grow 2 percent. But after tax reform passed, they reassessed this year. They took the projection of 2 percent for this year, and they said that now it will grow 3 percent based on tax reform. That is a 50-percent increase in the growth of our economy. That is huge.  For next year, 2019, they were projecting 1.7 percent growth. Now, post-tax reform, they are estimating 2.9 percent growth--1.2 percentage points--again, an almost 50-percent increase. These are huge increases, and they explain it. They say: ``The largest effects on GDP over the decade stem from the tax act . . . boost[ing] the level of real GDP by an average of 0.7 percent . . . over the 2018-2028 period.''  The fact is, this tax bill is already working. It is making the structural changes in the Tax Code that create a greater incentive for businesses to invest. It is making American companies and American workers more competitive than we have been in a very, very long time. It is going to increase the capital stock, the invested assets in our businesses that allow our workers to become more productive, and it is going to continue to allow those more productive workers to earn higher wages.  Let's be honest. No one can prove with certainty what the future holds, so it is worth looking at what is happening in the present. As a result of our tax reform, what is happening today, what is happening in the present is this: Millions of Americans have been receiving bonuses; millions of Americans have been receiving pay raises; millions of Americans have seen increases in their pension contributions; millions of Americans have seen an increase in the value of their pensions; and millions of Americans--like the workers at Carpenter Technology--have seen greater job security and greater opportunity as their employers are investing in their companies, and that is already beneficial for all of us.

While I don't know if this coming week people will see a simplified system, because it hasn't taken effect yet, I know that people who work really hard throughout the Central Valley are already starting to see an increase in their paychecks. I have heard it myself as I have gone around the district talking to constituents; people stopping me in the grocery store bringing up the fact that they are already seeing things in their paychecks. I have even had employers tell me that their employees walked up to them and talked a little bit about the difference they are seeing.  The Central Valley is an area that needs this more than a lot of other areas. When you look at the median income, Central Valley, or at least the 21st Congressional District, is about $40,000. So when you talk about doubling the standard deduction--before this tax plan went into place, about 83 percent of the people filed the standard deduction. Now, with doubling that standard deduction, you are going to see upwards of 90 to 95 percent of people filing the standard deduction.  What does that mean? That means, in the past, people only keep about $12,000 of their first income tax-free. Now they are going to go forward and have the opportunity to earn $24,000 without being taxed. So the first $24,000 isn't going to be touched, and that is impressive.[[Page H3087]]  Then, throughout the Central Valley, a lot of folks, with their children, having families, something that, myself, with three kids, something I am very proud of, we are doubling the child tax credit.

527,topic-id,371,"Mr.Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Alabama for yielding.  Mr.Chair, in recent years, sex trafficking has moved from the streets to the internet. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has witnessed an 846 percent increase in suspected child sex trafficking reports. Eighty-one percent of these reports concern online trafficking facilitated by websites that help traffickers post advertisements of child victims.  I find it hard to imagine that if a neighborhood business hosted a slave auction, the auctioneer would not be considered liable. But that is actually what is happening with websites like backpage.com and hundreds others.  I have spoken with State and local prosecutors across America who want to hold online advertisers accountable for facilitating traffic and promoting prostitution, but they cannot.  Section 230 has been interpreted so broadly that courts have ruled in favor of backpage.com in criminal and civil cases, despite the website's clear criminal conduct. These rulings defy congressional intent.  Twenty-two years ago, Senator Jim Exon from Nebraska, the sponsor of the Communications Decency Act, stated that ``the information superhighway should not become a red-light district.''  Section 230 was an amendment to the CDA that intended to motivate websites to screen explicit content in ``good faith,'' and to shield websites from unfair liability for third-party content. However, section 230 was never intended to shield websites from liability for criminal conduct.  Congress did not intend to allow businesses to commit trafficking crimes online that they could never commit offline. It never meant to imply that criminal conduct can hide behind the defense of legitimate publishing or editing.  H.1865 is a long-overdue clarification of section 230 explaining to America's courts that State and local prosecutors are not handcuffed from protecting their communities and that the State laws should be freely enforced against websites that unlawfully promote prostitution and sex.  Mr.Chair, the Jackson Lee amendment will help us track the use of this new crime, and I am delighted to support it. I thank the gentlewoman for offering it.  Mr.Chair, I am horrified that children and adults are sold on the internet like a T-shirt or takeout. I am horrified that human beings are sold with impunity and have no access to justice.  Today, please vote ``yes'' for justice.  ",CREC-2018-02-27-pt1-PgH1290-2.txt,2137,WELCOMING REVEREND SAM SMUCKER,2018.0,27.0,February
813,topic-id,852,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr.Speaker, I love this opportunity to testify on the rule for H.1865, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, or This legislation has been born, sadly, out of necessity, but has been truly a labor of love for me since I was first elected to Congress over 5 years ago. The bill is the result of meetings with trafficking survivors across the country who have been victimized by the online sex trade and unable to access either justice or relief in our court systems.  Today's consideration of the bill is an historic achievement, a long-awaited clarification from this Congress that the businesses that sell our children online can no longer do so with impunity. It is a clear statement that there are serious legal consequences for websites that actively profit from the exploitation of our most vulnerable. It is a wake-up call to America's judicial system, making clear that section 230 of the Communications Decency Act does not provide immunity to websites that are actively engaged in modern-day slavery.                              {time}  1130  FOSTA is a recommitment to Americans that Congress never intended to create a system that allows businesses to commit crimes online that they could not commit offline. It is in many ways just a simple statement of the obvious: Congress does not believe--and did not ever believe--that rape was a perquisite of a free and open internet.  This bill is a promise to our State and local law enforcement and prosecutors. Congress is making it clear that we believe in and support their missions to protect our communities. Combined with the Walters amendment, which reinstates victim-centered provisions from my original bill last April, this legislation is now a guarantee of the fundamental rights of the most vulnerable members of our society. It is a message to the children and victims who have been robbed of their basic dignities that Congress hears them and is responding to the injustices that they all have faced.  It has not been an easy journey to get to this point, to find middle ground with the tech industry and the victims' advocates to incorporate the concerns of prosecutors and the law enforcement community to move this bill through committee and to get both FOSTA and the SESTA Walters amendment to the floor today. So I am very grateful for the many, many people who joined my crusade to restore justice to the brave children, women, and men across our country who have been sold online.  I am grateful to Chairman Goodlatte and his team for going the extra mile in helping us include a strong, new crime that will enable prosecutors to better target online trafficking and prostitution. I am grateful for the Energy and Commerce Committee and House leadership and their willingness to prioritize this issue.  I must give a big thank-you to Majority Leader McCarthy, our Whip Scalise, and Speaker Ryan for leading the way in doing the right thing for America's children.  I am grateful for Senators Portman and Blumenthal and Senators Cornyn and McCaskill for carrying SESTA on their shoulders and advocating for a solution that allows victims to access the civil remedies that they deserve. I am grateful to each and every one of our 176 bipartisan cosponsors, many of whom personally stopped on the House floor to hear and express their concerns about victims of online sex trafficking. I especially want to mention Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty who fought the good fight on the other side of the aisle for what is truly a landmark, for a bipartisan piece of legislation that is going to save lives.  I am also so thankful for my dedicated staff who have poured their hearts, their minds, and their lives into this fight in more ways than the public will ever know.  FOSTA, combined with the Walters amendment, which is SESTA, will provide better civil justice for victims, more prosecutions of bad actor websites, more convictions, and more predators behind bars. Because of this package, fewer businesses will ever dare to enter the sex trade and fewer victims will be sold into modern-day sex slavery.  Last, but most importantly, I am in awe of and grateful for the contributions of the survivors in this fight to turn FOSTA and SESTA into law. It is heartbreaking to watch survivors struggle to piece their lives back together alone while our justice system shields the websites that sold them. That is why I introduced this bill, and that is why it must become law.  I expect this piece of legislation to sail through the Senate and make its way to the President's desk so that we can put those bad actor websites behind bars, deter others from entering this ecosystem, and make sure that there are rights and justice for our victims.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the Chair and our colleagues because, when we vote today for FOSTA and the Walters amendment, our survivors will know[[Page H1279]]that they are not alone and justice will indeed no longer be out of reach.

1132,topic-id,644,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the Environment Subcommittee, my friend, Mr.Shimkus, who has worked tirelessly--not just this year, not just last year, but probably since the first year he came to Congress--to try and find a permanent solution to the storage of nuclear waste in He has been a tireless worker in this endeavor, a smart worker in this endeavor, and a successful, so far, worker in this endeavor, as this bill passed out of the committee 49-4.  I rise tonight to address this pressing national need, and that is the importance of fixing our broken nuclear waste management program.  It was more than 35 years ago that the United States Congress made a commitment to communities throughout our Nation which host spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste. Congress, the Federal Government, agreed to assign the Department of Energy with the responsibility to permanently dispose of hazardous material, nuclear waste, by 1998.  There are many of those communities, like in the Tri-Cities in Washington State, co-located with the Department of Energy's Hanford site just up Columbia River, across the river from where I live and the people I represent. We have been DOE's partner to help win World War II at that site. It has maintained a nuclear weapon deterrent and powered our fleet of nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers.  Additionally, electricity consumers in many other communities have paid the Federal Government more than $40 billion to develop, license, construct, and operate a nuclear waste repository. They have already paid $40 billion to do this, and that was pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the law that Congress enacted. Yet rate payers have little to see for their investment because, I will call it political science, has deprived the public of the actual science to prove that nuclear waste can be safely and permanently disposed of.  As a consequence of this political interference, taxpayers and rate payers across the country are on the hook for DOE's inaction. The American people pay over $2 million every day to temporarily store used fuel scattered throughout the United So it is up to us to fix this waste management program and stop this cost that will continue in perpetuity if we don't act.  Now, after hearing from dozens of expert witnesses over many years, the Energy and Commerce Committee developed and passed a bipartisan bill by a vote of 49-4. Mr.Shimkus led our effort in this measure.  This legislation makes targeted reforms to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to set the Federal Government up to finally, finally, keep its promise.  Nuclear waste challenges have vexed policymakers for generations.  We, this Congress, have the chance now in a bipartisan way to successfully build a durable solution. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to achieve that goal, which brings about tonight's Special  Now, Mr.Speaker, I just want to show something. This is a piece of glass. This is not actually nuclear waste. The Pacific Northwest National Lab, when I visited Hanford a little while back with Secretary Perry, gave me this because it is an example of what the liquid waste, the waste at Hanford, will end up being.                              {time}  1930  It will look like this in a big cylinder. It is glass. This is what would go to Hanford, and it would be stored safely when that occurs.  If we don't have a repository, these nuclear wastes, in their various forms, will sit around in various locations, not nearly as safe or secure as we can have with the kind of legislation fully enacted that Mr.Shimkus has led on. So I thank Mr.Shimkus for his leadership on this. And I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their encouragement, their participation, their counsel. We are going to get this thing done.  ",CREC-2018-03-05-pt1-PgH1357.txt,1596,DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION GOOD CITIZENS AWARD,2018.0,5.0,February

90,topic-id,1005,"Mr.President, I am here today to urge my colleagues to oppose the confirmation of two Trump nominees--John Ring, who has been nominated to the National Labor Relations Board, and Patrick Pizzella, who has been nominated Deputy Secretary of These two nominees have been selected to hold critical jobs to protect workers. That is what these jobs are about.  I will be blunt. I start with a pretty high bar here since, despite his campaign rhetoric from 2 years ago, the President's track record on standing up for workers has been absolutely miserable. From the day he nominated Andrew Puzder--an executive who delighted in mocking and belittling his own low-wage workers--to run the Department of Labor, this administration has delivered one gut punch after another to America's working people.  The National Labor Relations Board is responsible for protecting the rights of workers to organize and bargain for better wages and benefits, so as we consider President Trump's latest nominee for the Board, it makes sense to look at what his nominees so far have already done.  Look at the new Republican majority's very first week back on the job back in In just 5 days, the Board mowed its way through a giant wish list of areas where giant companies were begging to be let off the hook for violating workers' rights.  Allowing employers to shirk their collective bargaining obligations by contracting out workers?  Making it easier for employers to control the outcome of union elections.  Opening the door for workplace rules that chill workers' ability to join together on the job.  Allowing cases to be ``settled'' without input from the workers whose rights are affected by the settlement.  Just as troubling as these anti-worker decisions themselves are the egregious conflicts of interest behind them.  From the moment he was nominated by President Trump, I have repeatedly raised concerns about Board Member William Emanuel's history of representing big corporations that have abused their workers and about his mile-long list of potential conflicts of interest. Sure enough, after just a few months on the Board, NLRB's inspector general determined that Mr.Emanuel participated in not one but two important decisions involving his former law firm, which directly violated his ethics pledge. In response, the Board vacated one of its most consequential decisions of the last year, and Member Emanuel lost any remaining credibility that he could be an impartial Board member. So I called on him to resign.  Now the President wants us to put John Ring on the I have asked Mr.Ring to provide a list of clients and cases that might require his recusal. To his credit, he has done so. But Mr.Ring's long list of clients is a huge red flag. Either he will ignore the ethics rules when they are inconvenient--like Mr.Emanuel did--or he will likely have to recuse himself from important cases.  A large number of potential conflicts of interest isn't the only thing Mr.Ring has in common with Mr.Like Emanuel, Mr.Ring has also spent his career representing large employers against workers, and his few public statements on the NLRB express a belief that the Board has been too friendly to workers and that corporations have gotten the short end of the stick.  After decades of stagnant wages and skyrocketing corporate profits, does[[Page S2028]]anyone other than insider lobbyists and lawyers think that Washington is working for middle-class families and that big corporations are the ones under attack? I don't think so. That is exactly why an NLRB that looks out for workers is more important than ever. President Trump's NLRB is failing miserably at that mission.  Working Americans deserve Board members with a demonstrated record of fighting for workers, not against them. They deserve Board members who aren't ethically and legally constrained from doing the job. Mr.Ring does not meet those qualifications.  Workers need an NLRB that works for them, and they need leaders at the Department of Labor who are going to be on their side, not on the side of giant employers and extreme, rightwing donors. Patrick Pizzella has been nominated to the 2 job at the Department of Labor, and nothing in Mr.Pizzella's resume tells us that he meets the description of being on the side of workers.  In the 1990s, Mr.Pizzella lobbied with Jack Abramoff to exempt the Northern Mariana Islands from Federal labor laws. Do you know what that did? That allowed companies to run sweatshops while slapping ``Made in America'' labels on their products.  Later, when Mr.Pizzella was in charge of data management and other operations at the Labor Department, the Government Accountability Office found that the Wage and Hour Division was egregiously mishandling wage theft complaints, consistently leaving vulnerable low-wage workers out to dry, because of faulty data systems and other operational failures.  After leaving the Department, Mr.Pizzella went to work for secretive, far-right donor groups, such as the Conservative Action Project, which secretly planned out the 2013 government shutdown to sabotage the Affordable Care Act and undermine many workers' access to healthcare, all while Mr.Pizzella was its highest paid employee.  The Deputy Secretary position should be filled by someone who has defended worker rights, not undermined them, someone who will make government work for the American people, not hamstring it for political purposes. Mr.Pizzella is the wrong man for this job.  President Trump talked a big game during his campaign about fighting for workers, but after a year of corporate tax cuts and rolling back commonsense protections for workplace safety, retirement security, and more, we know that those promises have turned out not to be worth much of anything.  The Senate should send a clear message to this administration that we expect agencies like the NLRB and the Labor Department to stand up for working people, not to suck up to corporate lobbyists. Rejecting these two nominees would be a good first step.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Cruz). Under the previous order, all time has expired.

1255,topic-id,1382,"Mr.President, I rise today to call on President Trump to nominate a Director for the Indian Health  There are many critical issues facing Indian Country--economic development, infrastructure, protection of Native lands, respect for Tribal governments--and after years and years of broken promises, discrimination, and neglect, Washington owes Tribes a fighting chance to build stronger communities and a brighter future.  The Federal Indian trust responsibility means that Washington has a basic legal obligation to the Washington also has a fundamental moral obligation, and that starts with basic healthcare.  American Indians have treaty rights to healthcare from the Federal Government, but the U.Government cannot fulfill our treaty obligations if key posts, such as the Director of IHS, lay vacant for years.  The IHS is a big deal. It is the primary Federal healthcare provider for American Indians and Alaska It serves 2.2 million people spread across 36 It has a budget of nearly $5 billion annually. The IHS provides care through more than 660 clinics, hospitals, and health stations on or near reservations, many of them in remote and rural locations located hours away from other health facilities. It serves more than 13 million outpatient visitors a year.  The doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers at IHS hospitals and clinics do everything from delivering babies, to providing dental services, to fighting the opioid crisis.  Right now, more than a year into President Trump's term, there is still no permanent leader at the Indian Health Two weeks ago, the nomination for IHS Director was withdrawn, and there hasn't been a Senate-confirmed Director for years. This leadership vacuum creates a serious problem. The IHS cannot engage in long-term planning without a permanent Director at the helm. It cannot officially fix problems at hospitals that failed inspections and where Medicare and Medicaid funding is in jeopardy. It cannot move as decisively to ensure that IHS facilities stay open. It cannot implement agency-wide standards for quality of care, as the Government Accountability Office has recommended. The IHS cannot prioritize competing issues, solve serious and longstanding problems, or work through how to meet multiple goals more effectively.  Its relationship with other Federal agencies is weakened without a stable leader--critical relationships with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Office of Management and Budget, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and the rest of the Department of Health and Human It cannot ensure that programs like the Special Diabetes Program for Indians, which has created real, positive outcomes, is implemented as well as possible. The IHS cannot work out a direction for the Service and hold a single stable leader accountable for doing a good job.  The IHS faces serious challenges that require the attention of a permanent, dedicated The agency is underfunded and has been underfunded for a long time. As a result, its facilities often lack medical equipment that many Americans take for granted when they visit a clinic or a hospital, like an MRI machine or a functioning operating room. A 2016 report by the inspector general of the U.Department of Health and Human Services found that IHS hospital administrators have had difficulty recruiting and retaining critical staff. Aging hospital buildings and outdated equipment also raise concerns about patient safety. The inspector general cites concerns about corroded pipes leaking sewage into the OR and not being able to find replacement parts to fix old equipment the hospitals are relying on. Doctors and nurses should be able to focus on helping their patients get well, not on whether the building is habitable and basic facilities are available.  There are also serious staffing shortages. At its Great Plains facilities, for example, IHS vacancy rates have reached 37 percent. Compare that to my home State of Massachusetts, where only 6 percent of nursing jobs were vacant in 2015.  Tribal leaders are understandably concerned about the direction of an[[Page S1237]]agency that plays such a vital role in their communities. Here is what I heard from Chairwoman Cheryl Andrews-Maltais, of the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head--the Aquinnah--in Massachusetts: ``This vacancy has created significant instability and negatively affects the already burdened IHS system.'' She added: ``Not only is it a failure on the part of the Federal Government to not adequately fund healthcare for Indians; the failure to appoint someone to lead this critical service area is considered by many Tribes as gross negligence.'' The chairwoman says that the United States is failing to keep its word and failing to fulfill its ``solemn responsibility'' to the I agree with the chairwoman.  Healthcare is a basic human right, and everyone in this country deserves access to quality, affordable healthcare. But the stakes are particularly high for Native people.  An American Indian or Alaska Native baby born today has a life expectancy that is almost 4\1/2\ years shorter than the U.average. These little babies are also more likely to die before they ever reach their first birthday. Native infant mortality is about 25 percent higher than for the U.as a whole.  Chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease hit Native Americans harder too. For instance, American Indians and Alaska Natives die from diabetes at a rate that is three times higher than that of the entire American population.  Mental health and addiction issues are also a very big concern. The opioid epidemic has devastated communities all over our country, but it is a particularly virulent problem for Native Americans, who have the highest per capita rates of opioid overdoses in the country.  Similarly, the alcohol-related death rate for Native Americans is about 500 percent higher than for the rest of the population.  Suicide rates are about 70 percent higher.  Everyone struggling with addiction deserves access to high-quality treatment, no matter who they are or where they live. That is the only way we are going to make progress in tackling this crisis. But right now, in a place where the need is great, the Federal Government is failing to provide adequate care.  With so much need, investing in improving the IHS should be a top priority for I am glad that the Trump administration's latest budget for the IHS includes a funding increase. Still, this government needs to do more--much more. A Senate-confirmed Director can serve as the advocate the IHS needs in order to get the resources it deserves. In fact, Federal law explicitly says that advocating good Indian health policy is one of the Director's job responsibilities. We should be doing that job.  We need a good person in this job, which means the nominee must be thoroughly vetted. But that is not an excuse for more delay or for the White House to drag its feet. It needs to work with the Tribes to find the right person for the job and then submit the nomination quickly.  The person who heads up the IHS should be knowledgeable and should have a vision for how to deliver better healthcare to Native The person should have the determination and commitment to push Congress to meet its treaty obligations in providing healthcare to Native communities.  The Trump administration doesn't have a stellar record when it comes to nominating the right people for important jobs. I often strongly disagree with the President's picks. But leaving hundreds of critical posts across our government vacant, including the IHS Director, has a devastating effect all its own.  It wasn't until just 2 weeks ago that President Trump finally named a nominee to be Commissioner of the Administration for Native  Several offices in the Federal bureaucracy have an important role in running important programs for Tribes, and the President hasn't nominated heads for some of those offices--for instance, the Director of the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women, which administers key grant programs for Tribal programs to combat domestic violence and sexual assault, and the Assistant Secretary of the Employment and Training Administration in the Department of Labor, which provides workforce innovation and opportunity grants to Tribes and Tribal organizations. These vacancies hit Native communities hard, and they represent one more broken promise to Native people.  There is no excuse for delay. I urge President Trump to move quickly to consult with Tribes and to submit a nomination for IHS The Native community should not have to wait any longer.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-27-pt1-PgS1234.txt,2182,TRIBUTE TO ANTHONY STOKS,2018.0,27.0,March

I would like to begin by thanking this body for the passing of the National Oceans and Coastal Security Fund as part of the measure that Republicans and Democrats agreed to before the recent recess. The Presiding Officer obviously represents an extremely coastal I represent Rhode Island, a very coastal This new program will provide resources for the communities along our shores to be able to deal with the threats they are seeing from sea level rise, fisheries moving about, worsening offshore storms, tides that now come ashore on bright sunny days, and the various hazards that they must undertake so that they are not left alone trying to address them.  I often use these speeches to explore why it is that we get nothing done in Congress on climate. I point out that the major reason is the insidious fossil-fuel-funded web of climate change denial, with a parallel lobbying and electioneering effort.  I point out that this network is funded by the fossil fuel industry in a deliberate and systematic effort to misdirect public discussion and to distort public understanding of climate change and climate science.  I point out that it is actually working. It has been so effective at infiltrating our political system that the head of the U.Environmental Protection Agency is a full-on fossil fuel flunky. I discuss the fossil fuel industry's parallel web that directs rivers of dark money into our political system and deploys related, but more clandestine, threats and promises to work the industry's will in  Like I said, it is working. The web of denial and political enforcement organizations has so far achieved its purpose: to prevent Congress from carrying out its responsibility to rein in carbon pollution. We are, as a result, failing to protect the American people and our economy from the effects of that pollution, particularly our coastal economies. But now agriculture and other economies are feeling it too, and Congress is still doing nothing.  So this secretive and insidious apparatus deserves our attention. Nowadays, this apparatus is dedicated to denying science, confusing the public, and holding a political whip hand over Congress on the issue of climate change. Nowadays, it does this to protect the fossil fuel industry from responsibility for its pollution. But it is actually not a new enterprise.  We have never seen this machinery operating at this scale before. It is bigger and more multifaceted than ever, but we have seen its tricks before. The science denial playbook, commissioned by the Koch brothers, ExxonMobil, and the U.Chamber of Commerce to stymie climate action, is the same doubt-mongering playbook we have seen used by Big Tobacco, by chemical industries, and by other corporate polluters for decades.  I am not the only one who has noticed. A lot of work has examined this denial apparatus--how it is funded, how it hides its funding, how it communicates, and how it propagates the denial message. This is valuable work because the better America understands the mechanisms of this deceitful operation, the better America can inoculate itself against that deceit.  So I have brought some of this work with me to the Senate floor today. It is kind of a beginner's bibliography of this apparatus.  I will start with a book called ``Deceit and Denial,'' and, on the cover, described by Bill Moyers as ``the best detective story I've read in years.'' This[[Page S2031]]book is written by Gerald Markowitz and David Rosner, who have been tracking the efforts of industry to hide scientific facts about pollution for a long time. They point out in their introduction here:       Some industries . . . have reassured the public that their      products are benign by controlling research and manipulating      science. Throughout much of the twentieth century, most      scientific studies of the health effects of toxic substances      have been done by researchers in the employ of industry or in      universities with financial ties to members of that industry.      At times their results were subject to review by industry; if      the results indicated a problem, the information was      suppressed.  This goes way back into the annals of denial.  My next book is ``Poison Tea.'' It is a book written by Jeff It goes back into the tobacco documents that were protected in the tobacco settlement. The attorneys general demanded that the documents of the tobacco companies be set aside as a permanent reference. Jeff Nesbit was present at some of the efforts to create the tobacco industry version of climate denial. He saw it happening up close. He was in some of the meetings. In chapter 25, he opens up with this:       If the 14 million internal tobacco industry memos and      documents show one thing clearly, it is this: political      campaign networks built to defend and promote large corporate      interests with integrated goals, messaging, targets, and      allies simply don't materialize overnight. The funding and      strategies behind them take years to develop before reaching      maturity. And they build on each other over time.  I turn now to ``Doubt is Their Product.'' This is David Michaels' book. The subtitle is ``How Industry's Assault on Science Threatens Your Health.''  The quotation I have selected moves from the general principle of science denial on behalf of industries into global warming as this scheme moved forward:       Take global warming. The vast majority of climate      scientists believe there is adequate evidence of global      warming to justify immediate intervention to reduce the human      contribution.  Now, this was written, just to be clear, in 2008, a decade ago--a decade ago:       The vast majority of climate scientists believe there is      adequate evidence global warming to justify immediate      intervention to reduce the human contribution. They      understand that waiting for absolute certainty is far      riskier--and potentially far more expensive--than acting      responsibly now--  That is, 10 years ago--     to control the causes of climate change. Opponents of action,      led by the fossil fuels industry, delayed this policy      debate--  And for another decade--     by challenging the science with a classic uncertainty      campaign.  He cites what he calls a cynical memo that Republican political consultant Frank Luntz delivered to his clients in early 2003, saying:       The scientific debate is closing [against us] but not yet      closed. There is still a window of opportunity to challenge      the science.       Luntz understood that his clients can oppose (and delay)      regulation . . . by simply manufacturing uncertainty. Doubt      is their product.  The next book is by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway, entitled ``Merchants of Doubt,'' which was actually made into a film as well. They have done a lot of work in this area.  Here is the conclusion:       Doubt-mongering works because we think science is about      facts--cold, hard, definite facts.       This is a mistake. There are always uncertainties in any      live science because science is a process of discovery.       Doubt is crucial to science . . . but it also makes science      vulnerable to misrepresentation, because it is easy to take      uncertainties out of context and create the impression that      everything is unresolved. This was the tobacco industry's key      insight: That you could use normal scientific uncertainty to      undermine the status of actual scientific knowledge.       ``Doubt is our product,'' ran the infamous memo written by      one tobacco industry executive in 1969.  ``Merchants of Doubt'' goes on to describe how that exact same technique--and many of the same individuals and organizations--carried that over from tobacco smoke to global warming. Subtitle: ``How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming.''  This is a book by Pulitzer Prize winning author Steve He is actually speaking tonight at the Library of This book is called ``Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power.'' It describes the mischief that Exxon got up to in pursuing its political goals here in He describes the underlying structure of Washington policy debates. He calls it a ``kaleidoscope of overlapping and competing influence campaigns, some open, some conducted by front organizations, and some entirely clandestine.''  Obviously, if you are ExxonMobil, you don't want your name on all of this stuff--hence, the ``kaleidoscope of overlapping and competing influence campaigns, some open, some conducted by front organizations, and some entirely clandestine.''  He continues:       Strategists created layers of disguise, subtlety, and      subterfuge--corporate-funded ``grassroots'' programs and      purpose-built think tanks, as fingerprint-free as possible.      In such an opaque and untrustworthy atmosphere, the ultimate      advantage lay with any lobbyist whose goal was to manufacture      confusion and perpetual controversy. On climate, this      happened to be the oil industry's position.  In his book ``The War on Science,'' Shawn Otto goes in some detail through the scheming that backs up what he calls ``a steady stream of pseudoscience that can be used by foot soldiers to sway the public debate.''  He goes through a number of steps that are the standard parts of this campaign, starting with phony science:       Phony science . . . that creates ``uncertainties'' about      the accepted views of mainstream science.  So you start off with phony science that creates phony uncertainties about the accepted views of mainstream science.       Step two follows with slanted press materials spoon-fed to      journalists by industry-affiliated nonprofits and bloggers.  A third step of this PR battle is what he calls ``building and financing industry-aligned front groups (fake public-interest organizations) and astroturf groups (fake grassroots organizations).''  And we sure do see those fake public interest organizations and fake grassroots organizations whipped up by the fossil fuel industry today.  Step 4 is outlier scientists--the ones who can cook up the pseudoscience that can be used by foot soldiers:       Outlier scientists are recruited to publish in phony      journals and speak at conferences of physicians, lawyers, and      other professionals, emphasizing the controversy and sowing      ``uncertainties'' and denial, thus using peer-pressure to      create true believers among the influential opinion leaders.  You then shove out into ``industry-aligned, or otherwise sympathetic talk-radio and cable-news purveyors, who reference these mainstream sources, react with outrage, and call for policy action.'' This provides political cover for legislative or other ``policy action by partisan allies in government.''       Industry representatives can step safely out from behind      the curtain for the main act of the culture-war drama and      plead their case to policymakers. . . . The strategy is      designed to neutralize the primacy of objective knowledge--  We wouldn't want to make decisions around here based on objective knowledge--     and slowly move public opinion toward accepting the      industry's position as the only truly reasonable one,      subverting the democratic process.  From my experience, that is a pretty good description as to how this game is played.  Thank you, Shawn  Two of the people who do some of the best work looking at this climate denial apparatus and tracking its funding are academic writers Riley Dunlap and Robert Their book, ``Climate Change and Society,'' drills into this pretty well. Here is the description.       Over time, manufacturing uncertainty has evolved into      ``manufacturing controversy,'' creating the impression that      there is major debate and dissent within the scientific      community over the reality of anthropogenic climate change.      To accomplish this, corporations and especially CTTs have      supported a small number of contrarian scientists (many with      no formal training in climate science) and other self-styled      ``experts'' (often social scientists affiliated with CTTs) to      produce non-peer-reviewed reports and books, publish in a      handful of marginal journals, hold ``scientific''      conferences, compile dubious lists of supposed scientists who      question climate change, and in general mimic the workings of      conventional science . . . fashioning a ``parallel scientific      universe'' that serves to generate confusion among the public      and policymakers.  Thank you, Riley Dunlap and Robert Brulle for your years of research.[[Page S2032]]  Recently Jane Mayer's book, ``Dark Money,'' has gotten a lot of attention. It focuses on the extent to which the Koch brothers specifically use the caverns for subterranean dark money to mess around in our politics. Following up on the use of conservative think tanks, we have an early--I guess you would say ``strategizer'' of this effort quoted as saying:       It would be necessary to use ambiguous and misleading      names, obscure the true agenda, and conceal the means of      control.  That is the background. This whole development of the think tank is described here this way:       In the 1970s, with funding from a handful of hugely wealthy      donors . . . as well as some major corporate support, a whole      new form of ``think tank'' emerged that was more engaged in      selling predetermined ideology to politicians and the public      than undertaking scholarly research.  To use her phrase, it was ``the think tank as disguised political weapon.''  That is part of what we are up against.  ``Democracy in Chains,'' a book by Nancy MacLean, looks back at some of the early history through which the Koch brothers and others funded this operation. It points out that ``the Koch team's most important stealth move, and the one that proved most critical to success, was to wrest control over the machinery of the Republican Party, beginning in the late 1990s and with sharply escalating determination after 2008.''  What made them want to do this? I will read. The Koch cadre identified the public's embrace of environmentalism as a problem early on. They then pulled together--     a circle of less-known Koch-funded libertarian think tanks      driving what two science scholars describe as systematic      environmental ``misinformation campaigns.'' They spread junk      pseudoscience to make the public believe that there is still      doubt about the peril of climate change, a tactic they      learned from the tobacco companies that for years sowed doubt      about science to keep the public from connecting smoking and      illness.       The Koch team by then could count on its Club for Growth to      fund primary challenges to ensure that the party line on      environmentalism would be maintained by Republican members of      . . . ``We're looking at a party,'' the economist      and columnist Paul Krugman rightly points out, ``that has      turned its back on science at a time when doing so puts the      very future of civilization at risk.''       Backing up that chokehold on federal action is what one      reporter called a ``secretive alliance'' between red-state      attorneys general and fossil fuel corporations.  Again, we link back to my earlier remarks. One of the red States' attorneys general who link up with the fossil fuel corporations is none other than our EPA Administrator, Scott  She concludes it this way:       To put all this another way: if the Koch-network-funded      academics and institutions were not in the conversation, the      public would have little doubt that the evidence of science      is overwhelming and government action to prevent further      global warming is urgent.  I will close with a return to Jane Mayer, whose research on this whole dark money problem that bedevils our democracy has been nothing less than heroic, in my view. She wrote recently:       If there was any lingering doubt that a tiny clique of      fossil-fuel barons has captured America's energy and      environmental policies, it was dispelled . . . when the Trump      Administration withdrew from the Paris climate accord. . . .      [A] majority of Americans in literally every state wanted to      remain within the agreement, and . . . the heads of many of      the country's most successful and iconic Fortune 100      companies, from Disney to General Electric, did, too. . . .      Yet . . . a tiny--and until recently, almost faceless--     minority somehow prevailed.       How this happened is no longer a secret. The answer . . .      is ``a story of big political money.'' It is, perhaps, the      most astounding example of influence-buying in modern      American political history.  It is focused now on climate change because climate change is--and I quote her again here--`` `a direct challenge to the most powerful industry that has ever existed on the face of the There's no depth to which they are unwilling to sink to challenge anything threatening their interests.' ''  That is a pretty good description by a lot of very well-regarded, and some in cases, Pulitzer Prize winning and award-winning writers and researchers about where we are. The result of all that is the gridlock that these interests have bought and paid for in Congress on this critical issue and an administration that is driven by fossil fuel interests to roll back all regulations that impinge on fossil fuel profits. Using that screen these authors have talked about--and that I have talked about--of think tanks and foundations and public relations firms and trade associations and, of course, those rivers of dark money flowing through subterranean political caverns, this industry--the fossil fuel industry--has taken control of and disabled our American political system. That is a very inconvenient truth for those in our political system, but its inconvenience takes away nothing from its truth.  Thanks to these authors and researchers and many others like them--many others like them--the truth of what has happened is plain. It is not just plain in these books. It will be plain before the reckoning gaze of history. There will be a reckoning. History always looks back, ultimately. If you look at these books and you look at others and you look at the record of what has taken place and the reporting, there is no doubt that this is the biggest influence-buying operation of all time. Do we in Congress really want to be found on the side of this crooked apparatus when that reckoning comes? God, I hope not. It is time to wake up.  I yield the floor.

1253,topic-id,2305,"Mr.President, I am here for my 198th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech with my increasingly dog-eared and beaten chart.  My last two speeches focused on, shall we say, the peculiar role two of this country's largest trade associations play on climate change. They have dozens and dozens of member companies that support action on climate change. Renewable energy now provides more jobs than fossil fuels and lots of American manufacturing. Yet the U.Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers spend millions and millions of dollars lobbying Congress against climate action, against renewables, and in favor of the fossil fuel industry. Go figure.  In 2016, Senator Warren and I surveyed the 108 companies on the chamber of commerce's board, and we couldn't find a single one that would endorse the chamber's anti-climate lobbying--not one. Many of these companies had very public pro-climate positions. None said they had even been consulted by the chamber about the chamber's anti-climate crusade.  The U.Chamber of Commerce's war on climate action isn't just in lobbying It also spends tens of millions of dollars in elections, using political attack ads to sink pro-climate candidates. So I asked in my last speeches: Why? Why does the chamber and NAM advance the special interests of the fossil fuel industry, opposing climate action, ignoring their own pro-climate members, and turning their backs on the whole renewable energy and green technology economy? Why, indeed.  Well, today I would like to talk about a fossil fuel trade association--the American Petroleum Institute,[[Page S1235]]API is a slightly different beast than the chamber and It represents the oil and gas industry. You wouldn't expect it to care about renewable energy or green technology. API's policy positions should align with the big oil companies it represents, but it gets complicated. It gets complicated because the big oil companies all claim to support action on climate change. Here is what ExxonMobil claims: ``The risk of climate change is clear and the risk warrants action.''  In 2009, then-Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson said the company supported a price on carbon. That is supposedly ExxonMobil's position today.  Here is Shell on carbon pricing: ``The transition to low-carbon solutions is best underpinned by meaningful government-led carbon `pricing' mechanisms.''  On the Paris Agreement, Exxon publicly supported the Paris Agreement, as did Chevron, as did Shell, as did In addition, BP and Shell signed on to an initiative to eliminate methane flaring.  So summing up, all of the major oil companies supported the Paris Three out of four, including ExxonMobil--the big kahuna--publicly support putting a price on carbon emissions, and two of them even support eliminating methane flaring.  So where is the American Petroleum Institute on these policies? Let's start with the Paris API funds a group called the American Council on Capital Formation, which, along with the Chamber of Commerce, funded the debunked study claiming that the Paris Agreement would cause massive job losses and huge costs. This debunked report was cited by President Trump as justification for withdrawing from the Paris accord. So API funded the report used as a basis for withdrawal--but wait. It gets better. The authors of this API-funded study are the same two characters API hired way back in 1997 and 1998 to write similar reports critical of the Kyoto The Kyoto Protocol, of course, was violently opposed in the Senate by the fossil fuel industry and  So here we are 20 years after Kyoto, and API used almost exactly the same playbook--even the same personnel--against the Paris Agreement that they had used against the Kyoto accord, except that this time API paid for the report through a front group to hide API's hand in torpedoing the Paris How do you relate that to the stated position of the four oil majors for the Paris Agreement? You would have to ask API to explain.  So now let's look at API's position on carbon pricing, which three out of those four oil majors say they support. API's President has claimed that his organization doesn't have an official position on carbon pricing, but if you take a look at API's website, it is loaded with comments critical of putting a price on carbon, and API also funded yet another study claiming that a price on carbon emissions would be bad for the economy.  On the issue of methane flaring, API out front led the charge against Department of the Interior and Environmental Protection Agency rules. Its lobbying campaign has paid off, as two of Trump's fossil fuel stooges, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, are busily trying to dismantle these rules. Luckily, they are not very bright about it, and courts keep upending their schemes.  Let's look at the lobbying. Big Oil money provides much of API's power in the Halls of API has spent over $100 million lobbying the Federal Government, and apparently its lobbying goes against the wishes as stated by its biggest clients, the four oil majors. If you look, there is a big bump up in 2009 and here through 2016--the Obama years--when they wanted to go in and stop all kinds of progress on climate change.  In this building, we all know perfectly well that API is not here lobbying for a price on carbon. We know perfectly well that if a Republican were to say, ``I am for a price on carbon,'' or sign on to a bill, they would probably get a visit from API saying, ``Whoa, not so fast there, partner.'' We know perfectly well that they are not in this building lobbying for the Paris accord.  So why the discrepancy? Is it possible that all of this money--$100 million--is being thrown around without the approval of the big oil companies? Has the American Petroleum Institute sort of gone off on its own, off the leash, free range, running away from the oil companies? It is a puzzlement, this vast gulf between the pro-climate policies the oil majors say they support and the anti-climate policies the API lobbyists support.  I said one possibility is, Big Oil doesn't know how its lobbying money is being spent. Maybe those CEOs have lost control of their own trade association and don't even know it. I mean, after all, around here, who pays attention to their own lobbying operation, anyway? Maybe the $100 million is such chump change to the big oil companies that they have just lost track of it, like we might lose change in our couch cushions.  Maybe--cover your ears, young pages, because I may say something shocking here--maybe it is a scam. It is totally shocking that a big corporation will say one thing and do another. What a concept, but it is a concept that works out great for Big The Big Oil CEOs get to go to cocktail parties in Davos or on Fifth They get to go to international conferences, and with all their sophisticated friends, they get to say: Hey, we are not a bunch of science-hating, heads-in-the-sand climate deniers. We have sensible climate policies.  At the same time, they can send their lobbying goons out to make sure no one in Congress takes that ``sensible climate policies'' nonsense seriously. It is great. Have your front group do your dirty work for you, fill your websites with happy assurances, while you let API loose on Washington to crush any pro-climate policies that might actually reduce carbon emissions and threaten your bottom line.  Hypocrisy? Yes, but then hypocrisy is famously the tribute vice pays to virtue. I suppose it is at least a start. It is a sign that we have reached the point where Big Oil recognizes the need to try to at least look virtuous. That is a start, but it still leaves us with this huge disconnect between the pro-climate policies the big oil companies claim to support and their American Petroleum Institute's relentless anti-climate lobbying.  Remember, throughout the oil industry's decades-long campaign against climate action, they knew all along. Exxon knew decades ago about the effects of carbon pollution, but they worked through an elaborate web of front groups to propagate doubt and denial about the science they knew.  Shell knew too. In 1991, Shell even produced a documentary warning about the serious threat climate change posed to the future of civilization. Despite acknowledging this threat, Shell, like Exxon, continued to fund API and other front groups that sought to mislead the public about climate change and opposed climate action here in  Exxon's trade group--this American Petroleum Institute--also knew. They knew of the reality of climate change. They knew it was caused by carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and they knew of the danger it poses. Way back in 1959--almost 60 years ago--API was warned by an eminent scientist that if we kept burning fossil fuels, we would increase the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Back in 1959, they were warned. The prediction they received was that it would warm the atmosphere, melt the icecaps, and submerge coastal cities and towns, as we are beginning to see along the Florida coastline right now. That was the prediction in 1959.  In 1959, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 316 parts per million. Then, in 1968, a group of scientists API had itself commissioned warned API that significant temperature changes could occur by the year 2000 and that, ultimately, potential damage to the environment could be severe. By 1968, the atmosphere concentration of CO2 was up to 323 parts per million.  In 1980, scientists hired by API again warned API that carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels were likely to have catastrophic effects. By 1980, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 was 339. In 1983, API disbanded the scientific working group it had created to study global warming. Apparently, API didn't like what it was hearing so, in 1983, they shut it off. There is a legal term for when you are on notice but[[Page S1236]]then just turn away; it is called ``willful ignorance.'' By 1983, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 was 343 parts per million.  Then came 1999, when James Hansen's famous Senate testimony threatened API's willful ignorance scheme. So API and its Big Oil members founded a front group with the misleading name Global Climate What is it with these front groups and these people, anyway? Why is it always these front groups? Global Climate Coalition began to spread falsehoods and disinformation about climate science, even though in 1989 they knew. In 1989, they had known for 30 years, since that first report in 1959, and by 1989 the atmospheric concentration was 353 parts per million.  In 1993, API hired one of the same men who wrote those phony Kyoto and Paris reports that I mentioned to write a report attacking President Clinton's so-called Btu tax on fuel sources. In 1993, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere was up to 357 parts per million. In 1998, API did that report attacking the Kyoto It also commissioned what it called its Global Climate Science Communications Plan, a plan designed to mislead Americans about climate science. By 1998, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 was 367 parts per million.  In 2009, API fought and killed the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade legislation that would have controlled carbon emissions. By 2009, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 was 387 parts per million.  Now here we are in 2018. API is still fighting climate action. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is now 407 parts per million, almost 30 percent higher than it was when API probably first learned what climate science meant. As we have kept dumping carbon pollution into the atmosphere, temperatures and sea levels have indeed steadily risen--just as API was told they would. They knew, but they lied.  For decades, they lied on a massive industrial scale. They lied through phony science. They lied through phony front groups and bogus studies. They lied through talk shows. They lied through rightwing media. They lied through AstroTurf, and well-paid PR firms. They lied for decades, and now the American people have to pay the price of climate change to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars.  So, from their point of view, what the heck? After decades of lying about climate change, what is a little discrepancy now between what Big Oil CEOs say and what Big Oil lobbyists do? The industry's sophisticated and expensive disinformation and lobbying campaign has blockaded climate action in this country for more than half a century. When you have been lying that long, maybe it is a hard habit to break.  Looking back at this whole scam, I guess API and its members actually see it as a win--nearly 60 years of industry profits they protected behind the barricade of lies, but at what price to our country? At what price to Americans whose lives have already, in many cases, been upended by climate change? At what price to people around the world who will suffer the effects of climate change and one day want an answer about why America, through all this period, let this take place--why America let them down.  The time for deception, the time for front groups, for misinformation, for inaction is over. API and its fossil fuel allies over at the U.Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers have blocked climate action in Congress long enough. Look at the price we paid to allow the fossil fuel lobby to dictate climate policy in this great body. Four hundred seven parts per million is a measurement, and it is a measurement unprecedented in the full span of human history on this planet.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1114,topic-id,886,"Mr.President, this Chamber is familiar with deadlines and has a habit of running up against them. We cannot lose sight of May 12, the deadline when President Trump will make a decision about sanctions on  In January, the President waived sanctions for the last time, calling on Congress to ``either fix the deal's disastrous flaws, or the United States will withdraw.'' We now have less than 3 months--a period in which bipartisan consensus on the issue of Iran is absolutely necessary.  To reimpose sanctions would effectively signal the end of America's participation in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the JCPOA, an agreement better known as the Iran nuclear deal. The plan is flawed, and we cannot fix it without action.  I ask my colleagues for cooperation and collaboration so that we can act in the national interest and prevent the nefarious aims of the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. When it comes to Iran, we must put aside our differences and work together on a bipartisan bill.  I know that the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Corker, has been working with Senator Cardin on this issue. Their efforts are commendable and necessary.  Let me stress again that this effort must be bipartisan. One-sided legislation would signal division and weakness on the issue of A partisan bill would also undermine our diplomatic efforts with the P5+1 countries to improve the JCPOA through a supplemental agreement. I am confident we can do our part.  First, Congress has repeatedly demonstrated its support for countering Iran's malign activities. Second, President Trump has laid out a clear road map for legislation that he would sign. Finally, this President has the will to walk away. He has made this promise, and I believe he will keep it.  Let me explore these three points in turn. 1, we have a long history of acting in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion on this issue. Last August, the President signed the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions The legislation included tough new sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program, on its sponsorship of terrorism, and its human rights abuses. The Senate approved it by a vote of 98 to 2, and it earned a vote of 419 to 3 in the House--bipartisan majorities. We also passed by voice vote Senator Rubio and Senator Shaheen's bill to crack down on illicit financing for Iran's client The House companion also passed by a voice vote.  We have a blueprint for what to do. The President has outlined four proposals addressing critical flaws in the nuclear deal.  One of those proposals is that Iran allow anytime, anywhere inspections. Currently, Iran is blocking international inspectors from accessing military sites, such as the Parchin facility. Inspectors also have to follow elaborate rules even to request and receive access, despite Iran's long history of concealment and deception. If Iran has nothing to hide, then it has no reason to object to anytime, anywhere inspections.  Second, the bill would ensure that Iran never comes close to getting a nuclear weapon. The current nuclear deal attempts to keep Iran 1 year away from breakout--the point at which Iran[[Page S1306]]can rapidly develop a nuclear capability. One year is not much of an insurance policy, especially against the top state sponsor of terrorism. The bottom line is that Tehran should never come close to a nuclear weapon.  Third, the bill needs to maintain restrictions in perpetuity. The so-called sunset clauses are perhaps the most flawed part of the nuclear agreement. The way it currently reads, Iran does not need to cheat. They can simply wait us out. The conventional weapons ban sunsets in 2020. The ban on receiving ballistic missile assistance sunsets in 2023. The ban on replacing old centrifuges with advanced models sunsets in 2026. And all nuclear restrictions--on centrifuges, on enrichment facilities and levels, and on heavy water production--sunset in 2031. The sunset clauses do not stop Iran but kick the can down the road--a road ending in just over a decade.  Finally, the bill cannot overlook the connection between Iran's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. The legislation must severely sanction the ballistic missile program. This is another no-brainer. A nuclear warhead is effective to the extent that it can be launched on a missile. Iran is not developing long-range and sophisticated ballistic missiles to deliver conventional payloads. The architects of the Iran deal, unfortunately, took great pains to keep it focused solely on nuclear. That has to end.  These four demands constitute a sensible framework for the kind of bipartisan legislation that Congress can achieve.  The final reason for my cautious optimism is that we have a President who keeps his promises. When President Trump calls May 12 the last chance, I take him seriously. I would encourage my colleagues to do the same. This President is dead serious about countering Iran's agenda. He said that he would decertify the deal last He followed through. That should have erased any doubts.  We should not wait until the eleventh hour to deal with this issue. It is too important. By putting aside personal or political feelings, we can absolutely achieve a bipartisan bill that fixes the Iran deal using the President's framework.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

The bill marked up by the Senate Intelligence Committee included three amendments I offered, one of which required that the Director of National Intelligence, working with the Department of the Treasury, produce a report on the threat to the United States from Russian money laundering. My first objection to the current version of the bill is based on a change to that provision which downgrades responsibility for the report and removes the Department of the The critical importance of this issue to our national security requires the highest level responsibility within the intelligence community. It also requires the direct involvement of the Department of the Treasury to ensure that all the Department's financial intelligence resources, including those that fall outside the intelligence community, are brought to bear.  My second objection, as I explained in my minority views to the bill in committee, is that it includes a provision stating that it is the sense of Congress ``that WikiLeaks and the senior[[Page S2068]]leadership of WikiLeaks resemble a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors and should be treated as such a service by the United States.''' My concern with this language does not relate to the actions of WikiLeaks, which, as I have stressed in the past, was part of a direct attack on our democracy.  My concern is that the use of the novel phrase ``non-state hostile intelligence service''' may have legal, constitutional, and policy implications, particularly should it be applied to journalists inquiring about secrets. The language in the bill suggesting that the U.Government has some unstated course of action against ``non-state hostile intelligence services''' is equally troubling.  The damage done by WikiLeaks to the United States is clear, but with any new challenge to our country, Congress ought not react in a manner that could have negative consequences, unforeseen or not, for our constitutional principles. The introduction of vague, undefined new categories of enemies constitutes such an ill-considered reaction.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-04-11-pt1-PgS2067-2.txt,1247,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2018.0,11.0,April
457,topic-id,902,"Mr.President, for the elite, the powerful and the well connected, the Republican tax law has turned out to be manna from The benefits of the tax law are about as one-sided as it gets, and middle-class Americans come up on the losing end.  It sure is one-sided when the price of admission for any middle-class tax relief is an investor handout big enough to pave Wall Street in gold. Democrats pushed for a tax cut that was centered on the middle class, but Republicans turned their one-sided wish list into law.  It sure is one-sided to have a massive tax handout to multinational corporations, a lower top rate for the fortunate few, and a massive tax cut in the estate tax that touches only the wealthiest, while working families get handed only temporary relief.  Those are the policies that are the essence of the Republican tax law. Yet the American people hear over and over again that the benefit of the proposals are going to work their way to the middle class and that those folks will get bulging wage increases.  So I would like to start by getting a few facts straight. First, just a few hours ago, corporations crossed the $200 billion mark in stock buybacks this year. These stock-buyback bonanzas drive up the value of investment portfolios for CEOs and high fliers, and they are now coming in at a rate 30 times greater--30 times greater--than worker bonuses. They are on pace to double the amount from the first quarter of last year.  Now, there was a whole lot of happy talk about this Republican tax bill last winter, but I don't remember--and I sat through a lot of markups in the Finance Committee and debates on this floor--I didn't hear anybody say there ought to be a stock buyback stimulus act.  The wealthiest 10 percent of earners own 84 percent of all of the stock held by So when it comes to these buybacks, a huge majority of families are on the outside looking in. All the moms and dads who balance the rent, the groceries, and the cost of gas and electricity don't get much of anything out of a corporate handout that gets swallowed up by these buyback bonanzas for big-time investors.  Second, when you talk about tax cuts producing massive stock buybacks, you are talking about sending huge amounts of cash overseas directly into the pockets of wealthy investors. That is because more than one-third of all U.corporate stock is owned by investors outside of the country. So under the Republican tax law, American taxpayers are on the hook, borrowing billions and billions of dollars to make wealthy foreigners even wealthier.  We heard a whole lot about how working families were going to get lifted up in Portland and in Topeka and in San Antonio, but the reality is, the folks who are getting enriched are in Beijing and Moscow and Panama  Finally, you don't have to take my word for it that these corporate windfalls overwhelmingly benefit those at the top. Fourteen years ago, the Federal Government gave corporations what is known as a repatriation holiday--a big tax break to bring back cash from overseas. What the American people heard back then sounds pretty familiar today. Corporations were going to invest in workers and equipment, and the money would trickle down to the middle class. That didn't work out either. More than 90 percent of the corporate cash windfall went to goodies for investors and Once again, very, very one-sided.  Not even two decades later, the American people are still being fed the line about how their one-sided tax plans are going to deliver bulging paychecks to the middle class.  A few weeks ago, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin came to the Finance He was asked who really benefits when the Republican tax bill showers all of this cash on multinationals. He said: ``Even if there are share buybacks . . . that capital is recycled back into the economy. It just doesn't sit in banks, it goes back into the economy.'' That sounds an awful lot like trying to put a new spin on the failed theory of trickle-down economics.  In my view, middle-class families are sick and tired of being told to wait for the benefits to somehow trickle down to them. From the get-go, our message on taxes was that if Senators were interested in real middle-class tax relief, we would be at the head of the line to work on it. I have been involved in a bipartisan bill. On this side, we were ready to go for a bipartisan approach focusing on the middle class. Instead, Republicans moved at breakneck speed to pass a one-sided bill that would fatten the accounts of the wealthy, the powerful, and CEOs around the world.  It is time for the Treasury Secretary to stop peddling the old huckster's line that somehow all of this is going to work out for the middle class if they would just wait long enough. That is not going to work because this bill was never about middle-class folks. We see it in the numbers. We see it in the fact that what the middle class gets is temporary, but now we know, while middle-class families keep waiting for the promises to come true, these stock buyback bonanzas, these investor windfalls are just going to keep rolling on in.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-28-pt1-PgS1267.txt,1247,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2018.0,28.0,March
1128,topic-id,718,"Mr.President, Mr.Russell Vought is nominated to be the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and My view is, he has radically misguided budget priorities. He has long opposed bipartisan compromise. I am especially concerned about his well-documented history of inflammatory rhetoric. If confirmed, he would be the point person in charge of the President's budget. He is on record supporting an extreme fiscal strategy--one that would really threaten the full faith and credit of the country by engaging in debt ceiling brinkmanship, but I also oppose Mr.Vought's nomination because of his extreme vote on the budget and refusal to reach across party lines.  So we have an obligation to look at his extreme views, especially his vitriolic comments he has made, and to consider them among the recent examples of individuals who made similar comments and were deemed unfit for service.  Carl Higbie, a Trump surrogate during the 2016 campaign, was appointed as chief of external affairs at the Corporation for National and Community He resigned from his taxpayer-funded post in shame after his history of hateful, bigoted rhetoric was brought to light. That history included saying he didn't like Muslims because he hated their religious ideology and even flatly admitted he was proud to be a racist if it meant being against  Jamie Johnson was appointed last April to lead the Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood He, too, resigned in disgrace after media reports drew scrutiny to his use of racist rhetoric. During a 2008 interview, he said that African Americans had ``turned America's major cities into slums because of laziness, drug use, and sexual promiscuity.'' He also said extremist terrorist groups were representative of all people of the Muslim faith.  For a person taking a job intended to promote partnerships, it was certainly important to call his job performance into question.  William Bradford was appointed to lead the Energy Department's Office of Indian Energy in 2017. He resigned after the media drew attention to comments[[Page S1268]]he made calling for the military to target Muslim women and children and equating American colleges to ``Jihadi training camps.''  None of these individuals resigned because of their religion. In the United States--and I feel this so deeply--every person is free to practice the religion of their choosing and hold any and all beliefs. The reason these three individuals resigned from their positions was because their intolerant comments cast serious doubt on whether they were capable of working on behalf of all  That brings me to Mr.Vought's nomination. He has a long history of using inflammatory rhetoric to demonize his political opponents, and he just seems to abhor compromise. He has said that if Republicans fail ``to beat back the forces of the left,'' then ``we will lose our country to tyranny.'' Addressing a group of conservative activists in 2014, he said: ``The left increasingly elects ideological storm troopers to Congress.'' After he was nominated, the American Civil Liberties Union criticized his nomination because he had previously claimed that Muslims had a ``deficient theology'' and flatly stated that all Muslims ``stand condemned.''  When I met with Mr.Vought, I asked him to clarify his inflammatory rhetoric. I always think it is important to give somebody a chance to break from the past, and I hoped to hear a softer approach. He chose to stand by what he said. In fact, he doubled down.  So I will close with this. In my view, nothing should have changed in the time since Mr.Higby, Reverend Johnson, and Mr.Bradford resigned in shame. This incendiary, vitriolic rhetoric is disqualifying.  One of the first requirements of nominees for public office is to respect Americans from all walks of life. This is true when you are talking about a position like the OMB Deputy Director which holds enormous influence over the Federal budget. Mr.Vought has a clear, documented record of disrespecting and demonizing those who think differently than he does, and I consider that disqualifying.  This administration may tolerate those who spew vile rhetoric, and maybe they believe it is right to reward them with powerful roles in government, but the Senate does not have an obligation to let the standards of decency and tolerance degrade in this manner.

53,topic-id,740,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for all of his great leadership and mentorship throughout this process to get this bill to the floor today.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.4293, the Stress Test Improvement It is critical bipartisan legislation that injects transparency, consistency, and fairness into the stress testing process.  I especially want to thank my bipartisan supporter and partner on this important bill, Congressman  David Scott of  Stress tests are one of the aspects of current law that are contributing to the climate of legal and regulatory uncertainty because the Federal Reserve has failed to provide the necessary transparency around this process.  A stress test is a financial analysis performed internally by a financial institution or done externally by a regulator to assess if a bank can withstand stressful economic conditions. Stress tests, when done correctly, are an important way for banks and regulators to understand the ability of financial institutions to survive a contracting economy or weather a major economic storm like a recession.  Ensuring that these tests are done right, with fairness and objectivity, is essential for protecting depositors and the overall financial system. That is why passing the reforms in this bill should be a priority on both sides of the aisle.  Working together on a bipartisan basis, Mr.Scott offered an amendment to this bill that was accepted unanimously by the members of the Financial Services Committee, including the ranking member, and this bill cleared a committee markup with a bipartisan vote of 38-21.  By focusing the bill on three core reforms, we are improving this important process to protect soundness in the banking system, while also reforming the negative unintended consequences and damaging overreach of Dodd- By striking the adverse scenario requirement from stress testing, these important tests can actually focus on real-world conditions to protect financial institutions and the customers they serve from threats to the stability of the financial system.  By repealing the ability of the Federal Reserve to reject a company's capital plan based solely on a qualitative stress test, we are making the process more transparent and fair.  This legislation ends the ability of regulators to arbitrarily reject a financial institution's capital plan without feedback or constructive criticism. These secretive rejections by regulators have done little to protect consumers and inserted more, not less, uncertainty into the financial system.  By eliminating the midcycle review and shifting from biannual to annual stress testing requirements, we are lessening the compliance tax that has raised the cost of lending and hurt consumers who have lost access to the small business loans or mortgages that help finance their American  Without needed reform, rather than ensuring financial stability, the Federal Reserve's stress tests are likely missing real risks while constraining the competitive flow of financial services that is critical to increasing economic opportunity.  While a valuable resource, stress test results may be creating a false sense of security, while at the same time sowing the seeds of financial instability. In order to succeed, a stress test must build from an accurate forecast of the next macroeconomic storm, and even the best forecasts tend to be wrong.  The Stress Test Improvement Act will make stress testing more effective by making the rules more transparent and fair. We are not gutting standards but making them work for the real world. This bill is a bipartisan team effort to accomplish these goals.  Without transparency about what the stress testing rules are, there is no way to ensure the government plays by the rules. By subjecting financial institutions to a questionable regime that lacks accountability and transparency, regulators are failing to achieve the important goals that they are tasked with: ensuring safety and soundness.  With the critical reforms in this legislation, we are upholding sensible standards for financial institutions, while clarifying the requirements for and the frequency of stress tests.  To the hardworking men and women in my district and nationwide, it is common sense that banks ought to know the standards and tests their regulators are subjecting them to. By injecting some transparency and consistency into the stress testing regime, we are taking needed capital off the sidelines so it can be invested in the private economy to create jobs and wealth.

The current standard under Dodd-Frank requires banks to look back and hold operational risk capital against discontinued business activities or products. In plain English, this means banks are being forced to hold capital to hedge against a fictitious risk of a loan or a product discontinued years ago.  This is not an effective way to determine capital requirements, nor is it in line with the real risk these standards are meant to protect consumers from.  This is hurting consumers by making credit less available in the marketplace, and this especially hurts the small- and medium-size hometown banks that our communities rely on.  To my constituents on Long Island, and to hardworking American families across our country, the consequences of these misguided regulations are more costly loans and less available mortgages. These are the financial products that help small-business owners expand and hire or help families buy a new home.  H.4296 reforms operational risk requirements so they can be focused on a bank's current activities and line of business. This legislation keeps sound standards in place so that banks must avoid risky behavior while also freeing up needed capital so that it can be lent to consumers, not be needlessly held up in a vault to meet a misguided government mandate.  By ensuring that capital standards are transparent, fair, and based on real-life economic conditions, this bipartisan solution removes a troubling roadblock to capital that would otherwise be allocated to consumers, homeowners, and businesses.  Mr.Speaker, I want to again applaud the bipartisan teamwork of my colleagues Blaine Luetkemeyer and  Gregory I also want to thank Chairman Hensarling for all of his leadership on this important issue and so many others, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important bipartisan bill.
