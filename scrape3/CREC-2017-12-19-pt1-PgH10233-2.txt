                          AMTRAK CASCADES 501

  (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart. Yesterday, 
my home State and my home district suffered a great tragedy. Amtrak 
Cascades 501, traveling from Seattle to Portland, Oregon, carrying 80 
passengers and seven crewmembers, derailed near Olympia, Washington.
  Early reports are that at least three passengers have died and nearly 
100 people needed hospital care. My heart and prayers go out to all 
those families as they deal with this tragedy.
  Our office stands ready to help any constituents in any way that we 
can. For up-to-date information, friends and family on Amtrak Cascades 
501 can also call 1-800-523-9101.
  I also want to thank our first responders for their skill and their 
courage. This could have been far worse without them.
  But as Amtrak, the National Transportation Safety Board, and State 
and local officials help on the scene, there are still so many 
questions, like: Why was the train going 50 miles over the speed limit 
as it rounded the curve? Why was the train not using positive train 
control technology to slow the train down? How, Mr. Speaker, can we be 
sure that this never happens again?
  Mr. Speaker, I will do everything I can to ensure that the 
investigation and our affected families have the resources and the 
support necessary to get the facts in the coming days and months.
