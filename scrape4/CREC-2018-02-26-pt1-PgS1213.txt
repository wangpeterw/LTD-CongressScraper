                          POLICY JUSTIFICATION

 Kuwait--Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance King Air 350ER

       The Government of Kuwait has requested a possible sale of 
     four (4) King Air 350ER Intelligence, Surveillance, and 
     Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft with enhanced PT6A-67A engines 
     and one (1) engine spare; four (4) AN/AAQ-35 WESCAM MX-15HDi 
     Electro-Optical & Infrared Imaging Sensor Turret; four (4) 
     Selex Seaspray 7500E Active Electronically Scanned Array 
     Radars (AESA); AN/AAR-47 Missile Warning Systems (MWS); AN/
     ALE-47 Countermeasure Dispenser Systems; secure 
     communications, cryptographic, and precision navigation 
     equipment; Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Systems; 
     aircraft modification and integration for ISR mission 
     systems; facility design and construction; ground data 
     processing systems and support equipment; spares and repair 
     parts; support and test equipment; simulators, training and 
     training equipment; publications and technical documentation; 
     U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical and 
     logistics support services; and other related elements of 
     logistical and program support. Additionally, one of the four 
     aircraft will be further modified to accommodate VIP/senior 
     leadership personnel for transport and Med Evac capability or 
     command and control, and other related elements of logistical 
     support. The estimated total case value is $259 million.
       This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy 
     and national security of the United States by helping to 
     improve the security of a friendly country. Kuwait plays a 
     large role in U.S. efforts to advance stability in the Middle 
     East, providing basing, access, and transit for U.S. forces 
     in the region.
       The proposed sale will enable Kuwait to gather its own 
     airborne ISR data. This capability will improve Kuwait's 
     situational awareness, armed forces posture, and armed forces 
     capability to respond to threats. Enhancing Kuwait's Command, 
     Control, Communications, Computers, & Intelligence (C4I) 
     capability will result in the potential for greater burden 
     sharing. The proposed sale of items and services will 
     establish Kuwait's first dedicated airborne ISR fleet. The 
     King Air 350ER ISR is part of the Kuwaiti Air Force's rapid 
     expansion and modernization efforts, and is a priority for 
     Kuwait and the United States. Kuwait will have no difficulty 
     absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.
       The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not 
     alter the basic military balance in the region.
       The principal contractor will be Sierra Nevada Corporation, 
     Hagerstown, MD. There are no known offset agreements proposed 
     in connection with this potential sale.
       Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the 
     long term assignment of any additional U.S. Government 
     representatives to Kuwait. There will be U.S. contractor 
     field representatives relocating to Kuwait in order provide 
     day-to-day maintenance and logistics support.
       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness 
     as a result of this proposed sale.

     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to 
         Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act

                           Annex Item No. vii

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
       1. The AH-64E Apache Attack Helicopter weapon system 
     contains communications and target identification equipment, 
     navigation equipment, aircraft survivability equipment, 
     displays, and sensors. The airframe itself does not contain 
     sensitive technology; however, the pertinent equipment listed 
     below will either be installed on the aircraft or included in 
     the sale:
       a. The AN/APG-78 Fire Control Radar (FCR) is an active, 
     low-probability of intercept, millimeter-wave radar, combined 
     with a passive AN/APR-48B Modernized Radar Frequency 
     Interferometer (M-RFI) mounted on top of the helicopter mast. 
     The FCR Ground Targeting Mode detects, locates, classifies 
     and prioritizes stationary or moving armored vehicles, tanks 
     and mobile air defense systems as well as hovering 
     helicopters, helicopters, and fixed wing aircraft in normal 
     flight. The M-RFI detects threat radar emissions and 
     determines the type of radar and mode of operation. The FCR 
     data and M-RFI data are fused for maximum synergism. If 
     desired, the radar data can be used to refer targets to the 
     regular electro-optical Modernized Target Acquisition and 
     Designation Sight (MTADS), permitting additional visual/
     infrared imagery and control of weapons, including the semi-
     active laser version of the HELLFIRE II missile. Critical 
     system information is stored in the FCR in the form of 
     mission executable code, target detection, classification 
     algorithms and coded threat parametrics. This information is 
     provided in a form that cannot be extracted by the foreign 
     user via anti-tamper provisions built into the system. The 
     content of these items is classified SECRET. The M-RFI is a 
     passive radar detection and direction finding system, which 
     utilizes a detachable User Data Module (UDM) on the RFI 
     processor, which contains the Radio Frequency threat library. 
     The UDM, which is a hardware assemblage, is classified 
     CONFIDENTIAL when programmed with threat parameters, threat 
     priorities and/or techniques derived from U.S. intelligence 
     information.
       b. The AN/ASQ-170 Modernized Target Acquisition and 
     Designation Sight/AN/AAQ-11 Pilot Night Vision Sensor (MTADS/
     PNVS) provides day, night, and limited adverse weather target 
     information, as well as night navigation capabilities. The 
     PNVS provides thermal imaging that permits map-of-the-earth 
     flight to, from, and within the battle area, while TADS 
     provides the co-pilot gunner with search, detection, 
     recognition, and designation by means of Direct View Optics 
     (DVO), EI\2\ television, and Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) 
     sighting systems that may be used singularly or in 
     combinations. Hardware is UNCLASSIFIED. Technical manuals for 
     authorized maintenance levels are UNCLASSIFIED.
       c. The AN/APR-48B Modernized Radar Frequency Interferometer 
     (M-RFI) is an updated version of the passive radar detection 
     and direction finding system. It utilizes a detachable UDM on 
     the M-RFI processor, which contains the Radar Frequency (RF) 
     threat library. The UDM, which is a hardware assemblage item, 
     is classified CONFIDENTIAL when programmed with threat 
     parametrics, threat priorities and/or techniques derived from 
     U.S. intelligence information. Hardware becomes CLASSIFIED 
     when populated with threat parametric data.
       d. KIV-77 A common IFF Applique Crypto Computer that 
     provides information assurance for the IFF interrogators and 
     transponders using Modes 4 and 5. The hardware is classified 
     UNCLASSIFIED. This item is CCI and SENSITIVE. Releasable 
     technical manuals for operation and maintenance are 
     classified FOUO.
       e. The Embedded Global Positioning System/Inertial 
     Navigation System plus Multi- Mode Receiver (EGI+MMR) EGI GEM 
     V 3.3 W/SAASM PN: 3424 9950-R004-XXX Software Security Core 
     PN: CP34211974-003 (CP34211903-002), GCORE 3 ver 3 SAASM with 
     MMR. The aircraft has two EGIs which use internal 
     accelerometers, rate gyro measurements, and external sensor 
     measurements to estimate the aircraft state, provides 
     aircraft flight and position data to aircraft systems. The 
     EGI is a velocity-aided, strap down, ring laser gyro based 
     inertial unit. The EGI unit houses a 12-channel (GEM 5) GPS 
     receiver. The receiver is capable of operating in either non-
     encrypted (C/A code) or encrypted (P/Y code). The Group User 
     Variable (GUV) is the normal encryption key used when 
     operating in the P/Y code mode. The GUV key is loaded into 
     the EGI using an ANACD-10 or equivalent device. When keyed, 
     the GPS receiver will automatically use anti-spoof/jam 
     capabilities when they are in use. The EGI will retain the 
     key through power on/off/on cycles. Because of safeguards 
     built into the EGI, it is not considered classified when 
     keyed. Integrated within the EGI is an Inertial Measurement 
     Unit (IMU) with processing functions for performing the 
     inertial navigation computations, GPS card, receiver 
     management, and Kalman filter estimates to support all 
     aircraft and weapon systems position and navigation 
     computations. Each EGI also houses a Multi-Mode Receiver 
     (MMR). The MMR is incorporated to provide for reception of 
     ground based NAVAID signals for instrument aided flight. 
     Provides IMC/IFR integration and certification of improved 
     Embedded Global Positioning System and Inertial (EGI) unit 
     with attached MMR, with specific cockpit instrumentation that 
     allows Apaches to operate within the worldwide IFR route 
     structure. Also includes integration of the Common Army 
     Aviation Map (CAAM), Area Navigation (RNAV), Digital 
     Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) and Global Air 
     Traffic Management (GATM) compliance.
       2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain 
     knowledge of specific hardware, the information could be used 
     to develop countermeasures which might reduce weapons system 
     effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with 
     similar or advanced capabilities.
       3. A determination has been made that the Netherlands can 
     provide substantially the same degree of protection for 
     sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government. 
     This proposed sustainment program is necessary to the 
     furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national security 
     objectives outlined in the policy justification.
       4. All defense articles and services listed on this 
     transmittal are authorized for release and export to the 
     Government of the Netherlands.

       Finland intends to use the vertical launching systems on 
     four new construction corvettes that will make up the Finnish 
     Navy's Squadron 2020. The vertical launching systems will 
     enable Finland to acquire missiles that will significantly 
     enhance the Finnish Navy's area defense capabilities over 
     critical air-and-sea-lines of trade and communication. The 
     proposed sale of the Mk 41 will increase the Finnish Navy's 
     maritime partnership, interoperability, and regional security 
     capability. Finland has not purchased the Mk 41 previously, 
     but will have no difficulty incorporating this capability 
     into its armed forces.
       The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not 
     alter the basic military balance in the region.
       The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin 
     Corporation, Bethesda, MD. The purchaser typically requests 
     offsets. Any offset agreement will be defined in negotiations 
     between the purchaser and the contractor.
       Implementation of this proposed sale will require up to 12 
     U.S. Government personnel and up to five contractor 
     representatives to travel to Finland providing support over a 
     period of ten years.
