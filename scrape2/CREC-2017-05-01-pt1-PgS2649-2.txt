                         GLACIER NATIONAL PARK

 Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, there is no place on this planet 
like the Crown of the Continent, Glacier National Park.
  For over 100 years, families have flocked to Glacier National Park to 
experience the breathtaking views, unique wildlife, and the pristine 
landscapes that can't be found anywhere else on earth.
  In fact, last year, more than 2.3 million people visited Glacier 
National Park to hike above Lake McDonald, bike across the Continental 
Divide, and experience the Going to the Sun Road.
  Today we mark the next chapter of the distinctive history of Glacier 
National Park. Glacier National Park and Waterton Lakes National Park 
have collectively become the first transcontinental National Parks to 
secure ``dark sky'' status.
  To achieve this prestigious status, Glacier National Park has 
retrofitted nearly 30 percent of its light fixtures and is committing 
to continue to identify ways to limit artificial light within the park.
  By achieving this status, Glacier and Waterton Lakes National Parks 
have provided the public with even more reasons to explore the outdoors 
in northwest Montana and southwest Alberta.
  Not only do dark skies play an important role in outdoor recreation 
and late-night stargazing, but they are critical to wildlife migrations 
and habitats within the parks.
  This wouldn't be possible without Glacier Park superintendent Jeff 
Mow.
  Their leadership has ushered Glacier National Park into a new era and 
provided millions of folks around the world with the opportunity to 
fall in love again with our great outdoors.
  Thank you again for your outstanding work.
