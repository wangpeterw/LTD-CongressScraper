                WISHING SENATOR McCAIN A SPEEDY RECOVERY

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I spoke to Senator McCain this morning 
and let him know the Senate continues to send its thoughts to him. Our 
friend from Arizona is a pretty tough guy, as we all know. He will be 
back with us soon. We will continue to offer him best wishes for a 
speedy recovery in the meantime, and we will continue to keep Cindy, 
their family, his staff, and the people of Arizona in our thoughts.
