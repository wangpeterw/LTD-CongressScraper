                 OFFICIAL PHOTOGRAPH OF 115TH CONGRESS

  The SPEAKER. Pursuant to House Resolution 350, this time has been 
designated for the taking of the official photo of the House of 
Representatives in session.
  The House will be in a brief recess while the Chamber is being 
prepared for the photo. As soon as the photographer indicates that 
these preparations are complete, the Chair will call the House to order 
to resume its actual session for the taking of the photograph. At that 
point the Members will take their cues from the photographer. Shortly 
after the photographer is finished, the House will proceed with 
business.
