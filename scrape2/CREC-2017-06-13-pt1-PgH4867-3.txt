                           VA ACCOUNTABILITY

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight Congress' making 
more important strides on behalf of our Nation's veterans.
  The last few years, we have all heard stories about employees at the 
VA who failed in their duty to serve and protect our Nation's heroes. 
It is true that most VA employees are hardworking and dedicated, but as 
we have come to find out, there are bad actors who must be held 
accountable. Our veterans deserve nothing less.
  Strangely, as the VA has tried to discipline these bad actors, the 
existing bureaucracy and red tape has stymied the Secretary's ability 
to do so. That is why the House today will pass the Department of 
Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, to 
create a more efficient and effective system to remove, demote, or 
suspend any VA employee for poor performance or misconduct.
  Our bill still ensures due process and actually expands protections 
for whistleblowers, but, importantly, it will let the VA Secretary do 
his job and clean up the Department and protect our Nation's veterans.
  Mr. Speaker, protecting those veterans isn't a political issue; it is 
a cause we must all champion. I encourage a bipartisan vote on today's 
bill.
