                   HONORING THE LIFE OF STEVE MOSTYN

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise for the very sad task, as we 
begin the season of Thanksgiving, of announcing the passing of my dear 
friend,

[[Page H9415]]

Steve Mostyn, a great Texan, a great American, husband, father, and 
friend. We pray for him; his beautiful wife, Amber; and his children.
  Today, I ask, in the spirit of our faith, if Members will join me in 
a moment of silence for the passing of Steve Mostyn.
