                  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL

  Mr. SCHUMER. Good morning, Mr. President.
  As we continue to work on the NDAA, the Democratic side is committed 
to working with the Republican side in good faith to finish this very 
important legislation. I am pleased that the managers have already been 
able to include more than 100 amendments in the substitute. I hope we 
can do another package today.
  Senators McCain and Reed are managing this bill with their usual 
great skill, and I very much appreciate their hard work. Particularly, 
I know how important this legislation is to Senator McCain and that he 
wants to see it through and see it through as soon as possible. We are 
going to help in that regard, of course.

                          ____________________
