                          REPUBLICAN TAX BILL

  (Mr. GARRETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, in the realm of humanity, that which is 
cobbled together by humans is rarely perfect. So, too, the tax reform 
that we undertook today is not perfect; however, it was overdue, and it 
is good.
  Candidly, any legislation contemplated that was last addressed when I 
weighed 112 pounds and had a full head of hair is long overdue.
  Having said that, I can find some fault. And I would submit that it 
is with the confidence and belief in the leadership of this Chamber and 
the relevant committees that will discuss the maintenance of the 
historic preservation tax credit, which is included in the Senate 
version of this bill, that I cast my ballot today.
  I think that is a worthwhile investment in revitalizing downtrodden 
areas. I want to make my voice known publicly, loudly, and on the 
record.
  I also hope that Members of this body, on both sides of the aisle, 
would consider the opportunity for students to remove themselves from 
the dark cloud of student loan debt by virtue of reviewing the Student 
Security Act that will be unveiled here within the next 24 hours
