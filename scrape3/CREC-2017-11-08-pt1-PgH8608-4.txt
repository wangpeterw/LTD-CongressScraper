                    TAXES WILL GO UP EVERY APRIL 15

  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask and highlight which 
Americans will see their taxes go up every April 15 under the 
Republican tax scam. Middle class families, teachers, firefighters, 
nurses, veterans, folks paying off student loans, seniors with medical 
expenses, small businesses, and every homeowner will pay more in taxes. 
Over 50 million Americans will see their taxes go up every April 15.
  Both students and teachers are hurt by this tax scam. This tax scam 
will make it harder for teachers to afford supplies for their 
classrooms. The Republican tax scam eliminates medical expense 
deductions. The adoption tax credit goes away. Student loan deductions, 
gone. State and local tax deductions for homeowners, forget about it. 
This tax scam is just wrong.
  Mr. Speaker, it hurts hardworking American families and it benefits 
the largest corporations.
