                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Spirit, today, teach our lawmakers to do things Your way, 
embracing Your precepts and walking in Your path. Lord, remind them 
that the road less traveled usually leads to life, and few find it.
  As our Senators receive guidance from You and follow Your leading, 
replace anxiety with calm, confusion with clarity, and despair with 
hope. Use these legislators to transform dark yesterdays into bright 
tomorrows. May Your peace guard their hearts. Guide them to find 
workable solutions for the problems of our Nation and world.
  And, Lord, bring healing to Senator John McCain.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
