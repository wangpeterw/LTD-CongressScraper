           TAKE BACK HEALTHCARE FROM PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, for far too long, Big Pharma has played by 
its own rules, benefiting from skyrocketing drug prices on the backs of 
our most vulnerable populations.
  Back in 2003, legislation was passed establishing Medicare part D to 
make prescription drugs more affordable for people, but Big Pharma 
lobbyists influenced those policies and made it so there is a provision 
included that would ban the Secretary of Health and Human Services from 
negotiating lower prices directly with pharmaceutical companies, 
something that the VA can already do today.
  Over 42 million Americans who are enrolled in Medicare part D 
continue to face rising costs on brand name drugs, fewer generic drugs, 
and higher premiums, making it difficult, if not impossible, for many 
to fill their prescriptions.
  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Medicare Prescription Drug 
Price Negotiation Act to take back our healthcare from pharmaceutical 
companies and allow the Secretary of HHS to negotiate drug prices 
directly with manufacturers to secure affordable, lifesaving medication 
for millions of Americans.
