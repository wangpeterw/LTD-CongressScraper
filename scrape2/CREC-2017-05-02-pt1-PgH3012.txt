      REMEMBERING FORMER BOULDER CITY MAYOR ROBERT STANLEY FERRARO

  (Ms. ROSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and commemorate the 
life of Robert Stanley Ferraro, a pillar in our community and one of 
the longest serving public officials in Nevada history who passed away 
last week at the age of 81.
  Robert Ferraro served on the Boulder City Council for 31 years and 
was Boulder City's first elected mayor, and successfully stood for 
election nine times. He knocked on every voter's door and provided 
leadership to one of the most unique communities in our State.
  Bob led the effort to maintain Boulder City's character as a special 
community and to be the clean, green Boulder City that many of my 
constituents call home and thousands visit each year.
  He was named Nevada Public Official of the Year in 1986, Community 
Leader of the Year in 2001, and led a life that was a true American 
success story coming from humble beginnings to being one of the great 
civic leaders of our State.
  Bob will be greatly missed, and my thoughts and prayers are with his 
family and friends today.
