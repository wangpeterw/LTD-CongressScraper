                    USDA FOOD PROGRAMS ARE CRITICAL

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week, the House 
Committee on Agriculture's Subcommittee on Nutrition hosted a hearing 
to examine USDA's three commodity distribution programs: the Emergency 
Food Assistance Program, the Commodity Supplemental Food program, and 
the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations.
  Committee members heard from a panel of witnesses representing each 
of these programs who explained how the programs differ, interact, and 
work together to meet the nutrition needs of America's most vulnerable 
citizens.
  Mr. Speaker, as chairman of this subcommittee, I know Federal 
nutrition programs are vital to ensuring that all Americans have 
healthy foods within reach, whether low-income populations, the 
elderly, or those living in areas with strained access to nutritious 
foods. Along with SNAP, these programs support agriculture and lessen 
the effects of poverty on our most vulnerable citizens.
  As we begin to work on the next farm bill, we will continue to 
identify ways to work alongside State and local organizations to help 
provide safe, nutritious food for those who need it most. I thank our 
witnesses for sharing their time and their expertise to help strengthen 
these programs.
