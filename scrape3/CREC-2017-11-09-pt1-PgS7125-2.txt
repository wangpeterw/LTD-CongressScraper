                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, thank You for the gift of our veterans, those on Capitol 
Hill and beyond. May our veterans make us mindful of the price of our 
freedom.
  Lord, infuse us with a spirit of gratitude for those who have offered 
their lives on the field of battle that we might live in peace. Let not 
one of our veterans feel forgotten, neglected, or unappreciated. May 
they know by experience the deep and enduring gratitude of a grateful 
nation.
  Lord, You know the burdens that many of our veterans must bear. Some 
feel isolated and alone; others feel misunderstood. Bring physical, 
emotional, and spiritual healing to their lives, providing them with 
the wisdom to trust You with their future.
  Lord, we ask Your particular blessings upon the Senators who in 
military service have sacrificially given their time, comfort, 
strength, ambition, and health. Reward them one hundredfold for their 
sacrifice and service, blessing them more than they can ask or imagine.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
