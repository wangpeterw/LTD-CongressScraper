                          DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the Days of 
Remembrance and pay tribute to all those who were affected by the 
enormity, the calamity, and the horrors of the Holocaust.
  On April 11, 1945, at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, General Patton's Third 
Army liberated Buchenwald concentration camp, with the help of my 
father-in-law, Bill McKenzie, then a young 22-year-old U.S Army 
officer, fresh from the corps at Texas A&M University.
  Bill said of that day: ``I will not describe the horrible sight of 
our entry into Buchenwald, but I will tell you this--that the 
crematorium was still

burning, dead were stacked like cordwood on large trailers, and the 
living dead were starving.''
  Some 65 years later, I would deliver the eulogy at Bill's funeral and 
read a condolence letter sent to our family from the nephew of a 
survivor he rescued that day.
  As a member of the Greatest Generation, Bill will always be 
remembered by us as a hero, and his role liberating innocent people 
from the Nazi Germany death camps is a proud distinction for our 
family. His story serves as a reminder that these atrocities have no 
place in our world.
