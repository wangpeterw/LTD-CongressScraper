                  HONORING BISHOP JIMMY W. GLENN, SR.

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Bishop Jimmy W. Glenn, 
Sr., who was recently elevated to Auxiliary Bishop of Texas' Northeast 
Fourth Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction of the Church of God in Christ.
  Bishop Glenn first embraced the call to serve at the young age of 8 
years old when he began singing at revival services around Texas. By 
the time he was 21, Bishop Glenn was licensed and ordained to serve as 
minister and began to travel across the State of Texas to help spread 
the word of Christ.
  Bishop Glenn has served in various Fort Worth churches, including 
Gethsemane Church of God in Christ, St. Mary Church of God in Christ, 
and Greater Love Chapel Church of God in Christ.
  A true servant with a heart for others, he took on a major leadership 
role within the Church of God in Christ and now serves as the vice 
president of the National Evangelist Department.
  On May 5, Bishop Glenn will be recognized for his recent elevation to 
Auxiliary Bishop of Texas' Northeast Fourth Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction 
during their inaugural banquet.

  I hope you will all join me in congratulating Bishop Glenn on this 
momentous achievement.
