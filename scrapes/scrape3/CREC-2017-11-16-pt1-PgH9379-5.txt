                    WELCOMING REVEREND ROBERT HUGHES

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. 
Hartzler) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and thank Reverend 
Robert Hughes of Sedalia, Missouri, for his leadership in the faith 
community.
  After beginning his career in film and television, working for media 
companies like Disney and National Geographic, Reverend Hughes left 
show business to do God's business. He entered the ministry, which led 
him to Sedalia, in Missouri's Fourth Congressional District, where he 
serves as the pastor at Broadway Presbyterian Church.
  Reverend Hughes is well loved by the members of his congregation, and 
he uses his time and talents to energize others about God's Word. It 
was my honor to recommend him as guest chaplain to lead the House in 
prayer this morning.
  Reverend Hughes, thank you for your devotion to your community and 
congregation and for bringing inspiration and encouragement to those 
you serve. May God bless everything you set your hand to. Your service 
to God and your church is appreciated.
