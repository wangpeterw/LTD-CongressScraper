  USDA FUNDING WILL HELP ERADICATE SPOTTED LANTERNFLY IN PENNSYLVANIA

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, earlier today, USDA 
Secretary Sonny Perdue announced $17.5 million in emergency funding to 
stop the spread of the spotted lanternfly in the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania.
  The spotted lanternfly is beautiful, with its distinctive and 
colorful wings, but it is an invasive and threatening pest and its 
spread must be stopped.
  The spotted lanternfly is originally native to parts of China, India, 
Vietnam, and Eastern Asia. It was first discovered in Berks County, 
Pennsylvania, but now has spread to 13 counties. It is a threat to 
apples and grapes and peaches, stone fruits, and various tree species 
throughout Pennsylvania.
  Pennsylvania's Agriculture Secretary Russell Reading has been working 
to combat its spread, and this Federal funding will only increase the 
Commonwealth's ability to fight this pest.
  As vice chair of the House Agriculture Committee, I have been working 
with Congressman Ryan Costello and Congressman Lloyd Smucker and all 
members of the Pennsylvania delegation to ensure that we have the 
resources necessary to eradicate the spotted lanternfly.
  I applaud Secretary Perdue's swift prevention efforts before the 
planthopper starts to reemerge this spring.
