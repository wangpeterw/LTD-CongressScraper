                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  We give You thanks, O God, for giving us another day.
  We ask Your blessing upon this assembly and upon all to whom the 
authority of government is given. Help them to meet their 
responsibilities during these days, to attend to the immediate needs 
and concerns of the moment, enlightened by Your eternal spirit.
  We thank You for Your gifts of patience and perseverance that have 
led to agreements on the funding of government. It is difficult work 
calling for true leadership. Continue to bless those Members who 
continue to work toward solutions that redound to the benefit of our 
Nation.
  Please send Your spirit of peace upon those areas of our world where 
conflicts continue and threaten to break out. May all Your children 
learn to live in peace.
  And may all that is done within the people's House be for Your 
greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
