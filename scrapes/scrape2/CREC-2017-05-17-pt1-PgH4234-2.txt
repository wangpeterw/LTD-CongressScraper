      JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SHOULD APPOINT AN INDEPENDENT PROSECUTOR

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, last night we learned that 
President Trump may have tried to interfere with an ongoing 
investigation, asking the FBI Director to end an investigation into his 
former National Security Adviser's ties to Russia.
  The Justice Department today should appoint an independent prosecutor 
to aggressively pursue the truth. There are a lot of informational 
dots. They either connect or they don't.
  There is no dispute that Russia interfered with the United States' 
Presidential election. The question is: Did Russia interfere with the 
Presidential election in coordination with the Trump campaign?
  It is deeply troubling that the Attorney General recused himself--a 
self-declared conflict--from the Russian investigation and then played 
a role in firing the man leading it.
  The American people rightfully suspect the decision to fire the FBI 
Director is part of a coverup. Appoint a special prosecutor to pursue 
the truth.
  Despots all over the world like Putin want to discredit American 
democracy to keep their own people from wanting it. We as Americans, 
Republicans and Democrats all, cannot allow this to happen, ever.
