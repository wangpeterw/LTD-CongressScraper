    PRAYERS AND SPEEDY RECOVERY TO ALL INJURED IN BASEBALL SHOOTING

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor consumed by great 
sadness. Yesterday's attack, as we have all heard, was an attack on the 
entire United States Congress.
  It is even more tragic that this attack occurred during a practice 
for one of the most bipartisan traditions in the Congress.
  I stand here with my colleagues hoping for a speedy recovery for my 
dear colleague, Representative Steve Scalise. My thoughts and prayers 
are with him, but also for all of the others that were injured, for all 
of their families, and for all of their loved ones.
  It is clear we all know that, without Capitol Police on duty with 
Representative Scalise, there would have been many more victims.
  I want to express my deepest gratitude to those officers who put 
their lives on the line, but I also want to pray for them and all those 
who were injured. I ask and I hope for their speedy recovery.

                          ____________________
