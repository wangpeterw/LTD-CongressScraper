      CONGRATULATING CAPTAIN PHILLIP DAWSON III ON HIS RETIREMENT

  (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Captain Phillip 
Dawson on his retirement from the United States Navy. On Friday, 
Captain Dawson will complete a nearly 4-year tour as the commanding 
officer of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, Florida.
  A 1988 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, Captain Dawson 
first served on the USS Tattnall as the antisubmarine warfare officer 
and, later, on the USS Harry E. Yarnell as the fire control officer.
  Captain Dawson assumed command of the Naval Surface Warfare Center in 
2013, where he led the center in a wide array of missions, including 
littoral warfare, coastal defense, and special missions. This base is 
also home to the U.S. Navy Dive School, where all of the divers from 
all of our services are trained.
  Captain Dawson's selfless sacrifice to this country and dedication to 
our Navy is truly inspiring. Madam Speaker, please join me in thanking 
Captain Dawson, his wife, Belinda, and their three children for their 
years of service and sacrifice, and wish them luck as they enjoy a new 
chapter in life.
