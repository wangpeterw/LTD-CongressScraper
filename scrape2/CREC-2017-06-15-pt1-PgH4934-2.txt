                  SUPPORTING STATEHOOD OF PUERTO RICO

  (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege last Sunday to 
be an observer in Puerto Rico for the plebiscite and watch the people 
of Puerto Rico make the decision that they would like to be the 51st 
State.
  I think it is time for this Congress to make the 3,400,000 American 
citizens part of the United States--in full grandeur, as every one of 
us have--and have a chance of making sure we can vote for everyone to 
be part of this.
  I think it is time that America should stop colonizing. If I am not 
mistaken, this is the last Nation that has a colony. The great America 
of the United States has a colony, and I think it is time that we 
change that. Vote in Congress to make sure that we have the 51st State.
  Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman yield?
  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.
  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to join my friend who has been such a 
great leader in dealing with those who have associations with our 
country but are not States. I join with his remarks.
  The Puerto Rican election that was held overwhelmingly voted for 
statehood as the option of governance they wanted to pursue. It is now, 
it seems to me, the responsibility of the United States Congress and 
the administration to recognize the overwhelming sentiment of the 
Puerto Rican people, expressed in a free and open election.
