            RECOGNIZING MICHAEL McDERMOTT of HOMER, NEW YORK

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Michael 
McDermott of Homer, New York. Mike is a veteran of the United States 
Navy, having served from 1964 through 1967, including 13 months of 
service in Vietnam. When Mike returned home from the Navy and Vietnam, 
he became active in the Homer community serving as a village trustee 
for 6 years and mayor for 6 years.
  Mike's true passion has been as an advocate for his fellow veterans 
through his service at the American Legion Post 465 in Homer where he 
has been a member for over 34 years. During his time with Post 465, 
Mike has served in many roles, including commander for 13 years. He 
also served as commander of the Cortland County American Legion.
  Mike is also involved in State and national leadership for The 
American Legion. He serves on the National Security Council for The 
American Legion and with the National and New York American Legion 
Press Associations.
  Most importantly, Mike continuously gives back to Cortland County's 
and Homer's veterans, hosting a veterans service fair and supporting 
veterans' causes throughout the village and county each and every year.
  We are grateful to compassionate citizens like Michael McDermott 
throughout our communities, and we are grateful for their service and 
dedication to our Nation's veterans. Thank you to Michael McDermott 
from a giving and warm community. We appreciate his service.
