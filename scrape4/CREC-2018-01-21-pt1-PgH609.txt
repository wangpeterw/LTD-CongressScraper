               IT IS SIMPLE UNTIL YOU MAKE IT COMPLICATED

  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, it is simple until you make it complicated. 
There is a poster in my office that says just that, and it kind of 
describes where we are at today.
  We are having a lot of debate in this House about the current 
government funding situation, our military, and the Children's Health 
Insurance Program, which, by the way, House Republicans actually voted 
to extend more than 2 months ago and did again this past week.
  Here is the simple part: the Children's Health Insurance Program can 
be reauthorized, the government can be reopened, and paychecks sent to 
our troops without delay if Senators Chuck Schumer and Bob Casey and 
other Senate Democrats change their votes to make that happen.
  The short-term funding bill and Children's Health Insurance Program 
reauthorization is about as bipartisan and noncontroversial as you can 
get around here, yet Senator Schumer decided to make a crisis out of 
it.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to be able to ask Senator Schumer and 
Senator Casey: Would you vote to reopen the government today? Would it 
make a difference, if I said ``please?''
