                     HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN VIETNAM

  (Mr. KHANNA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, my grandfather spent 4 years in jail during 
Gandhi's independence movement standing for human rights. One of his 
crimes was expressing unpopular views in a political newspaper.
  Similar human rights abuses are occurring today in Vietnam. I speak 
out, today, for those who have been silenced. In many cases, the 
victims are the brother, the sister, the friend, or acquaintance of 
someone living in my district.
  Over 100 activists and religious leaders are currently imprisoned in 
Vietnam for expressing their opinions and beliefs. For example, social 
activist and blogger Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh was recently sentenced to 10 
years in prison for highlighting social injustices on her blog.
  In California's 17th District, I am proud of organizations like The 
Good Will Brother-Sister Group that stand in solidarity for their 
oppressed friends and family in Vietnam.
  The Vietnamese Government must release every political prisoner, stop 
harassing religious groups, and have the confidence in allowing a free 
press. Until they do that, we must do no business deals with Vietnam 
and make it clear that we expect them to honor human rights.
