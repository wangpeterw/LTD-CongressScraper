                     CONGRATULATING XAVIER BECERRA

  (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my friend and 
former colleague, Xavier Becerra, for his long and effective record of 
service on behalf of California in Congress.
  Attorney General Xavier Becerra has been a true mentor and a friend 
to me, especially during this transition serving as a new Member of 
Congress.
  His support and his service reaffirm that the children of immigrants 
and immigrants themselves have a crucial role to play in our Federal 
Government.
  I want to congratulate Xavier Becerra on his well-deserved 
appointment to serve as California's attorney general. While he is no 
longer with us in the House, I know that his new appointment will be 
even greater felt across our country during these troubling political 
times.
  I have no doubt that, as attorney general, Xavier will defend our 
Constitution and fight for families in California and help our State 
serve as a beacon of hope and progress in America.
