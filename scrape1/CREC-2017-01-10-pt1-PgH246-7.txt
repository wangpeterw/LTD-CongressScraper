          THANK YOU TO MICHIGAN'S FIRST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

  (Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say thank you to the people 
of Michigan's First Congressional District for giving me the 
opportunity to represent them in Congress. I would also like to thank 
my wife, Cindy, and our children and grandchildren for their constant 
and unwavering support.
  It is truly an honor and a privilege to be here, and I am so humbled 
to be doing the people's work in the House of Representatives. I came 
to Congress not only to restore common sense and fiscal sanity to the 
Federal Government but, most importantly, to serve the constituents of 
Michigan's First District and to be their voice in Washington.
  We have a new opportunity ahead of us to bring industry and 
prosperity back to the American people, but it is up to us here in 
Congress to do the work and put in the long hours it will take to get 
there. My promise today is that I will work tirelessly for my district 
and do everything I can to make sure we are leaving a better country 
for our children and grandchildren.
  Again, thank you to the people of Michigan's First Congressional 
District for this opportunity.
