                             INFRASTRUCTURE

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I heard President Trump talk about 
Democrats being obstructionists yesterday--out in Ohio, Kentucky--about 
a healthcare bill in which they are not asking for Democratic help or 
input. They are tied in a knot because their own party can't agree on 
the tax bill. They again are not asking for Democratic input. They are 
tied in a knot because their own party can't agree.
  Now it looks as if they are doing the same thing on infrastructure. 
The President is in an ``alter reality'' world. He blames Democrats, 
but then his Republican colleagues, often at his instruction, are told 
not to work on the bill with Democrats. What is going on here?
  What the President tweets and talks about at his rallies and what is 
actually happening are two different worlds--two different worlds. That 
is no good. It is no good for America, no good for the American people, 
and, frankly, no good for the President.
  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
