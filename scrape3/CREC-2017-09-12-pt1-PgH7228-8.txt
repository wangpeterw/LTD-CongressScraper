 HONORING THE BRAVERY AND SACRIFICE OF THE 442ND MISSION SUPPORT GROUP

  (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and thank the 
airmen of the 442nd Mission Support Group who returned home to Whiteman 
Air Force Base last month after a 6-month deployment. These dedicated 
reservists were deployed across six bases in support of Operation 
Resolute Support and provided vital base functions for our military 
overseas.
  The reservists of the 442nd left their homes, jobs, families, and 
friends to travel overseas to support our military's mission. I admire 
their commitment, their sacrifice, and dedication to our Nation. Their 
bravery and sacrifice deserve our appreciation and respect, and I am 
glad to welcome them home

and thank them for their service to our country.
  I would also like to take a moment to thank their families for their 
commitment to our country. America's military families say good-bye to 
their spouses, parents, children, and siblings for extended periods of 
time for the good of our Nation. They are unsung heroes, and they, too, 
deserve our recognition for their sacrifice.
  So to the airmen of the 442nd, you and your families have our undying 
gratitude. You are truly heroes. Welcome home, and thank you for your 
service.
