     CONGRATULATIONS TO THE SOUTH CAROLINA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, Sunday afternoon, the 
University of South Carolina's women's basketball team clenched their 
third consecutive Southeastern Conference championship.
  The Gamecocks beat Mississippi State 59-49 in the SEC's women's 
basketball tournament title game in Greenville, South Carolina.
  Juniors Kaela Davis of Suwanee, Georgia, and A'ja Wilson of Irmo, 
South Carolina, an extraordinary constituent, led the team with an 
impressive 38 combined points. This all-star team will likely hold the 
number one seed in the NCAA tournament that will begin on March 17.
  Head coach Dawn Staley joined the University of South Carolina in 
2008, building a team based on teamwork and determination. In the eight 
seasons that Coach Staley has been with the program, the South Carolina 
Women's Basketball Team has also seen three SEC regular season 
championships, three Sweet 16 seasons, and the program's first number 
one national ranking, with an average home attendance of over 14,000 
Gamecock fans.
  As March marks Women's History Month, it is especially fitting to 
congratulate Coach Dawn Staley and the historic Gamecock women's 
basketball team.
  Best wishes for continued success in the NCAA playoffs. Go Gamecocks.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
