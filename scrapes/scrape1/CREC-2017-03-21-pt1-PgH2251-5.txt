                 DO NOT REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. CORREA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, on Thursday we will vote on the future of 
health care for America. We need to do what is right for our district 
and for our constituents. We need to protect the Affordable Care Act.
  The ACA works, but like America's other great healthcare program, 
Medicare, it needs a little time to get there. Today, Medicare covers 
over 55 million Americans and is a staple for our seniors; but back in 
1965, people had a very negative opinion of Medicare. Today, 52 years 
later, Medicare is one of the most efficient healthcare systems in our 
country.
  I urge my colleagues: Do not repeal the Affordable Care Act. If you 
do, 24 million Americans will lose their coverage and older Americans 
will pay higher premiums. I ask my colleagues to keep the ACA. Let's do 
the right thing.
