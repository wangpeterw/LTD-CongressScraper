                            TAX FREEDOM DAY

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last Sunday marked Tax 
Freedom Day, determined by the Tax Foundation, led by President Scott 
Hodge. This is the day when our citizens have earned enough money to 
pay their tax bill for the year.
  It is alarming that American taxpayers must work 113 days to foot the 
bill for their annual tax obligation. Collectively, American families 
spent more on their taxes this year than on food, clothing, and housing 
combined. This is an abuse of the American people, limiting their 
ability to spend their own hard-earned wages.
  As Tax Freedom Day is pushed later each year, we must commit to 
commonsense reforms to the Tax Code. The Federal Government takes too 
much from American workers with an obsessive push to increase taxes, 
destroying jobs.
  I am encouraged by the tax plan President Donald Trump outlined 
yesterday and look forward to working with him to provide tax reform 
that will create jobs, simplify the Tax Code, and grow the economy. I 
am confident that, by working together, we can deliver comprehensive, 
balanced tax reforms for American families which will promote jobs.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
