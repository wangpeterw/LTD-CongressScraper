 SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT PRESIDENT'S CARELESSNESS AND LACK OF JUDGMENT

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, in revealing classified information to the 
Russians, President Trump has compromised our ability to defend 
ourselves against ISIS to gather intelligence against them, and he has 
jeopardized our relationships with allies across the globe.
  Make no mistake about it, the President's actions were reckless. They 
are indefensible, and they make America less safe.
  Republicans cannot stay silent. There are serious questions about the 
President's carelessness, about his lack of judgment. In fact, last 
July, the Speaker said that individuals who are extremely careless with 
classified information should be denied further access to it.
  Even the President's own Chief of Staff said those who mishandle 
classified information have had their security clearances revoked. They 
have lost their jobs. They have faced fines. Some have gone to prison.
  I have to ask my colleagues, shouldn't the President of the United 
States be held to that same standard? They say he can do what he wants, 
but does that make it smart? No. Does that make it right? No. Does it 
make it less safe? Absolutely.
