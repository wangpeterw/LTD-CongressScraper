                  CHINA IS DESTROYING TIBETAN BUDDHISM

  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, last week, Human Rights Watch reported 
that the Chinese Government has imposed draconian new controls on 
Larung Gar, the famous Tibetan Buddhist center of learning.
  An official document says Communist Party cadres are taking over 
management, finances, security, admissions, and even the choice of 
textbooks. This follows last year's demolitions and expulsions.
  China says it respects constitutionally protected religious beliefs. 
That is a lie. When the state puts officials who are required to be 
atheists in charge of your religious institutions, that is not 
religious freedom. When admission requires a firm political stand, when 
the state tells you what to teach and students must honor the Communist 
Party, that is not religious freedom.
  Sadly, the White House has been silent as human rights abuses in 
China worsen. Enough is enough. Congress must pass the Reciprocal 
Access to Tibet Act. If the President won't act, Congress must ensure 
there are consequences for China's egregious actions to control and 
destroy Tibetan Buddhism.
