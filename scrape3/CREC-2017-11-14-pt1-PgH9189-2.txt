    CONFIRMATION OF BRIAN LACEFIELD AS KENTUCKY FARM SERVICE AGENCY 
                                DIRECTOR

  (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. Brian 
Lacefield, who was recently confirmed by President Trump as Kentucky's 
new Farm Service Agency director. I am thrilled to recognize such a 
prolific member of the agriculture community as Kentucky's new FSA 
director.
  Brian Lacefield was a successful area agriculture banker and 
agribusiness leader, most recently serving as market president of FNB 
Bank in Cadiz, Kentucky. A Hopkinsville native, Lacefield previously 
served as director of Commonwealth Agri-Finance with Hopkinsville 
Elevator, and he currently serves on the Kentucky Corn Growers board of 
directors, the Kentucky FFA Foundation, and the Kentucky Agricultural 
Leadership Program.
  I commend President Trump's selection of Lacefield to serve in such 
an important capacity.
  The FSA plays a vital role in the Commonwealth's agriculture 
undertakings. Just last year, the agency was responsible for more than 
$330 million of payments and loans to Kentucky farmers.
  I am grateful our new director brings with him a wealth of experience 
in agriculture, and I am confident he will serve Kentucky's farmers 
well. I look forward to working with Director Brian Lacefield in the 
years to come and continuing to serve Kentucky's agriculture community.
