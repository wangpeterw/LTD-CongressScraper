                             PASS A BUDGET

  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the previous speaker said this is a 4-week 
budget for the government, and another speaker said they have done 
their job.
  The most basic function of the majority party who controls the House, 
the Senate, and the White House is to write a permanent, 1-year budget 
for the Government of the United States. This is the fourth temporary 
continuing resolution. You are 113 days late.
  Now, what is wrong with that?
  Well, the Secretary of Defense says operating under a continuing 
resolution is about as unwise as could be. And you say you are here for 
the troops? Four weeks, now 18 days, maybe?
  It has cost the Pentagon billions. It has cost us $1.4 billion of 
lost transportation projects. That is 21,000 jobs. That is hundreds of 
projects across the country.
  Social Security needs new computers. They can't sign a contract to 
get them.

  Instead of accepting responsibility for your failures to pass a 
single appropriation bill, you are now demonizing the DREAMers.
  Pass a budget. Give us our appropriations--not 18 days, not 30 days--
for the rest of the fiscal year.
