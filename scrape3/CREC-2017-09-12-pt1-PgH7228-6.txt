            RECOGNIZING ALLIANCE FOR A HEALTHIER GENERATION

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
the outstanding work of the Alliance for a Healthier Generation in its 
mission to help our schoolchildren lead healthier lives. The alliance 
works closely with schools in Pennsylvania and nationwide to improve 
student health and wellbeing.
  Over the past decade, Healthier Generation's groundbreaking work with 
schools, communities, and businesses have benefited more than 25 
million children across this country. More than 950 Pennsylvania 
schools have teamed with Healthier Generation, helping more than half a 
million children in the Commonwealth make healthier choices.
  Since 2007, 18 Pennsylvania schools have been recognized with 
National Healthy School Awards for their exceptional work. The Healthy 
Out-of-School Time program has helped more than 11,000 Pennsylvania 
children have access to healthier foods and focus on more active 
community programs outside the classroom.
  Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Nutrition, I am so 
proud of our schools and our students who work to serve healthier meals 
and snacks, get students to move more, offer high-quality physical and 
health education, and empower school leaders to become healthy role 
models.
