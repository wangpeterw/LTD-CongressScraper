            By Mrs. COMSTOCK:
        H.R. 2008.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:

[[Page H2791]]

       Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the United States 
     Constitution; Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 of the United 
     States Constitution; and Amendment XVI to the United States 
     Constitution. Additionally, since the Constitution does not 
     provide Congress with the power to provide financial support 
     to U.S. political parties, the general repeal of the 
     Presidential Election Campaign Fund for this purpose is 
     consistent with the powers that are reserved to the States 
     and to the people as expressed in Amendments IX and X to the 
     United States Constitution. Further, Article I Section 8 
     defines the scope and powers of Congress and does not include 
     this concept of taxation in furtherance of funding U.S. 
     political parties within the expressed powers.
