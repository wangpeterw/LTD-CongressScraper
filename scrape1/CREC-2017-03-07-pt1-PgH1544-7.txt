                       AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REPEAL

  (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, last night our Republican colleagues finally 
revealed their secret healthcare bill, and it is clear that TrumpCare 
doesn't care. Here are the top five reasons why:
  Number one, TrumpCare cuts Medicaid. It creates block grants to 
States that will lead to less care, including forcing seniors out of 
nursing homes and reducing health care for the poor.
  Number two, TrumpCare eliminates healthcare subsidies. In its place, 
it creates substandard tax cuts that will ensure millions of Americans 
can no longer afford health insurance.
  Number three, TrumpCare favors the rich. It provides a tax giveaway 
for the rich, while leaving the middle class with less access to care.
  Number four, TrumpCare hurts our hospitals. It kicks people off of 
insurance, guaranteeing hospitals, employer plans, and taxpayers will 
ultimately foot the bill.
  Number five, TrumpCare defunds Planned Parenthood. This will leave 
millions of women without health care.
  In summary, TrumpCare doesn't care, and it won't work.
