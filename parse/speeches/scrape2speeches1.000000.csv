6350,topic-id,621,"Mr.Speaker, every time I visit Israel, I have such mixed feelings. It is a land of positive opportunities surrounded by intractable controversies.  The big question looming is how to achieve a two-state solution for the Israelis and the Palestinians with appropriate integrity so that they are actually separate countries. This has raised additional questions because of the ambiguity from the Trump administration about whether or not what, for years, has been American policy supporting a two-state solution is any longer a priority of theirs.  For several years, I have been deeply concerned about the looming environmental crisis in This is a small strip of land about twice the size of Washington, D.C., but it is home to 1.9 million people, most of whom are leading a wretched existence, even more so since Hamas, the political faction, has seized control. That is Israel's implacable enemy which now controls  They have little regard for their own people, using them as pawns, spending scarce resources, digging tunnels to try to kidnap Israeli children and soldiers, and launching rockets to terrorize Israeli communities in the surrounding areas.                              {time}  1015  Gaza has reached a crisis point in dealing with water and sanitation. The groundwater is so polluted that virtually all the water is unfit to drink--polluted by sewage, waste runoff, and seawater encroachment. They are pumping four times as much water out of the aquifer than can be replaced naturally, and seawater from the Mediterranean is encroaching.  We are told that, by the end of the year, there will probably be no sources of drinking water that are fit to drink. By 2020, the entire water system will be permanently damaged. Because of problems with drinking water that is not fit and raw sewage that is not treated, there is a real likelihood that we could have an outbreak of something like cholera, threatening not just the people in Gaza, but the Israelis as well.  Several times recently, sewage from Gaza has washed up on Israeli beaches and forced the shutdown of water treatment plants from desalinization. The Israeli military thinks this is a security threat.  In the course of this visit, I had an opportunity to put the question directly to Prime Minister Netanyahu; Jibril Rajoub, the number three person in the Palestinian Authority; and United States Ambassador Friedman about this pending crisis and the need for urgent action. Sadly, each of those conversations revealed I won't say indifference, but certainly a lack of urgency and no willingness for anybody to take the lead and break the impasse.  This is not a problem that is beyond our ability to solve. There are opportunities to increase electricity for pumping water and treating sewage. There is the capacity to build some smaller reservoirs to be able to mix saltwater with freshwater and extend the supplies.  For Israel, water is a mystery they have solved. They are the most water-rich country on the face of the planet, with very sophisticated technology. They could provide additional resources. Around the edges, the United States does some work with USAID, but it is not a priority for the United States at this point.  Mr.Speaker, I return perplexed. We will continue to push with the Israelis, the United States Government, the Palestinians, and with NGOs whenever we have the opportunity. But it seems to me, Mr.Speaker, if we cannot bring people together to solve a pending crisis with tools that are available to us now, at a relatively modest cost, what hope do we have of being able to work cooperatively to implement the two-state solution and be able to bring peace and security to Israel and the Palestinians?  I would hope my colleagues would lend their voices to this question.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-12-pt1-PgH5439.txt,99,TRIBUTE TO SCOTT SIMONS,2017.0,12.0,May

6450,topic-id,751,"Mr.President, I rise to pay tribute to law enforcement officers from Arkansas and all across the country who are called to serve and to protect. I am grateful for their dedication and commitment because it takes a very special person to put his life on the line every day to protect our communities.  Arkansans are proud of the law enforcement history in our In my hometown of Fort Smith, AR, the U.Marshals Service has a deep-rooted history that has helped shape our Nation's westward expansion. Today, many people in the area find their family roots traced back to a U.As home to the future U.Marshals Museum, the community and the State have rallied around this proud heritage. The tradition of courageous public service is carried on today by the men and women who keep communities across the country safe 24 hours a day.  This week, members from law enforcement agencies from around the Nation will join together in Washington to honor their fallen brothers and sisters who have died in the line of duty. May 15 marks Peace Officers Memorial Day, and this week is recognized as National Police We take this opportunity to honor the men and women who have died in the line of duty by adding their names to the National Law Enforcement Officers  This year, nearly 400 names will be added to the memorial, including these Arkansans: Robert Barker, a patrolman for the McCrory Police Department, who died while serving the people of Woodruff County on September 15, 2016; Corporal Bill Cooper, of the Sebastian County Sheriff's Office, who gave his life in the line of duty on August 10, 2016; and Corrections Officer Lisa Mauldin, who died in service to the community on December 18, 2016.  These Arkansans represent the selfless sacrifice that our law enforcement personnel embody. It is the truest testament to the life that they chose--to serve their communities.  I am sad to say that the name of another Arkansas law enforcement officer will be carved into the memorial. Yell County Sheriff's Deputy Kevin Mainhart was killed in the line of duty last week. He was a veteran officer with more than 20 years of serving and protecting Arkansas communities. I offer my condolences and my gratitude to his family and friends and the law enforcement community as they cope with this unspeakable tragedy.  Our law enforcement officers are true heroes. We recognize, not only during this week but all year long, the devotion of the 900,000 law enforcement officers whose service each and every day makes our communities safer.  I was proud to recognize the service and sacrifice of these first responders and show my support for their commitment to our safety during a tour of Arkansas last year that we called Every Second First responders invest so much of their lives in public service that one must take the opportunity to commend them for their tireless efforts and willingness to serve in a crisis at a moment's notice.  The role of law enforcement is changing. These men and women perform a variety of roles from responding to emergencies to maintaining public safety and promoting safety services and programs. In Arkansas, we are blessed to have the Criminal Justice Institute, which is a part of the University of Arkansas It is a resource to police departments and sheriffs' offices that provides them with updated training and information as they adapt to provide more services to their communities.  As a member of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus, I am deeply committed to supporting the Criminal Justice Institute and advocating for the policies and resources that law enforcement agencies need to successfully carry out their missions, as well as honoring those lives that are tragically cut short while in the line of duty.[[Page S2927]]  That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Honoring Hometown Heroes Act, which allows Governors to order the American flag to fly at half-staff in recognition of the sacrifice of the first responders who make the ultimate sacrifice.

6509,topic-id,373,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr.Newhouse), my colleague on the Rules Committee, for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, in the West, water is life. Coloradans must wisely steward the precious water flowing through our lands. That is why we are so focused on water storage projects.  Unfortunately, many water storage projects in my State face significant setbacks in permitting due to a long list of regulatory checkboxes. Local, State, and Federal agencies all have their own requirements.  For the past several years, I have followed multiple important water storage projects on the front range of Colorado that deeply impact Year after year, the shovels remain untouched as the water projects inched their way through the regulatory permitting process. Water projects should not take over 10 years to permit and then only a few years to build.  Much of this delay occurs because each level of government--local, State, and Federal--requires their own studies and permitting checklists, even though many of those requirements are the same or only slightly different.  H.1654 makes this process more efficient, allowing the Bureau of Reclamation to coordinate the Federal and State permitting processes, so that we can avoid unnecessary duplication and so that we can better unify the approval requirements.  H.1654 offers a more streamlined approval process for our water projects but still empowers State and Federal governments to fulfill our duties to protect communities and the environment.  This is a good government bill. We are simply asking different levels of government to work together so that our water projects can earn the permits they rightfully qualify for.  No water project should take 10 years to gain approval, but too many have. H.1654 ensures that projects on Federal lands will have a clear, more efficient permit application process.  We owe this bill to the people of Colorado; we owe this bill to the people of the We owe this bill to everyone in this country who relies on fresh, clean drinking water. We owe it to the farmers who need water for their crops, to the ranchers who need water for their livestock, to the anglers who need water for their recreation.

6599,topic-id,666,"Mr.President, I wish to commend Joseph ``Tim'' Arcano, technical director for Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC, Carderock Division, who is retiring after a lifetime[[Page S4419]]of service to the U.Navy, our Federal Government, and the scientific community.  Tim Arcano has dedicated his professional life to serving our country, first in the military and later as a civil servant. His knowledge of ships and the oceans they sail and nuclear safety and capabilities has been developed through his education and in his myriad positions throughout the Navy and our Federal Two of Arcano's academic degrees were earned in my us, home State, where he attended the U.Naval Academy, and later earned his Ph.at the University of In addition, he holds an Ocean Engineer degree and a masters in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,  Arcano's first career was in our military, where he served for 30 years in both Active and Reserve service. As technical director and ship design manager for the Virginia-Class Submarine Program, as technical authority for advanced submarines at Naval Sea System Command, NAVSEA, and as a program manager at the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, Arcano developed an understanding and expertise that few can match. Those skills were further utilized in five Reserve commands.  Arcano's dedication to our country continued after his transition from Active service to the Reserves in 1992 and his later retirement from the Navy as captain in June of 2008. He served as deputy chief of Nuclear Safety at the United States Department of Energy and as the director of the Office of Ocean Exploration and Research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric During that time, he returned to the Naval Academy to hold the Corbin McNeill Endowed Chair in Naval Engineering, where he created a course on engineering of submersible systems.  Arcano came to NSWC Carderock in May of 2013, bringing his wealth of experience as he took the helm of a campus of over 3,000 employees. His impact has been magnified by his commitment to STEM education and developing the next generation of scientific leaders. Under Arcano's leadership, employees at NSWC Carderock have mentored countless high school and college interns, even reaching to our youngest developing scientists by leading elementary students in FIRST Robotics clubs. Arcano ``walks the walk'' himself, giving greatly of his own time by taking interns under his wing to offer advice and helping them chart their path, wherever that might lead.  As part of his encouragement of STEM education, Arcano and NSWC Carderock have continued to host the International Human Powered Submarine Teams from not just corporations and research centers, but from universities and even high schools come from around the world to race their independently built one- or two-person submarines through a course at the historic David Taylor Model Basin at For 2 years, these competitors learn about hydrodynamic design, propulsion, underwater life support, materials science, and other scientific principles in creating their own designs for these vehicles. The lessons learned, both in science and engineering and in collaborating on a team project, help to fuel their enthusiasm for careers in science and technology.  Arcano's career reflects his selflessness, his unparalleled leadership capabilities, and his devotion to our country. He commands the respect and admiration of all who have had the privilege to know and work with him. His leadership will be greatly missed, but he has left a legacy of scientific leadership that will continue to develop through the principles and practice that he exercised every day. We are deeply grateful for his devotion to our national security, to naval science, and to America's future generations.  I offer the thanks of a grateful nation to Arcano and, by extension, to his family--his wife, Brenda, their daughter, Heather, and sons, Greg, Joseph, and Tyler--for as we all know, the support of family is critical. I am honored and pleased to recognize Tim Arcano for his outstanding career in public service and wish him all the best in his future pursuits.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-27-pt1-PgS4418-2.txt,,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,27.0,July
6500,topic-id,888,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to thank very much my colleague from Washington particularly for calling me ``young.'' I appreciate that always.  Mr.Speaker, I have enjoyed listening to the colloquy taking place among my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. We see this repeatedly now day[[Page H5010]]in and day out as we work hard in the majority to continue the progress that we have made so far in this Congress, really record-breaking progress of passing legislation, putting bills on the President's desk, having those bills signed into law. Mr.Speaker, I believe we are now at the point where we have presented more bills to the President and had more bills signed than in any Congress in the first term of any Presidency since Harry It is a record we are very proud of over here.  It is clear that as we continue to put commonsense reform legislation forward that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would sometimes like to distract and talk about other things. In terms of the healthcare conversation that is going on and the talk of unintended consequences, I would just point out, Mr.Speaker, that we now know the consequences of We have had to live under ObamaCare now for many years. We are in a situation where the system is absolutely failing the people of this country, and we have an obligation as a body, an obligation we take seriously here in the House, to make sure that we do what is right for the people of this country, that we provide them relief, that we provide them the kind of healthcare reform that is going to lower their costs, that is going to provide better access to care and put people back in charge.  We have tried the Democrats' way now for the last 7 years and fundamentally seen that the government cannot mandate effectively what people need. It doesn't have the consequences that many on the other side of the aisle thought it would, and the consequences have been devastating.  Mr.Speaker, the same is true in terms of the challenge that we are here dealing with today with these two bills. As my colleague from Washington (Mr.Newhouse) so eloquently put it, those of us across the West--and Mr.Polis knows this well, too--have had to live under this situation of absolutely devastating forest fires, forest fires that have been caused in too many instances by mismanagement by the Forest Service, mismanagement by the Federal  These bills--and in particular, H.1873, which is a bill that I am honored to cosponsor with Representative LaMalfa--will begin to impose the kind of commonsense reforms that we need so that our power grid is no longer threatened by mismanagement of our Federal Forest Service, of our Federal forestlands.  On our federally managed forest in Wyoming, when we have overgrowth around a power line, it is a direct risk to the people, the property, and the power grid, as well as to the wildlife that those on the other side of the aisle claim to care so much about.  Our local leaders understand this. Our local leaders are in the very best position to do something about this and to do it quickly. That is why we put in place these provisions in these bills that will allow the local utilities, allow local officials, to make the kinds of decisions that have to be made quickly.  H.1873 will allow our utilities to submit their own management facility inspection plans, their own operation and maintenance plans, and it will also ensure that our Federal land managers have consistent and accountable policies to reduce hazards in electricity rights-of-way, including they, themselves, will be held accountable for managing the land. The bill does adjust the liability framework for these rights-of-way to ensure that the utilities and the Federal Government have the incentive to respond quickly and effectively to these hazards.  Nobody in Wyoming or in any other State ought to feel that they have to go without affordable, reliable power, ought to feel that the power grid is threatened simply because the Federal Government fails to do its job. We have simply seen that too much. Our local co-ops are willing and able to step up to the plate.  Solving this problem is crucial to those who live in Wyoming, where bark beetle-killed trees and poorly managed overgrowth of Federal forests pose true threats to the safety and health of our communities and to our power reliability. Mr.Speaker, that is why H.1873 is supported by the Wyoming Rural Electric Association, the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, Black Hills Energy, the Edison Electric Institute, the American Public Power Association, the U.Chamber of Commerce, the Western Governors Association, and many others who care so much about our lands out  Wyoming supports this bill. Wyoming utility co-ops know best how to manage the provision of electricity and how to handle these rights-of-way and also how to provide healthy and sustainable forest management as they do so.  Mr.Speaker, I request immediate passage of this bill. It is hugely important that we get back on track, that we stop the kind of mismanagement from Washington that has been so damaging for so many years, and I urge my colleagues in Congress to act quickly on its passage.

Hemp is such an industrial crop that, during World War II, the USDA produced a film encouraging farmers to grow hemp to support the war effort because textiles and fibers were in such short supply.  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe all grew hemp. Today, however, industrial hemp is largely illegal for widespread production because the Controlled Substances Act does not make the distinction between hemp and marijuana.  Both are varieties of the cannabis plant, but that is where the similarities end. Unlike marijuana, hemp is high in fiber that makes it so useful and only has miniscule amounts of  In 2004, Congress began to recognize the differences when it passed the 2014 farm bill, which included language to allow industrial hemp pilot programs. Today, more than 30 States have enacted laws to legalize industrial hemp for research or commercial purposes.  I was proud to lead the effort to create a hemp program in Kentucky that has been highly successful, with nearly 250 permitted growers and small businesses today.

6451,topic-id,619,"Madam President, this is National Police Week--a time each year when we remember and honor those who have fallen in the line of duty.  There are more than 900,000 law enforcement officers serving in our country, and tragically every year dozens lose their lives defending our communities and our freedoms.  This year, as part of National Police Week, I am so thankful that Javier Vega, Jr., one of Texas's own, was honored at the National Law Enforcement Officer Memorial over the weekend, right here in Washington, Just a few hours ago, I had the honor of meeting his family--his wife, his children, and his parents--along with several of his friends whom he served alongside in the U.Border  They know, all too well, the high cost paid by our law enforcement officers who put themselves at risk every day. Javier--who was known by his close family and friends as Harvey--grew up in La Feria, TX, a small town in South He was a man known for putting others before himself--someone who would always serve rather than be served.  That desire turned first into a military career. He enlisted in the Marine Corps right out of high school, and later he put himself through college. Then he decided he hadn't done all he wanted to do in public service so he joined the Border Patrol, and just like everything else he pursued in life, he dedicated himself to tirelessly serving others and serving his country.  Sadly, that service was cut short when he and his family, while out on a fishing trip on a Sunday afternoon, were ambushed by two men who tried to rob them. The clash turned violent. Javier immediately thought of protecting others before himself so he jumped into action to fend off the attackers and defend his family.  Tragically, he was killed by the two men--illegal immigrant criminals who had been reportedly deported but managed repeatedly to find their way back into the country, even after committing serious crimes. What a testament to the great need we have to strengthen our border security and justice system to keep us all safe.  Now, there is no denying that Javier Vega, Jr., was taken from his family, his community, and from all of us far too soon. So while we consider the fallen this week, like Javier, and their lives of service, I hope we can also take time to consider how we can better support and serve those who have promised to defend us to the point of risking their very lives.  As we learn from the story of Javier, one obvious way we can do that is by making sure our Federal laws are fully enforced to protect our communities from those who would take advantage of our generosity and commit violent crimes, even though they are not in the country legally.  We have a chance to do more for our law enforcement officers, and we should always look for ways to do right by them. Now isn't the time to look the other way or to pretend that real problems facing our Nation and our law enforcement community will simply go away. So during this year's National Police Week, I look forward to playing my part to put forward policies that better support their mission to defend and protect communities all across the country.

6442,topic-id,538,"Today I wish to recognize and honor the extraordinary service and sacrifice of Aaron Allan of the Southport Police Dedication, loyalty, and compassion for those in need were the qualities that defined Allan's life.  Aaron Allan was a 6-year veteran with the Southport Police Department, who began his career in law enforcement in 2001. A kind and caring person, Allan was a family man who devoted his life to serving his community. Allan earned the nickname ``Teddy Bear'' because of his kind heart and willingness to help anyone in need.  Allan had dreamed of being a police officer since he was 5 years old. Before he joined the Southport Police Department in 2011 as a volunteer officer, he previously worked as an officer at the Indiana School for the Deaf and for Franklin Township In 2015, he was named Southport Police Department's ``Officer of the Year,'' after saving two lives. Among his efforts, he performed CPR to save a man at the Indiana State Fairgrounds before backup officers arrived with a defibrillator. In recognition of his work, he became the only full-time paid officer in an all-volunteer force of reserve officers. He was a devout volunteer, leader, and role model in Southport, who believed in community policing and prided himself on stopping to talk with residents and getting to know them. Allan made a difference in the community and always put the safety and well-being of his fellow citizens first. When he encountered a family whose car would not start and the husband had been diagnosed with a brain tumor and the wife cared for her husband and young daughter, Allan went to an auto parts store and bought the family a new car battery with his own money. It went beyond that. He participated in ``Shop with a Deputy,'' volunteering to take underprivileged children Christmas shopping. He also excelled responding to difficult calls, whether a citizen had overdosed and needed Narcan or he encountered a drunk driver. He enriched and touched so many lives through his service, and he made the ultimate sacrifice while responding to fellow citizens in need.  On Thursday, July 27, 2017, Allan was doing his job, responding to an incident involving an overturned vehicle in Southport, when he was shot. Hours before Allan was killed, he walked his 5-year-old son, Aaron, Jr., to the bus for his first day of kindergarten. He put his life on the line so that Hoosiers could have the chance to live in peace and safety, and we are eternally grateful. He died doing what he loved, and his legacy will live on.  Allan was a devoted citizen, son, husband, father, and friend, who loved his children and his fellow brothers and sisters in blue. He loved his job as a Southport Police Officer, and no amount of gratitude can repay Allan or his loved ones for his sacrifice.  Allan is survived and deeply missed by his wife, Stacy, their two sons, his fellow officers in Southport, and citizens across Let us strive to remember and emulate the shining example Allan set for us, and honor his selfless commitment to serving his fellow citizens. May God welcome Allan home and give comfort to his family and friends.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-08-02-pt1-PgS4756-2.txt,1850,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1873, ELECTRICITY RELIABILITY AND",2017.0,2.0,May
6398,topic-id,596,"Mr.President, I want to thank my colleague from New Hampshire before she leaves the floor for her statement on the Affordable Care I know she made reference to the recent report from the Congressional Budget Office that we just received, and it tells the whole story. It tells us all we need to know about TrumpCare 2--the second attempt by the Republicans to replace the Affordable Care What it tells us in the starkest terms is exactly the reason why the Republicans didn't want to wait around for this analysis.  For the record, the Congressional Budget Office is a nonpartisan agency of the Federal Government that analyzes our great ideas and tells us what is going to happen if they become law. I know this agency pretty well because[[Page S3126]]when we wrote the Affordable Care Act, we waited and waited and waited, sometimes weeks at a time, until some bright idea that we thought we had was analyzed in the cold reality of healthcare in Sometimes they came back and said good idea, and many times they came back and said bad idea.  The Republicans passed TrumpCare 2 in the House about 3 weeks ago and wouldn't wait for the Congressional Budget Office analysis. We thought to ourselves, that is unusual. That is the standard everybody uses in They wouldn't wait because they knew what was coming, and today it was announced.  This afternoon, here is what the Congressional Budget Office said about the Republican attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Next year, under the Republican plan, 14 million Americans would lose their health insurance. How about that for a starter. That is the starting point of their analysis. Over the next 10 years, 23 million Americans would lose their health insurance. Next year, premiums--the cost of health insurance--would increase 20 percent in the individual market. The CBO affirms that under current law--the Affordable Care Act--the marketplaces are stable. However, under the Republican repeal bill, one-sixth of the population resides in parts of America where the individual market would become unstable beginning in the year 2020.  There will be $834 billion in cuts in Federal Medicaid Programs over the next decade. Do we know what those cuts mean? In my State, half the children born are covered by The mothers get prenatal care so the babies are healthy--paid for by The delivery is paid for by The postnatal care of that little infant is paid for by  That is not the most expensive part of Medicaid in my State and in most The most expensive part is for your mom and your grandmother in the nursing home.

Those are the casualties of this Republican repeal plan, not to mention the fact that the real driving force behind these terrible healthcare decisions is a tax cut for the wealthiest people in  This is from the Congressional Budget Office again: $88 billion in tax cuts for the superwealthy and big businesses, including drug companies.

6405,topic-id,826,"That is exactly what the Congressional Budget Office reports to us.  This afternoon we had a press conference and we invited four or five families to come in with their kids. The theme of the press conference was, what is going to happen if your child has a preexisting condition?  Well, there were some amazing little kids there and some heroic moms and dads telling the story about what happens when you discover that your little infant has a cantaloupe-sized tumor from neuroblastoma and what happens for that family, what happens to that infant. Thank goodness those kids were all standing there smiling. They fought the good fight, and they have to continue to fight it, and each and every one of them is branded as having a preexisting condition. Back in the old days, before the Affordable Care Act, that meant those families were unable to buy health insurance, or if they could buy it, they couldn't afford it because the premiums were too high. So we passed the Affordable Care Act and said: We are not going to allow you to discriminate against anyone for a preexisting condition.  If you have a spouse with diabetes, if you have somebody in your family who is a cancer survivor, they can't use it against you. They can't discriminate. Now the Congressional Budget Office tells us what is going to happen to those people. We are going back to the bad old days when those families will not only have to stay awake at night[[Page S3127]]worrying about whether that baby of theirs is going to survive, they are going to stay awake at night also worrying about how in the world they are going to pay for their health insurance.  Is that the Republican answer? Is that Trumpism at work when it comes to healthcare in America? I can't believe the American people voted for that. I can't believe they are saying to our Republican colleagues: We really don't care if our health insurance covers preexisting conditions. Of course they care.  They come back with something called high-risk pools. I am sure the Senator from New Hampshire can remember those. Let me tell you about some of those warnings around swimming pools that say: No diving, the pool is too shallow. Well, the high-risk pools for preexisting conditions are way too shallow. No family with preexisting conditions should dive into those pools because the amount of money provided for by the Republicans in their affordable care repeal would only cover about one out of four families with preexisting conditions. Three out of four families: You are on your own.  Think about that. If you have ever been in a position in life where you are a parent with a sick child and have no health insurance, you will never forget it as long as you live. I know because I have been there. When I was a law student with a little baby who was sick, I had no health insurance. I will never forget it as long as I live.  Why don't the Republicans hear the same message we hear? Why aren't they listening to these families and the struggles they are going through to keep their kids alive? And they come up with a repeal plan that is going to make it exceedingly difficult--in some cases impossible--to provide quality care to these kids and to people with preexisting conditions. That, to me, is not our responsibility.  I go to the conclusion of the Senator from New Hampshire, which I think is the right one. Is the Affordable Care Act perfect? It is one of the most important and I think the most giving bills I have ever voted for, but it is far from perfect. We should be sitting down with the other side of the aisle--Republicans and Democrats--not to repeal the Affordable Care Act but to make sure we make the repairs that make a difference.  Each one of us has a list of things we would like to see addressed. The cost of premiums are too high in the individual market. Let's address that directly, and we should. The fact that pharmaceutical drugs don't have any regulation or control in terms of pricing is just plain wrong. And third--I will just put on my agenda--I think every American should have the option of a public option plan like You can decide if that is right for you or your family, but a not-for-profit plan based on Medicare should be available to every American no matter where you live. Those are the three things I would put on the table right away. To walk away from coverage for 23 million Americans and to endanger the coverage for those who remain with premiums they can't afford is hardly humane and hardly consistent with American values.  So I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for her contribution in this. We have to get the message out.

6407,topic-id,302,"If I may also say, I agree completely that discriminating against veterans should hardly be the starting point for the reform of our healthcare system.  I want to make this point because I know exactly what the first speech will be from the Republican side of the aisle. This point in the Congressional Budget Office affirms that under current law insurance marketplaces are stable. They are stable. That isn't what you will hear from the other side of the aisle. The other side of the aisle loves to use the phrase ``death spiral,'' that the current healthcare system in America is in a death spiral.  The only death spiral in the current healthcare system is brought on because the Republicans have their hands around the throat of that system and they are choking it. Their sabotage of our current healthcare system is the reason there is uncertainty in the insurance markets. The insurance companies told us that this week: We don't know where you are going in We don't know what the future will hold. We have an obligation to our shareholders and people who work for us to make sure we protect ourselves. So we are going to hold back in terms of commitment.  So to the Republicans I would say: This is no death spiral. This is a self-fulfilling prophecy to bring down our healthcare system, and shame on those who would do it at the expense of vulnerable populations across  I will mention one other group while the Senator from New Hampshire is on the floor.

I am sure that is the case in New  ",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgS3124-2.txt,326,CONGRATULATING THE WEST SIDE HIGH SCHOOL TRACK TEAMS,2017.0,24.0,May
6409,topic-id,506,"I am sure, in the Senator's State, like in our State of Illinois, there are larger cities with big hospitals that treat all kinds of cases, but were it not for that safety net of hospitals in small towns, these people living there would drive an extra 50 or 100 miles to get to a hospital and would see the loss of critical services for trauma and emergencies that currently exist with these smalltown hospitals.  According to the Illinois Hospital Association and others, the first casualties of the Republican repeal bill--the first casualties of TrumpCare--it is estimated in Illinois that we will lose 60,000 healthcare jobs at our hospitals because of the Republican approach. How important are these jobs? I will go out on a limb: In most communities, they are the best paying jobs in the community. The men and women who are the doctors and the nurses and the specialists who provide that basic care in these towns, sure, they get compensated better than most, but we want to compensate them and keep them there because without them, people don't have the basic health services they count on.  So from every perspective, whether it is the doctors, the nurses, the pediatricians, substance abuse treatment, hospitals and clinics, the Republican approach to repealing ObamaCare--repealing the Affordable Care Act--is devastating, and the Congressional Budget Office put it in writing today.  I might say, we should close by saying what is happening in the Senate after the House passed this terrible bill, which the Congressional Budget Office told us about. Well, we don't know. It is a mystery. We would have expected that someone in the Senate would have decided: Let's put a bill on the table, let's have an open public hearing, let's have a debate about where we go, and let's make a good, sound decision that is in the best interests of the American families. That is not the case at all.  Instead, the Republican leader in the Senate has chosen 12 or 13 men to sit in[[Page S3128]]a room outside of the view of the public and to craft an alternative to the terrible bill that passed the Nobody has seen it, nobody wants to talk about it. It has not been scored. It has not been debated. That is their idea of reforming healthcare in That is not going to work--at least not going to work for the best interests of the families I represent.

6539,topic-id,519,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  On June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress passed a resolution establishing an official flag for the new American The resolution, now known as the Flag Act of 1777, stated that the flag would be ``thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new Constellation.''  For the last 240 years, the American people have celebrated Flag Day every June 14, and, over that time, the flag has evolved. As we all know, changes have been made to its design, shape, and arrangement. The Flag Act of 1794 changed the design from 13 to 15 stars to accommodate the admission of Vermont and Kentucky into the The Flag Act of 1818 mandated that the 13 stripes represented the Thirteen Original Colonies, the number of stars matched the number of States, and provided that subsequent changes in the number of stars would be made on the 4th of  What has remained rock solid over that quarter millennium, however, is what our flag represents. It represents one nation, freedom, and justice for all, and the sacrifices made in pursuit of those core American values.[[Page H4209]]  Current law provides guidance for displaying and handling the flag so it is afforded the respect it deserves and has earned. In abiding by these guidelines, we all commemorate the value and love we hold for what our flag represents. That is why the legislation before us today, H.1892, the Honoring Hometown Heroes Act, is not only appropriate but necessary.  This bill amends Federal law to permit State and Territorial Governors and the Mayor of Washington, D.C., to order that the flag be flown at halfstaff in the event that a public safety officer dies in the line of duty. For purposes of this legislation, ``public safety officers'' include local police officers, firefighters, and EMS professionals. These are individuals who make great sacrifices so we all can live in a free country. These men and women work long hours, separated from their loved ones, and consistently place themselves in harm's way so we as Americans can enjoy our freedom and our way of life. These sacrifices often go unappreciated.  When an officer dies in the line of duty, he or she is making the ultimate sacrifice for their community, their family, and for their country. H.1892 allows the American people to show their appreciation to these men and women, who are truly the bulwark between order and chaos. They represent the values the Founders held so dear nearly 250 years ago, and their sacrifices must be publicly acknowledged so they are not taken for granted.  I thank the lead sponsor of this bill, Congressman John On May 3, the House Committee on the Judiciary approved the Honoring Hometown Heroes Act with unanimous, bipartisan support.

6375,topic-id,754,"Mr.President, on April 26 of each year, we celebrate World Intellectual Property Day and recognize the important role of intellectual property rights in the fabric of our society. This year, we take time to recognize the innovators and creators who are making our lives healthier, safer, and more productive through their ingenuity and the robust system of intellectual property protections enshrined in our laws.  The Founding Fathers recognized the value of intellectual property, empowering Congress ``to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.''  Placing this authority within Congress's enumerated powers underscores the weight that our Founding Fathers placed on intellectual property's value to the budding Nation as a means of fostering economic development and growth. Our success as a nation in agriculture, manufacturing, technology, and medicine shares a common thread of intellectual property rights.  True to their predictions, our system of intellectual property has fostered innovation and ensured America's role as an economic engine of inventions that have made us healthier, safer, and more secure.  Our system of intellectual property rights has evolved since the ratification of the Constitution and the passage of the Copyright Act of 1790, but its core mission of promoting innovation has remained constant.  Our innovators and creators rely on IP protections such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets to help drive and recoup their investments of ingenuity.  Of course, the innovation that intellectual property helps encourage benefits society more broadly as well. It drives enormous economic activity and development, helping assure America's place as an economic and intellectual beacon to the world. As the U.Chamber's Global Intellectual Property Center recently pointed out, IP-intensive industries employ over 40 million Americans, accounting for 34.8 percent of total U.gross domestic product.  Iowans have long held intellectual property as an integral part of our economy. Our commitment to growth and innovation has led to $11.2 billion in annual IP-related exports from the State, more than 667,000 IP-related jobs, and 19.9 percent higher wages for direct IP workers than non-IP workers.  As a society, we depend on innovators to make our lives better and to solve the challenges we face. These innovators, in turn, depend on different forms of intellectual property.  The Judiciary Committee will continue to play an important role in protecting intellectual property and we will continue to work to advance innovation. This week, Senator Leahy and I reintroduced the Patents for Humanity Program Improvement Act to encourage and reward companies that innovate and use patented technology to[[Page S2549]]address humanitarian needs. This legislation improves the incentives for small businesses to participate in the program, by ensuring that the prize--a certificate for expedited processing of certain matters at the USPTO--can be transferable to third parties.  Yesterday, we held a hearing with witnesses from U.Immigration and Customs Enforcement and industry innovators who described the central role that intellectual property has played in allowing their businesses to grow and innovate. We also heard about some of the enforcement challenges that those in IP-intensive industries face as they seek to protect their intellectual property.  As a cochair of the Congressional Trademark Caucus, which we just relaunched this week, I recognize the value of trademarks and their impact on society and the economy, as well as how counterfeiting can seriously impact consumer health and safety. Counterfeiting of goods presents a worldwide problem with enormous health and economic impacts, costing the global economy over 2.5 million jobs per year, while draining tax revenue and hurting the ability of American companies to compete in foreign markets.  Similarly, trade secret theft is an increasingly serious problem. A report by the IP Commission found that annual losses due to trade secret theft are over $300 billion and is the cause of an estimated loss of 2.1 million American jobs. That is why we passed into law the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016. This important legislation brings needed uniformity to trade secret law and provides more certainty to the innovators who rely on trade secrets to develop novel solutions to important problems that face us as a nation.  Intellectual property is a key driver of innovation and fundamental building block of our modern economy. This World IP Day, as we recognize the positive impacts IP has on innovation, let us continue to find ways to work together to ensure its protection against infringement and maintain the United States enduring position as the most innovative and creative country in the world.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-26-pt1-PgS2548.txt,457,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,26.0,June
6449,topic-id,948,"Mr.President, let me assure the Senator from New York that I am willing to listen to his stories about how people might be affected by the health care debate that is going on in the Congress right now if he will listen to some of the stories I have to tell. By the middle of June, people in 94 of the 99 counties in Iowa may not be able to buy insurance through the Obamacare exchanges.  Senator Schumer talked about the tough consequences of the House bill on healthcare. I am coming to the Senate floor today to talk about the tough consequences of  I rise today to speak some more about the Affordable Care The law is collapsing before our eyes. After 7 years of ObamaCare, it continues to overreach, overpromise, and overstay its welcome for the American people. I want to tell you the history about a bridge that relates very much to what is happening to ObamaCare today.[[Page S2926]]  Before I dive into the details of how ObamaCare is denying people in the State of Iowa the ability to get health insurance, I want to share a story about a bridge in the State of  This bridge is depicted right here. This is the collapse of that bridge. The bridge is called Tacoma Narrows It was built in 1940. It was the world's third largest suspension bridge. It was considered a state-of-the-art masterpiece of 20th-century engineering, but the bridge was set to fail from the very beginning.  On July 1, 1940, the $6 million bridge opened to traffic. Just 5 months later, on November 7, 1940, the bridge collapsed. What caused the massive steel and concrete structure to twist, turn, and drop nearly 200 feet into Puget Sound? Importantly, there was a key foreshadowing clue. The bridge was nicknamed ``Galloping Gertie'' for its dancing, swaying bridge deck. On most days, it resembled a roller coaster rolling in the wind. But on the morning of November 7, Gertie's dance became twisted in a howling 40-mile-an-hour wind. Dramatic footage shown here shows tons of concrete and steel cables snapping like fishing lines before its collapse. Gertie essentially self-destructed due to design flaws that created sheer havoc in those high winds.  Like ObamaCare, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge wasn't built to last, and like Galloping Gertie, ObamaCare is on a self-destruction course with destiny. Galloping Gertie collapsed by a flawed design that was unable to withstand high winds, and every day that goes by without a bipartisan solution to fix the flaws, ObamaCare is moving the American people closer to a calamity.  Sooner rather than later, ObamaCare will become its own bridge to nowhere, with no insurance plans on the exchanges. Millions of Americans will be left twisting high and dry. The warning signs can no longer be ignored. First, many health insurers are bailing. The individual market is near collapse.  Just last week, another insurance company, Aetna, announced it will quit the remaining two States it planned to sell plans in under That means in 2018, Aetna will sell zero plans on the individual market exchanges. Just a year ago, in 2016, Aetna participated in the individual markets in 778 counties across the country. In 2017, that number fell to 242. In 2018, that number will be zero.  We ought to repeat this story because everybody is talking about what the House health care bill might do to people's health insurance and their healthcare. The fact is that people can't buy health insurance, or if they buy it, the deductibles are so high they can't afford it. That is the story we ought to be telling at least with equal weight with the stories given by people who are talking about not wanting to do anything with healthcare.  My home State has been hit particularly hard by insurers pulling out of the individual market. In 2016, UnitedHealth Group announced it would leave Iowa the following year. Last month, Aetna and Wellmark announced they would be pulling out of the individual market in This leaves 94 of our 99 counties in Iowa with one choice for health insurance on the individual market.  A constituent wrote to me following the news of their departure.       My son recently turned 26 years old and is ineligible to      remain on my insurance; therefore, he signed up for his own      policy through My son farms with my husband, so      while my husband has coverage through me, my son may soon be      facing the fact that he will not be able to buy health      insurance. My son, a true ``beginning farmer,'' will be      forced to leave our farming operation and seek employment      solely for the purpose of health care coverage.  If Congress doesn't act, the individual market may come crashing down, just like the Tacoma Narrows bridge. We simply can't ignore another warning sign. Healthier, younger people are choosing the off-ramp. The toll to join ObamaCare is turning out to be unaffordable for them. ObamaCare is unsustainable.  Remarkably, instead of joining us to fix this broken bridge, the other side wants to leave Americans twisting in the wind. In my home State, 70,000 Iowans are enrolled in the individual exchanges, and the last carrier left, Medica, is on the fence about its plans for 2018. That is why I told Senator Schumer to listen to our stories. The people in 94 of Iowa's 99 counties may not even be able to buy insurance on the exchange.  The day has come. It is time to cross the bridge. It is time to repeal and replace ObamaCare before it finishes its collapse.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

6394,topic-id,876,"Mr.President, today I wish to celebrate the life of my aunt, Eleanor Atwater Byers, who passed away peacefully on March 20, 2017. Nunnie, as she was affectionately known, was born on November 30, 1927, in Fall River, MA, and grew up in Tiverton and Providence,  She grew up doing anything she could with water such as swimming, fishing, and sailing, as well as climbing trees, collecting arrowheads, and communing with the natural world on and around Nanaquaket Pond for the first 14 years of her life in At 12 years old, Nunnie took her first photograph with a Brownie camera of her best friend. At age 14, her family started to summer in Little Compton, RI, and while her childhood pals continued to sail and swim, Nunnie photographed the Sakonnet landscape. She continued snapping pictures until age 22 and then never photographed again until 30 years later. After the loss of her family's home to fire in 1940, Nunnie and her family moved to Providence, where she attended Lincoln After graduating from Lincoln School in 1945, Nunnie went to Bradford Junior College in Haverhill, Soon after graduating from Bradford in 1947, Nunnie suffered a broken back from a skiing accident which required a year's recovery, including many months in a full body cast. This injury would be a source of physical discomfort and limit her mobility for the rest of her life, but it would fail to squelch her mischievous and indomitable spirit.  Ahead of her times and a true adventurer, Nunnie joined the American Friends Field Service and participated in a mission trip to the village of Santiago Ixcuintla in Nayarit, She taught in health clinics and schools to improve the quality of life for the native Huichol and Mexican women and children with whom she fell in love. Soon after her return from Mexico, she accepted the marriage proposal of Randolph Kunhardt Byers, Jr., of Milton, MA, and they were married in August of 1951.  Randy's enlistment in the Army took them to Lawton, They then returned to Rhode Island where Nunnie gave birth to their first of four children, Elizabeth ``Libby''. In 1955, they moved to Wilton, CT, while also bringing son Bartlett ``Bart'' Cooke into the world. Two more daughters were to follow, Eleanor ``Ellie'' and Mary.[[Page S2489]]  Nunnie created extraordinary homes showcasing naturally found objects and her photography. She also loved crafting joyful holiday celebrations, including such things as greeting trick-or-treaters dressed as a witch with a memorable cackle and laugh from the roof of the garage. She adored her dachshunds, West Highland white terriers, and chocolate lab, giving them people names to assure them of their family status.  Her days in Mexico inspired memorable travels with Randy to Guatemala, Haiti, Mexico--again--Europe, and beyond, and she always had her camera at her side. She displayed her business acumen through leading a women's investment group, played paddle tennis, skated, cross country skied, fished, and boated. In 1970, Nunnie moved to her dream home in Wilton, which was surrounded by acres and acres of woods and on a reservoir. There, she balanced time communing with birds and skating on black ice with completing her job raising and launching her four teenagers, a job she later acknowledged to be one of the most gratifying, albeit societally underrecognized, accomplishments of her life.  Once done with child rearing, Nunnie turned her attention back to her photographic artwork, and in 1980, she went back to school and studied photography seriously for 5 years, including participating in workshops abroad. She dug out her old Brownie black-and-white vintage negatives and set about developing them herself, along with new images she took with her Leica camera, at a local community dark room. She also mounted and framed the prints and then displayed them at photography shows and exhibits for all to enjoy. She also created several series of color postcards of her beloved Little Compton and sold them at the local general store. She experimented with images, wanting to show others what can be seen with the ``naive eye'' and produced a large volume of photographic work until her eyesight started failing her in her 80s. Nunnie shared her gift, teaching others how to see and how to construct interesting and aesthetically pleasing visuals.  Nunnie was a force to be reckoned with, a fierce and passionate woman who felt and experienced life at a very deep level. Her sense of humor was full of wit, and time spent with her was always memorable. She stood her ground, valued truth, and supported others in being their own selves.  She was predeceased by her parents, Eleanor Bartlett and David Hay She was the sister of the late David ``Tiny'' Hay Atwater, Jr., and Damaris ``Dicie'' Sayre Living to carry on her memory are her husband of 65 years, Randy, and her children, Elizabeth ``Libby'' Moore and husband, Raoul, of Little Compton; Bartlett ``Bart'' Cooke Byers of Denver, CO; Eleanor ``Ellie'' Byers of Shelburne, VT; and Mary Truslow and her husband, Charles, of Living to carry on her legacy are her grandchildren, Justin, Loren, Chas, Kelsey, Andrew, Will, and Living to carry on the Atwater legacy are her sister, Sally Anne ``Sadie'' Havens, and brother, Nathaniel ``Nate'' Bartlett Atwater, both of Little                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-24-pt1-PgS2488-3.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,24.0,June

This year, the corn boil is focused on helping families and organizations addressing autism.  In 1967, the first ever corn boil brought Sugar Grove community members together for several hours in order to raise enough funds for the town's first ever street lamp. As a result of the festival's initial success, the community continued the tradition year after year.  The Sugar Grove Corn Boil has grown from a one-day event to a four-day event that brings around 35,000 attendees annually. Even though the old steam engines that used to boil the corn are no longer in use, the tradition of corn in the community ensures the grain remains a staple of the festival.  While the festival has grown in size and prominence, the mission has always stayed the same: to bring friends, family, and neighbors together to raise money for local organizations and for town improvement.  In addition, the corn boil celebrates Sugar Grove's Citizen of the Year to remind the community of the difference one person can make. Every dime donated to the Sugar Grove Corn Boil is given back to the community, whether it is local groups, food banks, churches, or to meet village needs.[[Page H6561]]  I am pleased to share that this year's festival is dedicated to the effort to address autism.

Perhaps most important are the 382,000 lives saved through Focus on the Family's Option Ultrasound program, which helps mothers choose life when faced with unexpected pregnancies.  Those 382,000 lives and, indeed, our entire Nation owe you a debt of gratitude.

He ran unsuccessfully for Governor in 1984 and 1988, but never gave up the opportunity to give back to the State he loved.  He was a member of the Moorefield Volunteer Fire Company and fought[[Page S2613]]fires years ago because he believed so deeply in public service.

Last year, the State of West Virginia lost one of our own, West Virginia State Police first sergeant Joseph Joseph was from Clarksburg and joined the State police in 1998 and served in In 2008, he was assigned staff officer at the academy and was then promoted to deputy director of training.

National Police Week acknowledges the service and sacrifice of our country's law enforcement officers and the safety and protection they provide our communities. Madam President, I know you do too. I go to a lot of schools and talk to the children. I want them to understand that anytime they see a person in uniform, whether it be a policeman, fireman, or EMT, these are people willing to get in front of harm's way for their safety and sacrifice themselves for them.

6485,topic-id,1917,"Mr.Speaker, before I begin the rule on the two measures that are before us today, let me just make a couple of comments that have come to mind in light of the events over the last week.  Mr.Speaker, you may know that this is the first formal debate that we have had as a legislative body since last Wednesday morning's shooting. I think[[Page H5006]]it is appropriate that we take a minute to reflect and remember those who were injured and are still struggling to recover from their injuries as well as those who did not receive physical injuries on last Wednesday morning but who are still recovering.  Let me also say, if I could be so presumptuous, Mr.Speaker, I believe that perhaps some people in the United States look to us here in Congress--their Representatives--and look and see how we act towards one another and how we conduct ourselves in our interaction with each other. Let me just say that if we are disrespectful to each other, others may see that and think that it is okay; that if Congress can be that way to themselves, maybe we can act that way, too. They may not even realize that. It may be just a subconscious thing.  I ask how can we expect others to have a high opinion of us if we don't even show each other the respect that we should and that we deserve?  I believe that we must all remember that we are--before we are Republicans, before we are Democrats or Independents--all We are all here trying to do what is right, what is right for our country, certainly what is right for our constituents, and we shouldn't say that someone is not here for those purposes.  I don't know your district, Mr.Speaker, and I might say that you don't know mine. So let's argue, which is what we are here for. As ugly as sometimes it can be, that is our job, to debate on the merits of ideas. But it is not our job to win a debate by degrading the ones who are making the arguments against. I think we all have this obligation to win debates or to argue debates on the merits of the issue. Last Wednesday reminded me that it is up to us, if we want changes, to make them and to begin them here in this body.  I was heartened in our meeting as a Congress in the auditorium over at the Capitol Visitor Center that there were several Members asking for a change in tone--a change in tone in how we interact with each other. It is important that we act civilly, that we be polite, and that we be respectful--kind of like how we treat each other on the journey over here from our offices in the elevators and in the hallways.  I would assert that this is also something that is the responsibility of our President, our country's leader, someone who can set the tone for our country, someone who can describe our hopes and our dreams and help us aspire to reach those things. It is also the responsibility of our media and for those advocacy groups that we all have and that we all work with. It is up to our parties. I think it is up to every single  We need to rediscover the faith that we should have in each other, our respect for each other and those bonds that make us one nation under  Now, it is simple to state, but how do we accomplish this?  It can start right here on this floor. Say something positive. We all call each other lady and gentleman. We all start off that way, and then sometimes the gloves come off.  I can assert to you that not every idea that is presented here is all good or all bad.  What is the risk of acknowledging a good part of a larger idea even if you may disagree with that larger idea?  I believe we have some very articulate people in this body who can figure out quite easily how we can accomplish that.  We shouldn't impugn the motives of others. We don't assign blame. We don't get personal. In fact, if you look in the rules that were adopted by this Congress, in section 363 of Jefferson's Manual of Parliamentary Practice, it says: ``The consequences of a measure may be reprobated in strong terms; but to arraign the motives of those who propose to advocate it is a personality, and against order.''  So it says in no uncertain terms that we should not make this personal. We can object without being objectionable, and maybe--just maybe--others will see this and discover a tone that we need and a change in I believe that we can start this right here, today, with our very first debate right now.  Will we agree on everything?  Absolutely not. In fact, this is where our disagreements should show the most. We are duty-bound to shape legislation by pointing out weaknesses but also by accentuating strengths. Mr.Speaker, every debate, every speech on the floor or in committee, our interactions with the media, in townhalls, or press releases, we are being listened to and being watched. I hope that we can change our tone and begin to change the tone in the United States of  With that, Mr.Speaker, I would like to announce that, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 392, providing for consideration of two important bills: H.1873, which is the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act; and H.1654, the Water Supply Permitting Coordination  This combined rule provides for consideration of H.1873 under a structured rule, making three amendments in order, all of which were submitted by Democratic Members of our H.1654 will also be considered under a structured rule, with one Democratic and one Republican amendment made in order.  H.1873 will help ensure reliable electric service and reduced wildfire hazards, which can result from inadequate vegetation management near power line rights-of-way on Federally owned and operated lands.  Mr.Speaker, over the past several decades there have been numerous electricity outages as well as incidents of wildfires due to contact between power lines and trees on Federal lands.  In 1996, my home State of Washington was impacted when three power lines in the Pacific Northwest sagged onto overgrown trees, leading to a massive electricity blackout that impacted 7.5 million people across 14 Western States, two Canadian provinces, and even parts of Then, in August of 2003, an outage left 50 million electricity customers without power when a falling tree came into contact with transmission lines.  These are not isolated incidents. According to the U.Forest Service, in 2012 and 2013, contact between power lines and trees on Forest Service lands led to the outbreak of 113 and 232 wildfires, respectively. This legislation would reduce such wildfires in part by promoting Federal consistency, accountability, and timely decisionmaking to protect electricity transmission, grid reliability, and distribution lines on Federal lands from overgrown and under-maintained trees and vegetation.  H.1873 will cut red tape to create a streamlined and consistent process for removing hazardous trees and vegetation without wasting time and money before they cause a wildfire or an outage. Preventing forest fires and maintaining a reliable electrical grid for our communities is an obvious priority for all of us here in Congress, which is why I was pleased to see this bill pass through the House Natural Resources Committee with bipartisan support.  I have seen countless catastrophic wildfires devastate Western communities just in the past several years, which is why this issue must be addressed and resolved. However, due to existing regulations, it is extremely difficult for utility companies to remove hazardous vegetation or trees that have the potential of falling on these power lines.  The scope of this problem is evident when considering the U.Forest Service manages 155 national forests and 20 national grasslands--encompassing over 192 million acres--that include 2,700 authorized electric transmission and distribution facilities.                              {time}  1245  Similarly, the Bureau of Land Management administers 245 million acres, including over 71,000 miles of electrical transmission and distribution lines on its Federal lands.  In order to perform infrastructure inspections and operate and maintain power lines on these lands, electric utilities must seek permission and approval from the appropriate Federal land management agency, which typically use processes under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to assess whether the proposed vegetative management measures comply with Federal environmental laws.  This often leads to delays and cumbersome bureaucratic requirements, which often prevent utilities from carrying out important vegetative management activities on a consistent and[[Page H5007]]timely basis. Yet the costs of operating, maintaining, and repairing these electric lines on Federal lands fall to the utility companies and their customers, which can lead to higher electricity costs for ratepayers.  Mr.Speaker, the rule also provides for consideration of H.1654, the Water Supply Permitting Coordination This legislation will streamline the permitting process for new surface water storage projects, which is critically important for many Western and rural communities that have endured severe droughts in recent years.  Currently, the regulatory process for constructing new surface water storage projects often involves applying for a host of Federal, State, and local permits, as well as approvals from various agencies, which can be a very cumbersome, costly, and time-consuming undertaking.  Additionally, conflicting permit requirements and agency reviews can add time to the project, the planning, and implementation process while also increasing the potential for last-minute surprises that could endanger the success of a project or require significant additional work.  In order to address this problem, H.1654 creates what is seen as a one-stop-shop permitting process to expedite construction of both new and expanded non-Federal surface water storage projects. The measure establishes the Bureau of Reclamation as the lead agency for purposes of coordinating all reviews, analyses, permits, licenses, or other Federal approvals as required by law, which will streamline the current multiagency permitting process and eliminate unnecessary delays for job-creating construction projects that directly benefit local communities and economies.  As the lead agency, Reclamation will be required to coordinate and prepare the unified environmental documentation that will serve as the basis for Federal decisions authorizing the use of Federal lands, as well as to coordinate project development and the construction of qualifying projects.  Additionally, H.1654 will allow the Secretary of the Interior to expedite the evaluation of permits for qualifying projects through the use of funds contributed by a non-Federal public entity.  Mr.Speaker, the rule we consider here today provides for the consideration of two bills that will have positive and lasting impacts for the American people, ratepayers, rural communities, and many Western States, as well as our entire country's economy.  H.1654 will provide the type of coordination and streamlining that is essential to the development and construction of much-needed water storage projects, certainly benefiting my home State of Washington, as well as water-stricken communities across the country.  H.1873 will create a framework for vegetation management near transmission and distribution lines on Federal lands while also providing electric companies with much-needed clarity and defined authority to remove hazardous trees that pose a risk of falling into power lines. Managing this vegetation is a critical component in ensuring the safety and reliability of the electrical grid, which will benefit all of our constituents.  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this rule as well as the underlying legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

6511,topic-id,1329,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I appreciate the time of my colleagues, who have joined me on the floor today, to speak in support of these underlying bills, as well as for the hard work of the House Natural Resources  First of all, H.1873 is a bipartisan bill by any measure--five Democratic cosponsors, passed bipartisanly through the committee.  This will reduce the threat of electricity outages caused by contact between overgrown trees and power lines. It is that simple.  Existing Federal regulations and red tape can make it extremely difficult for utilities to gain the access that they need to their rights of way in order to perform needed maintenance. Before taking this action, they must receive approval from Federal agencies. They have been criticized for not allowing these utilities to carry out vegetative management policies on a consistent and timely basis.  Mr.Speaker, as you know, just one down tree on a transmission line can have devastating impacts, causing blackouts for thousands or millions of homes as well as businesses, or it can ignite fires that consume entire forests. Yet it can take months to remove one single tree, due to our outdated Federal regulations and cumbersome bureaucracy.  H.1654 streamlines the current multiagency permitting system, which creates significant delays for project construction and completion, by creating a one-stop shop, a permitting process at the Bureau of  Mr.Speaker, the Bureau was created to oversee water resource management in the West and to prevent water shortages by building dams and conveyance systems. Yet, over the past 40 years, Federal regulations and policies have slowly made it increasingly difficult to build dams and reservoirs throughout the Western United Presently, it is nearly impossible to even expand the storage capacity at existing facilities.  The Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act establishes a framework where the Federal agencies with jurisdiction over new surface water storage projects must work together, coordinate their schedules, share technical information and data, and publish their findings publicly. This important measure will allow water providers to better manage their systems to modernize and enhance their water storage infrastructure and optimize water resource management in preparation for future droughts and shortages, which we know will come.                              {time}  1330  The Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act will prevent wildfires and power outages while enabling utilities to safely supply electricity to rural and Western communities.  H.1873 will ensure that practical measures are taken to protect power lines and conserve our public lands, which is especially important in Western States where overgrown Federal forests are too often the norm rather than the exception.  Mr.Speaker, I believe the rule provides for consideration of two commonsense measures that will implement much needed improvements to the Federal management of our water resources, our Federal lands and forests, and electricity infrastructure. I urge my colleagues to support this rule as well as the underlying bills.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Polis is as follows:            An Amendment to 392 Offered by Mr.Polis       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       Sec 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     685) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage      domestic insourcing and discourage foreign outsourcing. The      first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points      of order against consideration of the bill are waived.      General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not      exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair      and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and      After general debate the bill shall be considered for      amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order      against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion      of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee      shall rise and report the bill to the House with such      amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question      shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments      thereto to final passage without intervening motion except      one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the      Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to      no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day      the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of      business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the      Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.       4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.685.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

6486,topic-id,2179,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  First, I want to rise in agreement with my friend from Washington's statement about civility in this Chamber and beyond. I think that, while it is extremely important that those of us who are elected to represent 700,000 to 800,000 people reflect the passions that we bring to our service, at the same time, we need to make sure that nothing that we say in these walls or outside is used to incite those who hear those words in a different way than they are intended.  That is the fine line that we walk as elected Representatives who are passionate about our ideals and our values, and it is one that I encourage the President to walk, as well as other opinion leaders who we often see on the cable talk shows hurling inciteful phrases back and forth that could be used to further incite the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the two underlying bills: H.1873, the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act; and H.1654, the Water Supply Permitting Coordination  Frankly, both of these bills are trying to address real problems that have bipartisan solutions that I support, but neither of these bills solve the problems in a thoughtful, effective way without creating collateral damage that, in many ways, is as damaging as the problem that they are designed to solve.  The majority will claim that similar bills received hearings last Congress, but I want to point out from a procedural perspective that neither of these bills have had hearings. These bills have not gone through the committee process. But what they won't say is there are dozens of new Members of New members of the Natural Resources Committee didn't have hearings at all, but it was rushed through a markup in committee and to the floor without any hearings in this session, without the new members of the National Resources Committee having a chance to ask questions about these bills.  There is a reason we have regular order. It is so that we elected Representatives can use the passion we bring to service to ask the difficult questions to find out how to get at these very real problems that we are trying to solve.  Unfortunately, this secrecy, lack of hearings, and lack of participation appears to be the norm, and, in fact, the standard that Republicans are setting in both Chambers of Congress right now. It is how the Republicans handled the healthcare bill in the It is how the Republicans are handling the secret healthcare bill behind a closed door somewhere over in the  We know some things about the Republican healthcare bill. We know it will increase healthcare costs, throw people off their insurance, reduce access for the American people. We know it will burden small businesses and the middle class. We know it will hand hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest But there is also a lot we don't know because the process has been closed. This type of secret backroom deal is, unfortunately, becoming the norm of the way Republicans are running their agenda in  The rule for this bill is another example. It blocked at least three amendments from being considered on the floor.  Why can't we discuss the ideas of all Members, especially since there was no hearing on this bill?  Representative McEachin from Virginia, Representative Schneider from Illinois, and Representative Torres from California all offered amendments, all had good ideas and were not even allowed to discuss those on the floor for 10 minutes, 5 minutes, not even for 1 minute, to offer or discuss any of those amendments.  If my colleagues on the Republican side don't think they are good ideas, let's at least have a vote. They can vote against them. If they defeat them, that is the process. But they are not even allowing a vote on these amendments.  Unfortunately, the process of this bill is typical of the Republican process on healthcare and the way they have approached so many other issues. Republicans are working in secret and limiting debates so the American people won't see the horrible things they are trying to do, like throwing tens of millions of Americans off of healthcare.  Now, getting to these bills.  First, the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act has the goal of preventing forest fires and disruptions to power distribution; something that I strongly agree with.  I represent a district that has over 60 percent public land and a number of rural power districts. It is an admirable goal. We are a district that is at risk for forest fires. We had several devastating fires in the last several years alone. In fact, I am representing a State that is getting even more ravaged by fire, in light of the changing climate.  We need to take action to prevent them and allow additional work with[[Page H5008]]regard to preventing the forest fire risk. Unfortunately, this bill is not a positive step, but I am glad to say there is an alternative out there.  Representative Cramer from North Dakota and I, along with five of my Colorado delegation colleagues, recently introduced bipartisan legislation that will decrease these types of fires and protect power lines and transformers the right way--a way that Democrats and Republicans can agree on; a way that we can probably run the bill as a suspension and get 410 votes; a way that the stakeholders are involved and utilities, fire prevention experts and firefighters, environmentalists all agree on.  My legislation, known as the National Forest System Vegetation Management Pilot Program Act of 2017, gives power and electricity companies the ability to remove dead trees, but without the recklessness included in the bill that we are considering today.  It is a stark contrast. We can actually solve this problem in a way that would bring the country together, or there can be a divisive bill--maybe against one Democrat, maybe against five; I don't know, but it is not a broadly bipartisan bill. It is not one that has the support of the communities that are most affected by forest fires in my district. It is not even a bill that has the support of our main utility company in Colorado that actually sought the ability to reduce forest fire risks, which is done by Representative Cramer's and my bill.  This bill we are considering today simply lacks the protections that we need to have confidence. In this bill, the company can come up with a plan to remove vegetation, and then it can be accepted with no questions asked. They can't require them to fix obvious problems, like the power company cutting down trees for no reason other than to sell it for timber. They can't even deny an application.  Frankly, I think this legislation's real goal is to take a small step toward turning management of public lands over to private industry.  Once this plan that they would submit under this bill is approved--because the plans have to be approved--the utility companies would be able to do massive devegetation and clearing work without any reason related to fires and without any risk of liability.  On the other hand, the bipartisan legislation I introduced with Mr.Cramer gives that liability waiver that the utility companies need to do the additional work, but only if there is no gross negligence by the utility company and has something to do with actually reducing the risk of fires, as well as putting reasonable limits on the distance that the work can be done from the power lines or transformers themselves.  Mr.Cramer's and my bill has some of the most conservative and some of the most liberal Members of this body as cosponsors. So I just wonder and I ask the majority leader why we aren't bringing that bill to the floor--a bill that lacks controversy, that helps prevent forest fires, that saves American people time and money, a bill that this body could be proud of advancing with, if not all, almost near unanimity.  I would suggest that, instead of bringing the bill we are considering today to the floor, we should have been focused on fixing something that we know needs to be fixed: the Forest Service's problem with fire borrowing.  Fire borrowing means the Forest Service has to spend all their money fighting fires and little money to reduce the risk of forest fires, deal with climate change, or clear the extensive backlog of maintenance. We can do that today by bringing to the floor the bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act that Representative Simpson and I introduced, along with my colleague, Mr. These are the types of commonsense measures that would actually reduce the risk of forest fires, put the right parameters around utility companies doing additional work, and free up additional resources to prevent forest fires from occurring, rather than simply doing the cleanup after they occur.  H.1654, the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act, also is an admirable and needed goal, one that there is potential for bipartisan cooperation to speed up the process of approval of water projects and hydro dams.  There truly is a problem with the speed of which some of these problems are approved. I represent a district and a State where we understand how difficult and important water is, and we also believe in the new renewable energy economy.  Unfortunately, this bill also does it the wrong way. It circumvents and undermines important input from experts and scientists that actually understand the reviews that are being made by the Clean Water It even circumvents tribal sovereignty in the Native American Tribes and their sacred lands by overriding their input.  That is why a wide spectrum of organizations are opposed, from conservation groups like Oceana and League of Conservation Voters to sportsmen's groups like Trout Unlimited and The Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Dozens are opposed to this reckless bill.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of opposition.                                                    July 20, 2017.                        Please Oppose H.1654       Dear Representative: On behalf of the undersigned      organizations, we write to urge you to oppose H.1654      (McClintock, R-CA), a bill that would significantly limit      meaningful public and environmental review of new dams and      other surface storage projects throughout the west. H.1654      would likely reduce protections for fish and wildlife, and      could lead to further damming and destruction of western      waterways. Similar provisions were included in H.2898 and      H.23--anti-environmental bills from 2015 and 2017,      respectively--and the Department of Interior has previously      expressed opposition to these efforts.       H.1654 would undermine existing laws by making the U.     Bureau of Reclamation (``Reclamation'') the lead agency for      all environmental reviews, including reviews under the      Endangered Species Giving Reclamation this unprecedented      power over project permitting could undermine the ability of      the U.Fish and Wildlife Service and N.O.A.Fisheries to      share expertise and inform the development of major      infrastructure investments, placing imperiled fish species at      risk. H.1654 also establishes strict project-review      timelines, including provisions that could require expedited      review under the National Environmental Policy These      fast-tracking provisions could make it difficult for      responsible agencies to meaningfully analyze proposed      projects, and could limit the public's ability to weigh in on      infrastructure that could affect communities for decades.      Further, the bill permits non-federal public entities to      contribute funds to expedite project permitting, raising      questions about the fairness of the federal review process.       This damaging bill would affect states throughout the west,      and could even impact how state agencies are able review      proposed projects within their jurisdictions. H.1654      allows states to subject state agencies to the bill's      procedures, thereby requiring those agencies to cede control      to Reclamation and comply with Reclamation's timelines.      Consolidating project review in this manner could weaken the      essential role that states play in reviewing water      infrastructure projects within their jurisdictions.       As we recently learned from the emergency at Oroville Dam      in California, careful planning and design for major      infrastructure projects is critical for ensuring public      safety and protecting the environment. Environmental review      of surface storage projects is also essential for protecting      endangered and commercially important salmon runs and the      thousands of jobs that depend on healthy salmon populations.      With so much at stake, the streamlining provisions in H.     1654 are unwise and irresponsible. Instead of fast tracking      dam projects in the West, we should be investing in fiscally      sound, environmentally friendly water supply solutions like      conservation, water use efficiency, wastewater recycling, and      stormwater capture.       For these reasons, we respectfully urge you to vote no on      H.1654.

6510,topic-id,665,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I agree with the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.Buck), my friend, that there is a problem here we are trying to solve. Unfortunately, these are not the bipartisan bills that Democrats and Republicans from both sides of the aisle have worked hard to put together to do.  Of course, Democrats, myself, and so many others want to expedite water projects permitting for hydro renewable energy projects. Of course, we want to free up utilities to do extra mitigation work around power lines to reduce the risk of fires. We have solid bipartisan bills that would do that. We could put them on the floor today or tomorrow, and they would have over 400 votes. There are liberal Democrats, conservative Republicans, and firefighters who support them. Utilities, Democrats, Republicans, and sportsmen support them.  That is a route we could go. We could get those bills to President Trump's desk by next week and actually start preventing forest fires and facilitate the permitting process around hydro projects. But, no, instead, we are doing a very divisive bill, one that has a lot of problems that it creates, in addition to solving some of the problems that it sets out to address.  I encourage my Republican friends--they are in charge; they control the agenda--to take a look at pragmatic, smart, and thoughtful ways to reduce forest fire risk, speed up water project approval, such as the bipartisan National Forest System Vegetation Management Pilot Program Act, which is a bipartisan bill.  Look, this bill around the expedited water projects would circumvent a lot of the public input process that is actually so important to the success of these projects. My colleague from Colorado was referring to several water projects. One that we both care deeply about, the Northern Integrated Supply Project, NISP, is currently with the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of  I strongly supported extending the public comment period from 30 to 60 days--a very reasonable time to allow people more input, which actually changed how the project was done and planned. It was a very meaningful form of input to build additional public support for the project; and, when the project is completed, will lead to a better, more meaningful project, serving the water needs of our communities, as well as the impact on the lives of those who live in and near it.  So, look, whether it is fixing fire borrowing, giving utilities a liability waiver while not giving them a free pass, making sure that our agencies doing water project reviews have the men and women power they need to actually get them done quickly, these are reasonable, good ideas that I think we could pass with unanimity, or near unanimity.  I promise the Republicans, if you would just work with us and have an open process, we could find common ground. Let's start with these small things. Let's start with preventing forest fires around electrical fires. We will get to healthcare. We can find common ground with you on that, too.  But let's start on finding common ground around reducing forest fire risk around electrical wires, Mr.There is a path to do that. Let's solve our small problems, and let's build a pathway to work together on the big problems our country faces.  I urge everyone to vote ``no'' on this restrictive rule, this rule that goes to the floor with no hearing, this rule[[Page H5012]]that rules out Democratic amendments, doesn't even allow discussion of them, and has a controversial piece of underlying legislation, when there is no need for controversy around such an important aspect of life in the American West, and, nationally, reducing forest fire risk and facilitating water projects and hydroelectric projects. Please join me in voting ``no,'' so we can get this House back to working on commonsense legislation that is bipartisan, with the full support of the American people.

Maybe particularly relevant to this job at Transportation, in 2003 he was unanimously confirmed by this body to serve as the Chief Legal Officer at the Department of There he supervised more than 400 lawyers at the Department of As the top lawyer there, he wasn't afraid to roll up his sleeves and get involved in lots of issues, including policy issues. I think the kind of experience he gained there will make him very well qualified to serve now as Deputy Secretary of that same agency.  He did such a good job that in 2006 I reached out to him and asked him to join my team at the Office of Management and I wanted somebody who was a good lawyer but also someone who could manage well and give me good advice, and Jeffrey Rosen was that person.

I have been a part of several congressional delegations to Afghanistan to survey conditions there, particularly as it concerns the progress being made by Afghan women and girls to attain equal rights. I was honored once again to lead a delegation of my colleagues to the region to conduct oversight of American operations and better inform our efforts here in Congress to fulfill[[Page H4320]]our constitutional responsibility to fund and support our military.  Mr.Speaker, it has been more than 15 years since American and allied forces invaded Afghanistan to topple the Taliban regime and stamp out the terrorist breeding ground it harbored. Many brave Americans have given their lives in the struggle to defeat the al-Qaida terrorist threat and protect our homeland. It is incumbent on us as a nation to honor their sacrifice by never allowing it to be in vain.  So much has been given and, because of that, so much has been gained.

New laws criminalize violence toward women and offer them unprecedented legal protections. Girls are attending school and going to college. Women are working in government, serving in the military, in the police force, and even running for office. There is an Afghan Women's Chamber of Commerce that specifically works to see that women are incorporated into the nation's economic future.  For American women like me who grew up with parents telling me I could achieve anything I wanted to, those kinds of things are commonplace. For Afghan women who grew up in a culture that has subjugated them to second-class citizenship or worse, these activities are nothing short of extraordinary. Centuries of repression are being reversed, and a new generation of women that expects and demands basic rights is taking hold.

6448,topic-id,1299,"Mr.President, first let me thank my friend and colleague from Iowa for letting me go forward. The two Charles in the Senate work together whenever we can.                          National Police Week  First, Mr.President, I want to thank our Capitol Police, the New York police, and police around the country for the outstanding work they do. Much like our troops overseas, our law enforcement officers risk their lives for our safety.  As we welcome many police officers to the Capitol this week, I would like to express, on behalf of the Senate, our gratitude for their service, their sacrifice, and their countless daily acts of courage. Particularly, I want to say that in New York City, where we are so proud that crime is the lowest of the 25 largest cities in the country, we thank our New York City Police Department for a job well done. I would also like to thank the many police departments, sheriffs' offices, and so many others of our law enforcement in the State of New I have gotten to know them, respect them, and admire them as human beings and for the job they do.                          Russia Investigation  Getting back to a less happy subject, Mr.President, the events of last week tested some of the fundamental precepts of our democratic system, including the rule of law and the independence of our law enforcement agencies that were designed to be a check on any abuse of power.  The President of the United States fired the FBI Director, who was conducting an active investigation of the President's campaign and its ties to The Attorney General, who had recused himself from that investigation, played a role in that dismissal and continues to be involved in the selection of the new FBI The White House gave pretextual reasons for the firing, which were contradicted by the President himself a few days later when he admitted that he had planned to fire Director Comey for weeks and that he was thinking about Russia when he did it. The President then suggested there were tapes of conversations between himself and Director Comey, threatening to release them if Mr.Comey spoke to the press.  These are not the actions of an administration that respects the rule of law or treasures fidelity to the truth. These are not the actions of an administration that is eager for and even open to an independent investigation into a very serious matter--the interference of our elections by a foreign adversary.  The Founding Fathers, in their infinite wisdom--the more I am around, the more I am impressed with them, and I was impressed to begin with--designed three coequal branches of government with appropriate powers to check and balance the others. The Founding Fathers explicitly worried about foreign powers trying to influence our elections and government. They actually wrote into the Constitution protections against that very threat. Their concerns, expressed over 240 years ago, gain new prominence and meaning today, perhaps more than at any time in the past.  We in Congress--both parties--need to exercise the powers afforded to us by the Constitution to check and balance. We need to see that we get all the facts. We need to see that the Russia investigation is allowed to proceed as independently and as impartially as possible. We need to hold this administration accountable for any abuse of their powers.  So first of all, if there are ``tapes'' as the President has suggested, he should turn them over immediately to Congress and the investigators. To destroy them would be a violation of law. If there are no tapes, he should apologize to James Comey and to the American people for misleading them.  Second, the fact that the President has said that he may have taped Mr.Comey makes the need for a special prosecutor all the more important. If it is true, if there are tapes, a special prosecutor would have the ability to[[Page S2925]]obtain these tapes undeterred, and then he would examine them to see what wrongdoing, if any, has occurred.  The reasons for a special prosecutor are compelling. A special prosecutor is not subject to day-to-day supervision by the Attorney General or anyone else at the Justice He or she would have greater latitude in whom they can subpoena, which questions to ask, and how to conduct the investigation. He or she would have purview to investigate, not only the subject but also anyone who attempts to interfere with the investigation. There is built-in congressional oversight, and Congress is notified whenever a special prosecutor is appointed, removed, or finished with the investigation. He or she can only be removed for cause, not to quash an investigation.  With the events of the past week--and given that we have different stories coming out of this administration from different people--the need to have someone who is independent and far away from any of the actors, to get to the bottom of this, is so important. Firing the FBI Director is extremely rare and deeply troubling. We need the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  Third, we in the Congress need to hear testimony from Director Comey, as well as be briefed by Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General I understand that Director Comey declined an invitation to testify tomorrow, but I have no reason to believe he won't be willing to come before the Senate in the future. I hope that he will sooner rather than later and that those appearances are in a public setting. This week, on Thursday, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein will brief the full Senate on the events of the last week. Again, I thank the majority leader for joining me in that request. Again, I hope we can make as much of that information public as possible. The American people deserve to know the truth just as much, if not more, than the Senate does.  My caucus still believes that Attorney General Sessions must be made available to the Senate in a similar capacity, given his reported role in firing Director Comey and in helping select his replacement. Considering his recusal from the Russia investigation, his close involvement in these events warrants the Senate's questioning as well. To repeat, we need the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. The Russian meddling is so serious, and it is no place for partisan fighting.  Frankly, we need our Republican colleagues to help to get to the bottom of what happened in the 2016 elections and to hold this or any administration accountable when they don't tell the truth. If only one party is doing the talking, the issue will seem too partisan to the American people. A subject as important as this one--the tampering of our elections by a foreign power, a matter the Founders fretted about at the dawning of the Republic--shouldn't be colored by partisan politics.  It is time to put country before party. We need our Republican friends to help us call upon the White House to get an independent investigation on We need them to speak out when the White House misleads the public. No less than the integrity of our system of government and the rule of law is at stake.                               TrumpCare  Mr.President, a word on healthcare. As the Senate Republican caucus debates what to do on healthcare, they should take a hard look at the consequences of the House Republican bill on individual Last week, Senate Democrats met with four Americans who shared their stories and explained how they would be hurt by Because of the furor over Director Comey's firing, their voices may have been drowned out.

6397,topic-id,1319,"Mr.President, I am deeply concerned by warnings from leading health insurance companies and State insurance commissioners that the Trump administration is now deliberately undermining the Affordable Care Act, leaving insurance plans no choice but to sharply raise premiums or exit the marketplaces.  I understand--I think we all do--that the Affordable Care Act continues to experience stresses and that it needs to be strengthened. There is no doubt about that. I have been saying from the beginning that we need to correct what is not working, that we need to keep what is working, and that we need to work together to change it. Yet, in 2016, there were abundant signs that the law was working and that insurance markets were stabilizing.  For instance, in my State of New Hampshire, health insurance premium increases last year averaged just 2 percent. That is the lowest annual increase in history. Today, it is a very different picture. Because of the efforts of the Trump administration to undermine the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies in New Hampshire and across the country face widespread uncertainty. Many of them are deciding that they have no choice but to protect themselves by drastically increasing premiums.  This week, there was a report in the New Hampshire Union Leader, which is our State's largest newspaper, that premiums in New Hampshire could increase by as much as 44 percent. Now, President Trump says that the Affordable Care Act is ``exploding,'' but let's be clear. If ObamaCare is exploding, as President Trump says, it is because this administration lit the fuse and has been working aggressively to undermine the law.  We can see on this poster what is being reported in other parts of the country. In the LA Times, we see that health insurers and State officials say that Trump is undermining ObamaCare and pushing up rates and that health insurers plan big ObamaCare rate hikes, and they blame  Perhaps the greatest damage has been done by the administration's refusal to commit to funding cost-sharing subsidies, which are the Federal subsidies that help millions of people pay for coverage. To protect themselves, many insurance companies are preparing two sets of premiums for next year--one premium level if the administration agrees to fund the cost-sharing subsidies and a second, dramatically higher premium level if the administration says no to cost-sharing subsidies.  More broadly, the administration's mixed signals and erratic management of the Affordable Care Act are causing uncertainty in the marketplace. Paul Markovich, the CEO of Blue Shield of[[Page S3125]]California, has said that health plans are being forced to raise premiums to compensate for all of the turmoil.  It gets worse.  Last week, the Los Angeles Times reported that Seema Verma, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, shocked a meeting of insurance industry executives by threatening to cut off funding for cost-sharing reductions unless insurers agreed to support the House Republicans' bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act--the bill that was passed several weeks ago.  Washington State Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler criticized the administration's actions as playing Russian roulette with Americans' health insurance coverage. He said: ``This has real impact on people's lives.''  One insurance company executive said this about the administration's actions: ``There's a sense that there are no hands on the wheel, and they are just letting the bus careen down the road.''  Physicians and other healthcare professionals live by a time-honored pledge to do no harm, but the Trump administration is pursuing a course that will do tremendous harm to millions of Americans who have gained health coverage for the first time because of the Affordable Care Unless and until Congress repeals the Affordable Care Act, it is the law of the land, and this administration has a responsibility to administer this law with fairness, with rigor, and with competence. The administration certainly does not have the right to take active steps to undermine or even sabotage the law or to threaten insurance companies with such steps if they do not support the repeal of  It is time for the administration to reconsider its approach to healthcare reform. To date, regrettably, the administration's approach has been highly partisan, with no outreach to Instead of a ``do no harm'' approach, instead of taking steps to fill President Trump's pledge that we are going to have insurance for everybody--and he came through New Hampshire on multiple occasions during his primary campaign and during the general election campaign. What he said about health insurance was that we were going to make sure that everybody has it; we are going to make sure that they pay less and that they get quality coverage. The administration now seems determined to take health coverage away from tens of millions of  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the House Republicans' bill--the first one--to repeal the Affordable Care Act would take coverage away from 24 million Yesterday, the administration proposed a budget that would cut Medicaid by as much as $1.3 trillion over the next decade. That would end coverage for millions of low-income Americans, people with disabilities, and so many of our elderly in nursing homes. In New Hampshire, where we are really on the frontlines of the heroin and opioid epidemic, it would end treatment for many people who are getting treatment for their substance use disorders because of the expansion of  When we think about the people who would be hurt by this, it is unconscionable to hear Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney say: ``There is a certain philosophy wrapped up in the budget, and that is that we are no longer going to measure compassion by the number of programs or the number of people on those programs.'' I disagree with that view. By deliberately taking healthcare coverage from 24 million Americans, it shows the lack of compassion of this administration.  This is not about numbers. He is right about that. This should not be about numbers. This should be about people, about their families, and about what these proposals will do to everyday Americans who will no longer have access to affordable health coverage. Whether they have preexisting conditions or whether they need to get treatment for cancer, for substance use disorders, or for whatever their healthcare needs are, under this proposal, they are not going to be able to afford it. Millions of Americans will not be able to afford it.  I think there is a better way forward. Instead of tearing down the Affordable Care Act and taking health coverage away from people, we should be building on the gains and on the achievements of healthcare reform.  On that score, I want to share an extraordinary letter to the editor that was written by Carol Gulla, of Newmarket,  I am reading her letter:       I was in good health; why bother with a physical?       That was my mentality for years before the Affordable Care      Act (aka Obamacare). I work for a small nonprofit business,      so we don't qualify for group health insurance plans. An      annual physical wasn't included in the high premium, high      deductible plans that were available to me on the individual      health insurance market so they were often a luxury. But it      was OK; I felt great! Why bother with doctors?       Because of the Affordable Care Act, last June I went for a      routine physical. During [the exam] a lump was discovered in      my breast. Ten days later, breast cancer was diagnosed. . . .      Fast forward to today. I've just completed my final      chemotherapy treatment and my prognosis is very positive.      That physical saved my life.       Let me restate that--Obamacare saved my life.       That crucial physical in June would not have happened had      it not been an essential preventive service included in all      health plans under the While not perfect, my insurance      through the ACA is far better than anything available to me      as an individual in the past.

We lose more people in New Hampshire to deaths from overdoses of opioids and fentanyl and heroin than we do to car accidents. And an overwhelming percentage of people--over 90 percent--are getting treatment for their substance abuse disorders through the expansion of Medicaid, which has been a bipartisan program in New Hampshire that has covered about 60,000 people, many of whom are getting treatment for substance abuse disorders.  So what the Senator from Illinois is telling me, from the CBO, is that based on the plan that passed the House that Republicans have supported, those people who are getting their treatment--lifesaving treatment for mental health issues and substance abuse disorders--they are going to be kicked off of their plan, and they are not going to have any other option for getting that care.

Cystinuria is an inherited disease characterized by high concentrations of the amino acid cysteine in the urine, leading to the formation of cysteine stones in the kidneys and urinary tract. It is a rare disease that affects roughly 1 in every 7,000 people, including an estimated 130 Granite Cystinuria is a painful and often debilitating condition. Those who suffer from it can experience kidney stones as frequently as daily, causing many to lose weeks of work each year. Many sufferers use prescription painkillers to cope with the disease, and tragically, some develop substance use disorders.  Cystinuria does not discriminate, affecting people of all genders, races, ethnicities, and ages. There is not yet a cure, and the disease is frequently misdiagnosed. I sincerely hope that this day of awareness will help in advancing research into the causes of the disease as well as possible therapies and cures. Because cystinuria is a rare disease, there is an acute need for more aggressive research, including at the National Institutes of In addition to supporting important funding for research, we can also do our part by also advocating for awareness for the disease. Fortunately, the Affordable Care Act protects those with cystinuria and other preexisting conditions from discrimination by health insurance companies.  Cystinuria Awareness Day is a valuable opportunity for Americans to learn about this condition and offer support to those living with it.

6457,topic-id,1344,"Mr.President, I rise to honor and recognize the folks who are first to respond when crisis strikes--the folks who patrol our streets, keep our families safe, and are willing to enter harm's way on a daily basis.  I rise today to honor our police officers in Montana and every corner of the country. Police officers answer a call to duty to protect and defend our communities. While this Nation's police forces are on patrol, it is critical that the folks in this body are doing everything we can to keep them safe on the job and to honor their service.  To recognize National Police Week, I have partnered with Senators Boozman, Gardner, Moran, Udall, Blumenthal, and Carper to introduce the bipartisan Honoring Hometown Heroes Our bill will provide the Governor of each State the ability to fly the American flag at half-staff to honor a police officer or any first responder who dies in the line of duty. This bill will treat our fallen responders with the respect they deserve.  In the past, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to strengthen resources for local police officers, and we have ensured that our first responders have access to critical healthcare services, but this bill is a bit different. This bill makes sure that our police officers and their families receive the recognition they deserve for their selfless service to their communities. When tragedy strikes, I think it is important the entire State takes a moment to honor that police officer who was lost while serving others.  This bipartisan bill has the support of police officers and first responders from across the country--from the Fraternal Order of Police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the International Association of Firefighters, just to name a few.  The Honoring Hometown Heroes Act will give our fallen first responders the honor they so much deserve, but for the police officers we have already lost, it is too late. Today is Peace Officers Memorial Across the country, the names of fallen officers will be carved into granite, and their photos will be hung in stations for all to see.

He is currently a partner at the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, where he has worked on a range of regulatory and litigation matters for more than 30 years. Prior to starting his career at the firm, he obtained his bachelor's degree in economics at Northwestern University and his law degree from Harvard Law  Mr.Rosen's private sector experience has been punctuated by significant leadership positions in the public sector. Mr.Rosen served as the General Counsel of the Department of Transportation from 2003 to 2006 after winning Senate confirmation by a voice vote. He also served as the General Counsel and Senior Policy Adviser at the White House Office of Management and Budget from 2006 to 2009. Mr.Rosen's prior experience in government is a testament to his ability to lead, manage, and effectively operate within the Federal  If confirmed as Deputy Secretary of Transportation, Mr.Rosen will be responsible for overseeing the daily operations of the He will also oversee the DOT's 10 modal administrations and approximately 55,000 employees and will exercise stewardship for the Department's budget and its efforts to provide funding for State and local transportation projects.  Mr.Rosen's fundamental responsibility will be to ensure that the DOT's crucial mission--the safe and efficient movement of goods and people across our Nation and the world--is achieved while fostering innovation and maintaining the reliability of our infrastructure.  As I mentioned, Mr.Rosen brings valuable experience to this position. As the DOT's General Counsel during the George Bush administration, Mr.Rosen had responsibility for the DOT's regulatory programs, enforcement, litigation activities, legal issues relating to international transportation activities, and legislative proposals. He acted as counsel to Secretary Norman Later, as General Counsel and Senior Policy Adviser at the OMB, Mr.Rosen served as the Bush administration's top lawyer for regulations, fiscal issues, and executive orders.  Of note, during the past 2 years, Mr.Rosen has served as chair of the American Bar Association's Section of Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice, where he has been praised for revitalizing the section with more debate and programs while seeking consensus on recommended changes to the Administrative Procedure His thoughtful leadership will be valuable as the Department of Transportation looks toward a pro-growth agenda in the transportation sector.  On March 29, 2017, I held a hearing in the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee to consider his nomination. I was impressed, as were my colleagues on the committee, with Mr.Rosen's credentials, experience, and depth of knowledge on transportation policy.  On April 5, 2017, the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee acted by a rollcall vote to favorably report his nomination to the floor. While it is my hope that the Senate will confirm this exceptionally well-qualified nominee today, it is my understanding that some of my Democrat colleagues will oppose him. It is my understanding that their decision is, in large part, because Mr.Rosen refused to publicly oppose President Trump's proposed budget at his confirmation hearing last month. I think this is an unfair basis for opposing such a well-qualified nominee.  I believe Mr.Rosen's extensive and distinguished career in transportation policy and prior public service will be an asset in addressing the infrastructure challenges our Nation faces.  I look forward to confirming Mr.Rosen's nomination, and I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

6415,topic-id,934,"Mr.President, I rise to oppose the nomination of Judge Amul Thapar to serve as a judge on the Sixth Circuit Court of  It should surprise absolutely no one that Judge Thapar is the second nominee to a Federal court to come up for a vote in this His nomination comes on the heels of the nomination of now-Justice Neil Gorsuch, an ultraconservative who could not earn enough support to be confirmed under Senate's normal rules, a judge so radical, so controversial that Senate Republicans had to change the Senate rules and lower the vote threshold to force his nomination through the  Now the Senate is poised to vote on a judge cut from the same cloth. Like Justice Gorsuch, Judge Thapar made the list of 21 acceptable judges that far-right groups drew up and handed to President Trump--judges who would tilt the scales of justice in favor of the rich and the powerful. As in Justice Gorsuch's case, those radical groups are committed to doing whatever it takes to make sure Judge Thapar sits on the Nation's highest courts.  For those groups, the goal is not just to get a few ultraconservative judges on our Federal courts; it is to capture the entire judicial branch. For years, billionaire-funded, rightwing groups have worked hand in hand with Republicans to ensure that our courts advance the interests of the wealthy and powerful over the rights of everyone else. They abused the filibuster to stop fair, mainstream judges from filling vacancies on Federal courts, they slowed the judicial nominations process to a crawl, and they threw the Constitution and Senate precedent out the window by refusing to consider President Obama's Supreme Court nominee. Under their watch, judicial vacancies stacked up and courts became overloaded with cases. Now Republicans and their extremist friends have a President who shares their concern about the interests of the 1 percent, and they are ready to stack our Federal courts with judges who will advance their radical agenda. Judge Thapar is much more than up to the task.  There are many reasons to oppose Judge Thapar's nomination to the Sixth Circuit, from his decisions making it harder for working Americans to get access to the judicial system to his support for sentencing policies that don't make us safer but that exacerbate the problem of mass incarceration. There is a lot to object to, but I want to highlight one area that should concern every person who thinks government should work for all of us; that is, Judge Thapar's stance on money in politics.  For decades, our laws restricted the amount of money that individuals and corporations could pour into the political process. In recent years, Federal courts chipped away at those laws, and then Supreme Court decisions in cases like McCutcheon and Citizens United took a sledgehammer to campaign finance laws, unleashing a flood of dark money into the political system.  There are now dozens of perfectly legal ways for the 1 percent to buy influence and favor: corporate campaign contributions and super pacs, the revolving door between government and the private sector, bought-and-paid-for experts to push alternative facts, armies of lobbyists swarming the Halls of Their investments have paid off in the form of special breaks, exemptions, deals, riders, subsidies, loopholes, and every other handout industry can imagine. That money--that unaccountable, dark, unlimited money--has fundamentally distorted our democracy.  Judge Thapar would make the problem worse. Judge Thapar believes that actual speech and monetary contributions are basically the same thing. When he had to decide on the constitutionality of a Kentucky rule preventing State judges and judicial candidates from donating to political groups or campaigns, he concluded that the rule was unconstitutional. In his decision, Judge Thapar said: ``There is simply no difference between `saying' that one supports an organization by using words and `saying' that one supports an organization by donating money.'' No difference between talking about a candidate and dumping a bucket of money into the candidate's campaign.  In Judge Thapar's view, the Constitution should protect a billionaire's right to dump unlimited sums of money into the political process to influence the outcome of elections. That is even further than the Supreme Court has gone. As the Sixth Circuit reminded Judge Thapar when it reversed his decision on donations, even the Supreme Court has refused to treat monetary donations as equivalent to direct speech.  The issue of concentrated money in our political system is one that doesn't split down party lines. Americans of all political views cringe at the massive amounts of secret money that slither through our political process. They have seen politicians beholden to the handful of deep-pocketed individuals and giant corporations, and they have seen those politicians turn their backs on the constituents they were elected to represent. That is at the heart of what is wrong in our Our government should work for everyone, not just for the millionaires and billionaires.[[Page S3129]]  Fighting for a government that is accountable to the people means fighting to reduce the influence of concentrated money and concentrated power in our political system. It is time to take down the sign that says ``government for sale'' that hangs above Washington, DC, and we can start today by rejecting Judge Thapar's nomination to serve on the Sixth Circuit Court of  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

6582,topic-id,555,"Mr.Speaker, many Americans, when faced with that split-second decision to act in a crisis with selfless valor, or to flee, answer the call of duty in service to their fellow man.  In June 2016, NYPD Officers Peter Cybulski and Hameed Armani, both of whom I had the privilege to meet last month, were on patrol in Times Square when a suspected bomb was thrown into their vehicle. Rather than vacating their vehicle in place, these officers selflessly drove their car one-and-a-half blocks away from the public in a crowded Times  In that moment, when others might have simply fled the scene to save their own lives, Officers Cybulski and Armani were prepared to sacrifice everything to save the people they were sworn to protect. This selfless act of bravery is just one of so many acts of heroism by our police officers every single day.  This week is National Police Week, where we honor our members of law enforcement and remember the sacrifices of those who have lost their lives in the line of duty. The brave men and women protecting our communities deserve recognition for their selfless acts of courage and commitment to serving our  This special week began in 1962, when President John Kennedy signed a proclamation which designated May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Every year, the week on which that date falls is designated as National Police Since then, thousands of our officers and their families from all across our great Nation come to Washington, D.C., during this week to be recognized for their selfless duty and to honor those who have fallen in service to their community.  I have always believed that our Nation has a perennial obligation to provide our police officers with every ounce of support that we have to offer. These heroes deserve to know that the people of this Nation, for whom they have given so much, are forever grateful. It really is the least that we can do for these brave men and women.  As a Member of Congress, I have committed myself to ensuring law enforcement is given all of the support necessary, and more, to carry out their selfless mission. Last year, around this time, we passed five key pieces of legislation which both honor our police and ensure those still serving possess the tools and equipment needed to carry out this responsibility.  Some of these bills included the Fallen Heroes Flag Act of 2016, the Federal Law Enforcement Self-Defense and Protection Act, and the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program and Reauthorization And again this year, this week, we are doing the same: passing legislation to protect our law enforcement who sacrifice so much to protect us.  In recent years, our Nation has become fractured, and our police have been subject to acts of violence and hatred. It is more important now than ever before that law enforcement receives our unwavering appreciation, support, and respect. Courage, leadership, and a commitment to service, these are the qualities embedded within our members of law enforcement, the traits by which they uphold deeply with dignity and honor.  This week, and every week, it is so important to honor those who have put themselves into harm's way to protect us, our families, and our communities. Their sacrifices will, and should, be revered for generations to come.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgH4232-2.txt,2261,HONORING PETER CYBULSKI AND HAMEED ARMANI,2017.0,17.0,June
