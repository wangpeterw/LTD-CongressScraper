    SENATE REPUBLICANS ARE CRAFTING THEIR HEALTHCARE BILL IN SECRET

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, Senate Republicans are continuing to craft 
their healthcare bill, TrumpCare, in complete secrecy, behind closed 
doors, no hearings, no bill text, no transparency whatsoever, and they 
expect to bring this bill to the floor next week.
  The bill is secret, but it is pretty clear why they are keeping this 
legislation secret: because it is a lousy piece of legislation and the 
American people reject it because it takes away healthcare from 23 
million Americans. For those who are fortunate enough to have 
healthcare, they will pay more for worse care. You will pay an age tax 
if you are an older American just to have access to healthcare.
  Even President Donald Trump says this healthcare bill is mean. And 
let's just face the obvious. If Donald Trump says something is mean, 
you have got a real problem.
  This legislation should go through the process of open debate and 
dialogue, not be crafted in secret because it is such a bad piece of 
legislation that the people offering it are embarrassed for the folks 
in America to know what it says. We have to shut this down.
