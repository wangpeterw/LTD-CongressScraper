                          NATIONAL FARMERS DAY

  (Ms. STEFANIK asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, when you eat today, you can thank a 
farmer.
  Across this great Nation, over 3 million farmers work tirelessly each 
day to produce the food that feeds our families and keeps our country 
running.
  From Grace-Way Dairy Farm in Lowville to Everett Orchards in Peru, I 
have been blessed to meet with so many farmers that make up the 
backbone of our north country economy. Many of these family farms in my 
district produce dairy, apples, honey, wine, and the most delicious 
maple in the country.
  As Congress works on the next farm bill, we need to focus on 
supporting those who support our Nation's food supply.

  Mr. Speaker, today, on National Farmers Day, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in thanking the men and women who rise before the sun each and 
every day to make sure our families are fed.
