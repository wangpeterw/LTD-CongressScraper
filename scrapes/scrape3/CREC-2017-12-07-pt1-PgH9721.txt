                       MEDICARE AND MEDICAID CUTS

  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, Leo Rosten, the author of ``Joys of 
Yiddish,'' defines chutzpah as ``that quality enshrined in a man who, 
having killed his mother and father, throws himself on the mercy of the 
court because he is an orphan.''
  Here is a new definition. Yesterday, Speaker Ryan reconfirmed that, 
after pushing through a tax scam that adds $1.5 trillion to the deficit 
by giving tax cuts to the richest, Republicans will insist on slashing 
Medicare and Medicaid to reduce the deficit. He said: ``We're going to 
have to get back next year at entitlement reform, which is how you 
tackle the debt and the deficit.''
  This is not just chutzpah. It is actual cruelty and callousness.
  So I ask my Republican colleagues: Did you really come to Congress to 
take healthcare and long-term care from children, pregnant women, 
people with disabilities, families, and seniors?
  Who are you?
