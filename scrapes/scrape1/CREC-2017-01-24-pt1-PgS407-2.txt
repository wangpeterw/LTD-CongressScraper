                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Beautiful Savior, You have been our dwelling place in all 
generations, sustaining us with Your steadfast love.
  Today, surround our Senators with the shield of Your divine favor, 
enabling them to obey Your command to be fruitful and productive. Teach 
them to obey Your precepts, doing Your good will, as they find joy in 
Your presence. Lord, keep them from doing those things that could bring 
them regret, remorse, and shame. Renew their strength as You give them 
the courage to carry on in these challenging days. Guard them from 
error, save them from false judgments, and deliver them from evil.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
