the Department of Defense, other appropriate elements of the Federal 
Government, and foreign governments to resolutely continue efforts to 
investigate, recover, and identify all United States personnel 
designated as unaccounted-for from past wars and conflicts around the 
world.''.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
