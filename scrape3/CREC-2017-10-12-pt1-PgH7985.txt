               THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL WAS A GIANT MISTAKE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. Messer) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge President Trump to 
decertify the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. There are reports that 
decertification may come as early as tomorrow, and I certainly hope so.
  The Iran nuclear deal was a giant mistake. It has been bad for 
America's national security, bad for our ally Israel's national 
security, and bad for the world.
  By decertifying the flawed Iran nuclear deal before October 15, the 
administration has a chance to send a strong message that the United 
States will not sit idly by while the Iranian threat continues to grow.
  The deal was premised on a naive notion that Iran would somehow 
evolve into a peaceful global partner, but that couldn't have been 
further from the truth. Make no mistake about it: Iran is not our 
friend, does not share our values, and should not have been trusted.
  For decades, Iran has called the United States the Great Satan, and 
their leadership continues to call for the total annihilation of our 
ally Israel. Iran remains the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the 
world and is actively working towards obtaining a nuclear bomb.
  This much is clear: Iran has not upheld the spirit of this deal. Now 
is the time to reassert our authority on the world stage and hold Iran 
accountable.
  I look forward to working with President Trump to keep America, our 
allies, and the rest of the world safe from Iranian aggression.
