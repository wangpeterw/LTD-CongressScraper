                 RECOGNIZING DIWALI AND HINDU NEW YEAR

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Diwali, known 
as the Festival of Lights, and to recognize the Hindu New Year.
  The Hindu community comes together wearing their finest clothing to 
celebrate this occasion. Families prepare for Goddess Lakshmi's arrival 
weeks in advance by decorating their porches with colorful designs, or 
rangoli; preparing sweets and savories; and lighting divos. On the 
night before Diwali, they light divos, symbolically asking Bhagwan to 
expel their ignorance and enlighten their souls. Lights, candles, and 
fireworks are an integral part of the festivities.
  I was honored to be able to attend multiple celebrations at the BAPS 
mandirs in my district in Levittown, Warrington, and Souderton. As I 
traveled from celebration to celebration, I got to share in the 
absolute joy of my constituents as they celebrated with friends and 
with family. I was moved to be asked to participate in the lighting 
ceremonies, and I was in awe of the beauty of the festivals.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent a district that is so diverse 
and so rich in its culture.
