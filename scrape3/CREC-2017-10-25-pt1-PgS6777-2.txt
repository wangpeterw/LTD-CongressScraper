                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, the foundation of true wisdom, You extend Your powerful 
dominion over the universe. Stand by our lawmakers, and protect them 
with Your might. Lord, refresh them with Your wisdom as You prepare 
them not only for time but eternity. Lord, we praise You for ethically 
congruent lawmakers, who, in their inmost beings, are true and honest. 
Give us more Senators who are as true to duty as the needle to the 
pole. Give us more legislators who are not afraid to call sin by its 
right name. Lord, provide us with more patriots who will stand for 
right regardless of the consequences.
  We pray in Your sovereign Name. Amen.
