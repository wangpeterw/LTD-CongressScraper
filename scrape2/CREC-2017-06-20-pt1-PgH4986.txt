                          SUPPORT OUR REFUGEES

  (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the United States has been a 
leader welcoming refugees for decades. Refugees seek our shores to 
escape war, political and religious persecution, and sometimes fear of 
imminent death. People flee danger seeking refuge and safety. As 
Americans, we should be the last to perpetuate an environment that 
causes refugees to live in a state of fear and terror right here in 
America.
  I represent the residents of Clarkston, Georgia. As a refugee 
resettlement hub, Clarkston is often referred to as the most diverse 
square mile in America. Clarkston's refugees have established 
themselves as taxpayers; they have started thriving businesses; and 91 
percent obtain jobs and become completely self-sufficient within 6 
months of arriving in the U.S.
  The great diversity and cultural richness that they bring to our 
communities has made the Fourth District a better place to live, work, 
and play. Today we show our support for refugees. Today we should all 
stand to send a message that we will continue our work to support 
refugees as they continue to boost local economies and contribute to 
our communities with their unique and enriching cultures.
