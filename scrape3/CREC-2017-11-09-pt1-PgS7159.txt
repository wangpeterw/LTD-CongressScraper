 SENATE RESOLUTION 327--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF NOVEMBER 5 THROUGH 12, 
     2017, AS ``NATIONAL CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING AWARENESS WEEK''

  Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself and Mr. Hoeven) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:

                              S. Res. 327

       Whereas carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that 
     is produced whenever any fuel, such as natural gas, propane, 
     gasoline, oil, kerosene, wood, or charcoal, is burned;
       Whereas devices that produce carbon monoxide include cars, 
     boats, portable power generators, gasoline engines, stoves, 
     and heating systems, and carbon monoxide produced from these 
     sources can build up in enclosed or semi-enclosed spaces;
       Whereas carbon monoxide is often referred to as the 
     ``silent killer'' because it is colorless, odorless, 
     tasteless, and non-irritating, and ignoring early stages of 
     carbon monoxide poisoning may cause unconsciousness and 
     continual exposure to danger;
       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
     Prevention, each year in the United States, carbon monoxide 
     poisoning kills more than 150 individuals and sends 
     approximately 20,000 individuals to emergency rooms;
       Whereas when people breathe in carbon monoxide, the 
     poisonous gas enters the bloodstream and prevents adequate 
     intake of oxygen, which can damage tissues and result in 
     death;
       Whereas, given their common preexisting medical conditions, 
     individuals older than age 65 are particularly vulnerable to 
     carbon monoxide poisoning;
       Whereas for most individuals who suffer from carbon 
     monoxide poisoning, the early signs of exposure to low 
     concentrations of carbon monoxide include mild headaches and 
     breathlessness upon moderate exercise;
       Whereas sustained or increased exposure to carbon monoxide 
     can lead to flu-like symptoms, including severe headaches, 
     dizziness, tiredness, nausea, confusion, irritability, and 
     impaired judgment, memory, and coordination;
       Whereas breathing in low concentrations of carbon monoxide 
     can cause long-term health damage, even after exposure to the 
     gas ends;
       Whereas most cases of carbon monoxide exposure occur during 
     the colder months of December, January, and February, when 
     oil and gas heaters are more heavily in use;
       Whereas on January 5, 1996, the Burt family of Kimball, 
     Minnesota, was poisoned by carbon monoxide from a 
     malfunctioning furnace in the home of the Burt family, 
     resulting in the deaths of 15-month-old Zachary Todd Burt and 
     4-year-old Nicholas Todd Burt;
       Whereas according to the North Dakota Department of Health, 
     among residents over the age of 65, carbon monoxide poisoning 
     was the leading substance-related cause of death in North 
     Dakota from 2009 to 2014;
       Whereas the North Dakota Department of Health found that, 
     in 2010, carbon monoxide poisoning was the second-leading 
     cause of unintentional poisoning death among adults ages 30 
     through 49;
       Whereas on June 7, 2015, 3 adults and 1 child in Blanchard, 
     North Dakota, tragically passed away from carbon monoxide 
     poisoning as the result of a carbon monoxide leak caused by 
     an improperly vented water heater; and
       Whereas increasing awareness about the dangers of carbon 
     monoxide can help prevent poisoning and save lives: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate designates the week of November 5 
     through 12, 2017, as ``National Carbon Monoxide Poisoning 
     Awareness Week''.
