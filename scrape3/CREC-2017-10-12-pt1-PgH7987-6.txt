                   HONORING THE LIFE OF HANNAH AHLERS

  (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, on October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on 
thousands of innocent people at a music festival in Las Vegas.
  As our families mourn, I want to honor the life of Hannah Ahlers, a 
wife, mother, daughter, sister, friend to many, and beloved by her 
community, whose life was taken too soon. Her brother recently told me: 
``She was loved by everyone that met her . . . she was our sunshine.''
  Her beautiful personality was felt by all, from her family and 
friends, to the mothers she worked with in her children's schools, to 
the volleyball team she volunteered with. As her husband shared: ``She 
wasn't too good for anybody; beautiful inside and out.''
  At 34, her dedication to family and community is felt in her home in 
the city of Beaumont and across the Inland Empire.
  On behalf of my wife, Monica, and the entire 36th Congressional 
District, we join together as a community to mourn her heartbreaking 
loss and celebrate her life.
  To Hannah's husband, Brian; her children, Briannah, Brice, and 
Hailey, our thoughts and prayers are with you. We commit to take up 
Hannah's mantle of dedication by serving our own communities. Her love 
and devotion will never be forgotten.
