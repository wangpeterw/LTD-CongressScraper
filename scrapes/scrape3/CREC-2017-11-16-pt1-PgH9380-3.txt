                    AMERICANS DESERVE A BETTER DEAL

  (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, the American people do not 
support the GOP tax plan being considered today.
  After promising a simple and fair tax system, Republicans offer a 
complicated mess. Their tax plan picks winners: the rich, and big 
corporations, getting nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts. They create 
losers, like teachers, seniors, students, people with disabilities, and 
working families who will pay more.
  This GOP tax scam also targets our Nation's veterans. More than 
300,000 veterans have benefited from the work opportunity tax credit, 
most of whom served after 9/11. Yet this bill eliminates the tax credit 
and abandons our servicemembers when they return home and transition to 
civilian life.
  Today, one of every three veterans is underemployed, and 1.8 million 
veterans are stuck in low-wage jobs. Every single veteran should be 
able to get a family-supporting job at home after serving our Nation. 
This tax bill asks our veterans and their families to again sacrifice, 
this time so billionaires and big corporations get a huge tax cut.
  Mr. Speaker, veterans deserve a better deal and so do American 
working families.
