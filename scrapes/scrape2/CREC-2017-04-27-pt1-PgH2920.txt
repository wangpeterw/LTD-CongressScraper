          REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 2015

  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Representative 
Joe Wilson be removed as the cosponsor of H.R. 2015. He was incorrectly 
listed when it should have been Representative Frederica Wilson.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Collins of New York). Is there objection 
to the request of the gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
