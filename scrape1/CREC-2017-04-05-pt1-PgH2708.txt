                SPEAK UP AND SPEAK OUT TO CHANGE POLICY

  (Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on February 1, I introduced 
legislation to prohibit individuals whose primary role is political, 
like Steve Bannon, from serving on the National Security Council or its 
main subgroup, the Principals Committee. The bill has obtained 183 
cosponsors and received significant public support. The majority of the 
American people clearly believe that our national security policymaking 
process should not be contaminated by partisan politics.
  Today, the Trump administration responded to this message, removing 
Mr. Bannon from the NSC and the Principals Committee. I am incredibly 
proud of this development, which is clearly in the interest of our 
Nation's security.
  Today is a victory for democracy because it proves that the people, 
when they speak up and speak out, can change policy for the better.
