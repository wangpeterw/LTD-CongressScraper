       In implementing this agreement, the Departments and 
     agencies should be guided by the language and instructions 
     set forth in House Report 115-244 and Senate Report 115-150. 
     In either such report, any reference to the fiscal year 2019 
     budget request or congressional justification shall be 
     applied to the fiscal year 2020 Justification of Estimates 
     for the Committees on Appropriations.
       Where the explanatory statement speaks to an issue that was 
     addressed in the House or Senate reports, the explanatory 
     statement should supersede the language in the House or 
     Senate reports. In cases where the House Report and the 
     Senate Report address a particular issue not specifically 
     cited in the explanatory statement, the House Report and the 
     Senate Report should be complied with and carry the same 
     emphasis as the language included in the explanatory 
     statement. In providing the operating plan required by 
     section 516 of this Act, the Departments and agencies funded 
     in this Act are directed to include all programs, projects, 
     and activities, including those in House Report 115-244, 
     Senate Report 115-150, and this explanatory statement. All 
     such programs, projects, and activities are subject to the 
     provisions of this Act.
       Each department and agency funded in this Act shall follow

     activities except as provided herein. Funds for individual 
     programs and activities are displayed in the detailed table 
     at the end of the explanatory statement for this division. 
     Funding levels that are not displayed in the detailed table 
     are identified within this explanatory statement. Any action 
     to eliminate or consolidate programs, projects, and 
     activities should be pursued through a proposal in the 
     President's Budget so it can be considered by the Committees 
     on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the 
     Senate.
       Congressional Reports.--Each Department and agency is 
     directed to provide the Committees on Appropriations of the 
     House of Representatives and the Senate, within 30 days of

     any savings realized by such center closures within the year 
     to enhance instruction, technology, course offerings, and 
     safety at other centers, and conduct additional activities 
     that improve program quality for participants. The Department 
     should also support and incentivize center operators to build 
     and enhance partnerships between centers and other training 
     sites to enhance opportunity and work experiences for 
     students in underserved rural or remote communities as well 
     as in urban settings. Such partnerships should use student-
     focused industry-backed curricula, prepare students for 
     employment in high-demand fields, offer students the 
     opportunity to take coursework leading to college credit, and 
     demonstrate strong employer partnerships within the region in 
     which the center is located.

     approaches to reducing improper payments in the UI system.

     total amount of funding, if any, that was transferred to Job 
     Corps to be used for future operations as authorized.
       Technical Assistance.--The Committees on Appropriations of 
     the House of Representatives and the Senate (Committees) have 
     long relied on the budget office at the Department to 
     facilitate requests for legal and technical information that 
     is not covered by a legitimate claim of privilege. The 
     agreement expects that all technical assistance requests be

       The agreement provides $37,084,000,000 for the National 
     Institutes of Health (NIH), including $496,000,000 from the 
     21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255), an increase of 
     $3,000,000,000, or 8.8 percent, above fiscal year 2017.
       The agreement continues the commitment to funding research 
     on Alzheimer's disease and increases funding by $414,000,000 
     to a total of $1,828,000,000 in fiscal year 2018; increases 
     funding for the All of Us precision medicine initiative by 
     $60,000,000; increases funding for the Brain Research through 
     Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative by 
     $140,000,000; increases funding for regenerative medicine by 
     $8,000,000; increases funding for antibiotic resistance 
     research by $50,000,000; and increases funding for the 
     development of a universal influenza vaccine by $40,000,000. 
     In addition, the agreement includes $500,000,000 for targeted 
     research on opioid addiction within the National Institute of 
     Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the National 
     Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and encourages NIDA to commit 
     additional funding to this effort from within its base 
     budget. It also includes a new initiative to expand research 
     into Down syndrome. In addition, a funding increase above 
     fiscal year 2017 is provided to every Institute and Center to 
     continue investments in research that will save lives, lead 
     to new drug and device development, reduce health care costs, 
     and improve the lives of all Americans.
       The agreement appropriates funds authorized in the 21st 
     Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255). Per the authorization, 
     $300,000,000 is transferred to the National Cancer Institute 
     for cancer research; $43,000,000 to NINDS and $43,000,000 to 
     the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) for the BRAIN 
     Initiative; and $110,000,000 will be allocated from the NIH 
     Innovation Fund, in this agreement reflected in the Office of 
     the Director, for the Precision Medicine Initiative cohort 
     ($100,000,000) and regenerative medicine research 
     ($10,000,000).
       The agreement increases funding for Clinical and 
     Translational Science Awards to $542,771,000; increases 
     funding for Institutional Development Awards to $350,575,000; 
     and continues to support the National Children's Study 
     Follow-on program at $165,000,000.
       The Common Fund is supported as a set-aside within the 
     Office of the Director at $588,116,000, plus an additional 
     $12,600,000 to support pediatric research as authorized by 
     the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act (P.L. 113-94).
       The agreement expects the 8.8 percent increase of funds 
     over the fiscal year 2017 level to support an increase in the 
     number of new and competing Research Project Grants.
       The agreement expects that NIH will continue its focus on 
     emerging investigators and first-time renewals of these young 
     investigators with actions to significantly reduce the 
     average age of an NIH-supported new investigator.
       The agreement expects NIH to support an increase in the 
     number of Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service 
     Awards and to provide a stipend level and inflationary 
     increase to grantees that is at least consistent with the 
     fiscal year 2018 Federal employee pay raise.


                    NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (NCI)

       Heavy Ion Cancer Therapy and Research.--The agreement 
     supports NIH's continued exploration of advanced therapeutic 
     cancer research, specifically heavy ion irradiation 
     technology. Heavy ion technology will introduce a novel 
     treatment option to cancer patients that is currently not 
     available in the U.S. The agreement notes that the U.S. 
     stands to be a world leader in this advanced research. The 
     agreement encourages NIH to explore further the development 
     of a state of the art heavy ion research facility in the U.S. 
     Furthermore, the agreement encourages NIH to work with the 
     Departments of Defense and Energy, and other applicable 
     Federal agencies to equip the first U.S. heavy ion research 
     center. The agreement urges NIH to capitalize on the 
     expertise and potential of recently awarded heavy ion 
     facility planning grant recipients in order to foster a 
     multidisciplinary approach and advance heavy ion research 
     that would produce novel, cutting edge treatments for cancer 
     patients.


   NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES 
                                (NIDDK)

       National Commission on Digestive Diseases.--The agreement 
     requests an update on the implementation and recommendations 
     of the National Commission on Digestive Diseases report 
     entitled ``Opportunities & Challenges in Digestive 
     Diseases''' in the fiscal year 2020 Congressional 
     Justification.


    NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE (NINDS)

       Opioids Research.--The agreement includes $250,000,000 for 
     targeted research related to opioid addiction, development of 
     opioid alternatives, pain management, and addiction 
     treatment.


     NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES (NIAID)

       Universal Influenza Vaccine.--The agreement directs NIAID 
     to allocate not less than $100,000,000 in fiscal year 2018 to 
     advance basic, translational, and clinical research necessary 
     to develop a universal influenza vaccine. To date, 128 
     children have died from influenza this season, and the 
     hospitalization rate this season is among the highest since 
     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began 
     collecting these data in 2010. In response to the severity of 
     the 2017-2018 influenza season, the agreement encourages 
     NIAID to continue to prioritize investment in the basic and 
     clinical scientific research necessary to develop a universal 
     influenza vaccine.


         NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES (NIGMS)

       Science Education Partnership Awards (SEPA).--The agreement 
     expects SEPA to receive not less than $19,498,000, which is 
     the fiscal year 2017 level plus the proportional share of the 
     general increase provided to NIGMS.


  EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN 
                          DEVELOPMENT (NICHD)

       Birth Settings Study.--The agreement notes that rates of 
     home and birth center births continue to rise and there is 
     ongoing need for further study on issues related to the 
     choice of birth setting. Therefore, NICHD is directed to 
     enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences 
     to provide an evidence-based analysis of the complex findings 
     in the research on birth settings, including but not limited 
     to: definitions and assessment of risk factors; access to and 
     choice in birth settings; social determinants that influence 
     risk and outcomes in varying birth settings; financing models 
     for childbirth across settings; and the licensing, training, 
     and accreditation issues impacting professionals providing 
     maternity care across all settings.


     NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL AND SKIN--
                           DISEASES--(NIAMS)

       Dermatology Branch.--The agreement reflects the move of the 
     Dermatology Branch from NCI to NIAMS.


                NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE (NIDA)

       Opioid Research.--The agreement includes $250,000,000 for 
     targeted research related to opioid addiction, development of 
     opioid alternatives, pain management, and addiction 
     treatment. The agreement commends the NIH Director for 
     initiating a Public-Private Partnership to develop new 
     medications to respond to the opioid crisis, but notes, 
     however, that NIH has failed to identify additional funding 
     within the NIH's budget for efforts to address the opioid 
     crisis. Presently, NIDA allocates 15 percent of its annual 
     budget to researching issues related to opioid addiction, 
     arguably one of the greatest public health threats facing the 
     nation today. While a significant improvement compared to 
     previous years, in addition to the new opioid research 
     funding provided by this agreement, NIH is strongly 
     encouraged to explore opportunities for committing additional 
     resources from the significant base funding included in the 
     agreement for NIDA. It is understood that $141,000,000 in 
     expiring grant awards will become available for new competing 
     awards in fiscal year 2018.


  NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES (NIMHD)

       Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMIs).--The 
     agreement continues to support the core mission of RCMIs to 
     develop new investigators from under-represented communities 
     and to conduct world-class biomedical research that 
     emphasizes minority health and health disparities. The 
     agreement expects the RCMIs to receive not less than 
     $61,478,000, which is the fiscal year 2017 level plus the 
     proportional share of the general increase provided to NIMHD.


      NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES (NCATS)

       Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program.--
     The bill provides $542,771,000, an increase of $26,651,000, 
     for the CTSA program.-- The agreement continues to support 
     the program, a stabilization in the number of hubs funded, 
     and a five year grant cycle.-- The agreement acknowledges the 
     positive changes made to the program in response to language 
     included in the fiscal year--2018 Senate Report, including 
     the increase in communication and collaboration with the 
     Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives 
     and the Senate.-- The agreement expects the Director to 
     provide quarterly updates to principal investigators of CTSA 
     hubs beginning within 30--days of enactment of this Act and 
     to continue the ongoing updates to the Committees.-- Finally, 
     the agreement expects written notification to continue to be 
     provided to the Committees at least three days in advance of 
     any public release of CTSA grant awards.


                         OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR

       Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act.--The agreement 
     continues bill language for specific funds authorized by the 
     Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act--(P.L.--114-255) 
     within the Common Fund to support the fourth year of the 10-
     year Pediatric Research Initiative. The agreement requests an 
     update in the fiscal year 2020 Congressional Justification on 
     this effort as described in the House and Senate Reports.
       Down Syndrome.--The agreement directs the NIH Director to 
     develop a new trans-NIH initiative-involving, at a minimum, 
     NICHD, NIA, and NCI-to study trisomy 21, with the aim of 
     yielding scientific discoveries to improve the health and 
     neurodevelopment of

[[Page H2702]]

     individuals with Down syndrome and typical individuals at 
     risk for Alzheimer's disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, 
     immune system dysregulation, and autism, among others.--This 
     initiative shall bring together research results that will be 
     available to academic researchers, nonprofit organizations, 
     and industry researchers. Funding for this trans-NIH 
     initiative will supplement, not supplant, existing NIH 
     funding levels for Down syndrome research.-- The agreement 
     directs NIH to report to the Committees on Appropriations of 
     the House of Representatives and the Senate within--180 days 
     of enactment of this act on the structure, leadership, and 
     key areas of focus for the new trans-NIH initiative for 
     fiscal years 2018 through 2022.
       Strategic Plan for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).--The 
     agreement notes the release of the 2016 2017 Interagency 
     Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) Strategic Plan for 
     Autism Spectrum Disorder and encourages NIH to consider the 
     IACC's recommendations regarding future research related to 
     ASD.
       Clinical Trials Definition.--The agreement appreciates 
     efforts NIH has taken to increase transparency and improve 
     oversight of its clinical trials and recognizes that the 
     results of NIH-funded clinical trials have not always been 
     reported in a timely manner, reducing the potential benefit 
     from the findings. The agreement urges NIH to continue to 
     address this problem through enhanced registration and 
     reporting through ClinicalTrials.gov. There is concern, 
     however, that in addressing this issue, many fundamental 
     research studies involving human participants are being 
     redefined as clinical trials without sufficient notification 
     and consultation with this segment of the research community. 
     Fundamental research is critical to the NIH mission and of 
     value to the public, and there is concern that policy changes 
     could have long-term, unintended consequences for this 
     research, add unnecessary regulatory burdens, and 
     substantially increase the number of studies in the 
     clinicaltrials.gov database that are not clinical trials. For 
     fiscal year 2018, the agreement directs NIH to delay 
     enforcement of the new policy published in the Federal 
     Register on September 21, 2017--including NIH's more 
     expansive interpretation of ``interventions'''--in relation 
     to fundamental research projects involving humans. The new 
     policy should go forward for research projects that would 
     have been considered clinical trials under the prior policy. 
     This delay is intended to provide NIH sufficient time to 
     consult with the basic research community to determine the 
     reporting standards best suited to this kind of research. The 
     agreement directs NIH to provide the Committees on 
     Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate 
     a plan and schedule for soliciting comments and input from 
     the research community within 30 days of enactment of this 
     act, and brief the Committees on the results of these 
     consultations and next steps by June 22, 2018.
       Frontotemporal Degeneration (FTD).--The agreement strongly 
     encourages NIH maintain and expand a multi-site 
     infrastructure and network of clinical sites to extend the 
     study of genetic and sporadic FTD cohorts. By supporting 
     research in this way, we may increase our knowledge of the 
     natural history of the disease by building an infrastructure 
     for biomarker discovery and clinical trials in defined FTD 
     cohorts. A key component of this infrastructure includes 
     support for a bioinformatics framework that will enable broad 
     data sharing with the research community to advance disease 
     modeling, and target and pathway discovery for therapeutic 
     development. The agreement also recommends NIH prepare plans 
     of action to increase research and treatment initiatives as 
     they pertain to all forms of dementia, including challenges 
     faced by those with younger onset and non-amnestic forms of 
     the disease.
       Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH).--The agreement 
     recognizes the continuing importance of the ORWH, and the 
     valuable role it plays in ensuring clinical and basic 
     research accurately reflects the racial, ethnic, age, sex and 
     gender diversity necessary to provide generalizable data on 
     the safety and efficacy of new medical products and the 
     applicability of NIH-funded research to all Americans. It is 
     anticipated that funding for ORWH will be assigned the 
     priority merited by the important mission it advances and 
     reflect growth in the overall NIH budget.

   Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)

       The agreement encourages SAMHSA to include as eligible 
     applicants in new funding opportunity announcements, States, 
     political subdivisions of States, Indian tribes or tribal 
     organizations, health facilities, or programs operated by or 
     in accordance with a contract or grant with the Indian Health 
     Service, or other public or private nonprofit organizations. 
     The agreement strongly encourages SAMHSA to exercise maximum 
     flexibility when developing funding opportunity announcements 
     to ensure that all eligible applicants may apply.
       The agreement urges the Assistant Secretary to ensure that 
     all training requirements specified by 21 U.S.C. 
     823(g)(2)(G)(ii)(IV) are meaningfully addressed.


                             MENTAL HEALTH

       Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics.--The 
     agreement includes $100,000,000 and directs SAMSHA to 
     prioritize resources to entities within States that are part 
     of the section 223(a) of the Protecting Access to Medicare 
     Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-93) demonstration and to entities 
     within States that were awarded planning grants. SAMHSA is 
     encouraged to coordinate these resources with its efforts on 
     substance use disorders. SAMHSA shall conduct an evaluation 
     of the program and provide a report to the Committees on 
     Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate 
     not later than 15 months after the date of enactment of this 
     Act.
       Children's Mental Health Services.--The agreement includes 
     a new 10 percent set-aside for an early intervention 
     demonstration program with persons not more than 25 years of 
     age at clinical high risk of developing a first episode of 
     psychosis. SAMHSA is directed to work with NIMH on the 
     implementation of this set-aside.
       Within the total provided for Mental Health Programs of 
     Regional and National Significance (PRNS), the agreement 
     includes the following amounts:

       Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health.--The agreement 
     includes $5,000,000 for infant and early childhood mental 
     health promotion, intervention, and treatment as authorized 
     in section 10006 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-
     255).
       Mental Health First Aid.--When SAMHSA issues new 
     competitive funding opportunities, SAMHSA is directed to 
     include as eligible grantees local law enforcement agencies, 
     fire departments, and emergency medical units with a special 
     emphasis on training for crisis de-escalation techniques. 
     SAMHSA is also encouraged to prioritize training for 
     veterans, armed services personnel, and their family members.
       Project AWARE.--The agreement provides $71,000,000, an 
     increase of $14,000,000 for Project AWARE, a program which 
     raises awareness of mental health issues and connects young 
     people experiencing behavioral health issues, as well as 
     their families, with needed services. Of the amount provided 
     for Project AWARE, the agreement provides not less than 
     $10,000,000 for discretionary grants to support efforts in 
     high-crime, high-poverty areas and, in particular, 
     communities that are seeking to address relevant impacts and 
     root causes of civil unrest. These grants should maintain the 
     same focus as fiscal year 2017 grants. The agreement requests 
     a report on progress of fiscal year 2017 grantees 180 days 
     after the enactment of this Act.


                       SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT

       21st Century Cures.--The agreement notes concern that 
     SAMHSA has restricted State's flexibility for addressing the 
     opioid crisis by limiting the amount of funding that can be 
     used for opioid prevention activities. The agreement 
     recommends States be given flexibility within the existing 
     grant program authorized in section 1003(b)(3) of the 21st 
     Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) to direct resources in 
     accordance with local needs. The agreement requests a report 
     to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of 
     Representatives and the Senate on such plans and evaluation 
     results available on this program, one year after enactment 
     of this Act.
       State Opioid Response Grants.--The agreement provides 
     $1,000,000,000 in new funding for grants to States to address 
     the opioid crisis. This funding is in addition to the 
     $500,000,000 provided in the 21st Century Cures Act. Bill 
     language provides $50,000,000 for grants to Indian tribes or 
     tribal organizations. In addition, the agreement provides a 
     15 percent set-aside for States with the highest age-adjusted 
     mortality rate related to opioid use disorders. The Assistant 
     Secretary is encouraged to apply a weighted formula within 
     the set-aside based on state ordinal ranking. The agreement 
     urges the Assistant Secretary to ensure the formula avoids a 
     significant cliff between States with similar mortality 
     rates. SAMHSA shall submit to the Committees on 
     Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate 
     a work plan of the proposed allocation of funds not later 
     than 30 days prior to awarding grants.
       In addition, not later than one year after the date of 
     enactment of this Act, SAMHSA

[[Page H2703]]

     shall submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations of 
     the House of Representatives and the Senate that includes a 
     description of the activities for which each State has 
     received funding and the ultimate recipients of the funds 
     provided to States. In addition, SAMHSA shall submit an 
     evaluation of the program not later than two years after the 
     date of enactment of this Act. SAMHSA is directed to make the 
     report and evaluation publicly available on SAMHSA's website.
       National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Review.--Within the 
     total for administration, technical assistance, and 
     evaluation, provided to SAMHSA for the State Opioid Response 
     Grants, the agreement includes $2,000,000 to charter a NAS 
     review within 90 days of enactment of this Act. The NAS 
     review will identify outcomes that are to be achieved by 
     activities authorized in the Comprehensive Addiction and 
     Recovery Act (P.L. 114-198) and the metrics by which the 
     achievement of such outcomes shall be determined, as required 
     by section 701 of such Act. The NAS study should report on 
     the effectiveness of the programs in achieving their 
     respective goals for preventing, treating, and supporting 
     recovery from substance use disorders. The NAS study will 
     result in the public availability of program level data and 
     recommendations to Congress concerning the appropriate

       Health Services and Primary Care Research.--The agreement 
     includes $1,000,000 within the total for Program Management 
     to contract with an independent entity to study health 
     services and primary care research supported by Federal 
     agencies since fiscal year 2012. This study should identify 
     research gaps and areas for consolidation, as well as propose 
     strategies for better coordination of the Federal health 
     services research enterprise. AHRQ shall provide a report to 
     the Committees on Appropriations of the House of 
     Representatives and the Senate on the status of this study 
     within one year of enactment of this Act.

            Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)


                           program management

       Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment System.--The agreement 
     notes that CMS recently finalized the payment rates under the 
     Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment System for calendar year 
     2018. CMS is directed to submit a report within 180 days of 
     enactment of this Act to the Committees on Appropriations of 
     the House of Representatives and the Senate. Such report 
     should include a detailed justification of the payment 
     methodology for Interventional Pain Ambulatory Surgical 
     Centers.
       Assistive Technology.--The agreement encourages CMS to 
     support efforts by State Medicaid programs to partner with 
     State Assistive Technology Act Programs to develop and 
     implement reutilization programs with a goal of containing 
     Medicaid costs.
       Cost Plans.--The agreement supports efforts that ensure 
     beneficiaries enrolled in a Medicare Cost Plan subject to a 
     transition in contract year 2019 are either deemed from the 
     Cost Plan to one of its Medicare Advantage plans, seamlessly 
     transitioned to a new Medicare Advantage plan, or 
     transitioned to Medicare Fee-for-Service without disruption 
     to care. The agreement requests the Secretary notify 
     beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Cost Plans as of January 
     1, 2018, if their plan will not be available, and notify 
     beneficiaries of available educational resources not later 
     than June 1, 2018. The agreement requests CMS inform impacted 
     beneficiaries of their coverage options for January 1, 2019, 
     as early as practicable.
       Durable Medical Equipment.--The agreement encourages CMS to 
     promulgate the pending Interim Final Rule entitled ``Durable 
     Medical Equipment Fee Schedule, Adjustments to Resume the 
     Transitional 50/50 Blended Rates to Provide Relief in Non-
     Competitive Bidding Areas.''
       Health Insurance Exchange Transparency.--The agreement 
     continues to include bill language in section 220 that 
     requires CMS to provide cost information for the following 
     categories: Federal Payroll and Other Administrative Costs; 
     Exchange-related Information Technology (IT); Non-IT Program 
     Costs, including Health Plan Benefit and Rate Review, 
     Exchange Oversight, Payment and Financial Management, 
     Eligibility and Enrollment; Consumer Information and 
     Outreach, including the Call Center, Navigator Grants and 
     Consumer Education and Outreach; Exchange Quality Review; 
     Small Business Health Options Program and Employer 
     Activities; and Other Exchange Activities. Cost information 
     should be provided for each fiscal year since the enactment 
     of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-
     148). CMS is also required to include the estimated costs for 
     fiscal year 2019.
       Mental Health Providers.--The agreement is aware that 
     Medicare beneficiaries have limited access to substance use 
     disorder and mental health services, particularly in rural 
     and underserved areas. The agreement notes

[[Page H2704]]

     concern about the shortage of eligible mental health 
     providers for the Medicare population and supports efforts to 
     explore the expansion of the mental and behavioral health 
     workforce.
       Recovery Audit Contractors.--The agreement requests a 
     briefing on the Recovery Audit Contractor program for the 
     Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives 
     and the Senate within 60 days of enactment of this Act.
       Risk Corridor Program.--The agreement continues bill 
     language to prevent the CMS Program Management appropriation 
     account from being used to support risk corridor payments. 
     The agreement directs CMS to provide a report starting with 
     plan year 2014 to the Committees on Appropriations of the 
     House of Representatives and the Senate detailing the 
     receipts and transfer of payments for this program.
       Telehealth.--The agreement reaffirms the request under this 
     heading in Senate Report 115-150 for a report within one year 
     of enactment of this Act. The agreement directs the 
     Administrator to consult with Telehealth Centers of 
     Excellence and other relevant agencies and stakeholders.

             Administration for Children and Families (ACF)


                   low income home energy assistance

       The agreement includes an increase of $250,000,000 for the 
     Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). LIHEAP 
     provides critical assistance to help low-income households 
     keep up with home energy costs, which is particularly 
     valuable for geographic regions that experience extreme 
     temperatures in the winter and summer months.


                     refugee and entrant assistance

       Refugee Support Services.--The agreement accepts the 
     Administration's proposal to consolidate funding from Social 
     Services, Preventive Health, and Targeted Assistance into 
     Refugee Support Services. The agreement expects activities 
     funded under these three lines in fiscal year 2017 to 
     continue in fiscal year 2018 at the same funding level as 
     fiscal year 2017.
       Transitional and Medical Services.--The agreement provides 
     a funding level consistent with the current estimates of 
     eligible arrivals. The agreement affirms the expectations 
     outlined in Senate Report 115-150, including ACF maintaining 
     the number of months refugees are eligible for benefits.
       Unaccompanied Children.--The agreement directs HHS to 
     provide a joint briefing with the Departments of Homeland 
     Security and State, within 45 days of enactment of this Act, 
     to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of 
     Representatives and the Senate. The briefing should outline 
     the Administration's current and planned policies that impact 
     the resources needed for this program.
       Victims of Trafficking.--The agreement includes $17,000,000 
     for services for foreign national victims and $6,755,000 to 
     improve services available for U.S. citizens and legal 
     permanent residents. Within the total of $23,755,000, the 
     agreement includes $1,750,000 for the National Human 
     Trafficking Hotline program, an increase of $250,000.


   payments to states for the child care and development block grant

       The agreement includes a $2,370,000,000 increase for the 
     Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act. It is 
     expected that this increase will support the full 
     implementation of the CCDBG Act as reauthorized in 2014, 
     including activities to improve the quality and safety of 
     child care programs, increasing provider reimbursement rates, 
     and ensuring health and safety standards are met. The 
     Department should work with States to ensure they are fully 
     in compliance with, and meeting the goals of, the CCDBG Act. 
     Further, the Department should work with States to ensure 
     they are aware of the availability of funds under current law 
     to make minor improvements to facilities to bring them into 
     compliance with health and safety requirements and improve 
     professional development for the child care workforce. 
     Finally, the Department should work with States to ensure 
     they are meeting the needs of families with non-traditional 
     work hours. The funding will also increase access to 
     affordable, high-quality child care to more low-income, 
     working families.


                children and families services programs

       Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) Infant 
     Plans of Safe Care.--The agreement provides an increase of 
     $60,000,000 for CAPTA State Grants. Within the increase, the 
     agreement directs States to prioritize infant plans of safe 
     care, including compliance with the requirements in section 
     106(b)(2)(B)(iii) of CAPTA. The incidence of neonatal 
     abstinence syndrome has increased as the opioid crisis has 
     worsened, and this funding is intended to help States improve 
     their response to infants affected by substance use disorder 
     and their families. The agreement also directs HHS to provide 
     the necessary technical assistance, monitoring, and oversight 
     to assist and evaluate State's activities on plans of safe 
     care. The agreement requests an update on those activities in 
     the fiscal year 2020 Congressional Justification.
       Child Abuse Discretionary Activities.--The agreement notes 
     the lack of knowledge regarding effective and appropriate 
     text-based and chat-based intervention and education services 
     for child abuse victims and concerned adults as these new 
     communication channels increase in prevalence. Therefore, the 
     agreement includes $1,000,000 for an extramural grant to 
     develop and expand text and chat capabilities and protocols 
     for a National child abuse hotline to determine best 
     practices in appropriate communication, identity 
     verification, privacy protection, and resource sharing with 
     youth seeking assistance. In awarding the grant, ACF is 
     directed to prioritize ability to coordinate with other 
     hotlines administered by ACF.
       Community Economic Development.--The agreement directs ACF 
     to issue a funding opportunity announcement prioritizing 
     applications from rural areas with high rates of poverty, 
     unemployment, and substance abuse.
       Early Head Start (EHS).--The agreement includes a 
     $115,000,000 increase for Early Head Start Expansion and 
     Early Head Start-Child Care (EHS-CC) Partnership Grants. The 
     agreement directs ACF to continue to equally prioritize EHS 
     Expansion and EHS-CC Partnerships, as determined by the needs 
     of local communities, as done in previous grant competitions 
     for this program. Within the total, the agreement includes a 
     cost of living adjustment of $15,000,000 for existing 
     grantees.
       Head Start.--The agreement provides a full cost-of-living 
     adjustment of $216,000,000 to Head Start grantees. The 
     agreement also includes $260,000,000 for grantees to increase 
     their program hours, in alignment with the requirement in the 
     Head Start Program Performance Standards. In addition to 
     supporting working families, research shows that extended 
     duration of high-quality early learning services improves 
     child learning and developmental outcomes.
       Family Violence Prevention and Services.--The agreement 
     includes a $9,000,000 increase and directs ACF to use 
     $5,000,000 of that increase to supplement existing funding 
     for Native American tribes and tribal organizations. The 
     agreement recognizes the importance of providing supports 
     that are culturally appropriate to the populations they 
     serve.
       Native American Programs.--The agreement includes 
     $12,000,000 for Native American language preservation 
     activities, including $3,000,000 for Generation Indigenous, 
     and not less than $4,000,000 for language immersion programs 
     authorized by section 803C(b)(7)(A)-(C) of the Native 
     American Programs Act.
       Runaway and Homeless Youth.--The agreement provides an 
     increase of $8,300,000 for the Runaway and Homeless Youth 
     program. The new funding should be provided to Transitional 
     Living Program and Maternal Group Home grantees whose awards 
     end on April 30, 2018 to continue services until new awards 
     for those grantees are made or for grantees who did not get a 
     new grant, a continuation grant to provide services until the 
     end of fiscal year 2018. The new funding can only be used for 
     additional new awards after funds have been set aside for 
     completing extensions to ensure grantees awarded grants in 
     fiscal year 2013 are able to operate through the end of 
     fiscal year 2018.
       Street Outreach Program.--The agreement acknowledges the 
     value of geographic balance in providing resources to fight 
     against youth homelessness and encourages ACF to award at 
     least one grant in each of the 10 regions.


                   PROMOTING SAFE AND STABLE FAMILIES

       Kinship Navigator Programs.--As parents struggle with 
     opioid addiction and substance use disorder, more 
     grandparents and relatives are taking primary responsibility 
     for the care of children. The agreement includes $20,000,000 
     to assist States and Indian tribes to develop and enhance 
     kinship navigator programs. The new funding is provided to 
     support changes to comply with upcoming requirements in the 
     recently passed Family First Prevention Services Act, 
     included as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 
     115-123).
       Regional Partnership Grants.--This agreement includes 
     $20,000,000 for Regional Partnership Grants to fund community 
     collaborations among substance abuse treatment, courts, and 
     child welfare agencies to improve the lives of children and 
     families affected by opioids and other substance use 
     disorders.

               Administration for Community Living (ACL)


                 AGING AND DISABILITY SERVICES PROGRAMS

       Aging Network Support Activities.--The agreement provides 
     $12,461,000 for Aging Network Support Activities, of which 
     $5,000,000 is for the Holocaust Survivor's Assistance 
     program.
       Alzheimer's Disease Program.--The agreement provides 
     $23,500,000 for the Alzheimer's Disease Program, an increase 
     of $4,000,000. The agreement accepts the Administration's 
     proposal to streamline several Alzheimer's disease programs 
     into one larger, more flexible program that will allow 
     States, communities, nonprofits, and Indian tribes greater 
     access to funding opportunities authorized under Title IV of 
     the Older Americans Act. The agreement directs ACL to expand 
     support for evidence-based interventions funded in fiscal 
     year 2017 and to test cutting edge approaches that will serve 
     persons with Alzheimer's disease, related dementias, and 
     their family caregivers. The agreement notes that the 
     National Institute on Aging will continue its Alzheimer's 
     Disease Outreach Campaign and the agreement also provides 
     funding for the National Alzheimer's Call Center under this 
     heading.
       Assistive Technology.--The agreement includes $2,000,000 
     for competitive grants as specified in House Report 115-244. 
     In addition, the agreement encourages CMS to support efforts 
     by State Medicaid programs to

[[Page H2705]]

     partner with State Assistive Technology Act Programs to 
     develop and implement reutilization programs with a goal of 
     containing Medicaid costs.
       Elder Rights Support Activities.--The agreement includes 
     $15,874,000 for Elder Rights Support Activities, of which 
     $12,000,000 is included for the Elder Justice and Adult 
     Protective Services program.
       Developmental Disabilities Projects of National 
     Significance.--The agreement includes $12,000,000 for 
     Developmental Disabilities Projects of National Significance. 
     Of this amount, not less than $1,000,000 is to fund 
     transportation assistance activities for older adults and 
     persons with disabilities. The transportation activities 
     should focus on the most cost-effective and sustainable 
     strategies that can be replicated to other communities.
       Independent Living.--The agreement provides $113,183,000 
     for the Independent Living program, of which $24,878,000 is 
     for the Independent Living State Grants program and 
     $88,305,000 is for the Centers for Independent Living 
     program.
       Paralysis Resource Center.--The agreement includes 
     $7,700,000 for the National Paralysis Resource Center (PRC), 
     an increase of $1,000,000. This program has long provided 
     essential, comprehensive information, and referral services 
     that promote independence and quality of life for the 5.4 
     million people living with paralysis and their families. The 
     agreement directs ACL to continue support for the national 
     PRC at not less than the fiscal year 2017 funding level.

                        Office of the Secretary


                    GENERAL DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT

       Healthcare Costs of Illegal Immigration.--The agreement 
     directs the Department to provide a report to the Committees 
     on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the 
     Senate on available information regarding the costs borne by 
     State and local governments for providing services to 
     individuals without legal immigration status, including the 
     Federal resources from the Department that are being used to 
     assist States in fiscal year 2018 to cover these expenses.
       Nonrecurring Expenses Fund.--In addition to funds directed 
     in the CDC's Buildings and Facilities account to support the 
     BSL-4 laboratory, the agreement directs the Secretary to 
     prioritize obligations from resources in the Nonrecurring 
     Expenses Fund for the following projects: CDC National 
     Institute for Occupational Safety and Health facility, Indian 
     Health Services facilities, NIH chillers, Food and Drug 
     Administration laboratory renovations, HHS cybersecurity 
     initiatives, and the Departmental Appeals Board case 
     management system. Additionally, the agreement notes the 
     number of notified projects that have not yet been completed. 
     The agreement encourages the Secretary to complete 
     outstanding projects in a timely manner and prior to 
     directing funding to new projects.
       Obligation Reports.--The agreement directs the Secretary to 
     submit electronically to the Committees on Appropriations of 
     the House of Representatives and the Senate an Excel table 
     detailing the obligations made in the most recent quarter for 
     each office and activity funded under this appropriation not 
     later than 30 days after the end of each quarter.
       Staffing Reports.--The agreement directs the Secretary to 
     submit to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of 
     Representatives and the Senate a monthly Excel table listing 
     the names, titles, grades, agencies, and divisions of all of 
     the political appointees and special government employees, 
     and detailees that were employed by or assigned within the 
     Department during the previous month.
       Technical Assistance.--The agreement reiterates the 
     importance of the long-standing relationship between the 
     Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives 
     and the Senate (Committees) and the Department's Office of 
     the Assistant Secretary for Financial Resources (ASFR). As 
     noted in Senate Report 115-150, the Committees have long 
     relied on ASFR to facilitate the Committees' requests for 
     legal and technical feedback that is not covered by a 
     legitimate claim of privilege, as well as technical 
     assistance to ensure the Committees' guidance is implemented 
     as intended. The Committees expect that all technical 
     assistance requests be dealt with in a manner that is 
     consistent with past precedent, including timely answers that 
     respond to any specific inquiries.


                 OFFICE OF MEDICARE HEARINGS AND APPEALS

       The agreement directs the Office of Medicare Hearings and 
     Appeals to provide quarterly reports to the Committees on 
     Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate 
     reflecting the total number of appeals filed, appeals 
     pending, and appeals disposed of for all levels of the 
     appeals process. The quarterly updates should include a 
     breakout of Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) and non-RAC 
     claims.


             PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES EMERGENCY FUND

       The agreement includes a program level of $1,953,458,000 
     for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 
     (PHSSEF). This funding will support a comprehensive program 
     to prepare for and respond to the health and medical 
     consequences of all public health emergencies, including 
     bioterrorism, and support the cybersecurity efforts of HHS.
       The agreement commends the Assistant Secretary for 
     Preparedness and Response (ASPR) for the work ASPR has done 
     to develop regional, coalition-based disaster medical 
     response plans. The agreement encourages ASPR to work with 
     States that have demonstrated success in creating statewide 
     disaster healthcare systems to coordinate patient movement, 
     evacuation and field emergency care, particularly in areas 
     with high incidence of natural disasters, with the goal of 
     establishing best practices and maximizing Federal resources.
       Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP).--The agreement rejects 
     the Administration's proposal to change the allocation 
     formula that would leave 26 States and Territories without 
     HPP funding.

                           General Provisions

       Prevention and Public Health Fund.--The agreement reflects 
     the allocation of the Prevention and Public Health Fund.

     cost negotiated rates.
       The agreement includes a new provision granting transfer 
     authority for funds related to opioid research at NIH.
       The agreement includes a new provision prohibiting Child

                               TITLE III

                        DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

                    Education for the Disadvantaged

       Consultation on State Plans.--As State Educational Agencies 
     work to finalize their plans for distributing their section 
     1003 funds, and continue to give priority to supporting Local 
     Educational Agencies as required under section 1003(f) of the 
     Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), States must include 
     assurances in their State plans as required under 1111(g)(2), 
     including the assurance that the State educational agencies 
     will ensure that local educational agencies, in developing 
     and implementing programs under Title I, Part A, will, to the 
     extent feasible, work in consultation with outside 
     intermediary organizations (such as educational service 
     agencies), or individuals, that have practical expertise in 
     the development or use of evidence-based strategies and 
     programs to improve teaching, learning, and schools.

                      School Improvement Programs

       Native Hawaiian Education Program.--The agreement includes 
     $36,397,000 for the Native Hawaiian Education program, 
     including $650,000 for the Native Hawaiian Education Council.
       Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants.--One of the 
     goals of the Student Support and Academic Enrichment (SSAE) 
     grants program is to provide safe, healthy learning 
     environments for students. The funding can be utilized for a 
     wide range of uses, including to expand access to or 
     coordinate resources for school-based mental health services 
     and supports, which may include trauma-informed practices and 
     school counseling; bullying prevention; and professional 
     development for personnel in crisis management and school-
     based violence prevention strategies. The agreement provides 
     $1,100,000,000, which is a $700,000,000 increase over fiscal 
     year 2017, to make these flexible resources available to 
     States, which can include assisting in protecting students 
     and educators.
       In addition to the language included in House Report 115-
     244 regarding SSAE grants and science, technology, 
     engineering, and math (STEM) education, the agreement 
     encourages the Department to especially support pre-
     kindergarten through grade 12 computer science education 
     programs that address the enrollment and achievement gap for 
     underrepresented students such as minorities, girls, and 
     youth from families living at or below the poverty line.


                        INNOVATION AND IMPROVEMENT

       Education Innovation and Research (EIR).--The agreement 
     reiterates and applies language included under this heading 
     in both House Report 115-244 and Senate Report 115-150 to 
     funds provided in this Act.
       In addition, within the total, the agreement includes 
     $50,000,000 for innovative STEM education projects, including 
     computer science education. The Department proposed in its 
     fiscal year 2019 budget new bill language, not included in 
     this agreement, that would allow the Secretary to devote all 
     of these funds to STEM. This proposal will be considered as 
     part of the fiscal year 2019 appropriations process.
       The Department should coordinate with other Federal 
     agencies that issue grants in this area, including the 
     National Science Foundation, to avoid duplication and ensure 
     activities funded under EIR build on the existing evidence 
     base and provide a unique benefit to the field. The agreement 
     also notes that a wide-range of formula and competitive 
     grants at the Department of Education can also be used to 
     support STEM education.
       The agreement also encourages the Department to seek 
     opportunities to collaborate with researchers from the fields 
     of neuroscience, cognitive development, psychiatry, 
     psychology, and education and human development, for the 
     purposes of promoting research-based scientific interventions 
     in the science of learning that improve academic outcomes for 
     high-need, high-poverty students. The agreement also directs 
     the Department to prioritize proposals that seek to

[[Page H2706]]

     improve early learning and cognitive development outcomes 
     among high-need, high-poverty students through neuroscience-
     based and scientifically validated interventions and meet the 
     evidence requirements for this program established by ESSA.
       Charter Schools Program.--The agreement modifies the 
     language in Senate Report 115-150 to include up to $7,500,000 
     for developer grants to establish or expand charter schools 
     in underserved, high-poverty, rural areas, as described 
     therein.
       Supporting Effective Educator Development.--In awarding 
     grants under the Supporting Effective Educator Development 
     (SEED) program, the Secretary is directed to ensure that 
     grants are distributed among a diverse set of eligible 
     entities including National non-profit organizations 
     implementing evidence-based activities (as defined in section 
     8101(21)(A)(i) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act) 
     across a number of sites which can help bring to scale 
     evidence-based programs of National significance across the 
     country.
       Additionally, the agreement supports funding for activities 
     described under this heading in the explanatory statement 
     accompanying Division H of the Consolidated Appropriations 
     Act, 2017, regarding programs, which may include a consortia 
     of programs operating in multiple States, to improve the 
     academic preparation and college readiness, including the 
     college-and-career pipeline, of rural youth.
       Finally, within the SEED program, the agreement supports 
     funding for innovative programs providing professional 
     development for teachers in early childhood and early 
     elementary school focused on social emotional learning, 
     classroom and behavior management, and improving school 
     climate, with the goal of improving the social and emotional 
     well-being and academic performance of students.
       Arts in Education.--The agreement includes funding to 
     continue the Department's support for all grant programs 
     funded within this program at not less than the fiscal year 
     2017 level. This includes $7,700,000, an increase of 
     $1,000,000, for the National Arts in Education program, to 
     continue the Department's support for National-level, high-
     quality arts education projects, which could include 
     developing arts education data mapping tools to identify gaps 
     in arts education across the country; developing and updating 
     standards-aligned arts curriculum; professional development 
     for special educators; and other high-quality projects for 
     children and youth, with an emphasis on servicing students 
     from low-income families and students with disabilities. The 
     Department is also directed to provide more flexibility to 
     Arts in Education Model Development and Dissemination 
     grantees by establishing more appropriate performance 
     measures, such as access to standards-based arts education in 
     high-needs schools and assessment of student knowledge and 
     skills in the arts, for this grant activity.


                  SAFE SCHOOLS AND CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION

       National Activities.--The agreement includes $90,000,000, 
     an increase of $22,000,000. These funds should be used to 
     expand evidence-based programs to ensure safe learning 
     environments for students and educators, including improving 
     school climates, preventing violence in schools, and 
     providing services in response to serious incidents.
       Promise Neighborhoods.--The agreement reiterates language 
     under this heading in Senate Report 115-150 except that it 
     expects initial implementation continuation grants to be 
     awarded as soon as possible, not later than June 1, 2018. In 
     addition, the agreement specifies that not less than 
     $12,000,000 shall be available for such extension grants in 
     fiscal year 2018, with a minimum grant of not less than 
     $3,000,000 per year.


                            SPECIAL EDUCATION

       Within the total for Technical Assistance and Dissemination 
     the agreement includes $15,083,000 for education activities 
     authorized under P.L.--108-406.
       Seclusion and Restraint.--The agreement includes direction 
     for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a 
     further study on data reported to the Department of 
     Education's Office for Civil Rights on the use of seclusion 
     and restraints for all students at the school and district 
     level on efforts to reduce the use of seclusion and restraint 
     practices. There is concern that seclusion and restraint 
     issues continue to be chronically underreported. In 
     particular, GAO is encouraged to evaluate recommendations for 
     improving data collection at any school, including any 
     special education or alternative school, that serves 
     students, ages 3-21. In fulfilling the requested study, the 
     GAO should also include recommendations, including examples 
     of best practices, of how schools are adopting effective 
     alternatives to these practices and reducing the incidence of 
     seclusion and restraint.


                       STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

       Federal Work Study.--The agreement includes up to 
     $9,625,000, an increase of $1,235,000, for the Work Colleges 
     program authorized under section 448 of the Higher Education 
     Act.
       Pell Grants.--The agreement includes sufficient funding to 
     increase the maximum award by $175 to $6,095 in academic year 
     2018-2019.


                        STUDENT AID ADMINISTRATION

       Student Loan Servicing.--The agreement supports efforts to 
     improve the Federal student aid application and servicing 
     process to best serve students and student borrowers. 
     However, there remains concern about specific elements of the 
     Department's proposal to significantly revamp the Federal 
     student loan servicing process. Accordingly, the agreement 
     includes language, modified from Senate Report 115-150, 
     preventing the Department from moving forward with specific 
     components of their proposal and current solicitation unless 
     they are modified to include certain elements to promote 
     accountability, transparency, and competition, to better 
     serve student borrowers and taxpayers. Nothing in this 
     language should be interpreted as otherwise preventing the 
     Department from modernizing the student loan servicing 
     process, or the student and borrower experience; or improving 
     the current performance-based student loan allocation process 
     to strengthen incentives for servicers to provide high-
     quality service to borrowers.
       The Department is directed to provide pursuant to the 
     quarterly obligation plans reporting instructions in Senate 
     Report 115-150 the following additional information: 
     performance metrics, total loan volume, and number of 
     accounts broken out by servicer and for each private 
     collection agency. Further, the Department is directed to 
     provide the requested briefing on the benefits for 
     servicemembers and veterans directive in Senate Report 115-
     150 within 30 days of enactment of this Act.


                             HIGHER EDUCATION

       Cybersecurity Education.--The growing presence of 
     cybersecurity threats continues to highlight the need for 
     quality cybersecurity education programs. The efforts of the 
     nation's community colleges to expand cybersecurity education 
     in lower-income student populations is commendable and 
     important, but often those schools lack the resources to 
     maintain state of the art programs. To address these needs, 
     the agreement includes $1,000,000 for the Department of 
     Education to establish a pilot grant program to support 
     technological upgrades for community colleges for the purpose 
     of supporting cybersecurity programs.
       Federal TRIO Programs.--The agreement reiterates the 
     language in Senate Report 115-150 regarding reviewing fiscal 
     year 2017 applications with minor technical issues. Further, 
     the agreement clarifies that minor technical issues includes 
     applications with minor budget issues, and adds that the 
     review should include applications under all fiscal year 2017 
     TRIO competitions.
       GEAR UP.--The Department is directed to announce Notices 
     Inviting Applications for New Awards for State Grants and 
     Partnership Grants in the Federal Register. In such notice 
     for State grants, the Department is directed to uphold the 
     long-standing guidance that States may only administer one 
     active State GEAR UP grant at a time. The Secretary is 
     directed to provide written guidance in the Federal Register 
     notifying applicants that only States without an active State 
     GEAR UP grant, or States that have an active State GEAR UP 
     grant that is scheduled to end prior to October 1, 2018, will 
     be eligible to receive a new State GEAR UP award funded in 
     whole or in part by this appropriation.
       Open Textbooks Pilot.--The agreement includes $5,000,000 
     for a pilot, competitive grant program to support projects at 
     institutions of higher education that create new open 
     textbooks or expand their use in order to achieve savings for 
     students while maintaining or improving instruction and 
     student learning outcomes. The Secretary shall require that 
     any open textbook created with program funds be licensed 
     under a nonexclusive, irrevocable license to the public to 
     exercise any of the rights under copyright conditioned only 
     on the requirement that attribution be given as directed by 
     the copyright owner. Further, the Secretary should give 
     special consideration to projects at institutions of higher 
     education that demonstrate the greatest potential to achieve 
     the highest level of savings for students through 
     sustainable, expanded use of open textbooks in postsecondary 
     courses offered by the eligible entity and expand the use of 
     open textbooks at institutions of higher education outside of 
     the eligible entity.

      Historically Black College and University Capital Financing 
                                Program

       The agreement includes new funding and provisions related 
     to the deferment of outstanding loans for private 
     historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). It also 
     includes a new provision regarding an outreach plan to help 
     additional public HBCUs participate in the program.

                        Departmental Management

       Reorganization Plans.--The Department is directed to 
     provide detailed information on any plans to reform or 
     reorganize the Department to the Committees on Appropriations 
     of the House of Representatives and Senate prior to beginning 
     implementing any such plans. There remains concern that 
     adequate information about and justification for its 
     reorganization have not been transparently shared with 
     Congress and stakeholders to be able to evaluate the changes 
     being proposed, including the potential benefits or existing 
     challenges they are meant to address.
       Of particular concern is any attempt to reorganize or alter 
     the current structure of the Budget Service office. The 
     Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives 
     and the Senate rely on the quality and professional expertise 
     of this office and are deeply concerned about proposed 
     changes to its structure. Therefore, a provision is included 
     in the agreement which would not allow funding to be used for 
     the purpose of reorganizing or decentralizing the office.
       The Budget Service office shall continue to have lead 
     responsibility for: (1) developing and implementing the 
     Department's budget; (2) formulating budget and related 
     legislative policies for Department programs; (3) presenting 
     the Department's budget and related policy proposals to the 
     public and Congress; (4) establishing and maintaining a 
     Department-wide performance-based budget formulation, 
     execution, and management system; and (5) reviewing and 
     analyzing Department program operations, including budget and 
     policy implementation. The Budget Service office shall also 
     continue to play a prominent role in reviewing, analyzing and 
     estimating costs of regulations, analyzing policy, and 
     overseeing the Department's management of its programs and 
     administrative resources. There is strong concern that a 
     decentralization of these functions will create 
     inefficiencies.
       Borrower Defense Claims Reporting.--The Department is 
     directed to provide quarterly reports pursuant to the 
     borrower defense claims reporting instructions in Senate 
     Report 115-150 that also include the following additional 
     information: the total and median dollar amount of 
     outstanding debt from borrowers prior to discharge, the 
     percentage of

[[Page H2707]]

     the total approved claims receiving partial relief, and the 
     median student loan debt remaining as part of claims 
     receiving partial relief.
       Office for Civil Rights.--The agreement includes 
     $117,000,000 for the Office for Civil Rights (OCR). The OCR 
     is directed in fiscal year 2018 to use this appropriation to 
     increase its level of full time equivalent employment in 
     order to effectively and timely investigate complaints; 
     execute and report on the civil rights data collection; 
     thoroughly monitor corrective actions of institutions and 
     meet other critical workloads. Further, OCR is directed to 
     maintain its 12 regional offices consistent with the 
     organizational structure described in its fiscal year 2018 
     and 2019 Justification of Appropriation Estimates to the 
     Congress.

                           General Provisions

       The agreement includes a new general provision to exempt 
     the Magnet Schools program from one long-standing general 
     provision on transporting students. ESSA reauthorized the 
     Magnet School program in 2015 and allowed funds to be used 
     for transportation and this agreement should not impede the 
     Magnet School program from doing so. The agreement notes that 
     the Committees on Appropriations of the House of 
     Representatives and the Senate should consider a longer term 
     solution to this issue during the fiscal year 2019 
     appropriations process.
       The agreement modifies a provision rescinding unobligated 
     balances available for the Pell Grant program to offset the 
     mandatory costs of increasing the maximum award.
       The agreement includes a new provision to address a 
     drafting error related to the reauthorization of the Impact 
     Aid program.
       The agreement includes a new provision clarifying 
     availability of hurricane relief funding.
       The agreement includes a new provision to clarify current 
     law and allow for the continued sharing of financial data to 
     scholarship granting organizations.
       The agreement includes a new provision modifying existing 
     authority relating to cohort default rates for a period of 
     two years.
       The agreement includes a new provision related to public 
     service loan forgiveness.
       The agreement includes a new provision regarding Pell 
     eligibility for children of first responders who have died in 
     the line of duty.

                       TITLE IV--RELATED AGENCIES

         Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS)

       Innovation, Demonstration, and Other Activities.--The 
     agreement includes $7,600,000 for innovation, demonstration,

                       Railroad Retirement Board

       The agreement includes $10,000,000 for the implementation 
     of information technology systems modernization efforts. 
     Within 180 days of enactment of this Act, the Railroad 
     Retirement Board is directed to submit a comprehensive update 
     to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of 
     Representatives and the Senate on: project status, timelines 
     to completion, and total cost of development.

                  Social Security Administration (SSA)


                  LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

       Administrative Funding.--The agreement provides an increase 
     of $480,000,000 for administrative expenses. Of this amount, 
     bill language directs $280,000,000 to support SSA's 
     information technology modernization initiative and directs 
     $100,000,000, with extended availability, for processing the 
     backlog of disability hearings within the Office of Hearings 
     Operations.
       Capability Determination Process Improvements.--The 
     agreement notes the importance of SSA accurately evaluating 
     an individual's ability to manage--or direct the management 
     of--his or her Social Security benefits. However, a 2016 
     study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and 
     Medicine, entitled Informing Social Security's Process for 
     Financial Capability Determination, raised concerns about 
     SSA's capability determination process, and a 2015 internal 
     SSA report found that most capability determination decisions 
     are not adequately developed or documented. The agreement is 
     encouraged by the steps SSA is taking to improve its 
     capability determination process and requests a report not 
     later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act on SSA's 
     plans to evaluate the effects of these changes.
       Disability Case Processing System (DCPS).--The agreement 
     supports efforts to modernize the case processing systems 
     used by State Disability Determination Service agencies, 
     including the DCPS. The SSA is directed to take the necessary 
     actions that would permit States the ability to select from 
     all available options in the modernization of their case 
     processing systems, so long as the selected option has 
     similar or better functionality as DCPS without imposing 
     costs that are higher than using DCPS. Such process must be 
     in conformance with all Federal procurement rules and 
     information technology security requirements. The agreement 
     requests a detailed analysis in the fiscal year 2020 
     Congressional Justification on the actions SSA has taken to 
     implement this request. The analysis should include a 
     detailed description of any challenges or legal barriers to 
     implementing any option to modernize the disability case 
     processing system.
       Field Offices.--The agreement is concerned that SSA may be 
     reducing resources for field offices and expects SSA to 
     continue to support frontline operations. In fiscal year 
     2017, SSA field offices served approximately 42 million 
     visitors, a five percent increase over fiscal year 2015. The 
     high volume of visitors, combined with factors such as 
     complex workloads, shortened public operating hours, and 
     staff shortages, have led to increased wait times in both 
     field offices and the National 800 number. SSA is directed to 
     submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations of the 
     House of Representatives and the Senate within 90 days of 
     enactment of this Act outlining its plan for ensuring that 
     field offices, hearing offices, processing centers, and 
     teleservice centers are receiving sufficient resources to 
     maintain at least the current level of constituent services.
       Field Office Closures.--There is significant concern about 
     decisions to close field offices that may not be in 
     accordance with law, regulations, and SSA procedures. These 
     critical decisions must comply with Federal law, regulations, 
     and procedures to account for the impact such actions will 
     have on the community. The agreement notes that SSA's 
     Inspector General (IG) is reviewing decisions to close field 
     offices, including whether SSA followed internal procedures 
     in proposing consolidation, notifying the public, and 
     considering feedback from public input. While the IG review 
     is ongoing, the Acting Commissioner should not make any final 
     decisions related to field office locations under review. 
     Further, the agreement encourages SSA to carefully consider 
     and fully implement any IG recommendations that may result 
     from such review.
       Report on Compassionate Allowances.--The agreement is 
     concerned about SSA's process for identifying Compassionate 
     Allowance (CAL) conditions. The GAO issued a report entitled 
     SSA's Compassionate Allowance Initiative (GAO-17-625), which 
     found that SSA did not have a formal or systematic approach 
     for designating certain medical conditions for the CAL 
     initiative. The agreement directs SSA to submit a report not 
     later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act describing 
     the steps that SSA is taking to identify and evaluate new CAL 
     conditions and to improve the overall management of the 
     process, including the regular review and use of available 
     data to assess the accuracy and consistency of CAL decision-
     making.
       Representative Payee Program.--The agreement recognizes the 
     importance of providing oversight of the individuals and 
     organizations serving as representative payees and that the 
     current oversight structure needs improvement. The agreement 
     supports efforts to institute a new, stronger system of 
     oversight through the Federal-State Protection and Advocacy 
     system. The SSA's current contractor has consistently 
     underperformed and is not on track to meet the terms of the 
     contract. In light of the concerns about the existing 
     vendor's performance, the agreement believes it would be 
     inappropriate for SSA to extend its current contract beyond 
     its July 31, 2018 expiration date. Given continued concern 
     over the administration of the program, SSA should expect 
     further Congressional oversight of this situation throughout 
     the coming year.
       Ticket to Work Program.--The agreement recognizes that the 
     purpose of the Ticket to Work Program is to provide the 
     assistance disabled beneficiaries need to return to work. The 
     agreement notes that a number of evaluations have been done 
     on the Ticket to Work Program, including a 2016 SSA IG Report 
     entitled ``The Ticket to Work Program'' (A-02-17-50203) and 
     independent evaluations by Mathematica Policy Research. In 
     lieu of language in Senate Report 115-150, the agreement 
     directs GAO to submit a report to the Committees on 
     Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the 
     Senate, the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of 
     Representatives, and the Committee on Finance of the Senate, 
     and to make such report publicly available. The report shall 
     address the following: the annual benefit savings associated 
     with Tickets in use, the annual cost associated with the 
     Ticket to Work Program (in excess of those that would be made 
     under the SSA's traditional cost-reimbursement to vocational 
     rehabilitation agencies, if the Ticket to Work program did 
     not exist), how these costs and savings compare over time, 
     and whether the Ticket to Work Program has led to increased 
     earnings for beneficiaries and, if it is not possible to make 
     such a determination, the options for a demonstration or 
     study that would be necessary to make such a determination on 
     earnings. Finally, GAO is directed to include any benefits 
     from the Ticket to Work Program that are not captured by the 
     above cost-savings analysis, whether those benefits are 
     quantifiable, and to incorporate the views of beneficiary 
     representatives and other stakeholders in this aspect of the 
     report.
       Vocational Experts.--The agreement notes that the Office of 
     Hearing Operations (OHO) is developing a solicitation for a 
     market-

[[Page H2708]]

     based approach to acquiring contractors to provide vocational 
     expert testimony. Prior to issuing a solicitation, the 
     agreement requests a report on the market research used to 
     assess the fair and reasonable rate for vocational experts. 
     The report shall also include an assessment of how the 
     market-based approach taken by SSA will ensure vocational 
     experts contracted under the new procurement will have the 
     training and experience to demonstrate a thorough 
     understanding of the impact of impairments on functional 
     abilities, labor market needs, and job placement strategies. 
     The report should also include SSA's process for measuring 
     contractor performance and contractor adherence to 
     requirements on vocational expert qualifications.
       Work Incentives Planning and Assistance (WIPA) and 
     Protection and Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social Security 
     (PABSS). The agreement includes $23,000,000 for WIPA and 
     $7,000,000 for PABSS.

        DIVISION I--LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018

       The following is an explanation of the effects of Division 
     I, which makes appropriations for the Legislative Branch for 
     fiscal year 2018. Unless otherwise noted, reference to the 
     House and Senate reports are to House Report 115-199 and 
     Senate Report 115-137. The language included in these reports 
     should be complied with and carry the same emphasis as the 
     language included in the explanatory statement, unless 
     specifically addressed to the contrary in this explanatory 
     statement. While repeating some report language for emphasis, 
     this explanatory statement does not intend to negate the 
     language referred to above unless expressly provided herein.
       Security: This agreement provides additional resources to 
     the United States Capitol Police and the Sergeants at Arms of 
     both chambers to enhance security for Members of Congress, 
     their staff, and office visitors. Over the past year there 
     have been humbling reminders of the threats Members of 
     Congress and their staff face as public servants. The 
     Congressional community has also been reminded of the heroic 
     capabilities of the men and women of the United States 
     Capitol Police. There is no higher priority in this agreement 
     than providing adequate resources for the physical security 
     of Members and their staff as well as constituents and 
     visitors to the Capitol campus.
       Reprogramming Guidelines: It is expected that all agencies 
     notify the Committees on Appropriations of the House and the 
     Senate of any significant departures from budget plans 
     presented to the Committees in any agency's budget 
     justifications. In particular, agencies funded through this 
     bill are required to notify the Committees prior to each 
     reprogramming of funds in excess of the lesser of 10 percent 
     or $750,000 between programs, projects or activities, or in 
     excess of $750,000 between object classifications (except for 
     shifts within the pay categories, object class 11, 12, and 13 
     or as further specified in each agency's respective section). 
     This includes cumulative reprogrammings that together total 
     at least $750,000 from or to a particular program, activity, 
     or object classification as well as reprogramming FTEs or 
     funds to create new organizational entities within the agency 
     or to restructure entities which already exist. The 
     Committees desire to be notified of reprogramming actions 
     which involve less than the above-mentioned amounts if such 
     actions would have the effect of changing an agency's funding 
     requirements in future years or if programs or projects 
     specifically cited in the Committee's reports are affected.
       Inspectors General Budgets: It is important to ensure 
     independence between Legislative Branch Inspectors General 
     (IG) and their respective reporting agencies. Agencies are 
     directed to include a separate section in their respective 
     future budget justifications reflecting a detailed budget 
     request for the agency's IG Office. Additionally, each IG is 
     directed to keep the Committees on Appropriations of the 
     House and Senate fully apprised of its funding needs, and 
     each agency shall not interfere with, or require approval 
     for, such communications.

                                TITLE I

                                 SENATE

       The agreement includes $919,931,581 for Senate operations. 
     This item relates solely to the Senate, and is in accordance 
     with long practice under which each body determines its own 
     housekeeping requirements and the other concurs without 
     intervention.
       The requirements of the report requested pursuant to S. 
     Rept. 106-304 related to Senate collections is also requested 
     to include, for all appropriated amounts, the balance of 
     funds, the amount of prudent reserves, and the status, 
     timeline, and cost expectations of future projects.
       The Secretary of the Senate shall determine the allocations 
     of the Offices under the Senators' Official Personnel and 
     Office Expense Account for fiscal year 2018 by updating the 
     amounts provided under Public Law 111-68 to reflect any 
     applicable adjustments under Public Law 92-607, Public Law 
     95-94, and Public Law 90-57.


                       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

       The agreement provides for unspent amounts remaining in 
     Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account to be 
     used for deficit or debt reduction and authority for transfer 
     of funds, exempts the Senate from the requirements of 41 
     U.S.C. 6101, and provides a technical change to the Student 
     Loan Program.

                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

       The agreement includes $1,200,000,766 for House operations. 
     This item relates solely to the House, and is in accordance 
     with long practice under which each body determines its own 
     housekeeping requirements and the other concurs without 
     intervention.
       Workplace Rights: This agreement provides $5,000,000 to the 
     CAO for workplace rights initiatives. The funds will support 
     mandatory training requirements for all Members and staff 
     included in House Resolution 630, as well as the 
     establishment of the Office of Employee Advocacy created in 
     House Resolution 724. Mandatory training is an important 
     first step to ensure that every Member, staff, intern, fellow 
     and detailee is fully aware of the laws that apply to them 
     and their right to a harassment-free workplace under the 
     Congressional Accountability Act. The Office of Employee 
     Advocacy will provide House employees with immediate access 
     to a dedicated advocate who will provide legal consultation, 
     representation, and assistance on allegations, claims, and 
     complaints under the Congressional Accountability Act in 
     proceedings before the Office of Compliance and Committee on 
     Ethics.
       House Wellness Program: This agreement provides $380,000 
     for the establishment of a comprehensive House wellness 
     program.
       Internships: The Committee believes that House internships 
     should be available to the broadest possible pool of 
     candidates who have the ability and interest to serve. The 
     Committee intends to seek information on the extent to which 
     paid internships could expand the pool of candidates and how 
     such expansion might be implemented to the benefit of Member 
     and Committee offices and their constituents.
       House Child Care Center Expansion: This agreement provides 
     $12,000,000 for the second phase of the House Child Care 
     Center expansion. While expanding the center which will 
     reduce the lengthy waitlist and create more opportunities for 
     families to utilize the facility, it also provides an 
     opportunity to examine and evaluate the operations of the 
     Center. The CAO is encouraged to work with the House Child 
     Care Center Advisory Board in evaluating current operations 
     and with the expectation any recommendations be implemented 
     in conjunction with the full physical expansion of the 
     Center.
       Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission: The Tom Lantos Human 
     Rights Commission established in 2008 is charged with 
     promoting, defending and advocating for international human 
     rights. The Commission undertakes public education 
     activities, provides expert human rights advice and 
     encourages Members of Congress to actively engage in human 
     rights matters. After considering testimony from the co-
     chairs of the Commission an additional $200,000 has been made 
     available to the House Foreign Affairs Committee in order to 
     provide additional support for the Commission's work.


                       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

       The agreement provides for unspent amounts remaining in 
     Members' Representational Allowances account to be used for 
     deficit or debt reduction; prohibits the delivery of bills 
     and resolutions; prohibits the delivery of printed copies of 
     the Congressional Record; places a limitation on amount

     disbursements, daily calendars, and the Congressional 
     Pictorial Directory; amends the House Services Revolving 
     Fund, and repurposes unexpended funds.

                        Joint Economic Committee

       The agreement includes $4,203,000 for salaries and 
     expenses.

                      Joint Committee on Taxation

       The agreement includes $11,169,000 for salaries and

             Office of Congressional Accessibility Services


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

       The agreement includes $1,444,000 for salaries and 
     expenses.

                             Capitol Police


                                SALARIES

       The agreement includes $351,700,000 for salaries of the 
     Capitol Police. The increase includes necessary half year 
     funds to hire the required officers to staff garage security 
     and additional pre-screeners; half year funding for 48 
     civilians that will civilianize positions currently staffed 
     by sworn officers to allow the department to better utilize 
     the 48 sworn officers. The total staffing level is expected 
     to be approximately 1,943 sworn and 420 civilian staff. No 
     more than $45,000,000 is recommended for overtime in fiscal 
     year 2018, which includes funds to support the staffing of 
     the Thomas P. O'Neill House Office Building. This provides 
     for approximately 702,280 hours of additional duty.
       Security: The agreement includes $7,500,000 to enhance 
     Member protection, including funds for increased training, 
     equipment and technology-related support items. The men and 
     women of the Capitol Police have an increasingly difficult 
     mission of protecting Members of Congress and the overall 
     Capitol complex. Their mission can, at times, put them in 
     harm's way. Ensuring these officers have the best tools and 
     resources to carry out their duties is of the upmost 
     importance to Congress.
       Use of Grounds: Congress understands the need to maintain 
     safety and order on the Capitol grounds and the Capitol 
     Police is commended for their efforts. Given the family-style 
     neighborhood that the Capitol shares with the surrounding 
     community the Committee continues to instruct the Capitol 
     Police to forebear enforcement of 2 U.S.C. 1963 (``an act to 
     protect the public property, turf, and grass of the Capitol 
     Grounds from injury'') and the Traffic Regulations for the 
     United States Capitol Grounds when encountering snow sledders 
     on the grounds.
       USCP Office of Inspector General: The agreement includes 
     funds to support not less than six FTEs within the USCP 
     Office of Inspector General.


                            GENERAL EXPENSES

       The agreement includes $74,800,000 for general expenses of 
     the Capitol Police.

                          Office of Compliance


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

       The agreement includes $4,959,000 for salaries and 
     expenses. An increase of $1,000,000 is

[[Page H2785]]

     provided for training and information technology 
     enhancements.
       Reform: Ensuring and protecting workplace rights of 
     employees is imperative and the funds provided in this act 
     support that effort. Processes to protect workplace rights 
     have been in place for many years but they are not perfect. 
     As Congress considers changes to the Congressional 
     Accountability Act of 1995, which will impact the Office of 
     Compliance's operations, there is a need to strengthen the 
     agency's overall capacity, including the quality of its 
     training and information technology processes.

                      Congressional Budget Office


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

       The agreement includes $49,945,000 for salaries and 
     expenses.
       Transparency: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) 
     provides timely, nonpartisan budgetary and economic analysis 
     to support the work of the Congress and its reports and 
     analysis can have far reaching policy implications. The 
     Congress expects CBO to ensure a high level of transparency, 
     while also recognizing the importance of maintaining the 
     agency's professional independence and respecting its 
     analytical processes. There is support for the work that CBO 
     has done in the area of transparency thus far as well as 
     support for the agency's goals to continue to clearly present 
     and explain the methodology and results of CBO's analysis 
     while pursuing opportunities to further enhance transparency. 
     This includes exploring ways to make more supporting 
     documents publicly available for methods used in analysis, 
     cost estimates, and forecasts.


                        ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION

       This agreement provides contract parity with the Executive 
     Branch.

                        Architect of the Capitol

       The agreement includes $712,105,000 for the activities of 
     the Architect of the Capitol (AOC).
       Office of Inspector General: The AOC IG must maintain a 
     staffing level commensurate with the scale of AOC's vast 
     portfolio of operations, construction, and contract 
     oversight. Within funds provided, the AOC IG is directed to 
     employ not fewer than 14 full-time equivalent positions 
     during fiscal year 2018. The AOC is directed to ensure that 
     sufficient funding is available for contracts and other 
     expenses identified by the AOC IG to fulfill its mission.
       Custodial Services: The AOC is directed to study the 
     feasibility of consolidating custodial services for all AOC 
     jurisdictions across the Capitol Campus and geographically 
     separated facilities to include leased buildings. The 
     elements of this study should include opportunities and cost 
     savings derived from a shared contract approach within the 
     existing AOC custodial service(s) approaches using in-house 
     operations and/or contractors. The consolidation of future 
     custodial services with the current maintenance and repair 
     services provided by the AOC should support the desired 
     outcome of sustaining and preserving the historic fabric as 
     well as the building materials and architectural 
     accouterments through industry standard cleaning practices 
     that will also reduce the life cycle costs for maintenance 
     and repair for the AOC. The results of this study should be 
     delivered to the Committees on Appropriations of the House 
     and Senate within 180 days of enactment.

       Urban Agriculture: This agreement includes $400,000 for the 
     Botanic Garden to expand its urban agriculture education and 
     outreach programs including a feasibility study and pilot 
     project for a joint outreach program between the Botanic 
     Garden and urban local public gardens that engages citizens 
     in food-insecure, undernourished communities in the 
     production of nutrition-rich, healthy foods, and which 
     includes educational, job training, and therapeutic 
     horticultural and agricultural components.


                         CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER

                          library of congress

                         salaries and expenses

       The agreement includes $470,667,000 in direct 
     appropriations and authority to spend receipts of $6,350,000.
       This amount includes $9,494,000 for Enterprise Investment 
     in Information Technology Modernization, $297,000 for Office 
     of Inspector General Expanded Information Technology Audit 
     Capabilities, $2,349,000 for the Veterans History Project and 
     $8,653,000 for the Teaching with Primary Sources program. The 
     increased funding in the agreement provides requested funding 
     for maintaining the workforce, information technology, and 
     custodial services.
       Thomas Jefferson Building Experience: The recently revealed 
     Visitor Experience Plan for the Library of Congress' Thomas 
     Jefferson Building is an initiative that has support in 
     Congress. The proposed concept will enhance the Library's 
     ability to bring the nation's collections and history out of 
     the vaults and into public spaces. With enhancements to 
     exhibition spaces and development of learning centers, the 
     Library can maximize the experience for its nearly two 
     million annual visitors. The proposed funding for this 
     initiative involves a public/private partnership, which has 
     been a successful strategy for many similar institutions' 
     efforts to showcase our nation's treasures. This agreement 
     includes a total of $10,000,000, for enhancements to the 
     public exhibits and visitor services at the Library. Of that 
     amount, $2,000,000 is immediately available until September 
     30, 2020 to begin planning, including developing a detailed 
     budget justification. The budget justification shall provide 
     the following: 1) An overall acquisition plan with project 
     timelines; 2) Direct and indirect cost estimates developed in 
     conjunction with the Architect of the Capitol; 3) Projected 
     financial impact of this capital project on the Library's 
     operating budget; 4) Total cost estimates for: design 
     services; construction; construction management services; 
     project management services; and a contingency allowance. The 
     plan should also ensure consideration of historic 
     preservation. The remaining $8,000,000 will become available 
     only upon written approval by the Chair and Ranking Member of 
     the Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch of the Committee 
     on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and by the 
     Chair and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on the 
     Legislative Branch of the Committee on Appropriations of the 
     Senate, following review of the project's budget 
     justification and cost estimate. It is expected that the 
     Library provide to the Committees on Appropriations of the 
     House and Senate a budget justification that is comprehensive 
     in nature and includes elements consistent with other project 
     justifications in the past, prior to consideration of future 
     funding requests for this project.
       Memoranda of Understanding (MOU): The Library of Congress 
     maintains several agreements with other Legislative Branch 
     agencies to provide a range of support services. It is 
     important that the Library works to ensure that the service 
     level agreements within the MOUs are fully met.
       Preservation: The agreement defers to the Senate report 
     language.
       National Film and Sound Recording Preservation Programs: 
     The agreement incorporates language in Senate Report 115-137 
     related to the Library's National Film and Sound Recording 
     Preservation Programs, and it is expected that the Library 
     will provide full support to these programs.


                            COPYRIGHT OFFICE

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

       The agreement includes $28,446,000 in direct appropriations 
     to the Copyright Office which fully funds the agency's 
     amended request. An additional $41,305,000 is made available 
     from receipts for salaries and expenses and $2,260,000 is 
     available from prior year unobligated balances.
       Modernization: Modernizing the Copyright Office and 
     bringing its processes into the 21st Century has wide-spread 
     support within Congress, and this act provides funds to 
     further that effort. To date, the collaboration between the 
     Copyright Office and the Library's Office of Chief 
     Information Officer on modernization efforts has been 
     promising. That collaboration is expected to continue, while 
     allowing for mission-specific modernization requirements to 
     be defined by the Copyright Office. As with many information 
     technology (IT) projects there are many phases, some forward 
     facing, some not. Much of the IT modernization work to date 
     has been behind the scenes building a strong foundation for 
     the long-term IT modernization strategy. However, there is an 
     expectation that external Copyright users will begin to see 
     and benefit from the progress being made. As new modernized 
     processes are rolled out it is important to solicit feedback 
     from the external Copyright community and to consider that 
     feedback with efforts moving forward.


                     CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

       The agreement includes $119,279,000 for salaries and 
     expenses.
       Public Access to CRS Reports: The bill includes a provision 
     directing the Library of Congress's Congressional Research 
     Service (CRS) to make available to the public all non-
     confidential CRS products on a website operated and 
     maintained by the Library of Congress. Non-confidential CRS 
     products include any written CRS products containing research 
     or analysis that are currently available for general 
     congressional access on the CRS Congressional Intranet, or 
     that would be made available on the CRS Congressional 
     Intranet in the normal course of business. Non-confidential 
     CRS reports do not include material prepared in response to 
     Congressional requests for confidential analysis or research. 
     The published products are to be made available in a standard 
     format, such as PDF.
       CRS reports are funded by taxpayers and should be made 
     available to citizens, schools and libraries across the 
     country. Ensuring these products are made publicly available 
     is in keeping with the Committees' priority of full 
     transparency to the American people; however, CRS is not 
     expected or directed to respond to requests from the public, 
     and its core mission will continue to be to provide support 
     to the Congress. Within 60 days of enactment of this act CRS, 
     in consultation with the Library of Congress, shall provide 
     to the relevant oversight Committees, including the House and 
     Senate Appropriations Committees, a plan for making these 
     reports available by the end of Fiscal Year 2018, as well as 
     any associated cost estimates.
       Congressional Research Service Modernization: Included in 
     the agreement is $4,000,000 to begin modernization of CRS's 
     mission-specific information systems to increase efficiency 
     of the office while protecting confidentiality of 
     congressional data.
       Supporting Areas of High Congressional Demand: The 
     agreement includes $753,000 for eight additional support 
     staff to handle routine requests, allowing senior staff to 
     focus on more highly analytical research.


             BOOKS FOR THE BLIND AND PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

       The agreement includes $51,498,000 for salaries and 
     expenses.
       National Library Service: The National Library Service for 
     the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) has been 
     headquartered for over 50 years in a privately leased 
     building in Northwest, Washington, D.C. which is in need of 
     substantial renovations to meet program requirements. Library 
     of Congress and NLS leadership have expressed a desire to 
     move the headquarters closer to the Library's main campus. 
     NLS believes being in closer proximity to the Library will 
     improve management efficiencies by integrating into existing 
     Library infrastructure, reduce support service costs, reduce 
     lease costs, and enhance various program synergies. Available 
     office space exists at the Government Publishing Office (GPO) 
     to meet NLS's needs. NLS, GPO, and the Architect of the 
     Capitol are directed to study the feasibility of this move 
     and provide cost estimates to their committees of oversight.


                       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

       The agreement includes provisions regarding reimbursable 
     and revolving funds, updates to revolving fund returns to 
     allow the Library of Congress to accept fees for services 
     currently provided, allowing the Library of Congress to 
     accept gifts of goods and services, providing coverage for 
     Library of Congress employees under the Congressional 
     Accountability Act, and providing equal access to non-
     confidential Congressional Research Service products.


                      GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE

                        CONGRESSIONAL PUBLISHING

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

       The agreement includes $79,528,000 for authorized 
     publishing, printing and binding for the Congress.


     PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAMS OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF DOCUMENTS

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

       The agreement includes $29,000,000.


                      GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE

                   BUSINESS OPERATIONS REVOLVING FUND

       The agreement includes $8,540,000.


                    GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

       The agreement includes $578,916,653 in direct 
     appropriations for salaries and expenses of the Government 
     Accountability Office (GAO). In addition, $23,800,000 is 
     available from offsetting collections. The agreement provides 
     $6,000,000 for information technology projects and $4,000,000 
     for facility management and services projects. The agreement 
     also provides for statutory authority related to property 
     management.
       Inspector General Reports: With the creation of 
     Oversight.gov, which compiles non-confidential Inspector 
     General (IG) reports from agencies across the Federal 
     Government, the agreement no longer requires the report 
     requested in Senate Report 115-137 and House Report 115-199 
     for GAO to examine the availability of such reports by 
     individual IG offices.


                OPEN WORLD LEADERSHIP CENTER TRUST FUND

       The agreement includes $5,600,000.

     J, which makes appropriations for Military Construction, 
     Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies for fiscal year 2018. 
     Unless otherwise noted, reference to the House and Senate 
     reports are to House Report 115-188 and Senate Report 115-
     130. The language set forth in House Report 115-188 and 
     Senate Report 115-130 should be complied with and carry the 
     same emphasis as the language included in the joint 
     explanatory statement, unless specifically addressed to the 
     contrary in this joint explanatory statement. While repeating 
     some report language for emphasis, this joint explanatory 
     statement does not intend to negate the language referred to 
     above unless expressly provided herein. In cases in which the 
     House or the Senate has directed the submission of a report, 
     such report is to be submitted to both Houses of Congress. 
     House or Senate reporting requirements with deadlines prior 
     to, or within 15 days after enactment of this Act shall be 
     submitted no later than 60 days after enactment of this Act. 
     All other reporting deadlines not specifically directed by 
     this joint explanatory statement are to be met.

                                TITLE I

                         DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

       Bid Savings.--Cost variation notices required by 10 U.S.C. 
     2853 continue to demonstrate the Department of Defense 
     continues to have bid savings on previously appropriated 
     military construction projects. Therefore, the agreement 
     includes rescissions to the NATO Security Investment Program 
     and Army Family Housing Construction accounts. The Secretary 
     of Defense is directed to continue to submit 1002 reports on 
     military construction bid savings at the end of each fiscal 
     quarter to the Committees.
       Naval Shipyard Modernization.--On February 12, 2018 the 
     Secretary of the Navy transmitted a Shipyard Infrastructure 
     Optimization Plan as directed by Senate Report 115-130 
     accompanying the fiscal year 2018 Military Construction, 
     Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. 
     The report seeks to, among other requirements, assess 
     existing facilities for efficiencies and address future 
     infrastructure requirements at public shipyards and includes 
     a master plan for each shipyard, including, but not limited 
     to, capital equipment and facility investment requirements. 
     These first steps taken by the Department of the Navy to 
     identify gaps are important and the Secretary of the Navy is 
     urged to adequately prioritize public shipyard 
     infrastructure, in particular dry dock and shore 
     infrastructure needs to support critical maintenance of 
     surface and submarine fleets.
       Coastal Erosion and Sea-Level Rise.--Sea level rise and 
     flooding on facilities, particularly at DOD's coastal 
     military installations, both in the United States and 
     overseas continue to have harmful impacts. In a report to 
     Congress in January 2018 regarding the security implications 
     of climate-related risks, the Department noted it had 
     conducted a preliminary screening-level assessment to 
     determine installation vulnerabilities to climate-related 
     security risks with the goal of identifying serious 
     vulnerabilities and developing necessary adaptation 
     strategies. The report identified numerous installations that 
     experienced climate-related effects affecting, among others, 
     airfield operations, transportation, and energy 
     infrastructure, as well as training facilities. However, the 
     Department has not developed a comprehensive adaptation 
     approach, nor has it provided estimated costs associated with 
     implementing such a strategy. Therefore, the Comptroller 
     General is directed to undertake a study of DOD's progress in 
     developing a means to account for potentially damaging 
     weather in project design, and to report to the Committees on 
     Appropriations of both Houses of Congress no later than 180 
     days after enactment of this Act. At a minimum, the 
     Comptroller General should answer the following questions: 
     (1) What is known about the historical and projected costs 
     for facilities maintenance and repair beyond expected repair 
     costs of DOD infrastructure stemming from damage or 
     degradation caused by sea level rise and weather effects 
     associated with climate change; (2) What best practices has 
     DOD adopted for incorporating climate change adaptation into 
     the design of military construction or facilities 
     sustainment, restoration, or modernization projects; and (3) 
     To what extent has DOD developed a systematic process for 
     ensuring climate change or severe weather effects are 
     accounted for in the design of military construction and 
     facilities sustainment, modernization, or restoration 
     projects.


                      MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, ARMY

       The agreement provides $923,994,000 for Military 
     Construction, Army. Within this amount, the agreement 
     provides $101,470,000 for study, planning, design, architect 
     and engineer services, and host nation support. The agreement 
     also provides an additional $10,000,000 to supplement 
     unspecified minor military construction.
       Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant.--The U.S. Army is 
     currently managing the environmental remediation of the 
     Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant (SFAAP) property in excess of 
     9,000 acres in DeSoto, Kansas, which was conveyed to 
     Sunflower Redevelopment, LLC (SRL) through the Army and the 
     General Services Administration on August 3, 2005. Ten years 
     after the conveyance, on October 29, 2015, the Army 
     reinforced its responsibility in writing, ``the Army is 
     committed to programming the necessary resources to carry out 
     a long-term clean-up and has, for execution in fiscal year 
     2016, awarded several services contracts for the short-term 
     requirements.'' The Army further wrote it would ``issue 
     competitively sourced clean-up contracts, with Army oversight 
     to ensure its Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
     Compensation, and Liabilities Act (CERCLA) Sec. 120(h) 
     obligation at Sunflower.'' The Army confirmed its intention 
     ``to conduct in-depth coordination with Sunflower 
     Redevelopment, LLC (SRL) to ensure SRL's redevelopment 
     priorities are synchronized with the Army managed clean-up 
     activities.'' However, the Army has neglected to communicate 
     regularly with SRL and far less than the in-depth 
     coordination commitment made by the Army. The Army is 
     conducting ongoing risk assessments of contaminated portions 
     of SFAAP and is directed to work in consultation and 
     coordination with SRL to ensure transparency. The findings 
     and recommendations of such assessments should receive 
     approval from State and Federal regulators regarding 
     allowable levels of contaminants including, but not limited 
     to, pesticides, asbestos or other contaminants subject to 
     remediation for commercial use of the property. The Secretary 
     of the Army is directed to deliver the assessment and brief 
     the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress 
     on its findings and to provide a plan that ensures SRL's 
     redevelopment priorities are synchronized with Army managed 
     cleanup activities.
       Badger Army Ammunition Plant.--In 2011, an Army Feasibility 
     Study concluded that an offsite drinking water treatment 
     system was needed as part of a comprehensive groundwater 
     cleanup remedy for the former Badger Army Ammunition Plant 
     (BAAP). Accordingly, in 2015, the Town of Merrimac, 
     Wisconsin, designed and approved a sanitation district 
     required by the Army to support such a system, and as 
     recently as May 2016, the Army noted in writing that ``design 
     of the municipal drinking water system has been initiated.'' 
     Recently, however, the Army reversed its plans to construct 
     and operate the drinking water system. This decision, its 
     potential to delay the provision of clean drinking water to 
     homes near the site, and the Army's lack of public 
     communication regarding the decision is concerning.
       Therefore, the Army is directed to conduct required human 
     health risk assessments expeditiously, and if needed, use 
     expedited contracting authorities. Additionally, the Army 
     should hold regular public meetings to update and engage with 
     local stakeholders and integrate local priorities in its 
     remediation plans. Furthermore, within 90 days of enactment 
     of this Act, the Secretary of the Army shall submit to the 
     Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a 
     report and provide a corresponding briefing regarding the 
     Army's rationale and process for approving plans to construct 
     and operate a drinking water system and its subsequent 
     decision to terminate such plans, as well as the Army's 
     completed and planned actions for environmental restoration 
     at the site.
       Conveyance of property.--The Army is proposing to convey 
     17.1 acres of land known as Shenandoah Square and the 126 
     existing housing units to raise capital to improve other 
     military housing owned by private entities. Under the 
     proposed action, the existing 126 housing units would be 
     demolished to allow for the construction of high-density 
     residential housing. The residents have expressed concern 
     about the displacement from Shenandoah Square as it is in one 
     of the most expensive housing markets in the country and the 
     uncertainty about the affordability of new potential housing 
     on the site. Therefore, the Department of the Army is urged 
     to explore all possible alternatives to a conveyance of 
     Shenandoah Square, including a sublease of the property to an 
     entity that can better develop affordable housing on the 
     property.


              MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, NAVY AND MARINE CORPS

       The agreement provides $1,553,275,000 for Military 
     Construction, Navy and Marine Corps. Within this amount, the 
     agreement provides $219,069,000 for study, planning, design, 
     architect and engineer services. The agreement also provides 
     an additional $10,000,000 to supplement unspecified minor 
     military construction.
       Marine Corps fire stations.--The Marine Corps has been 
     neglecting fire station new construction and renovation over 
     the years and funding for military construction of new 
     stations has been deferred to the out years of budget 
     submissions. Many of the fire stations are deteriorating and 
     antiquated, creating significant life, safety, and health 
     concerns. Therefore, the Secretary of the Navy is directed to 
     prioritize funding for fire stations in a much timelier 
     manner and submit to the congressional defense committees a 
     list of how those requirements will be incorporated into 
     their construction requests for the out years. Fire stations 
     are valuable assets that should be maintained in a manner 
     that will ensure appropriate response time and their vital 
     role in protecting U.S. national security assets on military 
     installations.

     NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION SECURITY INVESTMENT PROGRAM

       The agreement provides $177,932,000 for the North Atlantic 
     Treaty Organization Security Investment Program, an increase 
     of $23,932,000.


               DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BASE CLOSURE ACCOUNT

       The agreement provides $310,000,000 for the Department of 
     Defense Base Closure Account, an increase of $54,133,000 
     above the request. The additional funding is for the 
     Department to accelerate environmental remediation at 
     installations closed under previous Base Realignment and 
     Closure rounds.
       Accelerated cleanup.--The agreement includes additional 
     funding to accelerate environmental remediation at 
     installations closed during previous Base Realignment and 
     Closure (BRAC) rounds. Priority should be given to those 
     sites with newly identified radiological cleanup cost. There 
     are many factors hindering the cleanup of BRAC sites. 
     However, strategic investments can lead to quicker clean-ups 
     and faster turnover of DOD property to the local community. 
     Therefore, the Department is directed to submit to the 
     congressional defense committees a spend plan for the 
     additional BRAC funds not later than 30 days after enactment 
     of this Act.
       Perfluorinated chemicals.--Perfluorinated chemical (PFC) 
     contaminants linked to a firefighting agent formerly used by 
     the DOD have been identified in water systems near military 
     installations closed during previous Base Realignment and 
     Closure (BRAC) rounds. Identification, testing, response, and 
     prevention activities are ongoing and will require 
     significant attention in future budget requests. Therefore, 
     the Secretary of the Air Force is urged to prioritize PFC-
     contaminated sites when considering BRAC cleanup project 
     funding requested through this account and to move forwards 
     with short- and long-term remediation efforts as 
     expeditiously as possible.

                                TITLE II

                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

                    Veterans Benefits Administration

                       Compensation and Pensions


                     (including transfer of funds)

       The agreement provides $95,768,462,000 for Compensation and 
     Pensions in advance for fiscal year 2019. Of the amount 
     provided, not more than $17,882,000 is to be transferred to 
     General Operating Expenses, Veterans Benefits Administration 
     (VBA) and Information Technology Systems for reimbursement of 
     necessary expenses in implementing provisions of title 38.


                         READJUSTMENT BENEFITS

       The agreement provides $11,832,175,000 for Readjustment 
     Benefits in advance for fiscal year 2019.


                   VETERANS INSURANCE AND INDEMNITIES

       The agreement provides $109,090,000 for Veterans Insurance 
     and Indemnities in advance for fiscal year 2019, as well as 
     an additional $12,439,000 for fiscal year 2018.


                 VETERANS HOUSING BENEFIT PROGRAM FUND

       The agreement provides such sums as may be necessary for 
     costs associated with direct and guaranteed loans for the 
     Veterans Housing Benefit Program Fund. The agreement limits 
     obligations for direct loans to not more than $500,000 and 
     provides that $178,626,000 shall be available for 
     administrative expenses.


            VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION LOANS PROGRAM ACCOUNT

       The agreement provides $30,000 for the cost of direct loans 
     from the Vocational Rehabilitation Loans Program Account, 
     plus $395,000 to be paid to the appropriation for General 
     Operating Expenses, Veterans Benefits Administration. The 
     agreement provides for a direct loan limitation of 
     $2,356,000.
       As indicated in the House report, the Secretary is directed 
     to provide the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of 
     Congress (``the Committees''') options to support greater 
     utilization of the Home Loan Program in locations with a 
     large veteran population and competitive housing markets.


          NATIVE AMERICAN VETERAN HOUSING LOAN PROGRAM ACCOUNT

       The agreement provides $1,163,000 for administrative 
     expenses of the Native American Veteran Housing Loan Program 
     Account.


      GENERAL OPERATING EXPENSES, VETERANS BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION

       The agreement provides $2,910,000,000 for General Operating 
     Expenses, Veterans Benefits Administration and makes 
     available not to exceed 10 percent of this funding until the 
     end of fiscal year 2019. The agreement provides $66,000,000 
     above the request and intends that the increase be used for 
     the Veterans Claims Intake Program; additional claims and 
     appellate staff; increased staff for the Vocational 
     Rehabilitation and Employment program; and overtime payments, 
     as necessary.
       Equitable relief.--As described in the House report, the 
     Secretary is directed to continue to grant or extend 
     equitable relief to eligible veterans initially deemed 
     eligible in instances of administrative error.
       Compensation claims for Camp Lejeune contaminated water 
     veterans.--There is concern regarding the lack of consistency 
     in the Department's handling of disability compensation 
     claims for veterans, former reservists, and former National 
     Guard members who served at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune 
     for no less than 30 days (consecutive or nonconsecutive) 
     between August 1, 1953 and December 31, 1987. VA established 
     a presumption of service connection for eight diseases 
     associated with exposure to contaminants in the water supply 
     at Camp Lejeune during that period. The Department made the 
     decision to subject nonpresumptive Camp Lejeune Contaminated 
     Water (CLCW) exposure claims to a higher level of scrutiny 
     than is applied to other exposure claims and did so without 
     providing notice or an opportunity for public comment. In 
     addition, no other toxic exposure claims require a positive 
     medical opinion to warrant service connection. The 
     evidentiary burden VA requires for CLCW nonpresumptive 
     exposure claims is significantly greater than the standard 
     used for Agent Orange or any other exposure claims. 
     Furthermore, there currently exists a wealth of ``competent 
     medical evidence'' specific to diseases related to exposure 
     to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, as published by the 
     Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), the 
     Institute of Medicine (IoM), and other government-sanctioned 
     medical experts. Nevertheless, the Department's same Clinical 
     Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), who provide medical opinions, 
     have routinely rejected ATSDR and IoM's findings without 
     providing any justification or explanation for doing so.
       The Department is directed to conduct a Special Focus 
     Review for the CLCW claims process and submit the results of 
     the review to the Committees no later than 180 days after 
     enactment of this Act. The report should also address the 
     lack of consistency for CLCW claims as compared to other non-
     presumptive and exposure claims, as well as answer the 
     following questions: (1) Why did the Department determine it 
     was necessary to ``create a process that fell outside of the 
     traditional Compensation and Pension (C&P) examination 
     process''' for Camp Lejeune exposure claims? (2) The 
     Department has stated that ``SMEs are required to be familiar 
     with the study of Environmental & Occupational Medicine and 
     Toxicology due to the specialized nature of these claims.'' 
     (a) Explain what the Department means by ``the specialized 
     nature of these claims.'' (b) Explain how and why this 
     process differs from the C&P examination process for Agent 
     Orange or other exposure claims. (c) What are the 
     educational, practical, or other requirements that a VHA 
     employee must meet in order to qualify as a ``Subject Matter 
     Expert'' who can adjudicate Camp Lejeune Contaminated Water 
     claims? (3) What justification did the Department use to 
     require a positive medical opinion to warrant service 
     connection for every single non-presumptive claim for CLCW 
     veterans? (a) What evidence is there to demonstrate the 
     necessity of establishing such a process? (b) What evidence 
     is there to demonstrate the impact that such extraordinary 
     evidentiary requirements have had on the processing of CLCW 
     exposure claims? (4) What percentage of non-presumptive 
     claims (VA wide) are currently referred to VHA Clinical SMEs 
     for a medical opinion? (5) Why does the Department require an 
     evidentiary standard greater than ``competent medical 
     evidence'' for CLCW claims? (6) Does the Department consider 
     the ATSDR and IoM reports on diseases associated with 
     exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune to be 
     ``competent medical evidence?'' (a) If so, why has the 
     Department refused to accept these findings as sufficient 
     medical evidence to establish a nexus of service connection? 
     (b) If not, why does the Department apply a different 
     definition of ``competent medical evidence'' to CLCW claims 
     than it applies to Agent Orange claims? (7) Is there any 
     other type of claim for which the Department requires a 
     positive medical opinion from a VHA clinical Subject Matter 
     Expert on each claim?


                     VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

                                Overview

       As described in the Senate report, the Secretary is 
     directed to establish relationships with personnel divisions 
     at the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Homeland Security to 
     enable rapid hiring by the Department of Veterans Affairs 
     (VA) of separating service members.


                            MEDICAL SERVICES

       The agreement provides $49,161,165,000 in advance for 
     fiscal year 2019 for Medical Services and makes 
     $1,400,000,000 of the advance available through fiscal year 
     2020. The agreement also provides $1,962,984,000 for fiscal 
     year 2018 in addition to the advance appropriation provided 
     last year.
       Given that there may be significant unfunded liabilities 
     created by the winding down of the Choice Act, the agreement 
     continues to include bill language in section 229 permitting 
     the transfer of funding from multiple VA appropriations 
     accounts to Medical Services to address unfunded needs.
       The agreement includes bill language requiring the 
     Secretary to ensure that sufficient amounts are available for 
     the acquisition of prosthetics designed specifically for 
     female veterans.
       Allocations.--At the beginning of fiscal year 2018, without 
     public notice, the Department considered fundamentally 
     changing the manner in which Medical Services allocations 
     were made to the Veterans Integrated Service Networks 
     (VISNs). Specifically, consideration was being given to 
     converting almost $1,000,000,000 of Specific Purpose funding 
     to General Purpose funding. After consultation with Congress 
     regarding the unknown and potentially serious impacts the 
     conversion could have to programs, such as the successful 
     Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supportive 
     Services program, the Department ceased implementation and 
     determined that conversion to General Purpose funding would 
     not go forward in fiscal year 2018. In order to provide for 
     transparency and ensure Congressional oversight and 
     deliberation, in the future, the VA is directed to consult 
     with the Committees on Appropriations and the Committees on 
     Veterans Affairs of both Houses of Congress before any 
     attempt is made to change the manner in which funding 
     allocations are made to the field, and to propose these types 
     of changes in an annual budget submission.
       Opioid abuse.--The agreement provides the estimated 
     $329,953,000 VA will spend on inpatient and outpatient 
     treatment, methadone and other pharmacy-related costs related 
     to opioid abuse; $55,821,000 to continue to implement opioid 
     safety initiatives outlined as part of the Comprehensive 
     Addiction and Recovery Act; and $48,778,000 for the Justice 
     Outreach and Prevention program. In addition to these 
     amounts, the agreement also includes $270,000,000 for the 
     Office of Rural Health's Rural Health Initiative, which funds 
     several pilot projects aimed at treating and preventing 
     opioid abuse, including projects focused on alternatives to 
     opioid-centered pain management in rural, highly rural, and 
     remote areas. In addition to the funding levels described 
     above, all directives regarding opioid prevention, treatment, 
     safety, and drug monitoring programs in both Senate Report 
     115-130 and House Report 115-188 shall be complied with.
       Overmedication.--As indicated in the Senate report, and in 
     addition to the funding levels highlighted for opioid abuse 
     above, the agreement provides $500,000 for the National 
     Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to conduct 
     an assessment of the potential overmedication of veterans 
     during fiscal years 2010 to 2017 that led to suicides, 
     deaths, mental disorders, and combat-related traumas.

[[Page H2817]]

       Mental health.--The agreement provides the full budget 
     request for all VA mental health services and programs of 
     $8,385,202,000, with an additional $10,000,000 provided for 
     the Veterans Crisis Line, an additional $22,002,000 above the 
     request provided for the National Centers for Posttraumatic 
     Stress Disorder, and an additional $10,000,000 to the Clay 
     Hunt pilot programs. The agreement includes $40,000,000 for 
     the National Centers and $99,044,000 for the Veterans Crisis 
     Line. The additional Clay Hunt funding will provide new 
     funding to each pilot site to incorporate best practices and 
     funding for new pilot sites in highly rural areas. Overall, 
     the agreement includes $186,128,000 for suicide prevention 
     outreach.
       Staffing shortages.--As indicated in the Senate report, VA 
     is directed to ensure that the brain bank and the 
     consultation program for providers, particularly in rural 
     areas, have the appropriate number of full-time staff.
       Suicide hotline.--The agreement includes bill language in 
     section 232 that was contained in the House bill which 
     requires certain professional standards for the suicide 
     hotline. As indicated in the House report, the Secretary is 
     urged to develop a basic training protocol for all VA 
     employees who deal with veterans in crisis, not only those 
     who staff the suicide hotline, as well as community providers 
     who deal with veterans.
       Women's health.--While VA has made efforts to address the 
     needs of female veterans, many still often report feeling 
     unrecognized and underappreciated. To better assist female 
     veterans and increase their knowledge of the services and 
     benefits to which they are entitled, the agreement provides 
     $512,000,000 for gender-specific healthcare, which is 
     $20,000,000 above the fiscal year 2018 budget estimate. 
     Furthermore, the Secretary should make it a top priority to 
     increase female veterans' access and utilization of VA 
     benefits and services. There are several areas where VA could 
     improve the quality of life for female veterans. One area 
     that needs improvement is access to mental healthcare 
     services. Many female veterans are faced with disabling 
     mental health issues when they leave active duty. Therefore, 
     VA is directed to renew its focus on improving access to 
     mental health services for female veterans and to work to 
     ensure that female veterans' psychological needs are met. In 
     addition to mental healthcare access, VA must ensure that VA 
     facilities can meet the needs of female veterans. Currently, 
     women make up 15 percent of the active military and are a 
     growing segment of the veteran population. According to the 
     1990 Census, there were 1.2 million women veterans. By the 
     next census in 2000, that number increased to 1.6 million, 
     with 1.74 million at the end of the fiscal year 2010, and it 
     is projected to increase to 1.9 million in 2020. However, 
     even with this growth in the female veteran population, 
     numerous VA facilities are still primarily designed to meet 
     the needs of male veterans. Consequently, the agreement 
     directs VA to describe the locations where VA facilities do 
     not meet the standards established in 2010 specifically for 
     healthcare services for female veterans. Also, VA is further 
     directed to create a master plan to address issues at the 
     locations that do not meet the established standards for 
     female veterans. This report shall be submitted no later than 
     180 days after enactment of this Act.
       Rural healthcare.--The agreement provides $270,000,000 for 
     the Office of Rural Health (ORH) and the Rural Health 
     Initiative, which is $20,000,000 above the President's 
     request. As included in the Senate report, the Department is 
     directed to conduct an agency-wide assessment of its rural 
     and highly rural workforce to identify geographic areas where 
     staffing needs exist. The Committees support the Department's 
     expansive use of telehealth for medical services and 
     encourage VA to strive to be even more innovative, more 
     expansive, and more connected in this area, especially as the 
     technique has proven particularly helpful in mental health 
     and primary care health delivery. The agreement includes 
     $1,348,883,000 for telehealth services, which is $5,000,000 
     above the budget request. The additional funding should be 
     used to further expand telehealth capacity and services in 
     rural and remote areas. The agreement directs no less than 
     $4,000,000 toward a pilot program to train veterans in 
     agricultural vocations while also tending to behavioral and 
     mental health needs with behavioral healthcare services and 
     treatments from licensed providers at no fewer than three 
     locations, as instructed in the Senate report.
       Long-term care.--The agreement provides $8,821,657,000 as 
     requested for long-term care, including $6,073,862,000 for 
     institutional care and $2,747,795,000 for non-institutional 
     care. As indicated in the Senate report, VA is directed to 
     meet its fiscal year 2018 non-institutional care request as 
     originally proposed in the advance Medical Services 
     appropriation if that care is not provided through the Choice 
     program. In order to improve budgetary oversight of non-
     institutional care programs, the Department is directed to 
     meet the reporting requirements included in Senate Report 
     115-130.
       Headache centers of excellence.--The agreement provides 
     $10,000,000 for the creation of headache centers of 
     excellence, as described in the Senate report.
       Veterans centers.--The agreement provides $258,483,000 for 
     readjustment counseling at Vet Centers, which is $15,000,000 
     above the budget request. As described in the Senate report, 
     within this amount, $2,500,000 is allocated to develop a 
     program to partner with organizations that provide outdoor 
     experiences for veterans as part of a continuum of care to 
     treat combat-related injuries, including those related to 
     behavioral health. The Department is also directed to 
     continue to work to expand Vet Centers and readjustment 
     services at areas across the country that currently lack 
     access.
       Caregivers program.--The agreement provides $839,828,000 
     for the caregivers program, which is the same as the original 
     fiscal year 2018 request and $235,889,000 above the revised 
     2018 request. The Department is instructed to provide 
     quarterly reports on obligations for the caregivers program, 
     with a full explanation of any inability to obligate the 
     original 2018 request.
       Dental care.--As part of VA's comprehensive medical 
     benefits package, certain eligible veterans also qualify for 
     dental care benefits. In some instances, VA is authorized to 
     provide extensive dental care, while in other cases treatment 
     may be limited. In order to better understand the full array 
     of services provided, and the locations in which they are 
     provided, the Department is directed to submit a report to 
     the Committees no later than 60 days after enactment of this 
     Act, describing the types of services provided to eligible 
     veterans, as well as a list of on-site dental clinics by 
     location and medical center. The report should also include 
     any implementation plans to expand on-sight dental care, 
     particularly in States in which there are currently no 
     services offered by VA or which have no on-site VA dental 
     clinics.
       Homeless assistance programs.--The agreement provides 
     $1,747,784,000 for homeless assistance programs, which 
     includes $340,000,000 for the homeless supportive services 
     for low income veterans and families, a level which is 
     $20,000,000 above the request.
       Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supportive 
     Housing (HUD-VASH).--The agreement includes full funding for 
     the HUD-VASH program. However, if additional new vouchers are 
     issued in fiscal year 2018 by the Department of Housing and 
     Urban Development for the HUD/VASH program. VA is directed to 
     increase funding for this program above the budget estimate 
     to ensure adequate staffing levels exist to manage the 
     increased workload. Further, the Department is directed to 
     submit to the Committee on Appropriations no later than 30 
     days after enactment of this Act the amount above the budget 
     estimate that has been made available for this purpose.
       High-cost areas.--There is a need for an examination of the 
     effects of rapidly rising rents in urban areas across the 
     nation and strategies to create and retain affordable housing 
     options for veterans. Avoiding the displacement of veterans 
     and their families in these communities should be a top 
     priority at the Department. Therefore, the Secretary is 
     directed, in consultation with the Secretary of Housing and 
     Urban Development, to submit a report detailing the best 
     practices and recommendations to address the displacement of 
     lower-income veterans who are long-time residents in urban 
     areas when there is a loss of affordable housing due to high 
     rental cost. This report shall be submitted to the Committees 
     no later than 180 days after enactment of this Act.
       Curing Hepatitis C within the veteran population.--The 
     Department should be commended on its successful efforts to 
     treat almost 100,000 veterans. Since VA has been successful 
     in negotiating lower prices for the drugs used to cure 
     hepatitis C, it has obligated less funding than anticipated. 
     Therefore, the agreement includes a rescission (Section 237) 
     and reappropriation (within the Medical Services account) of 
     $751,000,000 to prevent the funding already provided from 
     lapsing. The Department is directed to continue to 
     aggressively fund the Hepatitis C program consistent with its 
     fiscal year 2018 budget request.
       Hepatitis C screening.--There is a cohort of veterans who 
     are more difficult to screen, engage, and treat for hepatitis 
     C, due to factors such as the inability to adhere to therapy, 
     psychosocial determinants, unstable or uncontrolled medical 
     comorbidities, and enrollment barriers and challenges. The 
     Department is directed to improve hepatitis C screening rates 
     in traditional and non-traditional settings, including 
     increasing the utilization of innovative strategies like 
     point-of-care testing and public health outreach. The 
     Department is directed to submit a report to the Committees 
     no later than 120 days after enactment of this Act on VA's 
     efforts to facilitate this directive.
       Incorrect reporting of laboratory tests.--According to 
     press reports, in February 2018, at least 8 veterans in the 
     Miami area were given incorrect lab results indicating that 
     they did not test positive for the presence of human 
     immunodeficiency virus (HIV), when in fact they did have the 
     virus and needed treatment. The VA Inspector General is 
     directed to provide a report to the Committees describing how 
     the incident at the Miami VA hospital occurred and who was 
     responsible. This report shall be submitted no later than 180 
     days after enactment of this Act. The agreement further 
     directs that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) 
     provide a report to the Committees that examines VA's HIV 
     testing policy, including the use of the latest technologies, 
     and how this policy is implemented at a sample of VA 
     hospitals. This report shall be submitted no later than 180 
     days after enactment of this Act.
       Hospice care for veterans.--As described in the House and 
     Senate reports, the Department is directed to conduct a study 
     on the feasibility of implementing hospice care protocols 
     tailored to the unique needs of combat

[[Page H2818]]

     veterans, with special emphasis on the needs of Vietnam 
     veterans.
       Intimate Partner Violence Program.--The agreement provides 
     $17,000,000 for the Intimate Partner Violence Program within 
     the Medical Services account, which is the base level of 
     funding for the program and the amount identified in the 
     Senate report.
       Colorectal cancer screening.--The Department is directed to 
     offer all 7 colorectal cancer screening strategies 
     recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task 
     Force and adopted by the National Committee for Quality 
     Assurance Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set 
     measures, which are used by more than 90 percent of U.S. 
     health plans to measure performance. The Department is 
     directed to report to the Committees within 90 days of 
     enactment of this Act if it determines that it is unable to 
     comply with this directive.
       National Veteran Sports Program.--The agreement provides 
     $16,965,000 for the National Veterans Sports Program, with 
     $2,000,000 designated for veterans monthly assistance 
     allowances; $9,000,000 for the Adaptive Sports Grants 
     Program; and $5,965,000 for support of national veterans 
     sports and special events programs like the Paralympics. The 
     agreement includes necessary bill language within the Medical 
     Services account to permit VHA to carry out the Office's 
     activities.
       Equine therapy.--The Adaptive Sports Program awards small 
     grants for equine therapy, mostly for physical disabilities. 
     An additional $1,000,000 above the request is provided to the 
     Adaptive Sports Program to encourage VA to increase its use 
     of Adaptive Sports Program grants for equine therapy for 
     mental health issues, given the promising results reported 
     using equine therapy for veterans with posttraumatic stress 
     disorder.
       Burn pits.--The agreement provides $5,000,000 for the 
     purpose of implementing the recommendations included in 
     National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's 
     assessment to improve the VA open burn pit registry.
       Specialized and modular prosthetics.--As referenced in the 
     House report, the field of specialized and modular 
     prosthetics is evolving at a faster pace than VA has been 
     able to match. There is concern that VA does not have an 
     effective, streamlined model of service for specialized or 
     innovative modular prosthetics, unlike both the DOD and the 
     Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which have begun 
     to explore this field. Therefore, the agreement directs VA to 
     conduct comparative analyses of prosthetic manufacturing 
     processes and determine whether it has the capacity to use 
     the ``best of breed'' manufacturing processes in cases where 
     it directly produces the prosthesis. This report shall be 
     submitted to the Committees no later than 90 days after 
     enactment of this Act.
       Proposed prosthetics regulation.--VA has included a 
     provision in its proposed regulation on prosthetic and 
     rehabilitative items and services that may limit veterans' 
     choice in obtaining prosthetic, orthotic and other 
     rehabilitative services. The regulation appears to give the 
     Department sole authority to choose the provider of the 
     services, contrary to the current practice of giving veterans 
     a choice in these services. VA is encouraged to reconsider 
     this issue as it develops its final regulation.
       Partnerships with community providers.--The Department is 
     encouraged to establish a pilot program within the Veterans 
     Health Administration (VHA) to support a partnership between 
     community health centers, other health providers, and higher 
     education institutions for the purpose of providing 
     education, training, and placement of veterans into health 
     professions. No later than 60 days after enactment of this 
     Act, the Department is directed to submit a report to the 
     Committees outlining the feasibility and advisability of 
     establishing such a pilot program.
       Demand profile.--The creation of a demand profile of VA 
     healthcare needs across the country would be important to 
     inform the proper balance between VA and non-VA care covered 
     by the Department at VA and non-VA facilities. The Department 
     is directed to establish a demand profile for each of the 
     healthcare services furnished by VA and submit the findings 
     to the Committees no later than twelve months after enactment 
     of this Act. VA is directed to use the demand profile to 
     inform the capability and capacity of any non-Department 
     healthcare services provided. Each demand profile shall 
     include the following information: (1) the number of requests 
     for the healthcare service; (2) the number of appointments 
     for the receipt of the healthcare service, disaggregated by 
     appointments at VA facilities and appointments with non-
     Department healthcare providers; (3) the capacity of the 
     Department to provide the healthcare service at VA 
     facilities; and (4) an assessment of the extent to which the 
     Department needs to use non-Department healthcare providers 
     to provide healthcare services.
       Chiropractic services.--The agreement includes $5,000,000 
     for the chiropractic programs to be developed under the 
     authority of sec. 245.


                         MEDICAL COMMUNITY CARE

       The agreement provides $8,384,704,000 in advance fiscal 
     year 2019 funding for Medical Community Care, with 
     $2,000,000,000 available through fiscal year 2022. The 
     agreement also provides $419,176,000 for fiscal year 2018 in 
     addition to the advance appropriation provided last year.
       Due to the timing of reconciliation between obligations, 
     authorizations, and the number of those authorizations filled 
     through private providers, VA's accounting procedure has led 
     to the de-obligation of funds past the life of the budget 
     authority, leading to the expiration of millions of dollars 
     that could have been applied to veterans healthcare programs. 
     Therefore, the agreement provides extended availability to 
     aid the Department in ensuring that it can obligate all 
     appropriations within this account before expiration.


                     MEDICAL SUPPORT AND COMPLIANCE

       The agreement provides $7,239,156,000 in advance for fiscal 
     year 2019 for Medical Support and Compliance and makes 
     $100,000,000 of the advance funding available through fiscal 
     year 2020. The agreement also provides $100,000,000 for 
     fiscal year 2018 in addition to the advance appropriation 
     provided last year.


                           MEDICAL FACILITIES

       The agreement provides $5,914,288,000 in advance for fiscal 
     year 2019 for Medical Facilities, as well as $707,000,000 in 
     fiscal year 2018 funding, which is in addition to the advance 
     funding provided last year and is made available for two 
     years. Of the advance funding, $250,000,000 is made available 
     through fiscal year 2020.
       In addition, $1,000,000,000 is provided for non-recurring 
     maintenance in section 255 to be available until expended. 
     The funding is to be used to correct deficiencies identified 
     in the VA's facilities assessments reports as well as to 
     supplement base funding provided within this Medical 
     Facilities account.
       Bakersfield outpatient clinic.--The lengthy period VA has 
     taken to lease a new outpatient clinic in Bakersfield, CA 
     pursuant to Public Law 111-82 is concerning. Outpatient 
     clinics greatly reduce the need for veterans to travel long 
     distances for care by providing reliable medical services 
     closer to a veteran's home. The new outpatient clinic would 
     replace the Bakersfield community-based outpatient clinic and 
     would provide expanded primary care and mental health 
     services while offering a range of specialty care clinics. 
     This project would simultaneously increase veterans' access 
     to healthcare locally as well as reduce the caseload at other 
     facilities in the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. 
     While VA received congressional authorization for the project 
     in fiscal year 2010 and has allocated funding for it, the 
     project has been delayed for years and is still in the 
     acquisition phase. The Department is urged to expedite the 
     project in light of the urgent need for expanded healthcare 
     services. The Secretary is directed to report to the 
     Committees no later than 60 days after enactment of this Act 
     on past actions and the future plan forward, including the 
     timeline for this project, and to provide periodic progress 
     reports to the Committees every 120 days. These periodic 
     progress reports shall include an explanation of any changes 
     to: (1) the project's status; (2) the expected cost of the 
     lease; and (3) the projected completion date.


                    MEDICAL AND PROSTHETIC RESEARCH

       The agreement provides $722,262,000 for Medical and 
     Prosthetic Research, available until September 30, 2019. Bill 
     language is included to ensure that the Secretary allocates 
     adequate funding for research on gender-appropriate 
     prosthetics and toxic exposures.
       Exoskeleton research.--As indicated in the Senate report, 
     VA is directed to study the efficacy of exoskeletons in the 
     rehabilitation of patients who have suffered a stroke or 
     traumatic brain injury.
       Cancer moonshot.--As indicated in the Senate report, the 
     Department is urged to include skin cancer as a subject of 
     its efforts to provide targeted cancer treatments to veterans 
     through genomic science.
       Rare cancers.--The disproportionate impact of rare cancers 
     on veterans, the number of rare cancers affecting veterans 
     that are understudied and misunderstood, and inadequate 
     treatment options for rare cancers are concerning. Therefore, 
     the Department is instructed to provide a report to the 
     Committees within 90 days of enactment of this Act for each 
     of the last five years: the prevalence rate of rare cancers 
     among veterans; the types of treatments being provided to 
     veterans specifically for rare cancers; any studies on rare 
     cancers conducted by the Department; the Department's 
     expenditures on the treatment of rare cancers; the 
     Department's programs dedicated to addressing rare cancers 
     among veterans; and recommendations on ways the Department 
     can enhance rare cancer treatments for veterans.
       Exposure to Agent Orange by certain Navy veterans.--As 
     described in the Senate report, beginning in 2002, a revised 
     VA interpretation of the Agent Orange Act of 1991 (Public Law 
     102-4) has prevented ``Blue Water'' Navy veterans who served 
     in the Navy outside of the riverine and coastal areas from 
     collecting benefits unless they could prove that they stepped 
     onto land or that their ship entered the internal river 
     system of the Republic of Vietnam. However, a growing body of 
     research supports the resumption of the presumption of 
     exposure for these veterans. Subsequently, the Secretary has 
     testified before the House Veterans Affairs Committee that he 
     believes these veterans should be extended the presumption of 
     exposure. The Department is directed to submit a report to 
     the Committees no later than 180 days after enactment of this 
     Act evaluating each of the U.S. and non-U.S. studies on Agent 
     Orange exposure and any additional relevant material. The 
     report should also include any justification for the 
     continued exclusion policy

[[Page H2819]]

     or, in the alternative, detail the intent, along with 
     associated milestones, for lifting the exclusion policy.


                    NATIONAL CEMETERY ADMINISTRATION

       The agreement provides $306,193,000 for the National 
     Cemetery Administration (NCA). Of the amount provided, not to 
     exceed 10 percent is available until September 30, 2019.
       Burial rights for Hmong veterans.--The agreement includes 
     section 251 permitting burial in a National Cemetery 
     Administration national cemetery for any Hmong veterans 
     naturalized pursuant to the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization 
     Act of 2000, who served on behalf of the United States during 
     the Vietnam War, and who were residing in the United States 
     at the time of the individual's death. The Department is 
     instructed to conduct an analysis of the number of surviving 
     Hmong veterans who served in Vietnam on behalf of the United 
     States and who would not be eligible for burial in a VA 
     national cemetery under the provisions of section 251. This 
     analysis should be submitted to the Committees no later than 
     180 days after enactment of this Act.
       Deferred maintenance.--Given the weaknesses in the 
     Facilities Condition Assessment currently used by NCA, as 
     described in the House report, NCA is encouraged to pilot in 
     one region the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Sustainment 
     Management System (SMS). The procurement of the SMS is 
     available to VA without cost. The SMS provides automated, 
     predictive modeling that may provide more accurate data to 
     model future maintenance needs. Since other groups within VA 
     also currently use the Facilities Condition Assessment, this 
     pilot may provide a useful test to see if the SMS has utility 
     department-wide. VA is directed to inform the Committees of 
     its plans to pilot the SMS, including the region chosen, the 
     expected cost, and planned start date and duration of the 
     pilot. If VA determines it is unable to conduct the pilot, it 
     is directed to report to the Committees the reasons why.

                      Departmental Administration

                         General Administration


                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

       The agreement provides $335,891,000 for General 
     Administration. Of the amount provided, not to exceed 10 
     percent is available for obligation until September 30, 2019. 
     The agreement continues to include bill language permitting 
     the transfer of funds from this account to General Operating 
     Expenses, Veterans Benefits Administration.
       Recording of obligations.--VA is in the process of changing 
     its accounting for obligations for healthcare services 
     purchased from non-VA providers. Up to this time, such 
     obligations have been recorded at the time the health care 
     services were authorized. Obligations were later adjusted 
     after healthcare services were rendered, and VA received a 
     claim for payment, VA evaluated the claim to ensure that it 
     was allowable, and VA approved the claim for payment. Because 
     of the lag in the time between the date services were 
     rendered and the date a claim was processed, approved and 
     paid, approximately 75 percent of the preliminary fiscal year 
     2017 obligations were based on VA's ``best estimate'' of 
     services that a veteran might or might not receive. This is 
     because the amount of VA's final liability was contingent on 
     the veteran seeking health care services and the type and 
     length of services that were provided by the non-VA provider. 
     The proposed accounting change will mean that obligations 
     will be recorded at the time claims are processed and 
     approved, thereby eliminating the uncertainty regarding the 
     actual total obligations against the program. The Department 
     believes that this change in obligation procedure will 
     improve program management and the ability to forecast and 
     justify budget requirements. The Committees concur with the 
     VA proposal, noting the Comptroller General has opined in the 
     past that VA could determine whether the government should 
     accept liability for non-VA health care claims following a 
     review and approval process and record obligations upon 
     approval. This proposal matches the system DOD uses for its 
     non-Department healthcare claims.
       Staff vacancies.--As indicated in the Senate report, VA is 
     directed to use funds provided by this Act to fill its staff 
     vacancies and to report monthly on its progress in doing so.
       Financial management system.--The agreement includes 
     $10,800,000 in this account, as well as $83,000,000 in the 
     Information Technology Systems account for development of a 
     new financial management system. The VA agreement to use the 
     Department of Agriculture's Federal Shared Services financial 
     management system has broken down and VA is trying to use the 
     contracts USDA had set up to reconstruct the financial 
     management system it had anticipated acquiring through USDA. 
     It is concerning that VA is trying to move forward alone, 
     given the disastrous outcomes of its two previous attempts to 
     create a modern financial management system. VA is directed 
     to provide a report to the Committees within 60 days of 
     enactment of this Act that describes the components that will 
     be included in its planned financial management system, such 
     as acquisition, the cost of the contracts and staffing that 
     VA has acquired from USDA, the annual and total costs of the 
     project, and its timeline and performance benchmarks. The 
     report should also include a description of interim steps the 
     Department is taking to improve the timeliness of payments 
     made to healthcare providers and vendors while the FMS is 
     being developed. Upon submission of this report, VA is 
     directed to provide the Committees on a quarterly basis a 
     report that compares actual progress on the financial 
     management system to the performance benchmarks and timeline 
     provided in the first report.
       Inconsistencies in contracting policy after the Kingdomware 
     decision.--VA issued guidance to implement the Kingdomware 
     decision of June 2016, which held that the VA ``must use the 
     Rule of Two when awarding contracts, even when the Department 
     will otherwise meet its annual minimum contracting goals'' 
     and that it must be applied to Federal Supply Schedule 
     purchase orders. The VA guidance outlined ways to identify 
     potential vendors and evaluate their capabilities. However, 
     there is concern that VA's guidance is being interpreted 
     inconsistently across the VISNs. In some VISNs, option years 
     are not being exercised as anticipated, but instead, are 
     being re-bid to satisfy the ``Rule of Two'' retroactively 
     based on a misinterpretation of the Supreme Court's ruling.
       A report by the GAO (GAO-17-748) highlighted similar 
     concerns. The GAO report identified significant 
     inconsistencies between national policies set by the VA and 
     implementation of those policies at the regional and local 
     levels. The report emphasized that VA has not established a 
     process for systematically ensuring that local policies are 
     aligned with national policies.
       To ensure veterans' continued access to quality care, VA is 
     urged to issue additional guidance to provide a standard set 
     of criteria for contracting officers to evaluate veteran-
     owned providers' capabilities and to take steps to ensure 
     their implementation in a consistent manner across the VISNs, 
     in alignment with the GAO's recommendations, especially with 
     regard to option years.


                       BOARD OF VETERANS APPEALS

       The agreement provides $161,048,000 for the Board of 
     Veterans Appeals (BVA), of which not to exceed 10 percent 
     shall remain available until September 30, 2019. Funding 
     above the budget request is to be used to assist in 
     streamlining the appeals process, with the new authorities 
     provided by Congress. Bill language continues to be included 
     in section 230 permitting VA to transfer funding between this 
     account and the General Operating Expenses, Veterans Benefits 
     Administration account if needed to align funding with the 
     appropriate account to hire staff to address the appeals 
     backlog.


                     INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

       The agreement provides $4,055,500,000 for Information 
     Technology (IT) Systems. The agreement identifies separately 
     in bill language the funding available for pay 
     ($1,230,320,000); operations and maintenance 
     ($2,496,650,000); and systems development ($328,530,000). The 
     agreement makes not to exceed 5 percent of pay and of 
     operations and maintenance funding available until the end of 
     fiscal year 2019; not to exceed 5 percent of operations and 
     maintenance funding available until the end of fiscal year 
     2019, and all IT systems development funding available until 
     the end of fiscal year 2019.
       The agreement includes $63,404,000 in information 
     technology funding for the Veterans Benefits Management 
     System which processes disability claims; $7,500,000 for the 
     BVA claims appeals modernization effort; $83,000,000 for 
     development of a new VA financial management system; and 
     $340,000,000 for the Office of Information Security.
       The agreement continues language prohibiting the obligation 
     of IT development funding until VA submits a certification of 
     the amounts to be obligated, in part or in full, for each 
     development project.
       The agreement continues language permitting funding to be 
     transferred among the three IT subaccounts, subject to 
     approval from the Committees.
       The agreement continues language providing that funding may 
     be transferred among development projects or to new projects 
     subject to the Committees' approval.
       The agreement continues language indicating that no 
     development project may be increased or decreased by more 
     than $1,000,000 prior to receiving approval of the Committees 
     or a period of 30 days has elapsed.
       The agreement provides funding for IT development for the 
     projects and in the amounts specified in the following table:

               INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
                        (in thousands of dollars)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

       This table is intended to serve as the Department's 
     approved list of development projects; any requested changes 
     are subject to reprogramming requirements.
       Expenditure plan.--The Department is directed to continue 
     to provide a fiscal year 2018 IT expenditure plan to the 
     Committees upon enactment of this Act. This plan should be in 
     the same format as the table above.


                   VETERANS ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD

       The agreement provides $782,000,000 for activities related 
     to the development and rollout of a new VA electronic health 
     record, the

[[Page H2820]]

     associated contractual costs, and the salaries and expenses 
     of employees hired under titles 5 and 38, United States Code. 
     Because this is a very substantial new effort, the timing of 
     obligation of funding is uncertain. As a result, the 
     agreement makes these funds available for three years.
       This account is intended to be the single source of funding 
     within VA for the electronic health record effort. There is 
     no authority for funds from other VA accounts to be 
     transferred to this account or for funds from this account to 
     be transferred to other accounts. Consistent with the effort 
     to centralize financial management of the development of the 
     electronic health record, the Department is directed to place 
     top management of the project at the headquarters level above 
     either the VHA or the Office of Information Technology, such 
     as in the Office of the Deputy Secretary.
       The bill language for this account requires the Secretary 
     to submit a report quarterly to the Committees detailing 
     obligations, expenditures, and deployment strategy by 
     facility. In addition, GAO is directed to perform quarterly 
     performance reviews of the VA electronic health record 
     deployment so that the Committees are kept abreast of 
     important issues such as cost and operational capability. It 
     is expected that this quarterly reporting will avail the 
     Committees and VA with timely information to properly oversee 
     this effort and address important issues.


                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

       The agreement provides $164,000,000 for the Office of 
     Inspector General (OIG). Of the amount provided, not to 
     exceed 10 percent is available for obligation until September 
     30, 2019.


                      CONSTRUCTION, MAJOR PROJECTS

       The agreement provides $512,430,000 for Construction, Major 
     Projects, which is the same as the budget request. The 
     agreement makes this funding available for five years, except 
     that $80,000,000 is made available until expended.
       External project management.--The agreement continues the 
     bill language requiring that large VA construction projects 
     be managed by a non-VA government entity. Of the total 
     provided, $117,300,000 for VHA major construction projects 
     shall not be available until the Department enters into an 
     agreement with a non-Department of Veterans Affairs Federal 
     entity to serve as the design and/or construction agent for 
     each major construction project with a total estimated cost 
     of $100,000,000 or above. Funding is available for obligation 
     for each project only after VA certifies that the agreement 
     with the non-Department Federal entity is in effect for that 
     project. The single large VHA project affected by this 
     provision is in Livermore, California.
       The requirement to contract with an outside agent for major 
     construction projects was also mandated in Section 502 of the 
     Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 
     2015 (Public Law 114-58), enacted on September 30, 2015. 
     Since the provision in the annual appropriations bill is also 
     contained in permanent authorizing law, in future years, this 
     provision will not be included in the appropriations bill.
       The agreement funds the following items as requested in the 
     budget submission:

       West Los Angeles, California seismic corrections.--VA 
     removed six buildings from the scope of the West Los Angeles, 
     California seismic corrections project to be addressed 
     through the Enhanced Use Lease supportive housing program. In 
     the fiscal year 2018 budget submission, VA advised that 
     details would be provided on how the remaining funding 
     appropriated for the West LA project would be used. VA's most 
     urgent need is to address Building 300, the Regional Food 
     Services Facility, which is critical for providing quality 
     service to vulnerable inpatient veterans. The Regional Food 
     Services Facility is currently housed in a 65 year old, 
     seismically at-risk facility potentially impacting food 
     quality and safety, and placing veterans at risk. Renovation 
     of Building 300 was originally included in the scope of the 
     major project, but VA has determined that new construction 
     would be more cost-effective than the originally planned 
     renovation. The new Food Services facility will be efficient, 
     purpose-built, and centrally located adjacent to the 
     inpatient facility. VA has estimated that the total cost for 
     new construction of the approximately 25,000 gross square 
     foot Food Services facility is $35,000,000. VA is directed to 
     utilize $35,000,000 of the remaining funds from the West Los 
     Angeles, California Seismic Corrections major construction 
     project for construction of the Food Service facility. 
     Further, it is expected that the vacated Building 300 site 
     will be used to support the Department's stated goal of 
     developing at least 1,200 housing units on the campus by 
     2026. VA is directed to provide to the Committees no later 
     than 60 days after enactment of this Act an estimated 
     schedule for completion of the Food Services facility.
       Strategic Capital Investment Plan (SCIP).--It is 
     appreciated that VA has consulted with the Committees and 
     will be modifying its future capital budget and long term 
     capital plan, with its submission to include a clearer 
     presentation of its capital needs, by year, over the next 
     five years. In addition, VA will make improvements to the 
     congressional justification to make it a more usable and 
     understandable document. This additional information will 
     provide more clarity on VA's future capital plans. An example 
     of a presentation that accurately reflects the priority 
     projects from the SCIP that will actually be funded in the 
     request is the ``Active Development Major Construction 
     Projects''' on page 8.2 11 of Volume 4 of the fiscal year 
     2018 justification volumes. VA is encouraged to place such 
     charts in a more prominent place in the justifications. VA is 
     also encouraged to ensure that the funds requested for 
     projects (major, minor, leases, and non-recurring 
     maintenance) that are presented in congressional 
     justification documents are in fact allocated to those 
     projects for execution. VA is directed to report quarterly on 
     the allocation and execution of such funds for the identified 
     projects and clearly identify any changes.
       Vacant and underutilized buildings and structures.--In June 
     2017, the Secretary announced plans to initiate disposal or 
     reuse actions for 430 vacant buildings in VA's real property 
     inventory in order to decrease the maintenance of buildings 
     VA does not need and reinvest the savings. The Secretary also 
     announced a review of 784 non-vacant but underutilized 
     buildings. While the Department's initiative to review the 
     utility of VA property is commendable, the process by which 
     the list of buildings and structures was created was not 
     transparent. The Department is directed to submit a report to 
     the Committees no later than 90 days after enactment of this 
     Act that includes the following elements: (1) an explanation 
     of the process and methodology used to determine, record, and 
     validate which buildings and structures in VA's real property 
     portfolio are vacant, mostly vacant, or underutilized, and 
     their physical condition; (2) an explanation of the process 
     by which those property disposal analyses and plans were 
     developed and coordinated with, and within, each VISN; (3) a 
     cost-benefit analysis of the Department's ongoing real 
     property disposal plans, both in terms of this immediate 
     disposal action, and in aggregate; (4) a discussion of the 
     impact of historic designations of buildings and structures 
     on the Department's ability to manage its real property 
     portfolio; and (5) a certification that the disposal of these 
     identified properties will have no significant adverse impact 
     on the Department's ability to provide health care and 
     benefits for veterans.
       National realignment strategy.--It is understood the 
     Department, as part of a national realignment strategy of VA 
     services, will continue to reevaluate and scrutinize the 
     utility of facilities and property as well as the healthcare 
     services available at VA facilities and available through 
     non-Department healthcare providers. The Department is 
     prohibited from diminishing healthcare services at existing 
     VHA medical facilities as part of a planned realignment of VA 
     services until the Secretary provides justification to the 
     Committees.


                      CONSTRUCTION, MINOR PROJECTS

       The agreement provides $342,570,000 for Construction, Minor 
     Projects. The agreement makes this funding available for five 
     years. Included within the total is $193,610,000 for the 
     Veterans Health Administration; $97,950,000 for the National 
     Cemetery Administration; $29,895,000 for the Veterans 
     Benefits Administration; and $21,115,000 for General 
     Administration--Staff Offices.
       In addition, $425,000,000 is provided for minor 
     construction projects in section 255 to remain available 
     until expended.
       Expenditure plan.--The agreement includes a directive for 
     the Department to provide an expenditure plan no later than 
     30 days after the enactment of this Act. This expenditure 
     plan shall include a complete list of minor construction 
     projects to be supported with the fiscal year 2018 
     appropriation. The plan shall be updated six months and 
     twelve months after enactment.


       GRANTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF STATE EXTENDED CARE FACILITIES

       The agreement provides $110,000,000 for Grants for 
     Construction of State Extended Care Facilities, to remain 
     available until expended.
       The agreement includes in section 253 a provision ensuring 
     that the priority order for eligible and approved, but 
     unfunded, State projects in 2017 is not disrupted by priority 
     designated for approved 2018 projects.
       The agreement includes section 255 which provides an 
     additional $575,000,000 for grants

[[Page H2821]]

     for construction of State extended care facilities to be 
     available until expended. This funding, coupled with the base 
     funding of $110,000,000 and fiscal year 2017 carryover should 
     be sufficient to support the entire existing backlog of 
     approved State applications.
       VA is encouraged to prioritize the needs of rural States in 
     its allocation of funding for State homes by: (1) including 
     consideration of rural mileage access in its ``great need for 
     beds to be established'' at a State home; (2) considering the 
     unique needs of small States with a single facility; and (3) 
     prioritizing large rural States where veterans may live 
     hundreds of miles from the nearest facility.


             GRANTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF VETERANS CEMETERIES

       The agreement provides $45,000,000 for Grants for 
     Construction of Veterans Cemeteries, to remain available 
     until expended.


                       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

             (Including Transfers and Rescissions of Funds)

       The agreement includes section 201 allowing for the 
     transfer of funds among the three mandatory accounts.
       The agreement includes section 202 allowing for the 
     transfer of funds among the four medical accounts.
       The agreement includes section 203 allowing salaries and 
     expenses funds to be used for related authorized purposes.
       The agreement includes section 204 restricting the accounts 
     that may be used for the acquisition of land or the 
     construction of any new hospital or home.
       The agreement includes section 205 limiting the use of 
     funds in the Medical Services account only for entitled 
     beneficiaries unless reimbursement is made to the Department.
       The agreement includes section 206 allowing for the use of 
     certain mandatory appropriations accounts for payment of 
     prior year accrued obligations for those accounts.
       The agreement includes section 207 allowing the use of 
     appropriations available in this title to pay prior year 
     obligations.
       The agreement includes section 208 allowing the Department 
     to use surplus earnings from the National Service Life 
     Insurance Fund, the Veterans' Special Life Insurance Fund, 
     and the United States Government Life Insurance Fund to 
     administer these programs.
       The agreement includes section 209 allowing the Department 
     to cover the administrative expenses of enhanced-use leases 
     and provides authority to obligate these reimbursements in 
     the year in which the proceeds are received.
       The agreement includes section 210 limiting the amount of 
     reimbursement the Office of Resolution Management, the Office 
     of Employment Discrimination Complaint Adjudication, the 
     Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection, and 
     the Office of Diversity and Inclusion can charge other

   DIVISION K--DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AND RELATED 
                   PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018

       In implementing this agreement, Federal departments, 
     agencies, commissions, and other entities are directed to 
     comply with the directives, reporting requirements, and 
     instructions contained in H. Rept. 115-253 (House report) 
     accompanying H.R. 3362 (House bill) and S. Rept. 115-152 
     (Senate report) accompanying S. 1780 (Senate bill) as though 
     stated in this explanatory statement, unless specifically 
     directed to the contrary.
       This explanatory statement, while repeating some House and 
     Senate report language for emphasis or clarification, does 
     not negate language in such reports unless expressly provided 
     herein. Language expressing an opinion or making an 
     observation in the House or Senate reports represents the 
     view of the respective committee unless specifically endorsed 
     in this explanatory statement. In cases in which the House 
     and Senate reports provide contradictory directives or 
     instructions that are not addressed in this explanatory 
     statement, such directives or instructions are negated.
       Reports required to be submitted pursuant to the Act, 
     including reports required by this explanatory statement and 
     the House and Senate reports, may not be consolidated to 
     include responses to multiple requirements in a single 
     report, except following consultation with the Committees on 
     Appropriations.
       In lieu of the tables contained in the House and Senate 
     reports, the tables contained in this explanatory statement 
     shall guide departments, agencies, commissions, and other 
     entities when allocating funds.
       Section 7019 requires that amounts designated in the 
     respective tables referenced in this explanatory statement 
     for funds appropriated in titles III through V shall be made 
     available in such designated amounts, unless otherwise 
     provided for in the Act, and shall be the basis of the report 
     required by section 653(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
     1961 (FAA) (the 653(a) report), where applicable. The section 
     also includes limited authority to deviate from such 
     specified amounts and continues language similar to prior 
     years including exceptions to the application of the 
     requirements of such section for amounts designated in tables 
     included in this explanatory statement for International 
     Military Education and Training and Global Health Programs, 
     and funds for which the initial period of availability has 
     expired.
       Proposed deviations from tables in titles I and II in this 
     explanatory statement are subject to the regular notification 
     procedures of the Committees on Appropriations, unless an 
     exception or deviation authority is specifically provided 
     herein.
       For the purposes of the Act, the term ``regular 
     notification procedures of the Committees on Appropriations'' 
     means such Committees are notified not less than 15 days in 
     advance of the initial obligation of funds.
       For purposes of the Act, the term ``prior consultation'' 
     shall mean a pre-decisional engagement between a relevant 
     Federal agency and the Committees on Appropriations during 
     which such Committees are provided a meaningful opportunity 
     to provide relevant facts and opinions to inform the use of 
     funds; the development, content, or conduct of a program or 
     activity; or a decision to be taken.
       In meeting the requirements of section 7076(e) of the Act, 
     the Department of State and the United States Agency for 
     International Development (USAID) shall include in 
     congressional budget justifications (CBJs) the justifications 
     for multi-year availability for funds requested under 
     Diplomatic and Consular Programs and Operating Expenses. The 
     Department of State, USAID, and other agencies are also 
     directed to include in CBJs the information included in the 
     Introduction of the Senate report under Congressional Budget 
     Request and Justifications, as applicable.
       The Department of State, USAID, and other agencies funded

     decision making processes regarding RDMA's Mission Management 
     Assessment and the proposed closure of the Mission. While a 
     review of RDMA is appropriate, particularly its role in

     operations, and programs. The USAID Administrator is directed 
     to review USAID actions regarding RDMA from November 2016 to 
     the present, inform the appropriate congressional committees 
     of specific findings and recommendations, and provide 
     supporting documents. The review should include consultation

       Domestic Resource Mobilization.--Funds appropriated by the 
     Act under title III should be made available for USAID to

     new partnerships which should be competed and awarded not 
     later than one year after enactment of the Act. Despite 
     congressional directives in prior years, USAID has not 
     sufficiently responded to the demand for higher education

------------------------------------------------------------------------

       The Act provides not less than $10,000,000 for Egyptian 
     students with high financial need to attend not-for-profit 
     institutions of higher education. Such institutions must meet

     institutional accreditation by a regional accrediting agency 
     recognized by the United States Department of Education.
       For the purpose of the certification required under

     Giulio Regeni.
       The agreement requires that an assessment of the Government 
     of Egypt's compliance with United Nations Security Council 
     Resolution 2270 and other such resolutions regarding North 
     Korea be included in the report required to accompany any 
     waiver exercised by the Secretary of State pursuant to 
     subsection (a)(3)(B). Illicit arms sales and trafficking are

     security and global stability.

     extremism, strengthening democracy, and encouraging economic 
     opportunities. The Secretary of State or USAID Administrator, 
     as appropriate, shall include funds allocated for this 
     purpose in the spend plan submitted pursuant to section 
     7076(b) of the Act.

     under International Military Education and Training for 
     assistance for Jordan.

                 TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

                        Office of the Secretary


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

       The agreement provides $112,813,000 for the salaries and 
     expenses of the Office of the Secretary. The agreement 
     includes funding by office as specified below, and offices 
     are to manage staffing levels within the amounts provided. 
     Funds are available for transfer between all offices under 
     certain conditions.

       Consumer protections.--The Department has, in recent years, 
     initiated a process to establish more transparency in 
     displaying the total prices of airfare tickets and related 
     charges. Whether consumers are purchasing directly from the 
     airlines or through ticket agents, consumers should have 
     clear and accurate pricing information when choosing among 
     various air transportation options. Currently, fees for 
     additional services can be difficult to determine when 
     searching for airfares, and, as a result, consumers may be 
     unable to understand the true cost of travel when comparing 
     prices. To enhance consumers' choices and provide consumers 
     with full airline ticket pricing information, the agreement 
     directs the Department to work in collaboration with 
     industry, consumers, and other stakeholders to establish 
     guidelines which should lead to airlines or any for-profit 
     seller of commercial air transportation displaying, on an 
     airline's website or any travel metasearch website with which 
     the airline is partnered, full ticketing charges, including, 
     but not limited to, seat price, any additional fees the 
     consumer will pay per piece of baggage or per seat upgrade, 
     and optional flight insurance costs. As a result, all the 
     charges should be clear to the consumer, at the time of the 
     initial search, and the anticipated total charges fully 
     disclosed. The Secretary is directed to provide a report to 
     the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the 
     progress being made to establish these guidelines within 180 
     days of enactment of this Act.


                        RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY

       The agreement provides $23,465,109 for the Office of the 
     Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology, of which 
     $2,618,000 shall remain available until September 30, 2020.
       University transportation centers.--The agreement provides 
     $15,000,000 in additional funding for the University 
     Transportation Center (UTC) program as authorized under the 
     FAST Act. This additional funding is for competitive grants 
     for a national center for congestion research, focusing on 
     congestion relief, and a national center for infrastructure 
     research, focusing on improving the durability and extending 
     the life of transportation infrastructure. The increase is in 
     addition to amounts provided for fiscal year 2018 by the FAST 
     Act for a total UTC funding level of $90,000,000. The 
     agreement continues to direct the Department to award no less 
     than $3,000,000 of the amounts provided under the FAST Act

     vehicles to be conducted by existing UTC universities.

     administer the program within its current staffing levels.


     NATIONAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION AND INNOVATIVE FINANCE BUREAU

       The agreement provides $3,000,000 for the national surface 
     transportation and innovative finance bureau. The agreement 
     does not make an additional $3,000,000 available by transfer 
     from the Maritime Guaranteed (Title XI) Loan Program account 
     and does not expect the bureau to administer the Title XI

     utilizing the services of the IIPIC.


                          WORKING CAPITAL FUND

       The agreement limits expenditures for working capital fund 
     activities to $202,245,000.

     for the minority business center program for administrative 
     expenses, including education outreach activities, monitoring 
     of existing loans, and modification of existing loans. No 
     funding is provided to support the subsidy cost of new loan

     is provided as those functions are administered by the Small 
     Business Administration.

     core responsibility of safety oversight and to take action if 
     a systemic airworthiness noncompliance performance issue has 
     been identified and documented. The agreement recognizes 
     that, for safety oversight, the FAA considers a variety of 
     mechanisms, including inspections, whistleblower alerts, and 
     customer safety concerns.
       Contract towers.--The agreement includes $165,000,000 for 
     the contract tower program and establishes new requirements 
     for the FAA to expedite entry into the program for towers 
     that have met cost-benefit requirements.
       Controller hiring.--The agreement directs the FAA to 
     continue to update the House and Senate Committees on 
     Appropriations on the diversity of the controller workforce, 
     as specified in House Report 115-237, and to report on 
     workforce attrition, as specified in Senate Report 115-138, 
     within 120 days of enactment of this Act.
       Cyber security.--The agreement provides $24,000,000 in the 
     finance and management activity to address cyber security 
     requirements for the air traffic control system, as well as 
     other critical systems at the FAA.
       Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)--Electronic registration.--
     The agreement notes the progress the FAA has made within the 
     past year creating a new electronic registration system for 
     UAS. The FAA has provided regular updates to the House and 
     Senate Committees on Appropriations, and therefore, the 
     agreement no longer directs the FAA to provide an update 
     within 120 days of enactment of this Act.

     and within 120 days of enactment of this Act, the Secretary 
     shall develop a holistic HAV/ADAS research spend plan that 
     advances DOT's understanding of HAV and ADAS technologies to 
     the benefit of both commercial motor vehicle and light duty 
     vehicle safety and is consistent with the comprehensive plan 
     developed pursuant to GAO's recommendation. The research 
     should leverage the expertise of the private sector to 
     identify methods and criteria for measuring the cyber 
     security assurance levels deployed in autonomous vehicles. 
     The Secretary is expected to prioritize research topics that 
     fill gaps in research being conducted by the private sector, 
     have the strongest potential to advance the safe deployment 
     of HAV and ADAS technologies, and deliver the highest net 
     benefits to road safety. The research spend plan shall 
     identify research topics and goals, estimated

[[Page H2876]]

     costs per topic, estimated time of completion for each goal, 
     the lead modal administration for each topic, as well as 
     roles and responsibilities of any supporting modal 
     administrations. The Secretary is directed to certify in the 
     spend plan that all funded activities shall be coordinated 
     with ongoing research funded across the Department and shall 
     supplement and not supplant ongoing AV and ADAS research 
     including NHTSA's vehicle safety and connected vehicle 
     research programs.
       Of the total amount provided, not less than $60,000,000 
     shall be used for grants and cooperative agreements to fund 
     demonstration projects that test the feasibility and safety 
     of HAV and ADAS deployments, as well as necessary 
     administrative expenses. The Secretary is directed to solicit 
     applications within 180 days of enactment of this Act and to 
     make funding awards within one year of enactment of this Act. 
     The Secretary is directed to include state, local, and tribal 
     governments, transit agencies and authorities, metropolitan 
     planning organizations, other subdivisions of state or local 
     governments, or a multijurisdictional group thereof, 
     including entities designated as automated vehicle proving 
     grounds, as eligible applicants. The Secretary may also 
     include academic institutions or research institutions as 
     eligible, but shall not award funds to private companies. The 
     Department is expected to include as eligible activities the 
     following: technologies associated with autonomous vehicles 
     and other collision avoidance technologies, including systems 
     using cellular technology; advanced safety systems, including 
     vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure 
     communications; advanced mobility and access technologies, 
     such as dynamic ridesharing and information systems to 
     support human services for elderly and disabled individuals; 
     dynamic road network mapping; roadway marking and signage; 
     community education and outreach; and transportation data 
     collection and analysis. In reviewing applications and making 
     funding awards, the Secretary is directed to award no more 
     than $10,000,000 to a single grantee, no more than 
     $15,000,000 to grantees within a single state, and not less 
     than $20,000,000 to entities designated as automated vehicle 
     proving grounds. The Secretary is directed to select projects 
     that serve a variety of communities, including urban, 
     suburban, and rural environments, and that serve a variety of 
     transportation markets including freight, personal mobility, 
     and mass transit. The Secretary is directed to prioritize 
     projects that test applications with the greatest potential 
     to serve transportation-challenged populations, including the 
     elderly and individuals with disabilities. For all funded 
     projects, the Secretary is expected to require grantees to 
     gather and share relevant data with the Department, subject 
     to appropriate protections for confidential business 
     information, to aid DOT research efforts, and to inform 
     future policies and standards.
       Of the total amount provided, up to $1,500,000 shall be for 
     the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the 
     Secretary of Labor, to conduct a comprehensive analysis of 
     the impact ADAS and HAV technologies on drivers and operators 
     of commercial motor vehicles, including labor displacement, 
     within one year of enactment of this Act. The analysis shall 
     include stakeholder outreach and examine: (1) reduced 
     situational awareness caused by the operation of these 
     vehicles and options for mitigating such safety risks; (2) 
     visibility, mobility, and safety issues of platooning; and 
     (3) minimum and recommended training requirements. The 
     analysis should also examine labor displacement from the 
     deployment of HAV and ADAS technologies, including: (1) the 
     potential pace of job loss; (2) segments of motor carrier and 
     passenger transportation that could be affected; (3) existing 
     labor market programs that link workers to employment; and 
     (4) recommendations for new public or private sector job 
     training opportunities. The analysis shall not impede or 
     delay any ongoing studies at the Department related to 
     automated vehicles.

     Development (HUD) to refer all appropriations law issues to 
     the Office of Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) appropriations

     the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations and the 
     OCFO appropriations attorneys only at the invitation of those 
     Committees.


                           executive offices

------------------------------------------------------------------------

       The agreement no longer caps the staffing level of the OCFO

     agreement neither authorizes the creation of an Office of 
     Chief Operations Officer, nor allows for the Secretary to 
     transfer any funds from the proposed office into the 
     ``Information Technology Fund.'' The agreement requires the 
     Secretary to submit organizational charts within 30 days of 
     enactment of this Act that reflect the Department's and each 
     office's structure (to the branch level) on October 1, 2017 
     and on the date of enactment of this Act. The agreement notes 
     that the Department received a failing grade on the most

     and field office hiring should be prioritized to support the 
     closeout of open audits and backlog of open grants, 
     particularly as it relates to disaster recovery grants,

     overwhelming critical responses from industry and 
     stakeholders, the Department chose to cancel these

     cancellation of these solicitations for the remainder of the 
     fiscal year. In addition, the agreement directs the
