                          REMOTE AREA MEDICAL

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, this morning I met, once again, 
with representatives from Remote Area Medical, its founder and 
president, Stan Brock, and its leaders, Jeff Eastman and Anabel Evora.
  Remote Area Medical, also known as RAM, is an organization that helps 
medical professionals volunteer their services to our Nation's 
neediest.
  Over its 32 years, RAM has provided free healthcare to almost 1 
million people over the course of 862 weekend events so far. Their 
largest clinic was in Los Angeles, where over 7,000 people showed up to 
receive free dental care, eyeglasses, women's health services, and 
other free medical services.
  Unfortunately, only 12 States currently allow RAM to host these free 
clinics with volunteer medical professionals from all over the country. 
That is why I introduced H.R. 860, the HEALTHIER Act, so that people 
nationwide can have access to free healthcare clinics like RAM's.
  RAM is willing to provide these free healthcare services to several 
million more people across the Nation if only we will allow them to do 
so.
  Mr. Speaker, I commend Stan, Anabel, Jeff, and all the others who 
work with RAM for their great work, and I urge my colleagues to help to 
support my bill, the HEALTHIER Act, to help many more people receive 
free medical care.
