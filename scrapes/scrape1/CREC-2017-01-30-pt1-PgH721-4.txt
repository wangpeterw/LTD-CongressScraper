               EXECUTIVE ORDER AGAINST LEGAL IMMIGRATION

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to 
President Trump's executive order against legal immigration.
  I was sworn to uphold the Constitution and I was elected to grow our 
economy and help unify our country.
  Unfortunately, this order is an assault on the Constitution, it harms 
the economy by harming working families, and it divides the country.
  On Saturday night, I went to O'Hare International Airport to help 
American, legal permanent residents be freed from detention. They are 
people integral to the success of our community and our economy.
  I ask my honorable Republican colleagues to stand with them and 
oppose the executive order.
