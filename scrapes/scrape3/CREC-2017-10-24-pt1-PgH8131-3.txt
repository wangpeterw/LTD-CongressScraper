              HONORING BUFFALO POLICE OFFICER CRAIG LEHNER

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of 
Buffalo Police Officer Craig Lehner, who lost his life in the line of 
duty this past week. On October 13, tragedy struck. Officer Lehner went 
missing while performing underwater recovery training in the Niagara 
River. For 5 days, State, local, Federal, and Canadian agencies 
heroically assisted in the search and recovery.
  Officer Lehner lived a life of service to his country and to his 
community. A resident of south Buffalo, Lehner was a 9-year veteran of 
the Buffalo Police Department, a 16-year National Guardsman who served 
in Iraq, and a member of the canine unit.
  Those who knew Officer Lehner knew how much he loved his job and the 
people of Buffalo. Buffalo is the hardest working city in America, the 
city of good neighbors.
  In the past several days, there has been an outpouring of support for 
Officer Lehner's family and the Buffalo Police Department. I want to 
extend thanks to the many brave first responders who worked around the 
clock in recovery efforts.
  Officer Lehner, thank you for your service, and may you rest in 
peace.
