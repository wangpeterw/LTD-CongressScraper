                 FREE DR. AFRIDI FROM PAKISTANI PRISON

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the day that Osama bin Laden, the 
world's number one terrorist, met his maker was a great day in the war 
on terror. But finding America's most wanted terrorist hiding in 
Pakistan was no easy feat.
  Pakistani Dr. Afridi worked with our CIA to help determine and 
confirm Osama's hiding place in Pakistan by using DNA evidence. But 
after Osama bin Laden was killed, Pakistan threw Dr. Afridi in jail.
  Why?
  Because he helped the United States find Osama bin Laden.
  Pakistan claims to be United States' number one counterterrorism 
ally, yet they hypocritically hold this hero in a Pakistani prison. 
Pakistan is no friend of the United States. They are on the wrong side 
on the war on terror. Pakistan hid Osama bin Laden from the world.
  Dr. Afridi deserves a medal for aiding the elimination of Osama bin 
Laden, not life in prison. Pakistan should free him, and it is time to 
declare Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism.
  And that is just the way it is.
