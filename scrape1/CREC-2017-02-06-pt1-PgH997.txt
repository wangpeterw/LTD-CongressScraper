                    REMEMBERING DR. ARTHUR ROSENFELD

  (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, the energy world was saddened by the recent 
passing of Dr. Arthur Rosenfeld on January 27. I rise today to pay 
tribute to his extraordinary life and countless contributions.
  Known as the godfather of energy efficiency, Dr. Rosenfeld's efforts 
brought awareness to the tremendous benefits of efficiency. As a 
physicist at UC Berkeley, Dr. Rosenfeld became interested in efficiency 
during the 1973 oil embargo. He soon began pushing efficiency standards 
for appliances and buildings for California, and eventually for the 
entire Nation. He went on to work as an adviser at the Department of 
Energy and served on the California Energy Commission.
  According to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a 
group that Dr. Rosenfeld helped found, savings from energy efficiency 
gains have averted the need to build more than 300 large power plants 
since 1990.
  The EPA has estimated that between 1992 and 2014, its ENERGY STAR 
program, a program built on the shoulders of Dr. Rosenfeld's work, has 
helped families save over $350 billion on utility bills while reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions by more than 2.5 billion metric tons.
  The cleanest and cheapest kilowatt-hour of electricity that one may 
take advantage of is the one we do not use.
  We salute Dr. Rosenfeld.
