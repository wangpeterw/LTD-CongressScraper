                RECOGNIZING ORANGE COUNTY CIF CHAMPIONS

  (Mr. CORREA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize not one, not two, 
but three championship high school football teams in my district.
  Anaheim's own Katella High School varsity football team won their 
first ever CIF Division 11 championship victory. On December 1, the 
Katella Knights varsity football team brought a championship title to 
their school for the first time in the school's history.
  On December 2, Orange High School, another public school in my 
district, brought home the Division 13 CIF title.
  Also on December 2, Mater Dei High School's varsity football team won 
their first CIF Southern Section Division 1 title since 1999.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating these fine athletes, 
their coaches, and their outstanding football programs.
  I must say congratulations to the Knights, Panthers, and Monarchs. 
All three teams will be playing for their State titles in their 
respective divisions this Saturday.

                          ____________________
