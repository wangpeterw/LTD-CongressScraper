                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Our Father in Heaven, thank You that our life's pilgrimage is a 
process and discovery. Open our eyes today that we may see wonderful 
things in Your precepts, gaining wisdom from Your world. Help our 
lawmakers to strive to ensure that their thoughts, words, and deeds 
will please You. Today, we surrender to Your providence, trusting You 
to order our steps. Lord, teach us to illuminate our world with the 
wisdom of Your Divine insights, so that Your will may be done on Earth. 
Transform life's deserts so that they will blossom like roses. Bring 
flowing springs to the parched grounds of our lives, so that we may 
live abundantly.
  We pray in Your loving Name. Amen.
