     SENATE RESOLUTION 379--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRODUCTION OF RECORDS 
        BY THE PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS OF THE 
        COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS

  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Schumer) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 379

       Whereas, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of 
     the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs 
     conducted an investigation into the purchase and shipment of 
     illicit opioids into and throughout the United States;
       Whereas, the Subcommittee has received a request from a 
     federal law enforcement agency for access to records of the 
     Subcommittee's investigation;
       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United 
     States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no 
     evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate 
     can, by administrative or judicial process, be taken from 
     such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;
       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or 
     in the possession of the Senate is needed for the promotion 
     of justice, the Senate will take such action as will promote 
     the ends of justice consistent with the privileges of the 
     Senate: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of 
     the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee 
     on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, acting 
     jointly, are authorized to provide to law enforcement 
     officials, regulatory agencies, and other entities or 
     individuals duly authorized by federal or state governments, 
     records of the Subcommittee's investigation into the purchase 
     and shipment of illicit opioids into and throughout the 
     United States.
  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the 
distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a 
resolution on documentary production by the Permanent Subcommittee on 
Investigations, and ask for its immediate consideration.
  Mr. President, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the 
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs recently 
conducted an investigation into the purchase and shipment of illicit 
opioids into and throughout the United States. The Subcommittee has now 
received a request from the Department of Homeland Security seeking 
access to records that the Subcommittee obtained during the 
investigation.
  In keeping with the Senate's practice under its rules, this 
resolution would authorize the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of 
the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, acting jointly, to 
provide records, obtained by the Subcommittee in the course of its 
investigation, in response to this request and requests from other 
Federal or State government entities and officials with a legitimate 
need for the records.
