                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God of all creation, thank You for giving us another day.
  At the end of a very busy week, we ask Your blessing upon the Members 
of this people's House. As they prepare to return to their districts, 
may they be prepared to listen to the interests of their constituents.
  We ask Your blessing as well upon all the American people. May they 
be inclined to be active participants in the governing of our Nation 
and responsibly engaged with our democratic processes.
  May all that is done be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.

                          ____________________
