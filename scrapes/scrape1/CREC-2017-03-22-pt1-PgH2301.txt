                       STANDING AGAINST TRUMPCARE

  (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, during the last few weeks, my office has 
heard from literally hundreds of concerned Illinoisans about TrumpCare.
  I have heard from a heart attack survivor, whose prescription 
medication would go from affordable to $1,000 a day under this plan.
  I have heard from Americans ages 50 to 64--I happen to be in that 
group--who are worried about paying an age tax of five times more than 
others.
  Just in the last 24 hours, I have heard from two more groups that are 
standing against TrumpCare. And, no, they are not partisan political 
groups.
  The first is the Illinois Health and Hospital Association, which 
represents more than 200 hospitals in the State of Illinois. They 
oppose TrumpCare because it means taking health coverage away from 
hundreds of thousands of Illinoisans, while killing the jobs of another 
60,000 hardworking people in my State.
  The second group is the National Farmers Union. They understand that 
TrumpCare's drastic cuts could force hundreds of rural hospitals to 
close their doors.
  So I am left wondering, who exactly supports TrumpCare? Instead of 
throwing 24 million Americans off their coverage, let's work across the 
aisle to improve health care for all, not just the richest among us.
