  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a 
correction to appointments made on November 28, 2017, be printed in the 
Record. For the information of the Senate, this correction is clerical

     leader, pursuant to the provisions of Public Law 115-77, 
     appoints the following individuals to the Frederick Douglass 
     Bicentennial Commission: Kay Coles James of Virginia and Star 
     Parker of California.
