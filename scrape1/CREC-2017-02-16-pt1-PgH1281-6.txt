                 WHY THE MEDIA ATTACKS PRESIDENT TRUMP

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is no surprise that the media's 
credibility has hit a record low with the American people, according to 
a recent Gallup Poll.
  The media attacked President Trump because he proved their 
predictions wrong and their candidate lost. They attack him because 
they are mostly liberal Democrats and he is a conservative Republican. 
They attack him because he is reversing many of the policies of 
President Obama, whom they openly supported. They attack him because he 
is going around them, directly to the American people with his Twitter 
messages. They attack him because they can't intimidate or control him.
  The media's hate is poisoning the country.
  Wouldn't it be better for our country if the media gave the American 
people the facts rather than told them what to think?
  Wouldn't it be better for our country if the media treated the 
President fairly and without malice?
