                            VOTE EXPLANATION

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for votes 
relative to the nominations of Michael Lawrence Brown to be a U.S. 
district judge for the Northern District of Georgia and Walter David 
Counts III to be a U.S. district judge for the Western District of 
Texas.
  On vote No. 7, had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on 
confirmation of the Brown nomination.
  On vote No. 8, had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on the 
motion to invoke cloture on the Counts nomination.
  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered 
to be printed in the Record.)
