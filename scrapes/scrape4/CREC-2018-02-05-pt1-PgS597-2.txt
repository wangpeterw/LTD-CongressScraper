                         FUNDING THE GOVERNMENT

  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we are now 128 days into the fiscal year. 
For 128 days, we have failed to fulfill our basic responsibility of 
funding the government. Congress has not reached a bipartisan budget 
deal, even though, in past years, we always would have by this time. So 
the government is on autopilot.
  Across America, just as I find in Vermont, around families' kitchen 
tables, people are asking how to address the opioid crisis. Veterans 
are asking us why it takes months to get a doctor's appointment at the 
VA. People are worrying about having to stop working if they can't get 
quality and affordable childcare. So many have stopped me in the street 
to talk about how they are struggling to pay off college loans.
  Well, it has been 128 days. Instead of saying: We will get to it, the 
check is in the mail, let's actually get to it, we have had four 
continuing resolutions. It is about time we get serious about a 
bipartisan deal and get the budget going. Let's, for once, get past the
