               WE SHOULD NOT ROLL BACK FLIGHT SAFETY LAWS

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, 9 years ago, Continental Flight 
3407 crashed in western New York, killing all aboard and one on the 
ground.
  The National Transportation Safety Board found that the cause of the 
crash was pilot error and poor training.
  Prior to the enactment of flight safety laws, there were two levels 
of safety: one more stringent for the commercial carriers that we are 
all familiar with, and one considerably less stringent for the ones 
that we are less aware of. There were two levels of safety.
  Now there is only one because of the courageous work of the families 
of the survivors who came to Congress and helped Congress enact very 
strict safety regulations. We have not had a commercial crash that 
ended up in fatalities since that time.
  It is important that we not roll back these safety standards, as they 
are based on the National Transportation Safety Board's findings and 
the work of this Congress.
