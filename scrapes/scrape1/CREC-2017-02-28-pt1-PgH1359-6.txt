                 LET'S HELP OUR GREAT NATION STAY GREAT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Correa) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, tonight at the President's address, I will 
be joined by a young man, Eliel Aguillon, a new American, in the great 
tradition of this great country.
  Eliel grew up surrounded by poverty, yet he found his path to the 
American Dream through hard work and education. Eliel is my neighbor. 
He attended the same public high school

that my daughter attends. He is the first person in his family to 
attend college, and his goal is to earn a Ph.D. in engineering and to 
address our Nation's affordable housing crisis. Today, Eliel encourages 
young students to pursue careers in science and math.
  Eliel is a DACA student. Let me repeat. Eliel is a DACA student. He 
and his family left Mexico when he was 7 years old to pursue the 
American Dream through hard work and dedication.
  We must ensure that Eliel and hundreds of other hardworking DACA 
students stay in America, the only home they have known, so that they 
can also contribute to the greatness of our great country. DACA 
students are our new Americans.
  Let us help our great Nation stay great. Let us do the right thing. 
Let's give our DACA students and other hardworking taxpayers in our 
Nation a pathway to citizenship.
