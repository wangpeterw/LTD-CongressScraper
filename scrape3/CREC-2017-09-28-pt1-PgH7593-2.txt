                            SUPPORTING DACA

  (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, the decision to end DACA goes against the very 
core of our American values of the American Dream. The future of 
800,000 young people who study, serve in our military, and contribute 
to our economy, and who serve and protect America is at risk.
  DREAMers are understandably worried, anxious, depressed, petrified, 
and terrified about what will happen 6 months from now.
  DREAMers like Juan in my district who was brought here at a young age 
is a medical student and wants nothing more than to be a doctor and 
save lives--even your life. For Juan and nearly 1 million DREAMers like 
him, we must act. That is why I have joined House and Senate leaders to 
demand a vote on the bipartisan Dream Act.
  Mr. Speaker, put politics aside and bring the Dream Act to the floor 
for a vote as soon as possible.
  Rather than ending the DACA program and tearing families apart, 
instead, let's work together toward comprehensive immigration reform 
that will secure our Nation's borders, keep our citizens safe, help our 
economy, and fix our immigration system.
