                             LET'S VOTE NOW

  (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge House Republicans to 
put aside partisan politics and pass the Dream Act.
  This fall, I have shared story after story from the House floor of 
young Oregonians who have benefited from DACA. Sitting at this desk 
behind me is a discharge petition which will bring a vote on the Dream 
Act now.
  Unfortunately, this will require 24 of my Republican colleagues to 
join us in support. As of today, we only have two. This is despite the 
fact, if leadership put that bill on the floor, it would have 
overwhelming bipartisan support. We must act on this.
  It is clear that the administration is, at best, problematic. When 
asked about the status of DACA, this President said: They shouldn't be 
very worried; I have got a big heart. But it was only a few short 
months later that he announced an end to the DACA program.
  The Dream Act must be passed by Christmas. We should do it today. 
Continuing to delay a vote on the Dream Act basically puts 800,000 
recipients at risk, is irresponsible, and puts those lives in limbo.
  These young folks are doctors and teachers. The path forward is 
foggy, at best, right now. They deserve a better future. Let's vote 
now.
