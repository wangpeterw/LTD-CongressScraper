        RECOGNIZING DEANE BOZEMAN SCHOOL FOR ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE

  (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Deane Bozeman School, a 
title I school, located in Bay County, Florida. Deane Bozeman School 
prides itself on developing boys and girls of character and as well-
educated American citizens. The school's administration, faculty, 
staff, and parents join in investing and educating over 1,300 students, 
prekindergarten through 12th grade. The result is that Deane Bozeman 
School continues a tradition of academic excellence.
  This year, Deane Bozeman School reaches yet another milestone in 
excellence by adding a fully chartered Army Junior ROTC program to its 
curriculum. As cadets, the ROTC program will develop middle and high 
school students into leaders whose characters are based on the 
fundamental values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, 
integrity, and personal courage.
  Under the leadership of Chief Warrant Officer Retired Jeff Adkins, 
these students will certainly thrive.

  Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Deane Bozeman School 
for taking such a bold step and enriching the lives of the students in 
this inaugural year of its Army ROTC program.
