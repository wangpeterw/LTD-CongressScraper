 SENATE RESOLUTION 25--DESIGNATING JANUARY 27, 2017, AS A NATIONAL DAY 
  OF REMEMBRANCE FOR PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES WHO, DURING THE COLD 
  WAR, WORKED AND LIVED DOWNWIND FROM NUCLEAR TESTING SITES AND WERE 
  ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE RADIATION EXPOSURE GENERATED BY THE ABOVE 
                     GROUND NUCLEAR WEAPONS TESTING

  Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mr. Udall, Mr. Risch, Mr. Heinrich, and Mr. 
Bennet) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary:

                               S. Res. 25

       Whereas, on January 27, 1951, the first of years of nuclear 
     weapons tests was conducted at a site known as the Nevada 
     Proving Ground, located approximately 65 miles northwest of 
     Las Vegas, Nevada;
       Whereas the extensive testing at the Nevada Proving Ground 
     occurred just years after the first nuclear weapon test, 
     which was conducted on July 16, 1945, at what is known as the 
     Trinity Atomic Test Site, located approximately 35 miles 
     south of Socorro, New Mexico;
       Whereas many people of the United States who, during the 
     Cold War, worked and lived downwind from nuclear testing 
     sites (referred to in this preamble as the ``downwinders'') 
     were adversely affected by the radiation exposure generated 
     by the above ground nuclear weapons testing, and some of the 
     downwinders sickened as a result of the radiation exposure;
       Whereas the downwinders paid a high price for the 
     development of a nuclear weapons program for the benefit of 
     the United States; and
       Whereas the downwinders deserve to be recognized for the 
     sacrifice they have made for the defense of the United 
     States: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates January 27, 2017, as a national day of 
     remembrance for people of the United States who, during the 
     Cold War, worked and lived downwind from nuclear testing 
     sites and were adversely affected by the radiation exposure 
     generated by the above ground nuclear weapons testing; and
       (2) encourages the people of the United States to support 
     and participate in appropriate ceremonies, programs, and 
     other activities to commemorate that national day of 
     remembrance.
