                    HONORING FALLEN POLICE OFFICERS

  (Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Michigan's police 
officers for their selfless service and to honor the fallen.
  Isaiah 6:8 says: ``Whom shall I send? And who will go for us? And I 
said, `Here I am. Send me.' ''
  Every time our law enforcement officers put on their uniform, they 
are saying, ``Send me.''
  In cities and small towns all over the United States, law enforcement 
officers act as our protectors, defenders, and ambassadors of peace. 
They hold that thin blue line between thriving, healthy communities and 
chaos.
  During the past few months, I have had the pleasure of getting to 
know officers serving the Escanaba, Gaylord, and Traverse City 
communities in specific, and all across the First District, and I can 
say without pause that Michiganders are in capable and caring hands.
  We owe a debt of gratitude, a debt of cooperation, and a debt of 
consistent support to our law enforcement officers.
  God rest the souls of the fallen. Keep their friends, families, and 
fellow officers in your hearts and prayers.
