12309,topic-id,451,"Mr.Speaker, today is the 19th anniversary, if you can call it an anniversary, of a shooting in the United States Capitol in which two Capitol Police officers, Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson, were killed. They were defending the Capitol, and a gunman got in and was heading towards the majority leader at the time, Tom DeLay's office. And they, in defending that office, were shot and killed.  The Speaker at the time and the Congress at the time established a Wounded Officers Fund, but they made it specific to those two fallen officers.  As we all know, on June 14, we had another shooting, although it was at a baseball practice for the charity baseball game where the Republican Members were practicing out in Alexandria, Two officers, Officers Bailey and Griner, were both seriously injured in defending the 20-some-odd Republican Members that were at practice that morning.  What this bill does, Mr.Speaker, is simply take an existing fund that was established for two officers that were killed in the line of duty and open it up, now and in the future, for Capitol Police officers who were seriously injured in the line of duty defending the Capitol and defending the  I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.Michael Doyle), the Democratic manager, for being an original sponsor with me. I want to thank every member of the Republican and Democratic baseball teams who have signed on as original sponsors.  I want to thank Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy, Steny Hoyer and Nancy Pelosi, leadership on both sides of the aisle, for making it possible to bring this bill to the floor. We introduced it last Thursday, and we are voting on it tonight; and wonder of wonders, the Senate is probably going to vote on it tomorrow, and there is a chance the President will sign it this week.                              {time}  1700  We are showing the American people that we can work together for a noble cause. As has already been pointed out, Officers Bailey and Griner both, at risk to their own lives, defended the Members, staff, and volunteers at that baseball practice on June 14.  I watched Officer Bailey run past me directly at the shooter, risking his life, and two other Alexandria Police officers who had arrived on the scene assisted him. Officer Griner was wounded but was providing covering fire, and that is when they brought down the shooter.  They are heroes. They have sustained injuries. They deserve some assistance. The American people have donated probably $600,000 or $700,000 to provide some assistance, and this technical change in the existing fund would allow that to happen.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank Mr.I hope everybody can support this.  ",CREC-2017-07-24-pt1-PgH6183.txt,62,PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATION,2017.0,24.0,May
12329,topic-id,525,"Mr.Speaker, this week, as the House of Representatives considers human trafficking legislation, I am proud to continue working with colleagues from both sides of the aisle to raise awareness on the heinous practice of human trafficking and to work together to eradicate it from our communities.  I thank my friend and classmate, Congresswoman Ann Wagner of Missouri (MO-02) for organizing tonight's Special Order  Human trafficking--where people profit from the control and exploitation of others--occurs both here at home and abroad on a daily basis.  In fact, the International Labour Organization estimates that there are 20.9 million victims of human trafficking globally--68% of them are trapped in forced labor, 26% of them are children, and 55% are women and girls.  And in my home state of Ohio, human trafficking for sex and labor is on the rise.  According to recent reports from the Polaris Project, a nonprofit that tracks trafficking in the U.and abroad, 375 Ohio trafficking cases were reported from 1,352 calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline in 2016. In 2015, there were 289 cases based on 1,070 calls. The 2016 numbers reflect a nearly four-fold increase over the Ohio figures from 2013.  While the overall increase in reporting can be partly attributed to greater awareness of the national hotline, we know, and officials confirm, that trafficking is, unfortunately, chronically under-reported.  We must do more to help trafficking victims and to encourage people when they see something that looks like an individual is being trafficked, that they say something.  Victims of human trafficking often live in the shadows of our society, so it is up to all of us to help identify and rescue victims of trafficking.  While human trafficking spans all demographics, there are some circumstances or vulnerabilities that lead to a higher susceptibility to victimization.  Runaway and homeless youth, as well as victims of domestic violence or sexual assault, are frequently targeted by traffickers.  Men and women, boys and girls, who are all alone, abused, and often believe they have nowhere to go.  Well, we can help. We must do more to assist victims of trafficking and provide them with the services and treatment necessary to regain control of their lives.  We must also ensure the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking crimes is focused on the traffickers, the people assisting the traffickers, and the purchasers--the individuals who are the real criminals in the enterprise.  Almost two years ago, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act--or the JVTA--was signed into law. The JVTA is helping to update efforts to combat the scourge of human trafficking and provided essential resources to survivors and law enforcement officials.  I am proud to have had a provision included in this comprehensive legislation and to have taken part in its drafting, passage, and enactment.  Mr.Speaker, since the JVTA's enactment, we have witnessed important achievements, but we cannot stop here.  We must continue to work together to eradicate human trafficking and support the victims. Tonight, I pledge to continue to working with my colleagues to raise awareness and fight back against human trafficking, because as we all know, one victim of human trafficking is one too many.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgH4563.txt,2153,WOUNDED OFFICERS RECOVERY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,24.0,July

In the First District of Michigan, which I represent, we are largely a rural district, and our district and our veterans have suffered more than most on this.  The GOOD Act utilizes a two-pronged approach to address VA's continuing struggles in recruiting and retaining their physician assistant workforce. This bill creates a pilot program to provide that pathway for veterans to receive the education necessary to become a PA while, simultaneously, requiring the VA to establish a national strategic plan to recruit and retain a robust and long-term medical staff.

Mr.Speaker, H.1967 would amend the permitting process for pumped storage hydropower projects utilizing multiple Bureau of Reclamation reservoirs.  Currently, hydropower projects involving Reclamation facilities are subject to either the FERC permitting process or the Reclamation permitting process, based on whether a Reclamation facility was originally authorized for hydropower development.  The unique nature of pumped storage projects, which require the use of multiple separate reservoirs, can mean that a single proposed project can be subject to both Reclamation and FERC's permitting processes, since different reservoirs are under different agency jurisdiction.  If enacted, H.1967 would subject pumped storage projects using multiple Reclamation reservoirs to just the Reclamation permitting process instead of the process for both Reclamation and  Like FERC, Reclamation's permitting project requires authorized pumped storage projects to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, and other statutory requirements.  While I believe that H.1967 is a commonsense bill and I support its passage, I also support ongoing efforts to incorporate feedback from the Colville Tribe in Washington State as this bill advances to the Senate and proceeds through the legislative process.

Agent Terry's family recently testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that the Obama administration continually denied all efforts to release any additional information about his death. They are now calling on President Trump to finally unseal the records and expose the dirty secrets behind this tragic scandal.  It is shameful that the Trump administration has been repeatedly accused of collusion and coverups based on unsourced rumors, while little attention was given to the Obama administration's blatant efforts to cover up the truth into Agent Terry's murder.  Under Operation Fast and Furious, roughly 2,000 firearms were purposely sold to criminals, which were later smuggled into Mexico, and have been linked to multiple homicides.

12347,topic-id,833,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about the introduction of the bipartisan Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act, or CARERS The bill would make our Federal laws dealing with medical marijuana fairer and help ensure that Americans have access to the care they need. I am proud to introduce this legislation, and I want to thank Senators Rand Paul and Kirsten Gillibrand for working with me on this bill. I also want to thank Senators Lisa Murkowski, Al Franken, and Mike Lee for joining the[[Page S3557]]CARERS Act as original cosponsors and Representatives Steve Cohen and Don Young for introducing a House companion bill.  Right now, regardless of whether you are in a State that has legalized medical marijuana, it is illegal under Federal law. This inconsistency puts growers, distributors, and patients at great risk of Federal prosecution even though they are in compliance with State law.  In 2013, the Department of Justice issued guidance to Federal prosecutors to refrain from prosecuting individuals that use, purchase, or sell marijuana in States where it is legal as long as a State regulatory framework exists that maintains certain standards, such as a ban on sales to minors. As a result of this guidance, more and more States have taken steps to legalize medical marijuana.  Sadly, despite this guidance, the inability of the Federal Government to be aligned with States regarding the legality of medical marijuana has resulted in confusion and uncertainty for State lawmakers and the public about what the law requires. This lack of clarity is only part of the problem. Individual users of medical marijuana in States with legalized medical marijuana continue to be targeted by the Drug Enforcement  And now, more than ever, I am especially concerned with Attorney General Jeff Sessions as our Nation's top law enforcement officer. His radical stance on marijuana is way out of the mainstream, and he has taken steps to reinvigorate the failed War on Recently, he wrote a letter to Senate and House leadership asking them not to renew an appropriations rider that prevents the Justice Department from spending money on cases that involve individuals who are in compliance with State medical marijuana laws. He said, ``I believe it would be unwise for Congress to restrict the discretion of the Department to fund particular prosecutions, particularly in the midst of an historic drug epidemic and potentially long-term uptick in violent crime.'' Contrary to Attorney General Sessions' views, this is not a problem we can jail ourselves out of.  Individuals who use medical marijuana in States where it is legal should not fear prosecution simply based on prosecutorial discretion. It is time for Congress to act.  Today, I reintroduced the CARERS First, and most importantly, the bill would end the Federal prohibition of medical marijuana. Millions of Americans need to gain access to the medicine that works best for them. The Federal Government's current stance on medical marijuana has only created confusion and uncertainty. This bill would prohibit the Federal Government from prosecuting persons who are in compliance with State medical marijuana laws and let people gain access to the care they need.  The bill would also allow States to import cannabidiol, commonly called CBD for short. CBD is an oil substance made from a marijuana plant that contains virtually no THC--meaning you experience no high from the drug. CBD is the medicine so many children need--along with thousands of other individuals with Dravet syndrome--to control seizures. We must make this important drug more available so people can access the medication they need.  The bill would promote research. A large problem for our Nation is that not enough research exists on the impact of medical marijuana. We know there are legitimate medical uses of the drug, but we can learn much more. We need to allow experts to access the drug to conduct tests and clinical trials to fully understand the effects of the drug and how it can best be utilized. This will only benefit the doctors that prescribe it, the lawmakers that regulate it, and the people that need it.  Finally, the bill would allow VA doctors to recommend medical marijuana to veterans in States that have legalized medical marijuana. Many men and women in uniform who have bravely served our Nation come home with invisible wounds of war, and they deserve the best care available. This means allowing them access to the medicine they need to heal or control their condition. Those who have served our Nation deserve to be served by us, and that means receiving the best care available.  The CARERS Act was the first medical marijuana bill introduced in the Unfortunately, we did not pass it in the last Congress, but I am hopeful that in the 115th Congress we can get this bill across the finish line and send it to the President's desk for signature.

12434,topic-id,278,"Mr.Speaker, prescription opioids and heroin addiction are ravaging our Nation, causing heartache and pain for millions of American families, and destroying our communities. This is no secret.  In my own home State of Illinois, opioids contribute to nearly 1,200 overdose deaths in 2016. Heroin played a role in those deaths of another 1,000 people, many of whom started with prescription drugs.  According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, more people die from opioid drug overdose than from homicide and motor vehicle accidents.  These aren't just numbers or statistics. The people battling addiction are moms and dads and neighbors and students. Addiction doesn't care about your race, your gender, your income, your political leanings. It is an issue that affects everyone because it impacts every community and every person we love.  Congress took an important step last year in passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery This bipartisan legislation, which was signed into law, created a coordinated and balanced strategy for communities to tackle issues regarding prescription and opioid abuse in their communities.  Just last month, Congress voted to fund programs designed to prevent and treat opioid and heroin use. But the real leaders of this effort will be citizens in our local community. Many local police departments now offer drug drop boxes. Parents, especially, are on the front line of this issue and are responsible to educate our children about the dangers of prescription medication.  If you see someone struggling with addiction, please encourage them to speak to their local drug and alcohol commissioners.

12343,topic-id,1080,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition, understanding that the vote has been taken but wanting to speak on the record about the nomination of Governor Terry Branstad to be Ambassador to the People's Republic of  This is a critical diplomatic post today, perhaps more than at any time in our history. It has certainly been increasingly important through every administration as China's expansionist views of the world grow, as China's economy becomes more and more dominant in East Asia, and as China, by not playing fair on economic issues, has caused, with the acquiescence of many, many American companies, far too many jobs to move there.  We have seen sort of a new business model for American business that has been around now for a quarter of a century--something that economic history never showed us before--where companies shut down in places like Willowick or Toledo or Dayton or Springfield, OH, and move overseas. They are getting tax breaks to do it. They build plants there and sell those products back into Ohio or into Oklahoma or into the United States in the other 48 Unfortunately, China has been part of that, while U.companies have acted, in many cases, irresponsibly, and China has played into it.  We have serious issues with China, from their currency manipulation to trade cheating that hurts the American steel industry to their dismal, documented record on human rights and religious freedom. On all of these fronts, we need to take a firm position with We need an ambassador who will advocate for American workers, for American businesses, and, yes, for American values. I don't believe Governor Branstad will be that ambassador.  When it comes to putting American workers first, Governor Branstad's record, frankly, is appalling. How can he advocate for American workers and for expanding the rights of working people around the world when he fought against it at home in his home State of Iowa? As Governor, Terry Branstad waged war on collective bargaining rights. He recently signed legislation that takes away the right of public employees to bargain for fair wages and for healthcare rights that they have guaranteed for 45 years--rights that were enshrined by a law signed by a former Republican  When the State Department measures labor rights in countries around the world, they look at whether a country's laws allow workers to organize and engage in collective bargaining. China's results have always been poor. They have been criticized for deplorable working conditions. How can our country--how can the United States--lead by example when it comes to ensuring that hard work pays off when the man representing us in Beijing, when the man representing us at the negotiating table is taking away workers' rights in our own country? Don't think for a moment that the Chinese will not remind the American Ambassador of what he has done with workers' rights in his home State, as we perhaps argue--it is unclear if we will now, but perhaps we will argue--for expanding workers' rights in  I appreciate the questions for the record that Senator Cardin submitted to Governor Unfortunately, his answers were vague and did nothing to address the serious concerns that many of us have.  The President made a lot of campaign promises when it comes to standing up to I have been clear since the days after the election, when I called the President-elect's transition team, and in conversations since then with President Trump and with the U.Trade Representative, Ambassador Lighthizer, that I want to work with them on that--with the President and with the U.Trade  After his meeting with Chinese President Xi, I sent a letter to President Trump outlining steps he should take for fighting for American workers, particularly in the steel industry, in his 100-day plan on trade. But the person negotiating that 100-day plan needs to have America's workers first in their mind. Governor Branstad has made it clear that multinational corporations, not ordinary American workers--not people in Youngstown, Warren, Steubenville, and Columbus--will have his ear.  We can see corporate fingerprints on these trade agreements. Rarely do we see workers at the table advocating for workers' rights. We only see trade policy that reflects the interests of large corporations. Those corporations then use these trade policies to outsource jobs around the world.  It is not just workers' rights where China falls woefully short and where we need to take a tough stand. China's record on human rights and religious freedom is unacceptable. Our Ambassador needs to make that clear. When U.officials represent us in the world, they must not only be advocates for our business interests--they should be that, to be sure--but they must also be critical advocates on behalf of workers and on behalf of the Nation's values--values like freedom of speech, freedom to organize, and the freedom to challenge powerful special interests. These are values that go to the core of who we are as the American people. But, again, Governor Branstad has not led by example. He has waged war on women's access to healthcare.  Just this week, Planned Parenthood announced that they will be forced to[[Page S3074]]shut down four Iowa health clinics because of the law signed by Governor Branstad that blocked its funding. These clinics served 15,000 patients over the past 3 years--not providing abortions. The great majority of these 15,000 patients got primary care, preventive care, contraceptive coverage--all the things that women in every community in this country demand.  Many live in rural areas. Many have nowhere else to turn for care. Now, where do all of these women go for cancer screenings, diabetes screenings, and other preventive care? Yet Governor Branstad has signed legislation taking it away, forcing the shutdown of these clinics.  Access to healthcare is a basic right in this country, and it should be in all 50 We need to take care of American patients and American workers and set an example for the world. Our diplomats must be that example. But, instead, we now have a man at the negotiating table who again and again and again has proven that he wants to turn back the clock on healthcare and on workers' rights.  We need an ambassador with a record of championing American values. Only then can we be confident that he will stand up to China and put Ohio workers and American workers first. Frankly, I question Governor Branstad's ability to be that ambassador--to represent the people of this great country in the People's Republic of                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-22-pt1-PgS3073-4.txt,2106,HEALTHCARE DEBATE IN OUR NATION,2017.0,22.0,July

Pride, equality, freedom--these values are at the core of Pride Month for LGBTQ individuals and families in Maryland and across the United Every American deserves the same freedoms, the same opportunities and the same protections under the law to love whom they love.

LGBTQ individuals have enriched our communities and made us a stronger nation.  Fear, apprehension, caution--those of us who defend civil rights every day understand that these are discouraging and uncertain times. It pains me to say the full admission of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning individuals into society has yet to be granted. The open expression of one's sexual orientation and gender identity has been--and oftentimes still is--wrought with discrimination and hardship.  Despite the highs of Windsor and Obergefell, the LGBTQ community feels the pain of the senseless shooting at Pulse nightclub 1 year ago, blatant discrimination in States like North Carolina, and the incomprehensible abandonment of transgender students in schools, and the decades of injustice that reach back far beyond The results of last year's Presidential election brought an unwanted chill to the winds of momentum that had swept through the LGBTQ community. Insensitive language from the current administration adds an ominous cloud over the potential for future progress.  To all of my lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning sisters and brothers, I say this: You are not alone. I support you. I will fight alongside you. We will not allow extremism to take away the inherent rights afforded to each and every one of us. Equality and liberty will prevail over any who would use hate and bigotry to frighten or intimidate others.  I have joined with nearly half of the U.Senate as a sponsor of the Equality Act, 1006, historic, comprehensive Federal legislation that would ensure full Federal nondiscrimination equality for LGBTQ individuals by adding sexual orientation and gender identity to other protected classes, such as race or religion, in existing Federal laws. Despite major advances in equality for LGBTQ Americans, including nationwide marriage equality, the majority of States still do not have explicit LGBTQ nondiscrimination protection laws. The Equality Act would fill in the gap by explicitly banning discrimination in a host of areas, including employment, housing, public[[Page S3855]]accommodations, jury service, access to credit, and Federal funding.  When the White House broke more than a decade of tradition by failing to recognize June as LGBTQ Pride Month, I joined my colleagues in picking up the mantle by introducing the first-ever Senate resolution recognizing June as LGBTQ Pride The resolution notes major milestones in the fight for equal treatment of LGBTQ Americans and resolves to continue efforts to achieve full equality for LGBTQ individuals.  As we build a new future of equality for all, despite the current headwinds, it is important that we learn from our Nation's past and use it as a source of strength and a teachable moment for those unaware of the history the LGBTQ community and what our Nation has been through. It is my firm hope that we are not seeing a redux of a McCarthy-like rise in political-driven discrimination.  For this reason, I was taken back a bit at the confirmation hearings of Rex Tillerson and Nikki Haley, who are now serving as America's top diplomats, that neither of them would say the phrase ``LGBTQ.'' Following that peculiarity, it has been widely reported that the Trump administration has scrubbed LGBTQ content from various Federal Government websites--in some cases changing the agency's official nondiscrimination policy.  Juxtaposed with the Obama administration that lit up the White House in rainbow lights during Pride month and backed up those concrete actions of support, this attempt to erase LGBTQ individuals from government was disturbing. I was alarmed because I knew that it had been tried before during the McCarthy era. It had a damaging effect on U.foreign policy back then, and it cannot be repeated.  In what came to be known as the Lavender Scare, according to the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security, employees were forced out on the ostensible grounds that their real or perceived sexual orientation rendered them vulnerable to blackmail, prone to getting caught in ``honey traps,'' and a general security risk. Many more individuals were prevented from joining the State Department due to a screening process that was put in place to prevent those who ``seemed like they might be gay or lesbian'' from being hired.  David Johnson's ``The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government,'' University of Chicago Press, 2006, the definitive academic study of the issue, found that at least 1,000 people were dismissed from the U.Department of State alone for alleged homosexuality during the 1950s and well into the 1960s before the ``scare'' ran its course.  The Senate bears a special measure of responsibility for the Lavender Scare, as the State Department's actions were in part in response to congressional investigations into ``sex perversion of federal employees,'' reports on the employments of ``moral perverts by Government Agencies,'' and hearings or pressure placed on the Department through the appropriations process.  Last year, in my role as ranking member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I urged then-Secretary of State John Kerry to shine a spotlight on this dark period in American diplomatic history by issuing the first-ever public apology for the Department of State's targeting due to perceived sexual orientation.  This month, I introduced new legislation called the Lavender Offense Victim Exoneration Act of 2017, or the LOVE Similar to what was enacted for the men and women of our military, who also were forced to hide their real self to the world, the LOVE Act would make amends and help right the wrongs that were leveled against our U.diplomats during this un-American and unacceptable episode in our history. The Lavender Scare is a painful but little-known chapter in American history, and even though times have thankfully changed in so many ways for the LGBT community, we must have the courage of our conviction to recognize wrong, apologize, and move forward with common sense and compassion whenever it is required.  A few have asked me, Why now? Why do we need to relive past transgressions when there are ``more important things to do''? The answer is clear: The current administration may work to avoid using the words lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, but Congress should take firm action to show LGBTQ Americans that their valuable contributions to our country--today or 60-plus years ago--are very real and they are recognized. We cannot and should not turn our backs on the individuals who sacrificed so much for the benefit of the American people. We cannot and will not turn back the clock on the hard-fought civil rights of the LGBTQ community.  The theme of the 2017 Baltimore Pride celebration is ``Pride Unleashed,'' a commitment to ``work boldly and to live freely.'' I can think of no better mantra for LGBTQ Marylanders and allies as we fight side by side to protect civil rights and celebrate the strength of our diversity.  I implore you and all of our colleagues to join the fight for LGBTQ equality. The administration also should take firm action to show LGBTQ Americans that their valuable contributions to our country are recognized and appreciated. It is the responsibility of each and every citizen to root out systemic intolerance. Inclusion and diversity are some of our Nation's greatest strengths; yet these values are now in peril. We cannot and will not turn back the clock on hard-fought civil rights for the LGBTQ community.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-29-pt1-PgS3854-3.txt,,PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BUDGET,2017.0,29.0,July
12411,topic-id,823,"Mr.President, I would like to take this opportunity to talk about a special member of the Senate family, Nancy Nancy, who has served as the Democratic Secretary's administrative assistant since 1998, is retiring after 34 years of devoted public service. I know I speak on behalf of all of my colleagues when I say I am going to miss Nancy, but she has certainly earned a respite, and I want to wish her all the best in her retirement.  Nancy is a proud Pittsburgh native. She earned her bachelor of arts degree in art history from the University of Notre She was an excellent student: she was on the dean's honor list, she was a Notre Dame scholar, and she graduated cum laude. Then she earned a master of arts degree in art history with a concentration in museum practice from George Washington Armed with her degrees and proven academic success, Nancy went to work for the National Gallery of Art, She spent 5 years at the NGA, holding positions of increasing responsibility. During this time, she also contributed entries and artist biographies to ``La Vie Moderne: Nineteenth Century Paintings from the Permanent Collection of the Corcoran Gallery of Art,'' Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1983.  In 1988, Nancy decided to shift her focus from art history to the art of the possible, and she joined the Democratic Policy Committee as a staff assistant. Within a few short months, she was promoted to the position of special assistant to the floor staff and then again a short time later to the position of executive assistant. The art world pulled her back, though, and from 1994 to 1998, she served as deputy congressional liaison at the National Endowment for the Arts, Some may recall that this was a critical time in the NEA's history when its very existence was at stake. Nancy helped the NEA weather the storm and then returned to the Senate to work in the Democratic Secretary's office.  Since Nancy came to work in Washington, she has lived in Nancy has held leadership roles in the Ballston/Virginia Square Civic Association, the Cherrydale Citizens Association, and the Neighborhood Conservation Advisory She is a past member and chairman of the county's transportation commission, a past member and chairman of the historical affairs and landmark review board, and past chairman of the towing advisory board. She also chaired the fire station 3 relocation task force. Nancy has also participated in the East Falls Church Working Group, the Clarendon Sector Plan Update, neighborhood traffic calming measures ad hoc advisory group, the subdivision ordinance working group, and the joint George Mason University/Arlington County advisory board. She served as Arlington's representative to WMATA's Riders' Advisory Council from 2006 to 2009 and chaired the council in 2008.  Here in the Senate, Nancy has had so many responsibilities that it would be hard to list them all, but I would note a few. Every Tuesday when the Senate is in session, there is a conference lunch. Nancy has been responsible for organizing the lunch, the topics for discussion, and the materials to be distributed. Despite much complaining from Senators whom I shall not name, she singlehandedly made the lunches more nutritious, with healthier entrees and more salads. That is no small accomplishment. My staff and I worked with Nancy and Gary Myrick on updating and revising the conference rules. Nancy's institutional memory and patience and helpful suggestions were crucially important and much appreciated in that endeavor. She helped people find jobs. She answered every imaginable inquiry from Senators and staff. I could go on, but suffice it to say that Nancy Iacomini has kept the ``Democratic trains'' running on time here in the She has done so with diligence and grace and good humor and skill. Will Rogers famously said, ``I am not a member of any organized political party; I am a Democrat.'' Well, he didn't know Of course, if he did, he would have liked her--just as we all do.  We are going to miss Nancy's quiet competence and her sense of humor. We are going to miss the pumpkin outfits she would put on for We are going to miss her wonder dog I hope Nancy will come back to visit us every now and then and even bring Flash with her, but I know she is looking forward to spending more time with her husband, Dan, and the rest of her family, pursuing her myriad hobbies, interests, and community activities and rooting for the Notre Dame football team.  Nancy Iacomini has devoted 34 years of her life to government service. We are all better off because of that service. As the fictional Inspector Morse reminds us, ``To make an end is to make a beginning.'' I would ask all of my colleagues to join me in thanking Nancy and wishing her all the best as she begins the next chapter in her life.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-04-pt1-PgS2771-2.txt,,1645,2017.0,4.0,May

12376,topic-id,1240,"Mr.Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I rise to give notice of my intent to raise a question of the privileges of the  The form of the resolution is as follows:  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the President shall immediately disclose his tax return information to the House of Representatives and the American people.  Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed his tax return information to the public;  Whereas, the chairmen of the Committee on Ways and Means, Joint Committee on Taxation, and the Committee on Finance have the authority to request the President's tax returns under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;  Whereas, pursuant to Article I, section 7, clause 1 of the Constitution, often referred to as the Origination Clause, the House of Representatives has the sole authority to initiate legislation that raises revenue for the national government, and the Committee on Ways and Means is considering a comprehensive reform of the Tax Code;  Whereas, President Donald Trump holds interests as the sole or principal owner in approximately 500 separate business entities, and the President's tax plan proposes to cut the corporate tax from 35 percent to 15 percent, applicable to many of these entities;  Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics, the President has refused to divest his ownership stake in his businesses, has instead placed his assets in a trust which is run by his adult children, and the President can withdraw profits from his trust at any time of his choosing from any of the companies he owns;  Whereas, the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub, resigned on July 6, 2017, stating that ``There isn't much more I could accomplish at the Office of Government Ethics, given the current situation. O.G.E.'s recent experiences have made it clear that the ethics program needs to be strengthened'';  Whereas, according to media reports analyzing President Trump's leaked 2005 tax return, had his own tax plan been in place, he would have paid an estimated 3.48 percent rate instead of a 24 percent rate, saving him $31.3 million in that year alone;  Whereas, without access to the President's tax returns, the American people cannot determine how much he will personally benefit from proposed changes to the Tax Code or from policy decisions he makes, nor can the American people fully understand the financial interests and motivations of the President;  Whereas, in June 2017, President Trump filed an updated financial disclosure with the Office of Government Ethics which showed that the President reported $37.2 million income from the Mar-a-Lago resort between January 2016 and April 2017 where he hosted the President of China and from where he ordered missile strikes against Syria;  Whereas, during the same time period, President Trump reported $288 million in income from all his golf courses, including $19.7 million from his course in Bedminister, New Jersey;  Whereas, over the weekend of July 14, President Trump sent out eight tweets promoting the U.Women's Open Golf Tournament which took place at his Bedminister club;  Whereas, Mar-a-Lago doubled its new member fees to $200,000 immediately following the 2016 election, and President Trump personally benefits from such new member fees;  Whereas, disclosure of the President's tax returns would help those investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and assist them in better[[Page H5942]]understanding the President's financial ties to the Russian Federation, Russian businesses, and Russian individuals;  Whereas, in 2013, President Trump said, ``Well, I've done a lot of business with the They're smart and they're tough,'' and President Trump's son, Donald Trump, Jr., told a news outlet in 2008 that ``Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets'';  Whereas, President Trump fired Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, who was overseeing an investigation into ties and any collusion between the Russian Government and President Trump's campaign;  Whereas, former Director Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that President Trump asked him to ``let go'' of an investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's business ties to Russia;  Whereas, President Trump stated on May 11, 2017, that he had decided that he was going to fire Comey because of ``this Russia thing'';  Whereas, at the G-20 Hamburg summit on July 7, 2017, President Trump took a more than 2 hour closed-door meeting with President Vladimir Putin, after which he claimed that he ``strongly pressed'' President Putin on Russian interference in U.elections and that it is ``time to move forward'';  Whereas, on June 9, 2016, then-Candidate Trump's son, Donald Trump, Jr., then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and Trump son-in-law and current White House adviser Jared Kushner met with a person described as ``a Russian government attorney,'' and a former Russian military intelligence officer who promised to offer incriminating information about Hillary Clinton which had been collected as part of a Russian Government effort to assist President Trump in his campaign for President;  Whereas, the Committee on Ways and Means has in the past used the authority under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in 2014 to make public the confidential tax information of 51 taxpayers;  Whereas, the Committee on Ways and Means has now voted three times along party lines to continue to conceal President Trump's tax returns;  Whereas, the House of Representatives has now refused ten times to act on President Trump's tax returns;  Whereas, the Committee on the Judiciary has failed to conduct even basic oversight on the connections between the Russian Government and the Trump campaign;  Whereas, the Committee on the Judiciary has now voted twice along party lines to decline to request documents detailing the Trump administration's ties with Russian officials;  Whereas, the House of Representatives undermines its dignity and the integrity of its proceedings by continuing the cover-up of President Trump's tax returns:  Now, therefore, be it resolved, that the House of Representatives shall, one, immediately request the tax return and return information of Donald Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015, as provided under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as well as the tax return, and return information with respect to the President's businesses, of each business entity disclosed by Donald Trump on his Office of Government Ethics Form 278e, specifically each corporation and each partnership, within the meaning of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, where he is listed as an officer, director, or equivalent, or exercises working control; and  Two, postpone consideration of tax reform legislation until the elected Representatives of the American people in this House have obtained President Trump's tax returns and return information to ascertain how any changes to the Tax Code might financially benefit the  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under rule IX, a resolution offered on the floor by a Member other than the majority leader or the minority leader as a question of the privileges of the House has immediate precedence only at a time designated by the Chair within 2 legislative days after the resolution is properly noticed.  Pending that designation, the form of the resolution noticed by the gentleman from Rhode Island will appear in the Record at this point.

12212,topic-id,460,"Mr.Chair, as a co-chair of the Victims' Rights Caucus, along with Congressman Ted Poe, we have over 70 members, bipartisan, to focus on protecting victims of crime. We also try to ensure that we protect the VOCA funding that goes for very worthwhile efforts for organizations throughout the country and to recognize and honor every year those who stand out on behalf of victims of crime.  I want to commend the chairman and the ranking member for advancing this legislation, as well as my Senate colleagues, because there is a companion piece of legislation that is attempting to address this horrible issue in which you have so often young athletes--Olympic-caliber athletes--some who actually have participated in the Olympics, who, at a very young age, find themselves victims of these horrific crimes, through no fault of their own.  Sexual assault, in any form, is a horrible crime and it leaves lasting damage to its victims. Sadly, some victims of assault are children who may be incapable of truly understanding what is happening to them at the time. However, years later, when this poor child comes to understand what happened, they are faced with the reality that someone who is supposed to be looking after their well-being actually betrayed them. This leaves real and very lasting damage that can take decades, if not years, for the person to deal with.  In some instances, sexual assault victims may not discover their injuries or the violation until adulthood, years after the abuse happened, years after the processing of their own internal trauma, years after feeling strong enough finally to go public.  A perfect example of this is in child pornography. How is a young child supposed to find, process, and accuse someone of a crime that they simply didn't even know existed?  There are legitimate constitutional debates dealing with the criminal and civil process. We understand that. Current and future legal scholars will debate those. I am not a lawyer; I am a farmer. But as a farmer, I know we should be able to agree on one simple principle, and that principle is that these victims deserve their day in court, they deserve due process, and they deserve their time to face the person who assaulted them and to ask their fellow citizens or a judge for justice.  It is our responsibility to do what we can to protect child victims and to ensure that they have access to the courts. That is what this amendment is all about.  Mr.Chairman, I want to, in the effort of comity, offer this amendment, but I will ask to respectfully withdraw the amendment. This is an issue that is not going to go away.

12385,topic-id,366,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to join the Armenian community in commemorating the 102nd anniversary of the Armenian genocide.  On April 24, 1915, the Ottoman Empire began committing atrocities that would result in the first genocide of the 20th century. Between 1915 and 1923, 1\1/2\ million Armenians were systematically deported from their homes and sent to their death on marches through the Syrian That is a fact.  My district, located in California's San Joaquin Valley, is the land of William Saroyan and the resting place of Soghomon Terlirian, a hero of the Armenian people. It is also home to the only Armenian genocide monument on a college campus in the Nation at Fresno State University, my alma mater. It is a campus that has a storied Armenian Studies program known throughout the country and is a sister university to the American University of  The San Joaquin Valley of California is also one of the earliest settling places for thousands of survivors and their families as part of the diaspora as a result of the genocide. Many still live there today and call the valley their home.  I was honored to visit Armenia this past year to meet with its people and leaders. I was truly humbled to visit the Armenian genocide memorial in We have seen religious and civic leaders from all around the world recognize the Armenian genocide and ensure that this tragedy is never ever forgotten.  I am very disappointed and saddened that another year has passed without the President of the United States or the Congress recognizing the events of 1915 as genocide. We cannot move forward free of genocide without recognizing the first genocide of the 20th century. So I ask my colleagues to please join me in recognizing the lives of 1\1/2\ million victims and their families.  It is always said that now is not the right time because of our relationship with Turkey as they become, like this country, less democratic as a result of recent elections. I reject that view. If we do not recognize the genocide now, then when?  I stand with Armenians all over the world to say ``menk' ch'yenk' morranum.'' We will not forget.

Think about that: Listen with compassion and give with a warm heart and a smile.  The lives of hundreds and thousands of individuals were made better because of Mike's helping hand. He will be remembered by all for his deep compassion and boundless kindness.  Mike was a role model for me and for all who knew him. He leaves a legacy of service and selflessness, both through the Poverello House and in the hearts of those people he touched throughout the years.  I join Mike's family and the supporters of the Poverello House over the years in honoring his life.

12406,topic-id,2527,"Mr.Speaker, I just want to say thank you to Congressman Raskin for holding down this Special You do such an excellent job, you and Pramila Jayapal, and we are grateful for it.  Mr.Speaker, here are just a few headlines from the budget that the Trump administration just released:  ``Trump Budget Leaves Working Class Base Behind''; that is the Detroit Free  ``Meatloaf Again: Christie Meekly Accepts Trump's Medicaid Cuts''; that is the New Jersey Star- ``Trump Budget Replicates Disastrous Kansas This Won't End Well''; that is the Kansas City Star, Mr. ``No Help from Trump''; that is the Houston  ``Trump Meets the Pope While His Budget Threatens the Least of Us''; that is The Sacramento  ``The Harsh Budget Americans Voted for''; that is the Charlotte  ``Another Bad Budget from Trump Targets the Poor,'' The Washington  ``Trump's Assault on Working Voters''; that is the Baltimore  ``Surprise, Surprise: Trump's Budget Punishes the Sick and the Poor While Rewarding the Wealthy''; that is the LA  ``A Slash-and-Burn Budget,'' New York Daily  ``Budget Cuts Include U.Heart''; that is northjersey.com;  The New York Times: ``A Budget That Promises Little But Pain.''  Bloomberg View: ``Trump's Budget is a Waste of Everybody's Time.''  Financial Times, no beacon of liberalism there, Mr.Speaker: ``Trump's Implausible Plan for the U.Budget.''  So whether you are talking about conservative instruments in the news or more liberal ones or more middle-of-the-road, it is really kind of amazing: Everyone seems to share one feeling about the Trump budget. We all hate it. It is bad. It is not a good thing, and there are plenty of reasons why people don't like it.  And so I just want to add that the OMB is led by one of our former colleagues, Mick Mulvaney, and I think Mick is a nice guy. I can't tell people that I personally dislike He is nice to me. But that is not what this is about.                              {time}  1800  This is about how we are operating in our public lives. In our public lives and discharging our public responsibility, I have to quote the Director of the Office of Management and He says: Meals on Wheels sounds great. We're not going to spend money on programs that cannot show that they actually deliver on promises that we've made to people.  I will submit to you that Meals on Wheels is a very meritorious program, it costs very little money, and it allows vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities to live at home. Deep cuts.  Actually, Mick said as well: Deep budget cuts are actually one of the most compassionate things we can do.  I wonder, Mr.Speaker, compassionate for who?  Maybe those billionaires at Mar-a-Lago--maybe they need a little love, too, sometimes--or the people who occupy Trump  Regarding HUD, or Housing and Urban Development, he said: It doesn't work very well. Tell that to the people who rely on low-income housing tax credits, section 8 voucher programs, and all types of housing programs that allow people to afford their housing.  On the issue of school nutrition programs, he says: Guess what. There's no demonstrable evidence that they're actually doing that. There's no demonstrable evidence that we're actually helping kids to do better in school. This is about school nutrition.  Here is another one: We can't ask single mothers to continue to pay for the Corporation for Public  Well, single moms might rely on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to help their kids learn how to read. I think that Sesame Street is a pretty good outfit. That might be their only avenue.  Here is another one: If you ask, 999 people out of 1,000 would tell you that Social Security disability is not part of Social It is an old-age retirement that they think of when they think of Social  Quite the contrary. People do think of Social Security disability when they think of Social  Here is another quote: ``Are there folks on SNAP who shouldn't be?''  That is the question.  So we are, again, trying to focus on fraud in SNAP, rather than worrying about hungry  Here is another quote: ``Maybe it's reasonable to ask if there are folks who are on there that shouldn't be. That is a reasonable question to ask.''[[Page H4559]]  You know what? I think it is focusing on the wrong part of the problem. Hunger, Mr.Speaker, is the problem in the richest country in the history of the world. At its richest point in its own history, we are being told by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget that we cannot afford SNAP, Meals on Wheels, and public broadcasting.  I think that, honestly, Mr.Speaker, it is often said that you should speak truth to power. I think we must speak truth to power. I think the gentleman from Maryland would agree with me that we have got to speak truth to power. But it occurs to me, Mr.Speaker, that the power knows exactly what the truth is: this budget is going to hurt hungry children. The budget is going to cut seniors. It is going to cut veterans. It is going to cut public broadcasting, which is one of the major ways people get news in South Dakota and rural It is going to cut the Appalachian Regional It is going to leave devastation almost everywhere. It is going to cut the EPA by a third.  The power knows--and I am talking about Trump and his administration--the devastation that they are going to inflict on people. In fact, that is why they are doing it. They just don't believe the government has any role in helping to make Americans lives better.  Their idea of freedom, Mr.Speaker, is a billionaire being able to pollute anywhere and everywhere he wants. Their idea of freedom is amassing great fortunes at the expense of everyone else, all the while relying on our Nation's military, our Nation's police, the road system; all the while relying on clean water, clean air; all the while relying on public schools to educate their workforce.  They say: I did it all by myself. Yet everything they have done has been with the help of the government of the people of the United States of It is really outrageous, Mr. I think that we are in a moment when we have got to speak truth to each other, Mr.We have got to go all across this Nation and talk to people in the barbershops, the VFW halls. We have got to talk to people in the church basement, the mosque basement, the synagogue basement. We have got to talk to people on the corners and tell them about this budget. If they hear about this Trump budget, they will be outraged.  Nobody can support this budget, not even a millionaire or a billionaire, unless you believe that you are not your brother's keeper, that you have no obligation to other people around you, that everything around you should be amassed to accumulate wealth for yourself. That is the only possible way anybody can stand next to this budget.  I really do hope that the Republican caucus puts this budget up for a vote. I want to see who is going to stand next to this monstrosity of a budget. I am curious to see who, representing southern Ohio, Kentucky, or Tennessee, is going to vote to zero out the Appalachian Regional Commission; who, representing a northern-tier State, is going to cut, zero out, I want to see the Republican who is going to do that. I think that will be a pretty gutsy move. I guarantee you, your constituents will know exactly what you did. They are watching, Mr.People watch C-SPAN and they read the news. They read the headlines that I read off, Mr.Speaker, and they are aware of what is happening in the people's House at this very hour.  I want the people to know that it is the government's responsibility to take care of the least of these. If you are too poor, too old, or too sick to work, we should help people. We should do it. I believe it is the right thing to do.  Mr.Speaker, I don't care if they call me a bleeding heart liberal--they can call me anything they want--but I am going to be there for low-income people who are too old, too sick, or too young to work. I am going to be there to make sure that people who are out of work but who are able-bodied have the support that they need to get to work, to have clean air, to have clean water, to promote jobs and infrastructure.  We are going to be there to do those things, Mr.Speaker, because we believe in them.  Do you know what else, Mr.Speaker?  We don't believe ``tax'' is a four-letter word. It is actually a three-letter word. It is not a bad word at all. In fact, it is the dues that you pay to live in a civilized society. If you think tax is some kind of a curse word, you can move to Somalia, because they don't have many there.  Here, we have the protection of our police. We have the protection of our courts. We have the protection of our Nation's military. We have the protection of people who inspect the meat, the water, the air, and everything else, and these people look after us as they discharge their public responsibility and they get paid in our tax money. There is nothing wrong with it. We stand on that.  I believe there has got to be a few Republicans who agree with what I just said. I believe there has got to be a few Republicans who believe that it is a good idea for the public to spend money on figuring out the vexing diseases that are ravaging people all over America, like ALS, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's. We should research these diseases. And if we need public money to do it, Mr.Speaker, we should spend that money. But I don't think this Trump budget reflects that.  I want to see my friends on the Republican side of the aisle join us and say we should not cut the Corporation for Public Broadcasting; we should not cut critical programs that help people; we should not cut supplemental assistance programs, SNAP, and food stamps for hungry Americans; we should not cut Medicaid, leaving families on the hook to pay more for the care of their loved ones with disabilities.  I don't believe they believe these cuts are right. I just think that it is going to take a lot of political courage to stand up and say: You know what? Sometimes the government does good for people--we have spent decades saying the government is the problem--and now people actually believe it sometimes, except they don't believe it when you are cutting their healthcare, basic research, cutting money for our parks, and literally cutting everything, except the military.  Oh, by the way, I am the proud father of a military son. My son is a veteran. He just finished 4 years of service in the United States Army, Mr.He was a combat veteran. My whole family is proud of him. But I am going to tell you one thing: the money didn't go to him. He made less than $25,000 a year. He didn't mind. He is serving his country.  Where is all this Big Money going to go? Who is getting it?  I don't know. People who make the machinery, the weapons industry, they are going to make out like bandits, you better believe that.  At the end of the day, Mr.Speaker, even the money that they are asking us to spend is going to hurt veterans. I know they are trying to plus-up a little on the VA, but there are a whole lot of other services that veterans benefit from, and they are going to get hurt.  Mr.Speaker, this Trump budget is wrong, and I believe that every Democrat knows it is wrong, and I even believe a few Republicans know that it is wrong. We should stand up and say that it is wrong.  It is wrong to slash the earned income tax credit and child tax credit by $40 billion. This is money that goes to people who actually work for a living.  I heard one of our Nation's leaders in the administration say: Oh, you are crying about these people who are going to get cut. What about the people who pay all the taxes?  Mr.Speaker, if we would raise the minimum wage, you would have more people paying taxes, because people's pay would be higher. It is no comfort to say that half the people don't pay taxes. They do pay taxes. They pay payroll taxes, they pay sales taxes, they pay property taxes, they pay all kind of taxes, Mr.It is wrong to try to imply that they are freeloaders because they don't pay income taxes. They would be glad to pay those income taxes if their income were higher, which it would be if we invested in America, which this budget does the opposite of. It divests  I just want to say to you as we begin to wrap up that our Nation is the greatest Nation in the world not because of bombs and guns and military. It is the greatest Nation because we believe in liberty and justice for all, and not just a millionaire's and a billionaire's liberty to pollute all they want,[[Page H4560]]escape taxes all they want, do whatever they please, without any ramifications.  Mr.Speaker, justice is also a part of that equation. Justice means doing right by people. Justice means being fair to people. This budget is the exact opposite of it. This budget leaves out people like our veterans. It cuts almost a billion dollars from housing assistance programs to keep a roof over people's heads. It cuts Social Security by $72 billion by restricting enrollment in disability insurance programs.  It hurts our national security. It spends over $2 billion to build an unnecessary border wall. Oh, this wall. Mr.Speaker, in his campaign, the wall was among the most offensive things, because what it really said is we don't really want folks from south of the border around here. That is what it said. That is how they felt. Yet here we are spending money to prove that point.  It cuts the State Department and USAID by almost 32 percent. Generals will tell you that it is better to talk it out than to shoot it out. Yet here we are cutting down our ability to talk it out. What an outrage.  It eliminates international family planning.  Let me wrap up by saying this. I was talking to some of my Republican friends--and I do have many, and I am proud to say so--and one of them said to me: Keith, this thing probably is never going to see the light of day.  I said: Maybe it will and maybe it won't. But this Trump budget is a direct reflection of what he would do if he could do it. And that is scary.

12437,topic-id,690,"Mr.Speaker, what has changed since the last time the Republicans attempted to repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act?  Absolutely nothing. That is right. Nothing has changed.  Recent polls show that the Affordable Care Act is more popular than ever. Yet, the Republicans still want to get rid of a law that is helping to provide our most vulnerable Americans the affordable care they need and deserve.  In my district, Mr.Speaker, 369,000 people who receive health coverage from their employers could lose their consumer protection. 62,000 people covered by Medicare expansion could lose coverage if the ACA is repealed. These are the numbers of a few weeks back. It could be even worse now.  This Saturday marks President Trump's 100th day in the White And this week we have a stacked agenda with tax reform, to pass a spending bill, to prevent government shutdown, to talks of health care being back in the mix.  One may think that health care will get lost in the shuffle, but we have seen how this administration and the Republicans will not back down. They appear committed to getting rid of a law that provides quality, affordable health care to millions of Americans young and old.  The American people elected us to fight an agenda that supports the needs of everyday Americans, hardworking Instead of cutting programs like SNAP, Meals on Wheels, the Community Development Block Grant program, we should look for ways to grow programs that help build stronger neighborhoods block by block.  Over the weekend, I went to the health fair at Temple University in my district. Temple University Hospital has served the city of Philadelphia for the last 120 years. It is a job creator and a major employer in our community. We should be looking for ways to build up the engines that drive investment and grow our economy, not tear them down.  Let me remind you, Republicans want to vote on the healthcare bill that gets rid of essential health benefits--for example, coverage for emergency rooms, maternity care, and prescription drugs. But because of the people, because of you and all of your phone calls, all of your emails, all of your letters, their attempt to repeal the healthcare bill was stopped.  This just happened. Yes, they still want to vote on a bill that destroys protections for people with preexisting conditions.  I want to tell you a story of a small-business owner in my district named Andrea owns a small pet shop, Spot's--The Place for Paws, in Narberth, Andrea left her Philadelphia law practice to pursue her dream of owning a small business. Andrea has type 1 diabetes. Without the ACA, she would not be able to get well-priced coverage that covers her health expenses and medication and allows her to keep her shop open.  Andrea's story is like that of so many Americans across the country. We cannot support legislation that makes life harder for those trying the hardest to get ahead.  Last week, I visited another wonderful resident in my district, Sister Mary She is truly an inspirational individual who has made it her mission to help the most vulnerable citizens.

12325,topic-id,596,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague for his leadership on this and many other issues, really taking up this cause and being a champion for the voiceless.  Last month I was in my district in Hawaii, and we traveled all across the State, on every island, holding townhall meetings on a variety of issues, but one of the meetings and forums that I participated in was at the University of Hawaii at Hilo, and it was specifically around this issue of human trafficking, of sex trafficking.  In this small community in Hawaii, many people had gathered--it was a full room--trying to increase their own awareness and share more information about the prevalence of this issue, not just in places in other parts of the world, but in our communities right here at home. I think that is something that surprises a lot of folks that I talk to, is you can read about these human trafficking problems in cities in Asia or other parts of the world, but very rarely do people think that it is happening in their own backyard, in their own hometown, when the reality is that this is a very real issue that exists in far too many of our hometowns and our communities all across the country.  In my own home State of Hawaii, girls as young as 11 years old have been recruited from schools, from beaches, from malls through an intricate network of sex traffickers. In 2016, last year, 30 cases of human trafficking were reported to the human trafficking hotline in Almost all of them had to do with the exploitation of women for sex and labor, and in 10 of these cases the individuals targeted were minors.  Now, what we know and what is terribly disturbing is how underreported this actually is, that these numbers are not at all representative of the reality that exists in our community because trafficking is more common than the number of cases reported.  Now, too often those who are victims of and those who are forced into trafficking are charged as criminals and are forced to live with this criminal record for the rest of their lives, never being able to escape the shackles of nonviolent crimes committed in the course of their being victims of human trafficking. This often inhibits them from getting the care and assistance that they really need, to be free, to be able to move on with their lives.  Our current criminal justice system is broken in so many ways, and in so many ways perpetuates a cycle of crime, exploitation, and poverty, stripping the most exploited and vulnerable individuals in our society of a fair chance for a new life and healing from unimaginable abuses perpetuated by truly evil criminals.  Now, at the local level in States like Hawaii, we have passed legislation that bans sex trafficking and classifies it as a class A felony, but that is not enough. That is why I am so proud to be a cosponsor of the Trafficking Survivors Relief Act, because it creates this promise of freedom for those survivors from the shackles of their past. It establishes a process to vacate convictions and expunge arrests for those charged with criminal offenses related to human trafficking, finally putting survivors on a path to rehabilitation and healing rather than a life of continued exploitation and abuse.  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to get this legislation passed and actually enact this change so it helps those in our communities who need it the most.

Small businesses are the backbone of the U.economy, and, according to the SBA, have provided 55 percent of all jobs and 66 percent of all net new jobs over the past 40 years. These small[[Page H2981]]businesses are intimately familiar with their businesses and the regulatory environment, and who better to provide insights to regulators and lawmakers on how to best provide and promote capital formation and remove unnecessary regulatory barriers and burdens?  Nearly four decades ago, in 1980, Congress recognized the importance of our small-business owners and their having a voice and sharing their recommendations with the SEC, and Congress required the SEC to conduct an annual forum to review the current status and issues surrounding small business capital formation. But while the Commission is required to conduct this forum, its obligation goes no further.  Though the SEC often praises this small business forum and the insights and recommendations from the small business community, the SEC has no obligation to respond to or act on the forum's recommendations and findings and has rarely done so. For example, many of the provisions of the JOBS Act came from recommendations from the small business forum, but it was Congress who had to move forward with these ideas, not the  This commonsense bill introduced by Mr.Poliquin and Mr.Vargas would require the SEC to formally respond to these recommendations just like they legally have to acknowledge and respond to recommendations from their Investor Advisory Similar legislation passed the House last Congress by a nearly unanimous vote, and, earlier this year, H.1312 passed the House Financial Services Committee by a unanimous vote.

Rather than fulfill his promise to directly renegotiate NAFTA, the President signed another ``dodge 'em'' executive order asking for a 6-month delay by reviewing all U.trade agreements. That could take forever. His NAFTA backtrack presents a serious problem for Americans who continue to lose their jobs to NAFTA's broken promises.  None will be more impacted than Americans working in the automotive sector. Last year, our country's automotive trade gap with Mexico was deep in the red again. As a result, our country imported 800,000 more cars from Mexico than we exported.  This is what it looked like back in 1993. This is what it looks like today. Is it any wonder that Americans are concerned about jobs?  In agricultural trade among NAFTA partners, 2 million small-scale Mexican farmers were thrown off their farms and out of work. This fueled the immigration crisis and subwage workers across our continent as poverty continued--no different than 1993.  America's workers don't need any more studies or delays.

12404,topic-id,622,"Thank you, Congressman Raskin, and thank you for your leadership with the Progressive Caucus and in articulating a positive vision of what the American people need with a budget.  I want to address the issue of manufacturing because this President went around the country campaigning on bringing manufacturing jobs back. And there is a simple philosophical difference in what the Progressive Caucus believes and the President's budget. If you believe, as the Republicans do, that we need to cut taxes and have less spending, you would be for this President's budget.  But if you believe, as we do, that the big issue facing this country is good-paying jobs and higher wages, you would be for the progressive budget.                              {time}  1745  Let me give you a concrete example. One of the programs that the President cuts in the name of less government and lower taxes is the Manufacturing Extension Now, what does this do? What does the Manufacturing Extension Partnership do? It actually works with small- and medium-sized manufacturers across this country, many in the Rust Belt, to help them be competitive, to help them compete against currency manipulation, against unfair trade deals, to help them compete against lower cost labor.  How does the program do this? It partners them with leading technology companies to say, look, if you are a small- or medium-sized manufacturer, maybe you should have cloud technology. Move your technology off the factory floor and use the cloud to be more cost-competitive so that you can compete. Basically, the program helps to bring and keep manufacturing jobs in the United  Now, here is the irony. You would think, oh, is this a liberal idea? Is this the idea of Democrat, or a liberal Democrat? The irony is this was Ronald Reagan's idea. It was actually a program instituted by President Reagan in 1988 to help American manufacturers compete for the 21st century, and every administration has supported it.  One would think this President who ran on bringing manufacturing jobs would say, okay, let's quadruple funding for the Manufacturing Extension Instead, he zeroed it out, zeroed out the funding for manufacturing programs. The progressive budget says we want to increase our investment in manufacturing. We want to actually help the small- and medium-sized manufacturers create jobs in the United  I have one more concrete example before I hand it back over to my colleague, Mr. The Appalachian Regional Commission invests in helping to create jobs across the parts of this country that most need that investment. I was down in Appalachia visiting Hal Rogers' district, a distinguished Republican who chaired the Appropriations Committee, and we saw the Appalachian Regional Commission's investment in helping coal miners' kids get jobs.  This Republican budget, this administration zeros out the funding for the Appalachian Regional Instead, we ought to be increasing funding in programs that are going to help transition folks from the industrial to the digital economy.  I think my colleague, Congressman Raskin, will explain that the Progressive budget is not just a moral document. It very much is, and it keeps our commitment to seniors and to those in need, but it is also a blueprint for job creation and good wages and for creating jobs in precisely the places that need them most.  This is the big division in this Do you believe that the big issue is that we need more tax cuts for the investor class, that we need simply to cut government, or do you believe we need government to partner with local leaders, with businesses, to create jobs and better wages?  If you believe the latter, I urge you to take a look at the Progressive budget and see our vision for job creation and higher wages.

12293,topic-id,478,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.Cook), a valuable member of the Committee on Natural Resources, for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, today, we are here to consider a bill that aims to remove barriers to improve our Nation's water and power infrastructure.  Just last Thursday, the House passed a bill designating the Bureau of Reclamation as the lead agency when it comes to permitting new and expanded water storage projects. Today, the bill before us seeks to clear up regulatory confusion over the development of new pumped storage hydropower.  Hydropower can and should be part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy now and well into the future. It is a reliable and emissions-free source of electricity that accounts for a majority of the Nation's total renewable electricity generation.  In my home State of Colorado, we have over 60 operating hydropower facilities that generate more than 1,100 megawatts, including new projects such as Carter Lake, South Canal, and Ridgway However, as is the case nationwide, there is potential for new hydropower generation in  My bill, the Bureau of Reclamation Pumped Storage Hydropower Development Act, H.1967, looks to pave the way for additional clean hydropower generation by clearing up regulatory permitting confusion at existing Bureau of Reclamation facilities.  We worked with our colleague from central Washington State, Mr.Newhouse, on this bill. His interest stems from a real-life example of where it is unclear whether the Bureau of Reclamation or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have permitting jurisdiction on pumped storage hydropower projects at the Columbia Basin  The project's proponents want to build a project that pumps water to and from two of the project's reservoirs for hydroelectric generation. But because of potential dual permitting requirements, there have been serious delays in bringing this potential 500 megawatt project online.  Similar to a public law authored in 2013 by our committee colleague and fellow Coloradan, Scott Tipton, that cleared up confusion on the Bureau of Reclamation's pipes and canals, my bill makes it clear that the Bureau of Reclamation is the lead agency that will oversee pumped storage development for projects exclusively utilizing the agency's facilities.  The regulatory clarification in my bill will help pave the way for more pumped storage by incentivizing developers who will, in turn, pay the American taxpayers for the use of Federal facilities.  In a hearing earlier this spring of the Water, Power, and Oceans Subcommittee, which I chair, even our friends on the other side of the aisle agreed that we should be doing all we can to incentivize clean, renewable hydropower generation at existing Federal facilities. That is why this bill was passed by the House Natural Resources Committee by unanimous consent in  I urge my House colleagues to join me in promoting clean, renewable hydropower generation as part of our Nation's all-of-the-above energy strategy by supporting this bill, the Bureau of Reclamation Pumped Storage Hydropower Development  ",CREC-2017-06-27-pt1-PgH5210.txt,1834,PROTECTING YOUNG VICTIMS FROM SEXUAL ABUSE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,27.0,July

Mr.Speaker, there are times in our lifetime that leave an impact on our lives and we never forget that place or time when we experienced the event or we heard of the event. For my father, it was the attack on Pearl He always remembered that moment and the place and the feelings he had when he heard of the attack, which motivated him to join the United States For my children, it was the attacks on America on September 11, 2001.  For me, Mr.Speaker, it is Flag Day, June 14, 2017, at a baseball practice. Not only will I remember that event, but I specifically remember where I was because I was there. Not only was I there, I was within proximity of 10 to 15 feet from the officers who acted so heroically. And still, Mr.Speaker, those images of that day are vivid in my mind. There isn't a day that goes by--and I am sure it is the same thing for the other players--that I don't relive a portion of that moment.                              {time}  1715  But although those images are vivid, time heals all wounds, and at some point the details will be obscured by the fog of war and other events in our lives. But I will never forget the heroic actions of those two officers that day. Even at the moment when Agent Griner took a bullet--which I believe was destined for me, or definitely in my direction--which took her down and out of the fight, Agent Bailey came to check on his partner, and immediately put himself even more in the line of fire to draw the fire away from us.  I can't express how heroic these officers acted. Some may say, well, that is[[Page H6186]]their duty, but what I experienced, Mr.Speaker, was above and beyond any call of duty, setting aside their own safety, their own persons, and putting themselves in a situation where death may have been imminent.  They were in a gunfight with someone with a more powerful, more accurate rifle, and all they had was a handgun. But they never let that dissuade them from protecting the lives of those of us. I would not be here today if it wasn't for those two agents.  This is the least that we could do, as has been expressed by many other speakers. The cost upon the families is tremendous when someone is injured in the line of duty. I believe that this is all fitting, and it is an expression of our appreciation for what they do for us day in and day out.  I hope and I pray that we never have an incident like that again, but as history tells us, something like this will happen again. And I just hope that we have agents like Agents Griner and Bailey on duty when that happens again.  There were many miracles on the field that day, and one of those miracles was having the two right agents there doing their job, just like all of our Capitol Police do every day.  I support this bill. I support the intent behind it, and I hope that we move forward with this in an expeditious manner and that we have a unanimous vote on this.

Alzheimer's is the only one of the top 10 causes of death that cannot be prevented, cannot be cured, and cannot be slowed. As the sixth leading cause of death in Florida, and with so many affected by this incurable disease, we have to continue to stress the importance of early diagnosis and the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related illnesses.  But awareness is never enough. As a member of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer's Disease, I am determined to make progress for all those affected. We must act proactively to achieve breakthroughs in prevention and treatment. We also have to act to ensure that those who currently have Alzheimer's have the tools that are needed to manage their symptoms, reduce pain, and increase comfort.  Nearly half of all people with Alzheimer's and other dementias are in hospice care at the time of their passing, but less than half of nursing homes have some sort of palliative care program. For people with advanced dementia, palliative care improves their quality of life, controls costs, and enhances both patient and family satisfaction.  As the demand for this kind of care grows with the aging population, more has to be done to ensure that there is a workforce equipped to provide that care.

We have come a long way in this country in recognizing and acknowledging the problems of sex trafficking; and not just laying the blame at the seat of a so-called prostitute but understanding that this is a crime where the persons being trafficked, as you have heard my colleagues say, are imprisoned in sex trafficking. And why is it?  You heard them talk about the $150 billion impact that this has. There is a huge incentive to sell these women over and over and over and over again. Because unlike drugs, you can resell these products of these victims again.  Survivors of sex trafficking can't just walk away. They are in prison. They endure violent beatings, brainwashing, sexual assault, psychological control, and control of their purses and their identification. But then they find themselves arrested and convicted for prostitution, labeled as sex offenders, and then just revictimized by a system that doesn't understand that they were prisoners of this lucrative operation.  These survivors face long-term negative consequences. They are denied access to employment, housing resources, and student financial aid that is needed to develop a sustainable safe and stable life. The Trafficking Survivors Relief Act offers survivors postconviction relief from criminal charges stemming from nonviolent offenses committed as a direct result of being a victim of human trafficking.  Mr.Speaker, believe it or not, an estimated 300,000 children become victims of sex trafficking every year through fraud, force, and coercion. Many of them think, You know, I am going to be taken out to dinner by someone who loves me, and find themselves imprisoned at that very moment. Many of them are then arrested for these crimes that they are forced to commit.  In my State of Wisconsin, 79 percent of human trafficking cases reported in Wisconsin occur in my district, I am ashamed to say.  In the city of Milwaukee, last year, as an example, Mr.Speaker, two sisters, ages 16 and 17, were rescued during the FBI's Operation Cross They told an undercover Federal agent that their mother had forced them into prostitution. Had they been arrested, instead of recovered from their mother, who imprisoned them, would they have deserved to be branded for life with a criminal record?  Imagine every time that they applied for housing or for financial aid or for a job, that they would be denied on the basis of their criminal record; and they were coerced into this act as minors by their own mother. Imagine the re-traumatization and further devastation that repeated denial would have caused them.  It just makes these people so vulnerable, and it deserves a legislative solution that we are proposing here today.

12402,topic-id,1648,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity. I would like to thank the gentleman from  The Progressive Caucus has its own version of a budget which we have discussed on the floor of Congress previously that we will be glad to put exactly next to the budget that has been produced by this President, because our budget takes a completely different course than the budget that has been put forth by the Trump administration.  We can tell you, now that we have seen the budget from the Republicans, it hits every fear that we thought was going to be in it. There are very few winners, and there are an awful lot of losers in the budget, and that is what we are going to try to show today, just who some of the winners are and who some of the losers are, just to give you a visual display of exactly what is in this Trump budget.  So what people need to know is that this is a budget that is not for the average person across the country. In fact, the average person will be hurt in multiple ways by the cuts that are in this budget. There are very few in this country who are going to applaud this, but it is very few because this is a budget that only benefits a very few. And we, in the Progressive Caucus, are going to do everything we can to fight this, tooth and nail, to make sure this doesn't become law.  Let me just show a few of the winners that we have on this. One of the winners are the wealthiest This is going to reduce trillions of dollars in taxes that are primarily paid by the wealthy. So clearly, the wealthy are going to do well.  Another group that does well is Wall Street and Big corporations. This budget slashes regulations for Big banks that caused the great recession, and it defunds the agency that is charged with protecting consumers.  Another beneficiary is defense contractors--a $54 billion boost in defense spending at the expense of nearly every other program. That will increase money that will purchase unnecessary new weapons.  The border wall. This is going to put down a $1.6 billion downpayment to build a wall across the Mexican border, something that truly is not necessary and not asked for.  And finally, the last beneficiary is polluters. This is going to roll back environmental regulations that protect our air and water.  So those are the winners on the Trump budget. But if you look on the other side of the equation, there are a whole lot more losers.  Let's start right up here with our friend, Big PBS funding. The Trump budget would cut funding for children's shows like Sesame  Social The Trump budget will get rid of the insurance to help people with disabilities.  Meals on You know, I have had the great fortune of doing Meals on Wheels delivery in Madison, Wisconsin, which is in my district. And not only is it often the only meal, the healthy meal that that person is getting delivered who often can't leave their homes, but it is also that daily check-in to make sure that person is all right.  I just met with someone who works with Meals on Wheels, and they said that there is not a week that goes by that they don't find someone who has fallen in their home and needed that person to come by for help. Well, the Trump budget eliminates funding for programs like Meals on  The children's health insurance and Medicaid funding specifically for kids is cut. He cuts dental care for kids, cancer care for kids, access to inhalers, and access to vital medical devices for children.  He cuts nursing home care. Families are going to be forced to pay more out-of-pocket for nursing home care.  The school lunch program. Now, I understand, everyone may not love everything on their tray at lunch, but this is cutting funding for subsidized lunches, causing kids literally to go hungry in this country.  It has education cuts to school and literacy programs, to teacher training and class-size reduction. Over 20 programs are going to be cut. Even Special Olympics gets a cut in this budget.  Today, we had Secretary DeVos at the Appropriations Subcommittee for[[Page H4556]]the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies, and, unfortunately, she couldn't make a case for any of these cuts, which is truly disappointing, because they are going to add hundreds of millions of dollars to give money to people who have children attending private schools, but we are going to be slashing the very programs that make our public schools so strong.  They slash programs for the Department of labor for job training.  There is a $6 billion-plus cut to the National Institutes of Health that works on lifesaving research for diseases like Alzheimer's and ALS and diabetes. And it cuts another billion for cancer research, specifically, in this budget.  Loan repayment programs. This is going to end the loan repayment programs for police officers, nurses, and teachers who work in a public setting.  This has massive cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency that protect our air and water, and it guts general funding that provides that clean air and water programs that are going to affect people across the country.  It cuts funding to prevent major outbreaks for diseases like Ebola and Zika by cutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention program budget.  Opioid addiction, something that this Congress has, in a bipartisan way, found ways to find additional funding for; in this proposal by the Trump administration, it leaves families that are dealing with addiction on the hook for the cost of treatment in many cases.  Border funding. It is not just that they are building a wall, but this also ramps up funding for deportation task forces which are going to tear families apart in this country; and it adds money to build more detention centers.  This budget will allow the government to sell off swaths of public land that is going to open up our national parks and public land to oil and gas development, including fracking operations.  And this budget, when it comes to women's healthcare, will go after protections in funding for women's healthcare by cutting Planned  Finally, for veterans, it makes it harder for veterans and low-income families of veterans to find housing.  That is just some of the losers, but we want to show the difference in the balance of the very few who benefit and the whole lot of people--and there is a whole lot of other areas that are going to be cut by this budget.  Now, the contrast really is the Progressive Caucus budget that we put forward that we will have a vote on, on this floor of Congress, where we do a completely different approach. Gone are the winners and losers of this case. And the winners would be a big category, being the American people, and the losers really being those, I think, who have abused the system for all too long.  We have a $2 trillion investment in infrastructure that puts money into our roads and bridges, our schools, our waterworks, our broadband, and really makes sure that those are family-supporting jobs that people can get back to work and will create millions of new jobs, according to the Economic Policy  We make sure that we move forward in affordable healthcare by making it so we can negotiate for prescription drug prices and bring those costs down, as well as allow States to get closer to a single-payer system.  We specifically have comprehensive immigration reform that recognizes those who are aspiring Americans, not by building walls and more detention centers but really providing a path to citizenship so that we can find a way to still protect our borders, but also make sure that we have got a path for people who have lived here for so very long.  We close corporate tax loopholes and make sure that working families are getting the stronger benefit.  We have an investment to make sure that we can have universal child care for all families in this country, not like the proposal that President Trump has put forward that takes care of, quite honestly, President Trump and people like him and the wealthiest in this country, but making sure that every family will never pay more than 10 percent of their income to have child care for their family. And on and on and on is what our contrast is.  So as someone who has been very active in the Progressive Caucus, someone who comes from America's heartland in Wisconsin, we wanted to show the winners and the losers but, more importantly, to show the different path forward the Progressive Caucus is going to put for a vote on the floor of And I think if you get a chance to compare and contrast these budgets, you can see there is an alternative.  We don't have to slash funding for all sorts of programs just to get $54 billion of new spending for defense. We can actually invest in America, invest in healthcare, invest in our schools, make sure that college is affordable, all the things that we offer in our contrast budget. It is the only budget that is out there right now, so we would love to be able to show that contrast.  But we ask people to take a look at this, and then you decide what is best for your family. I think you are going to decide the Progressive Caucus puts a positive path forward that will make your family prosper and won't just support a very few in this country.

I do want to thank the Congresswoman from New York and also Congressman Juan Vargas of California who stepped up as the lead cosponsor of this legislation.  As Mr.Hill mentioned a moment ago, about two-thirds of our new jobs in the last decade have been created by small business. This is the bloodline of our economy, and certainly in Maine, Mr.Speaker, where we are a State and a district of small businesses, this is very particular to my interest.  Those of us who have run small businesses know that one of the biggest challenges you have is how to borrow money--access to capital--because unless you have access to capital and unless you have the funds you need to grow and expand, you can't create new opportunities and new jobs for our kids and our grandkids. So access to capital is absolutely critical when it comes to growing our economy and providing more opportunities for the next generation.  As has already been said today, the SEC holds these annual forums where small-business leaders who are on the ground creating jobs and those in the public sector get together, and they review and explore new ways and better ways to change the regulations and the rules we have in this country such that access to capital is enhanced.  What better idea; what more common sense do we need than to have a bill, H.1312, that I am very proud to sponsor, that requires the SEC to assess every recommendation by this forum every year--not necessarily act upon it, but take it off the shelf, assess it, and determine if action should be taken.

12403,topic-id,602,"Thank you so much, Congressman Pocan from Wisconsin, a distinguished leader in the House of Representatives, and the new co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive  Mr.Speaker, a budget, as we like to say, is not just a bunch of numbers, but it is an ethical document. It is a reflection of our values, and it is a plan of action for investment of our energy and our resources into the future.  The Progressive Caucus has drafted The People's Budget based on the actual needs of American society. So we have looked out, and we have seen that the great American infrastructure is ailing; it is crumbling. The bridges are falling down. The roads and the highways need repair. The transit systems are under tremendous stress, including the Metro system here in the Maryland, Washington, Virginia area.  The cybersecurity system is compromised. Our airports, our port structure, our water systems, like in Flint, Michigan, need desperate intervention and rescue and help. We propose a $1 trillion plan of investment in the American infrastructure to create millions of jobs, putting people to work on restoring the strength and the vitality of America's basic institutions, the infrastructure that supports a strong and flourishing economy.  So that is the heart of it. But we are also working to defend the gains we have made in healthcare, to extend healthcare so that all Americans are included in our health insurance system so we can squeeze out the bureaucratic bloat and the money that is wasted on insurance bureaucracy and red tape.  We are also working for investment in quality child care so working families are not spending 30 or 40 or 50 percent of their family budgets on trying to just pay for babysitters and piece together a system.  America is the wealthiest society on Earth, and this is the wealthiest moment in our history. We can provide healthcare for everyone. We can create a childcare system that works for working families in We can reinvest in American infrastructure.  But right now, there is no leadership, and there is no vision. We are so disappointed that the White House did not come forward with a plan, a bipartisan plan, to try to reinvest in American infrastructure, which everybody says he or she supports so we could get behind that, but we don't see anything.  Proverbs says that where there is no vision the people will perish, and so we have offered a vision. And instead, they have come with a plan that lacks all vision, lacks any plan for reinvesting in American infrastructure, lacks any investment in the vital services that people need and, on the contrary, works to dismantle healthcare services, Medicaid, education, community development grants, senior workforce, jobs training, you name it, the Peace Corps, National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities; slashed $6 billion from NIH in order to undermine scientific research and medical progress on colon cancer and breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease and asthma and bipolar disorder.  We have been making progress on all of these things, and, for some reason,[[Page H4557]]the Trump administration says they want to pull the plug on it and slash $6 billion from NIH and all of the institutions around the country that NIH supports.  Well, we have invited Congressman Ro Khanna to be with us tonight.

12405,topic-id,1245,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Khanna for that excellent discussion.  You would think, with all of the domestic budget of the country being dismantled and slashed and reduced by the Trump administration that we would end up saving money, but they don't in any way at all because the money is just being shifted over to the  So the proposal is to slash $56 billion from things like Meals on Wheels, NIH research into eating disorders and asthma and Alzheimer's disease and heart and lung disorders and breast cancer and colon cancer, and environmental cleanup like the Chesapeake Bay cleanup, which they want to zero out, and then to shift the money over to the Pentagon at a time when the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform received a report and had a hearing on a McKinsey report which showed that there was $125 billion in immediate savings available at the Pentagon in waste, fraud, abuse, and contractor overruns.  So, at a moment when the Pentagon is drowning in money that they don't know what to do with and all of the beltway bandits are buzzing around in order to get their slice of the pie, President Trump decides it is a good moment to try to dismantle services for the elderly and to stop job training for young people, to stop job training in location for retired citizens, wipe out funding for the Chesapeake Bay cleanup, and roll back or abolish preschool development grants to the  The litany of attacks on the American people is really quite astounding, and I invite everybody just to go and read the specifics of this budget, which can be read as nothing more than an assault on the health and the well-being and the security of the American people.  For example, the Department of Education budget proposes to cut $578 billion in title I, part A to support services for disadvantaged students. It reduces IDEA funding by $113 million, seriously jeopardizing special education services for students with disabilities all across the country.  It eliminates title II, part A, which provides Federal funding for teacher support and class size reduction. It eliminates or reduces more than 20 additional programs promoting literacy in our communities. It cuts Perkins Career and Technical Education funding by 15 percent. That is just on the education side.  Department of Health and Human Services, it eliminates the Community Services Block It eliminates the Low Income Home Energy Assistance It cuts the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health by 40 percent. It reduces funding for Child Care and Development Block Grant programs by tens of millions of dollars. It reduces support for Federal job training for adults by 40 percent, job training for dislocated workers and youth.  It ends the Senior Community Service Employment Program, an excellent program that has located work, meaningful work, for tens of thousands of older It closes Job Corps centers. It eliminates funding to counter the worst forms of child labor through the Bureau of International Labor It eliminates $11 million in OSHA safety training grants for high hazard industries.  You have got to read it to believe it, but the amazing thing is, despite pulling the plug on all of these essential domestic programs that have been proven to work, it doesn't save us any money because the money is just thrown at the Pentagon and is being saved to throw up the wealth ladder in the country, send it up the wealth ladder through tax cuts to the largest corporations and the wealthiest  That is the name of the game. Everybody understands it, which is why this is the good news. At least we are hearing from both sides of the aisle that the President's budget written in gold[[Page H4558]]at Trump tower for the people at Mar-a-Lago is DOA, dead on arrival. Everybody is saying it, that there is no way that America could absorb the shock of letting this budget come anywhere near to reality.  But the message that we get from President Trump and his administration is very simple: Let them eat emoluments. Let them eat emoluments. Now, of course, we don't get them; he gets them. But the American people are left empty-handed at the end of this.  We don't get any meaningful investment in the infrastructure of the country. There is no jobs program that is in here. There is no attempt to guarantee the solvency and the strength and the resilience of the Social Security program. We have got that as part of our plan in The People's Budget for the Progressive  It is far from trying to stabilize and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid, those two great victories of the Great There is an attempt to undermine and ravage Medicaid and Medicare, again, to send all of the wealth up the income ladder, all of the wealth to the people who need it the least in the country, pulling the plug on everybody else.  Well, our hope is that we are going to be able to organize people to stop it, but the tragedy here is that there are so many needs in America that need to be addressed. Working people have seen a major erosion in their living standards over the last several decades. Working people have lost pension security.  Working people need to have retirement sources stabilized. We have got to use Social Security as a way to make sure that everybody can experience a decent and dignified retirement. Social Security is a great accomplishment, maybe the greatest antipoverty program ever created in the history of the It lifted millions of senior Americans out of poverty; and despite the opposition of the GOP at the time, now everybody concedes that Social Security was a brilliant idea with administrative bureaucratic overhead less than 1 percent, and it lifts millions of seniors to a state of at least a modicum of dignity in retirement. And there are millions of children who are on Social Security because of survivors benefits and disability benefits.  So we need to strengthen the Social Security system. We need to reinvest in it, and we need to expand it, because it used to be that there were supposed to be three pillars for people's old age: one was Social Security, another was a defined pension, and another was personal savings.  But the pensions from private employment are increasingly gone. They have been scattered to the winds. And people's personal savings have been eroded by the dramatic increase of economic inequality in the country and the erosion of the living standards of working people.  Tens of millions of Americans are relying exclusively on Social Security now, so we have got to reinvest in Social Security and make sure it works, and we have got plans for doing that, too.  But the point is that the real problems of the country have been ignored. There is no vision. There is no program. There is no policy for reinvesting in America coming from the Mar-a-Lago set, from this Cabinet of billionaires.  We are not getting any of it. Instead, we get an almost laughable, comical, cartoon version of rightwing GOP economics, which proposes to slash everything and to uproot the basic programs that the American people rely on for a civilized society. We can do better than this.  I see I have been joined by my very distinguished colleague who will pursue the discussion. Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.Ellison).

Let's review some of the extraordinary assaults on the health and the well-being of the American people that are embodied in this atrocious budget.  First, the President says: let's cut children's health insurance by more than $600 billion.  This would strip countless children of dental care, asthma treatment, and other medical visits.  It eliminates over $190 billion to the SNAP program, a supplemental assistance program that is the food assistance program which helps prevent 42 million working families from going hungry in  It calls for billions in cuts to It, unbelievably, in the middle of an opioid crisis across the country, would reduce access to drug addiction treatment and drug prevention services with a $1.2 billion cut to the Centers for Disease Control and                              {time}  1815  At a time when we need to be doubling down on investment in drug prevention and drug treatment and dealing with the opioid crisis, the Trump administration simply hides under the bed.  The budget would cut the Department of Labor's job training programs by an astonishing two-thirds--that is job training for our people at a time when we are going through dramatic structural shifts in the nature of the economy with robots and mechanization, and they want to cut by 65 percent the Department of Labor's job training programs.  They want to sell off our national parks and public lands for oil drilling, gas exploration, and fracking. They want to sell the land of the American people--the trust that we have had for centuries--that a great Republican President, Teddy Roosevelt, once insisted on. They want to sell it off to their friends at Exxon Mobil and the frackers across the country.  They have spent $10 billion building their stupid wall--a 14th century answer to a 21st century problem. Maybe they will have a moat and some alligators to go with it. But didn't I hear somebody say on the campaign trail that Mexico was going to pay for that wall? I heard millions of people chanting that at rallies, and the President was saying: Mexico--you can believe me--Mexico is going to pay for it.  Already they are putting $2 billion in our budget while they are stripping schoolchildren of their lunches. While they are slashing scientific and medical research in the country, they want to put $2 billion into a wall that nobody needs at a time when illegal immigration from the southern border is at a decade's record low. They want to take $2 billion and put it into that.  They want to cut billions of dollars from afterschool programs, from teacher training, and from student loans. They want to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, which millions of women and men depend on not just for family planning but also for basic medical attention, purely out of animosity toward Planned Parenthood which has not received one penny for abortion services in many decades. They just want to dismantle it. They would destroy it if they could, despite the fact that millions of Americans depend on Planned  They want to cut Social Security--which they promised not to touch--by $72 billion by restricting enrollment in the disability insurance program--and on and on. You name your favorite, most important Federal program, and I guarantee you, unless you are a Big Business beltway contractor defense bandit, it is going to be cut in this budget. You can go and check it out.  Now, if a foreign power--a foreign repressive power--like Putin's Russia or Duterte's Philippines or Orban's Hungary set out to injure and demoralize the American people, they could not have done better than the budget which President Trump sent to Capitol Hill this week. This is a budget that is drafted seemingly by an enemy of the American people.  It is not the media that is the American people's enemy, as the President insisted, it is whoever drafted this budget. That is the enemy of the American people.  Let them eat emoluments, they are telling us with this. Let them eat emoluments. They have got all the emoluments. They are the ones taking the money from the foreign governments. But they are saying, Let them eat emoluments, because the American people have been robbed by this budget if it were ever to see the light of day.  Mr.Speaker, a great Republican President once spoke of government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Abraham Lincoln was a Member of this body. He sat where we have the honor of sitting in this body, and he talked about government of the people, by the people, and for the people. This is a budget of the super rich, by the super rich, for the super rich. It was drafted by a Cabinet of billionaires for the people who are lounging at Mar-a-Lago today, and they give the finger to the rest of the country. That is what this budget says.  If my friends on the other side of the aisle are smart--and I know they are--and they know what is good for them--and I know they do, Mr.Speaker--they will say immediately this document is DOA and they have got nothing to do with it and very quickly distance themselves from it. We need to return to that great vision of a government that is of the people, by the people, and for the people. That is who we are as a country.  The government right now is experiencing a hostile takeover by a tiny elite, and that is what is taking place around the world today. If you look at Putin's Russia, if you look at Orban's Hungary, if you look at Duterte in the Philippines, if you look at what they tried to do with Le Pen in France, there is a new model, my friends, all over the world. Government is a moneymaking operation for a tiny elite in each society. They want to go back to something like kings and queens where the government serves the tiniest portion of the people.  They might get elected spouting populist rhetoric and slogans, but the minute they get in, Wall Street takes over. We have got a President who campaigned against Goldman Sachs, and his Cabinet is dominated by Goldman How long are people going to fall for that magic trick? Not very long if anybody still believes in it out there. I don't think anybody's faith or confidence in this President as a populist will survive this budget--what a joke, and what an insult to the great populists of American history like the populist movement in William Jennings Bryan, that they would dare to associate themselves with populism.[[Page H4561]]  This is a budget that is based on elitism and class warfare, top-down class warfare: the richest people in this country against everybody else. That is what this budget represents. That is what it embodies.  So check out the Progressive Caucus' People's It is a real reinvestment in the infrastructure of the country: our bridges, our roads, our highways, our transit systems, our port systems, our airports, and cybersecurity--where America really needs investment, not stealing from poor people, not stealing from the working class, and not ripping off NIH and the Centers for Disease Control in order to put money in the Pentagon for a bunch of beltway bandits and defense contractors who have so much money they don't know what to do with it anymore. That is not what we need. We need a real investment in  This budget is an affront, and it is an insult to the American people. We should reject it immediately. I call on all of our colleagues, Mr.Speaker, to repudiate this document in a bipartisan fashion, and let's get down to work for the American people.

12224,topic-id,576,"Mr.President, today Senator Blunt and I are reintroducing the Family Self-Sufficiency Act, and we are pleased to be joined in this effort in this Congress by our colleagues, Senators Scott and  The Family Self Sufficient, FSS, Program is an existing Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, employment and savings incentive initiative for families that use section 8 vouchers or live in public housing. FSS provides participants access to the resources and training that enable them to pursue higher paying employment opportunities and meet financial goals, while putting FSS families in a better position to save by establishing an interest-bearing escrow account for them. Upon graduation from the FSS program, the family can use these savings to pay for job-related expenses, such as additional workforce training or the purchase or maintenance of a car needed for commuting purposes. In short, FSS is all about giving our constituents the incentives and the tools to move up the economic ladder.[[Page S3458]]  Our bipartisan legislation enhances the FSS Program by streamlining the administration of this program, broadening the supportive services that can be provided, and extending the reach of the FSS Program to tenants who live in privately owned properties with project-based assistance. In short, we make the FSS Program easier to administer and more effective.  First, to streamline the FSS Program, our bill would permanently combine two separate but similar FSS Programs into one. Under the existing authorization, HUD is supposed to operate one FSS Program for those families served by the Housing Choice Voucher Program and another for those families served by the Public Housing This is the case even though the purpose of each FSS Program--to increase economic independence and self-sufficiency--is identical. Unfortunately, without a permanent change in the authorization, public housing agencies, PHAs, may at some point in the future have to operate essentially two programs to achieve the same goal. With our bill, PHAs would be relieved of this unnecessary burden permanently.  Second, our legislation broadens the scope of the supportive services that may be offered to include attainment of a high school equivalency certificate, education in pursuit of a postsecondary degree or certification, and financial literacy, such as training in financial management, financial coaching, and asset building. Providing families in need with affordable rental housing is critical, but combining this resource with the support and services to help families get ahead increases the effectiveness of this Federal investment. Our legislation makes it easier for FSS participants to obtain the training necessary to secure employment and the education to make prudent financial decisions to protect and grow their earnings.  Lastly, our bill permanently extends the FSS Program to families who live in privately owned properties subsidized with project-based rental assistance. It shouldn't matter what kind of housing assistance a family gets. Families seeking to achieve self-sufficiency shouldn't be held back by this sort of technicality.  I thank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Compass Working Capital, Housing Partnership Network, Preservation of Affordable Housing, National Housing Conference, Stewards of Affordable Housing for the Future, National NeighborWorks Association, National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, Public Housing Authority Directors Association, Public Housing Association of Rhode Island, and Rhode Island Housing for their support. I also thank Senator Blunt, Senator Menendez, and Senator Scott for their partnership and I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill, which will help give those receiving housing assistance a greater chance to build their skills and achieve economic independence.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-13-pt1-PgS3457.txt,1982,1645,2017.0,13.0,June

We have a choice of two paths, and they lead to very different outcomes.  ObamaCare's regulatory behemoth is collapsing the individual market and is paving the way toward a disastrous result, namely, socialized medicine--and the crowded waiting rooms, scarce access to physicians, and low-quality health care that comes with it, not to mention an unprecedented accumulation of power in Washington, D. This is not conjecture. Barack Obama, Harry Reid, and a whole host of ObamaCare supporters have been completely candid about their ultimate goal of a single-payer healthcare system, which could then seamlessly devolve into socialized medicine.

Seniors with Alzheimer's, dementia, and other special needs, someone to watch over them at home so they don't get lost or injure themselves or leave the stove on and injure others? Seniors with Parkinson's who need help to walk, to move, to get out of their chair, seniors too frail to care for themselves, or need long-term rehabilitation after a fall and an injured hip or an injured femur?  How many of us have worried about where they would live and how they would get the care that they need? And oftentimes, the real question is: How are they going to pay for that care?  Most people work their entire lives, save for retirement, pay into the system, yet still find themselves struggling to afford the care that they need. Both parents in middle class families have to work to barely make ends meet; no money and nobody home to care for their parents or grandparents.  I understand the tough decision.

That is why TrumpCare's Medicaid cuts would devastate our Nation's seniors, leaving the 64 percent of nursing home residents who depend on Medicaid out in the cold. In fact, nursing homes account for 42 percent of Medicaid spending.  Under TrumpCare, many seniors will lose their nursing home care, grandmothers with disabilities would find it harder to be cared for, harder to walk, harder to eat, harder to bathe. Nursing homes give patients a safe and caring place to recuperate when they are weakened by disabilities but don't need to be in a hospital, and they provide families peace of mind knowing that their loved one has a safe and caring place to get around-the-clock care.  That is why we must stop We cannot allow these deep cuts to Medicaid threaten the health of our seniors. We cannot rip these services away from the most vulnerable among us.

Funds used for college work-study programs, loan forgiveness for those who enter public service, and dollars used by schools for mental health will not just be cut but be eliminated.

I believe it is particularly significant that a bipartisan coalition is seeking to reestablish Congress as a final arbiter of sanctions relief, no matter what the administration does, particularly, considering that this administration has been too eager to put sanctions relief on the table.

12261,topic-id,1094,"Mr.President, let me talk about the retirement CRA, the vote that is coming before us quite soon.  So far this Congress, the Republican majority has passed 13 CRAs--Congressional Review Act resolutions--all on party-line votes. Far from being a major accomplishment, these CRAs just overturn rules passed at the very end of the Obama administration. To make them a major accomplishment of the first 100 days misreads what they are and history, when compared to many other Most of them, to boot, even worse, rather than benefiting the American people, just benefit large, wealthy, special interests--not just this one but just about all of them. They are not for working people. They are not for middle-class If there is some narrow special interest that doesn't like it, then this Republican-led Congress goes along. It is not right. Let me give a few examples.  The Republicans passed a CRA that removed protections for our waters and streams from the harmful pollution that comes from the runoff of mining sites. Why? Large mining companies wanted it. The American people weren't crying out for it.  This Republican Congress passed a CRA that would make it easier for the adjudicated mentally ill to purchase firearms--a priority of the gun lobby, certainly not of the American people. They even passed a CRA that allowed large oil, mining, and gas companies to make payments to foreign governments--essentially bribes--without even having to disclose them.  That is not the America we know. That is not the Shining City on the That is not the lady in the harbor with a torch.  Today, the Republican majority is going to have a vote on another This one may be the worst of all because it would block initiatives by States to provide alternative retirement savings options for millions of Is that because Americans are clamoring: Take away my ability for retirement if my company doesn't give me one. No, we haven't heard a peep about that. It is because the private financial institutions--Wall Street--that manage retirement plans don't want to see any competition from city or State retirement plans. This is just another giveaway to the wealthy special interests that will hurt working Americans who should have more low-cost choices when it comes to their retirement.  We all know our Nation faces a serious retirement security problem. Pensions, often a guarantee for large numbers of Americans, are vanishing. New employers often don't provide pensions. Older employers' pension plans are running low. People who used to feel, when they retired, there would at least be something there so they could live their final years in dignity, are worried, as they should be. Fifty-five million working Americans do not have a way for retirement to save through their employer. That is nearly half--half--of all private sector workers aged 18 to 64. It is a huge concern.  So what did the Obama administration do in its last few months? Wisely, they said States could set up initiatives for employees to save through their employers' payroll systems. The Obama administration acted to allow States to pursue these initiatives by exempting them from overreaching[[Page S2690]]Federal regulations and then provided necessary consumer protections. That is what people want. Now, maybe some of these big financial interests don't want it because the plans the States head up will be a lot cheaper than the private sector plan, but we have to adapt to the 21st century. Any way we can help people with security in their golden years with retirement savings, we should.  Here is another issue. We hear a lot from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle about States' rights. This regulation doesn't force the States to do it. It allows the States to do it. It gives them a choice. This CRA vote would re-regulate the  My Republican friends--who spare no opportunity to decry regulation and exhort States' rights--will impose a new regulation on States from My Republican friends talk about increasing Americans' freedom of choice in all sorts of matters. What about their choice in terms of retirement, one of the most important things to the American people. Middle-class incomes are squeezed in so many different directions. It is harder to scrape and save for retirement when the cost of college, medicine, and other essentials go up while take-home pay is stagnant. It makes sense to give Americans a choice to start saving earlier, at a lower cost, for retirement. That is why 23 State Treasurers from States across the political spectrum--across Utah and Kentucky, our two speakers before me--have written to their Senators opposing this Red States and blue States alike want to pursue this option. Polling shows that across party lines, 77 percent of voters support State-facilitated retirement savings, but Republicans want to block it. We haven't heard one good reason--one good reason. We know the real reason. Financial institutions don't want competition, particularly if it is a little cheaper for the worker.  Another example of special interests taking hold of the Republican agenda: Almost every one of these CRAs has been at the behest of a narrow special interest over the interests of working Unfortunately, it is a metaphor for both the new Trump administration and how our Republican colleagues are marching in lockstep to support the wealthy--people doing great--over the middle class and working people who need help.  President Trump promised over and over again in his campaign to stick up for working He said he would be their voice and their champion. Since he has taken office, President Trump sure hasn't governed that way. He is pursuing policy after policy that would help the wealthy and hurt the middle class, breaking promise after promise after promise to working I ask him to veto this legislation.  Leader Pelosi and I are putting out a statement that asks just that. Stand up for working people. There is no good argument against what the Obama administration did. There is no good argument against letting workers decide on their own volition that they want a retirement plan and are willing to put some money into it.  This CRA is another test. If our President and our Republican colleagues were truly a champion of working men and women, they wouldn't support this resolution. If President Trump were truly a champion of working men and women, he would veto this resolution. We call on him to do so.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Essentially, these are the men and women who keep our country safe with America's most sophisticated missile defense system. So I would like to read their names on the Senate floor.

But the one that keeps not only me but many Members of the Senate and our military up at night right now is the threat from North There is no doubt that North Korea and the leader of that country are intent on obtaining and nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile that can range our entire country. Recent unclassified briefings on this issue have said it is no longer a matter of if but when North Korea is going to have this capability.  To protect us from this impending threat, this advancing threat, a number of us introduced a bill this past week to enhance our missile defense system across the country. While Alaska's missile defenders currently keep us safe, like many in our military they need more training and better technology so these brave men and women[[Page S3195]]can do their job and continue to keep America safe in the future.  Leading up to Memorial Day, I want to make sure to thank all who have served and continue to serve our Nation in uniform. I especially honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice, and, of course, their families. I also want to make sure I recognize Alaska's missile defenders. While millions of Americans will be outside this weekend, having a barbecue and celebrating Memorial Day, every American in this country can rest assured that these brave missile defenders in Alaska, men and women like the Spartans of old, stand watch to defend our freedoms. They are doing it today and they will do it on Memorial Day, just like they do every day of the year.  That is why all of them, in my view, merit the award of Alaskans of the                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgS3194-2.txt,2290,PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BUDGET,2017.0,25.0,May

Tragically, human trafficking is a $32 billion industry. This horrific practice is often difficult to detect, yet there are nearly 21 million victims of human trafficking throughout the world each year. It is estimated that 55 percent of these victims are women and young girls.  Sadly, most incidents of human trafficking go unreported, while the victims suffer in silent pain. It is for these reasons that we must raise awareness of this terrible practice and work to combat the growing threat against these vulnerable people.  As a member of the State assembly, I championed bipartisan measures to combat this modern-day form of slavery, including the Trafficking Victims Protection and Justice  Yesterday, to continue this fight, I worked alongside my colleagues in the House to pass bipartisan measures to eliminate the scourge on humanity at the Federal level, and also today.

We have benefited enormously from Pastor Ewing's spiritual mentorship, his always wise and godly council, and his example of faithfulness.  In addition to those in my State of South Dakota and across the country, the ministry has been involved through the years in ministering to people who have been through very difficult circumstances. They were there after 9/11 in New York and after Hurricane There have been countless examples of things that happened not only here at home but also around the world--all the things that have gone on in the country of Haiti--Christian Life Ministries has been on the scene and has been very ably ministering to people who have been impacted by these horrific events.  Bill Ewing is a lifelong South Dakotan, although he did venture over to Wyoming to go to college, where he was a two-time All American baseball player and actually was in the California Angels farm system for a number of years before an injury ended his career, but that loss to the California Angels and Major League Baseball was an enormous win for people all over South Dakota and all across this country who have benefited from the work he and his team in Christian Life Ministries have done.

12240,topic-id,369,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.1312, a commonsense measure that will ensure the SEC responds to recommendations that will reduce barriers to small businesses' capital formation. Access to capital is the lifeblood of every business. As ranking member of the House Small Business Committee, I hear this on a near daily basis. It is as true today as it was 65 years ago when Congress created the Small Business  Since that time, Congress has taken steps to better understand the needs of our small businesses and find ways to improve access to capital. In 1980, we created the Government-Business Forum on Small Business Capital Formation at the This body helps policymakers learn about unnecessary impediments to small business capital formation and address how they can be eliminated or reduced. However, the SEC isn't currently required to act on the forum's recommendations.  The Small Business Capital Formation Enhancement Act changes the SEC's obligation by requiring the Commission to respond to the recommendations made by the annual Government-Business This bill is modeled after a similar provision in the Dodd-Frank Act requiring the SEC to respond to the recommendation of the Investor Advisory  However, there are important distinctions between the recommendations of the IAC and the forum. Specifically, the IAC is limited by statute to 23 members. By contrast, the forum is open to all public and private participants. As a result, the IAC has only issued 12 recommendations since its first meeting in 2012. During the same timeframe, the forum issued 98 recommendations.  While I understand the desire to have the SEC respond to each of the forum's recommendations, I would remind my colleagues that the SEC has the important duty to police our financial markets. Therefore, I hope my colleagues will remember these additional duties and set appropriate funding levels for the SEC to ensure agency resources are not being diverted from its crucial examination and enforcement activities.  I would like to thank Mr.Poliquin and Mr.Vargas for crafting this bipartisan bill to ensure that the voice of our small business community is heard.  Mr.Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-05-01-pt1-PgH2980.txt,1184,CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW ACT RESOLUTION,2017.0,1.0,April

12322,topic-id,457,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for the opportunity to co-lead this Special Order with my dear colleague, Congressman Ted Poe, for Human Trafficking Awareness  I was thrilled, Mr.Speaker, that yesterday the House passed my legislation, the Put Trafficking Victims First Together, we can get victims of trafficking out of dangerous and abusive situations and create better, more accessible trauma-informed services. Victims don't just need to be rescued. They need opportunities to rebuild and sort through trauma and to live well.  My bill advances a survivor-centered approach to addressing human trafficking that ensures the safety, confidentiality, and the well-being of victims. It encourages stakeholders to recognize symptoms of trauma and coping mechanisms that may impact victims' interactions with law enforcement, the justice system, and service providers.  One of the key ways we can address the upsetting realities of human trafficking in the U.justice system is by giving victims a pathway to vacate and expunge their criminal records for offenses that they were forced to commit. I have met with many survivors in my home State of Missouri and across our great country who struggle to rebuild their lives because they are trailed by criminal records. Traffickers and pimps intentionally push victims to commit crimes as a means of control.  My heart breaks for these women who have suffered horrendous abuse and bear the mark of a record on top of it. Criminal records make it difficult for survivors to get jobs, medical care, education, and even housing assistance. These records haunt survivors and can even lead to revictimization.  Mr.Speaker, if we are serious about giving survivors of trafficking a second chance, we must enact serious, foolproof vacatur laws that erase the collateral consequences of treating trafficking victims like criminals. This is why I introduced, along with the support of many of my colleagues, the Trafficking Survivors Relief This bill would give victims of trafficking relief from Federal or D.criminal convictions or arrests.  We know well that Federal courts are not--and I underscore ``not''--infallible, and that many victims are trafficked within the These women don't deserve criminal records. They deserve restitution, civil damages, and the empowerment to walk with their heads held high.  I am adamant that these women get a second chance at life, that they find housing, therapy, jobs, new friends, and new chances. I am adamant that the United States of America will no longer punish people for trauma that most of us cannot even imagine. I am adamant that the United States Congress will have the moral aptitude to enact the Trafficking Survivors Relief I am adamant that not one more victim of trafficking will be mistreated in our criminal justice system. Mr.Speaker, I am adamant that we pass this bill into law.  ",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgH4563.txt,2137,1845,2017.0,24.0,June

So the problem is prevalent. It exists still.  What breaks my heart most of all are those children who have been victimized, whether it is by online predators or other means, those who are the most vulnerable in our society. We have been able to work with many of the safe houses, with our prosecutors, with our law enforcement, with our advocacy groups.  As Congressman Poe and I both know, we can't always legislate all the ills of society away. What I appreciate about the work that we do is not only passing laws and legislation to help those victims, but also the education and awareness that is so very important.
