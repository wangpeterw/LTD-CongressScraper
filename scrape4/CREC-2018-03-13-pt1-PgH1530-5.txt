                            AUSTIN BOMBINGS

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as the senior member on the Judiciary 
Committee, I remember dealing with church bombings some few years ago. 
So I rise today to acknowledge my colleagues in Austin and to express 
my sympathy for the bombing deaths that occurred with a nondescript 
package being left at the homes of African Americans and a Hispanic.
  I believe action is needed now, and I certainly thank law enforcement 
for engaging ATF and the FBI. But I think it was important that when 
the first bombing occurred, notice generally should have been made 
about nondescript packages at the homes of individuals.
  We know the facts are not all in. The investigation is ongoing. 
However, the Federal Government can be of help to local law enforcement 
that I know is working hard. We want to be there for them. But it is 
important to take note, and I want my constituents to be aware, that 
nondescript packages, until this dastardly individual is found, please 
call the police in whatever jurisdiction you are in in the State of 
Texas, and let's hope that we can find this person as quickly as 
possible.
  Mr. Speaker, my deepest sympathy and prayers are with those who 
already lost their life.
