He has completed three rounds of intense questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee, which totaled nearly 20 hours and covered nearly 1,200 questions. This was the longest hearing of any nominee in the 21st century.  During this time, Judge Gorsuch showed himself to be uniquely qualified and experienced to serve on our Nation's highest court.

14090,topic-id,205,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Doug Collins for leading this very Special Order on a topic that is very near and dear to my heart, the invaluable role of community pharmacists in our society.  As a rural dentist who practiced for 35 years, I can relate to the plight of community pharmacists who must overcome all of the challenges involved in running a small business while serving their patients and serving their customers and doing their job as a medical professional.[[Page H1451]]  Just like my small hometown of Woodville, Texas, where I practice, many of the areas in which community pharmacies are located are rural and have underserved, low-income and elderly populations. This can present unique challenges and, oftentimes, results in community pharmacists performing a lot of services, such as face-to-face counseling and planning services for patients' medication regimen at no charge, care that is uncompensated by Medicare and not typically reimbursed by private insurance companies as well.  What is even more challenging is the uphill battle that community pharmacists continually face in just getting adequate payment for the lifesaving medications that they dispense on a daily basis and still be able to earn a small profit.

14111,topic-id,348,"Mr.Speaker, I think the real question for the majority is: What do you have against Secretary-elect Ryan Zinke? He is being given a brand-new rule and the keys to the castle. He has a clean slate to develop the playbook for a hugely impactful planning process and free rein to make it what he wants.  Yet, one of the first moves the majority is making, before Mr.Zinke has even been confirmed, is to undo Planning 2.0 and leave the agency with a planning process that was written before my staff was born. In other words, the majority is tying Mr.Zinke's hands.  Quite simply, the majority is laboring under the false impression that Planning 2.0 makes the BLM's planning process worse when, in fact, it makes it better. Under the current regulatory framework for resource management plans, it takes BLM an average of 8 years to update and revise a plan, and this matters because, by the time the plan is completed, it is almost already out of date. Significant public involvement doesn't happen until the end of the process. There is often litigation which stalls the process even more. This is a huge waste of government resources and taxpayer money.  Mr.Speaker, as Ranking Member Grijalva said earlier, the use of the Congressional Review Act to revoke BLM Planning 2.0, or any other Federal regulation, is a radical step. That is the reason why the Congressional Review Act has only been used once before this year.  Once Congress approves the Congressional Review Act resolution, the agency can never issue a similar rule. So this is an extreme overreach in general, but especially for something like BLM's Planning 2.0, which is designed to enhance efficiency and make BLM more responsive to public input.  Isn't our goal to improve how government works and make it more efficient? This resolution will permanently lock us into an old rule that didn't work for anybody.  I know House Republicans and President Trump are eager to roll back regulations, but we should pump the brakes on this particular resolution. A lot has changed since 1983.

It would have been much better if the legislative process hadn't collapsed in theSenate and forced reconciliation as the vehicle.

There is a reason, after 6 years, the Republicans do not have an alternative to offer now. It is because their wildlycontradictory promises cannot be met.

14096,topic-id,1979,"Mr.President, today I wish to join the American people in celebrating Women's History I would like to begin that celebration by paying homage to several women whose ingenuity and inventions have shaped modern society, but who, like innumerable women throughout history, have not received the credit or recognition they are due.  Katherine Blodgett is a good place to start. In 1935, she invented the first transparent glass that eliminated distortion and glare. Before her, glass contained small bubbles and inclusions that was suitable for windows, but little else. Her method of producing and cutting glass revolutionized the material and is the reason we have camera lenses, microscopes, and eyeglasses today. Without her pioneering work, our ability to see and our ability to look into the universe would be degraded.  In 1942, the actress Hedy Lamarr and a partner were granted a U.patent for a secret communication system that involved manipulating radio frequencies to form an unbreakable code to prevent classified messages from being intercepted. The significance of her invention was not fully realized until the 1960s, when it was used by naval ships during the Cuban Missile We were able to navigate that perilous nuclear threat successfully in part because of her self-taught inventiveness and skill. Lamarr's coded communications system has been used by numerous military agencies since.  Just 2 years later, in 1944, Grace Hopper made her own kind of history, becoming what many consider to be one of the world's first computer scientists. She invented the compiler that translated written language into computer code and coined the terms ``bug'' and ``debugging.'' Fifteen years later, she led the team that developed COBOL, one of the very first programming languages.  More recently, in 1965, Stephanie Kwolek invented We know Kevlar best as the material used to manufacture bulletproof vests, protecting our police officers and first responders in their greatest moments of crisis, but Kevlar is widely considered to be one of the strongest, most durable materials ever invented and has become a critical component in the manufacturing of airplanes, boats, cars, and bridge cables.  I pause to honor these great inventors and scientists because their names should be familiar, but they aren't. As long as toxic, gender-role stereotypes persist, these women serve as important examples that such stereotypes are hollow and wrong. Women have been serving on the frontlines of war, science, and invention since long before men ``allowed'' them.[[Page S2045]]  These women and others are part of our untold history. You will rarely hear them discussed in American classrooms, and you will seldom find their stories printed in textbooks. Most people wouldn't even recognize their names; yet our lives and fortunes have been shaped by them. Every day, men go to work protected by Kevlar vests, live their daily lives with the benefit of eyeglasses, or boot up their laptop computer using the devices and tools women gave them. That is both the majesty and tragedy of women's history: it is inextricable and powerful and entirely undervalued.  This Women's History Month should not pass without each and every one of us at the very least taking the time to acknowledge and appreciate the women of history who helped to invent modern society, who fought alongside men in every war, who gave us more complete rights and equality, who endured the habitual and everyday scorn of sexism--and who did so generation after generation without accolade or recognition.  Perhaps the best way to honor the past is to secure the future. The denizens of women's history didn't endure systemic misogyny or work so hard to change our world so that we would peer backward and applaud. They did so with the hope we would look forward and make progress.  We still have a long way to go, but we have made progress. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, being a woman is no longer considered a ``preexisting condition'' that warrants higher premiums and deductibles. Also thanks to the Affordable Care Act, preventative services for women--like mammograms, cervical cancer screenings, and prenatal care--are covered by insurance companies. Today more than 48 million American women take advantage of that.  Thanks to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, women have extended protection in cases of wage discrimination. The Lilly Ledbetter Act finally recognized that, when pay discrimination occurs, it is not a single event, but a chronic and repeated offense that inflicts ongoing damage with each and every substandard paycheck. This simple and commonsense recognition has allowed women to seek justice against the kind of economic disenfranchisement that has plagued generations.  Progress, however, does not have its own autopilot button. We must be its stewards and its champions. We must be its agents. We must protect it actively, each and every day, or else we will be complicit in its loss.  I am talking about women's reproductive rights. A woman's right to make her own decisions is under threat today. Her body is her body. It is not ours, and it certainly is not the government's. Roe v. Wade decided that in 1973, yet 44 years later, the Federal Government is run by a party that uses every tool at its disposal to chip away at reproductive rights. Whether it is State policies to limit the types of buildings abortions can be performed in or the threat to defund Planned Parenthood, women's rights are under attack.  Let's be clear that Federal funding for abortion services is already banned under the Hyde Today's witch hunt against Planned Parenthood is not substantive in nature; it is a thinly-veiled attempt to prolong a culture war with the hope of assuaging far-right voters. Women's reproductive rights deserve more than to be treated as a political punchline. Reproductive rights were hard-won by centuries of activism and pain, and we--all Members of this Chamber--must vow this month and every month to honor that with our votes and with our voices. We must vow not to let women's reproductive rights be diminished on our watch.  It is 2017, and still, women are expected to be everything simultaneously, all while they are refused the tools and the freedom to balance such difficult demands. It is 2017, and still, families--mothers most of all--are too often forced to choose between parenthood and economic security, between recovering from childbirth and their career. No woman, no matter what her line of work or Zip Code may be, should be forced to make such an impossible decision. It is our job to pass legislation to ensure no woman has to.  Even with the Lilly Ledbetter legislation, women today are paid, on average, just 77 cents for every dollar men receive for performing the same work. That gap is even worse for women of color: African-American women only earn 64 cents to the dollar, while Latina women earn only 55 cents. That is a problem begging to be solved by That is a problem for all of us. Women are powerful economic engines in this country, and if we continue to stand idly by while their work is underpaid and undervalued, we will all suffer. We will all have to explain to our daughters and granddaughters why we didn't fight harder for them.  Critically, there is also the issue of violence against women. It is a moral outrage that women experience about 4.8 million intimate partner related physical and sexual assaults every single year. When women stand up and tell us the stories behind this number, we must sit down and listen. We must stop speaking over them with advice on how to protect themselves or avoid certain social situations. They shouldn't have to. It is insulting to presume they require lectures on personal safety, but that men don't require lectures on consent. This problem demands a cultural shift, and we must be its purveyors.  There is the issue of college affordability. A related issue is access to and participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, STEM, programs and--of equal importance--encouragement to join them. Women need to be better represented in positions of power.  These and other issues are what is at stake. These and other issues are why we recognize Women's History Month: to remind ourselves and each other that women helped build this Nation and this world. We need to remind ourselves that women are therefore entitled to equal representation in it and equal access to its opportunities. We need to remind ourselves that women deserve equal respect and equal protection under the law and that women's rights are human rights. We all prosper when we fight to protect them.  Toward these ends, I have led the charge in Congress to ratify the Equal Rights Many Americans would be shocked to learn that the Constitution still lacks a provision ensuring gender equality. That is wrong, but it is fixable. I have introduced S.5, legislation to remove the deadline for States to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, which would pave the way for its formal adoption. Nevada recently passed the Equal Rights Amendment, leaving us just two States shy of success.  The Equal Rights Amendment is only slightly longer than two tweets, but its ratification would finally give women full and equal protection under the It reads as follows:       Section 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be      denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on      account of sex.       Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by      appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.       Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after      the date of ratification.  It is that simple, and it is both necessary and past time to adopt it.  When Congress passed the ERA in 1972, it provided that the measure had to be ratified by three-fourths of the States, 38 States, within 7 years. The original deadline was later extended to 10 years by a joint resolution enacted by Ultimately, 35 States ratified the ERA by the time the revised deadline expired, leaving advocates a little short.  Article V of the Constitution contains no time limits for ratification of constitutional amendments. In fact, in 1992, the 27th Amendment to the Constitution prohibiting immediate congressional pay raises was ratified after 203 years. The Senate could pass my legislation removing the 10-year deadline right now. I strongly encourage the majority leader to bring S.5 up for a vote as soon as possible. American women deserve to know that their most fundamental rights are explicitly protected by our nation's most venerated document.  I have often said that how a nation treats its women is a good barometer of that nation's potential for success as a whole. I hold the United States of America to that standard. Every day, I weigh the successes and failures we have had along the path toward fair treatment and gender equality, and I assess ways Congress can facilitate more successes. Every day, I reevaluate how best to fight for the Equal Rights Amendment, how best to protect reproductive rights, how best to fight for[[Page S2046]]paid family leave and affordable higher education and greater representation in this very  I invite every Senator to do the same, both because those are the right battles and because fighting them protects gender equality progress that has been so hard-won by the women of this We must not allow those victories to be reversed. We must keep progressing.  This Women's History Month, I am reminded of what the poet G.Anderson once said: ``Feminism is not about making women strong. Women are already strong. It's about changing the way the world perceives that strength.'' Let us remember it is precisely that strength that has propelled our world forward. It is precisely that strength that serves as the foundation of so many of this country's successes, and it is precisely that strength we must remember and meet with our own, when women's rights are under siege.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgS2044-2.txt,,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF S.

14104,topic-id,438,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, BLM Planning 2.0 is yet one more example of Obama-era Federal Government overreach. It takes authority away from people in local communities, in my home State of Wyoming, and all across the It takes authority away from our elected representatives at a local level, and it puts Washington bureaucrats in charge of decisions that influence and impact our lives.  It significantly dilutes cooperating agency status, and it discounts input from those who are closest to our land and our resources. BLM 2.0 is an example of the midnight rulemaking that we saw that was so rampant in the Obama administration. In fact, it is an abuse of that rulemaking process.  By statute, Mr.Speaker, the BLM is supposed to manage our public lands for multiple use and for sustained yield, but instead we have seen consistently throughout the last 8 years the Obama administration doing everything possible to deny all human use of our public lands.  This rulemaking isn't based on the language of the statute that underlies it. It is based, rather, on policy preferences that have been expressed in memos and in various studies. The rulemaking takes another step in imposing a brand new mitigation formula that essentially is a land grab by a Federal agency that would put even more land under the control of Washington bureaucrats.  Despite the fact that these agencies are required to consider costs as they impose regulations, BLM 2.0 was imposed not only using cost estimates that are clearly wrong, but, in fact, it removed all reference to looking at the devastating impact that this rule has on our local economies across the  This rule takes away authority and power from those who know best how to manage our lands and how to manage our resources.

In short, Mr.Speaker, this rule takes authority away from those who know best what we need to do to manage and sustain our resources, and it puts it in the hands of the Federal Government and bureaucrats here in Washington, D.

Mr.Mr.Speaker, of all of the stifling, bureaucratic, pettifogging regulations that Congress is now repealing from the previous administration, none is more deserving of repeal than the BLM's Planning 2.0 rule.  This rule governs the process for creating resource management plans. If they are done wrong, they can devastate the economies of the communities that are impacted by those lands. A new RMP can crush an industry, and it can destroy a community, which is why States and counties across the West have been anxiously watching this process unfold.  Despite serious concerns being raised by State and local governments--by farming, livestock, and energy production groups, and even by Congress during the rulemaking process--the Bureau of Land Management charged full steam ahead and finalized this rule. The BLM assured stakeholders that the final rule governing this process would not undercut State and local voices. But, when the BLM realized that the election of President Trump endangered the environmental left's stranglehold on this agency, the Planning 2.0 rule was hastily finalized in contradiction of almost all of the promises that the BLM made.  The Planning 2.0 rule is a gross expansion of BLM's power, and the power of well-funded political groups that use the veneer of environmentalism at the expense of local communities. Under BLM's current RMP procedures, our Western counties already complain of having their voices ignored and their interests disregarded.  Last year, the Federal Lands Subcommittee held a field hearing in George, We heard how the city of George was experiencing economic growth, pushing the limits of its infrastructure, and how the city had tried over and over to engage the BLM in the development of a new RMP to address the needs of the local community. The city was desperate for the new RMP to include a transportation corridor for a new road to meet the needs of their growing economy. In their testimony before the subcommittee, the city relayed that they were unable to secure regular meetings with their local BLM office, despite the BLM office holding frequent meetings with local environmental groups.  In the end, the RMP was released and there was nothing to account for the transportation needs of the people of In a State that is two-thirds owned by the Federal Government, I find it hard to believe that the BLM could not have worked with the city of George to accommodate a simple road.  With these kind of results under BLM's current planning regime, it is no wonder that counties across the West are weary of a new planning rule.[[Page H1034]]BLM should be focused on improving their collaboration and coordination with counties and local governments.

14116,topic-id,435,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.LaMalfa).  Mr.Mr.Speaker, thank you to my colleague from Wyoming for the time and ability to weigh in on this.  Today, I rise in support of the measure for congressional disapproval under the Congressional Review Act for disapproving of the BLM's 2.0 rule.  It is another midnight regulation passed in the final days of the previous administration which undercuts the resource management planning process on public lands by stripping local community input and centralizing, again, in Washington, D.C., the decisionmaking.  California holds some of the largest amounts of public land in the U.The Federal Government has approximately 46 percent of the total land in California, amounting to about 46 million acres. BLM oversees about 15 million acres of those public lands, or about 15 percent of the State's total land mass.  The abundance of natural resources and diversity of landscapes within California creates unique challenges for BLM to even fulfill its multiple-use mandate. It is essential that development of these resource management plans include close coordination with local, State, and tribal governments--the people who actually grew up and know those lands the best for all of the potential these lands could bring, whether it is for development of potential energy or timber management. Whatever those ideas are that they would have, let the locals have the input on it. These decisions need to be made with that local input so that everyone's voice is heard.                              {time}  1415  In strong rural areas like my own, the First District of California, close coordination between the Federal Government and local groups is vital to have good decisions be made regarding public land management. Unfortunately, what we have is nonmanagement, and we suffer for that each summer and fall with a forestry that is not managed and the inability to have an economic opportunity for those people in those areas.  The 2.0 rule does just the opposite with that collaboration. It strengthens BLM's power once again in Washington, marginalizing Western counties and districts, eliminating their ability to coordinate or challenge BLM's proposed plans in an open setting.  Under the pretext of climate change and landscape scale management, the agency's rule undermines federalism and allows for the implementation of a previous era environmental agenda. No wonder Modoc County, in my own district, as well as other counties from Western States have sued BLM for its failure to properly engage and coordinate with the public and fulfill what the law requires for the BLM in managing these lands.

The final rule decreases the BLM's accountability      for cooperating with state and local[[Page H1041]]     governments. Specifically, it minimizes state and local      government plans, programs and policies and the important      role these entities should play in final RMP decisions.       This rule is a prime candidate for Congressional analysis      under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). I ask that you      bring this rule to the full House for consideration under the      CRA for a floor debate. The BLM can and must involve state      and local governments in RMP decisions and it must respect      the role of state and local governments.       Thank you for your consideration.

As partners with the      federal government, we continue to encourage the BLM to      engage in meaningful collaboration with local stakeholders      during the development of policies and guidelines. And      despite representations by the BLM to do just that, we remain      unconvinced that Planning 2.0 in its final form does much to      satisfy the objective of meaningful collaboration and      consultation with non-federal governmental entities.       Robust coordination and cooperation between states and      local governments and the BLM allows federal decision-makers      to be responsive to the concerns of state and local      government officials during policy development and sets the      stage for more effective and efficient implementation of      federal policies by involving multi-jurisdictional resources      and expertise. Simply put, gathering meaningful, on the      ground, input from the states and localities that will be      most impacted by BLM's planning regulations is critical to      ensuring a practical federal policy that works at the local      level.       For years to come, the proposed Planning 2.0 rule will have      a substantial impact on how the BLM engages with state and      local government and manages its 245 million acres of public      lands and 700 million acres of subsurface minerals. We      encourage Congress to act to ensure BLM's Planning 2.0 rule      does not go into effect and instruct the agency to work with      intergovernmental partners to ensure the policy has benefited      from meaningful, on the ground, collaboration with state and      local governments.

What we have seen over the last 8 years, unfortunately, in Washington, D.C., has been a massive expansion of the authority and the overreach of the Federal Government under the Obama administration. We have seen a number of instances where agencies have acted outside of the law, in some instances outside of the  BLM 2.0 is an example of where this agency is acting completely outside of the law. There is absolutely no legal authority, no statutory language on which they can base this rulemaking, on which they can base the fundamental changes that they are making and the fundamental power grab that they are making.  It is hugely important for us, as we go forward here, to make sure that we have done everything we can to roll back regulations that are really killing our jobs, that are preventing people in our local communities from being able to make a living, from being able to consistently graze, for example, on these public lands. It is absolutely outside of the law to have a situation, as 2.0 would create, where people who have never been to these lands, people who, frankly, may not even be in the United States, have just as much a say in how we manage our lands as a rancher who has got to graze on those lands or as the county commissioners who are charged with making decisions about those lands.  A number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have mentioned today the thousands of comments that the BLM sought as they were going through this rulemaking process. The problem is that there is very little evidence that any of those comments were taken into account in the final rulemaking. As I mentioned earlier, the track record with respect to the BLM listening to and being willing to take into account local concerns is a very bad one in which you have got State agencies that are led to believe they will have an impact and then find themselves having radio silence, essentially, from the  Mr.Speaker, Planning 2.0 is a dangerous and damaging rule.

14194,topic-id,824,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kind words and for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. As has been made clear, we are actually talkingabout two different pieces of legislation here today.  The waiver for Secretary-designee James Mattis is, quite frankly, a no-brainer. The Senate voted 81-17 in favor of thatwaiver. I would suspect there will be similar bipartisan support here.  My friend is correct, of course; this is a serious matter whenever we grant exceptions to the law. But General Mattis isjust uniformly and universally respected across the lines for his distinguished work in defense of this country, so I hope wemove ahead on that.  The budget resolution that comes before us is another matter, and there will be a great deal of contention. Frankly, theresolution itself is not, as my good friend from California pointed out, and should not be seen as, a traditional budgetaryitem. It is, frankly, a projection of what will happen if we do absolutely nothing over the next decade and leave the currentset of policies in place.  It is a sobering document to read in that regard because it shows rising deficits every single year for a decade, beginningat over $580 billion and then moving well north of $1 trillion. Frankly, in my view, it is something that we ought to look atand come to the realization that we are going to need to do entitlement reform in the next decade, something that people on bothsides of the aisle seem to want to ignore. Absent that, we will, indeed, have extraordinarybudget deficits, and they will be large enough to undercut and undermine our economy.  The budget resolution is also a vehicle, a tool, to begin to repeal the Affordable Care This is necessary for, really,one simple reason. The Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare as it is popularly known, is a failing system. It is unpopular. It hasnever been popular, never hit 50 percent of popularity. Frankly, in my view, it has cost our friends their majority in theHouse, then cost them their majority in the Senate, and may well have cost them the Presidency of the United TheAmerican people have spoken pretty emphatically: We don't like this product. And it is collapsing financially right now. This isnot a system that is an operation that is really doing well.  Let me just talk about my own We have about 197,000 people that have gotten insurance under This year,they will have exactly one choice as to what company they want to choose to provide them, and their rates will go up by 69percent. Now, nationally, I think the average is over 25 percent.  Clearly, this is not a system that is working very well. Politically, the easy thing to do would be what our friends want usto do--let's just leave it alone. It will fall under its own weight, and it will be very clear who is responsible for thatcollapse: the current administration and my friends on the other side. But that also would be the irresponsible thing to do, andthat would be, in itself, an abdication of leadership and, ultimately, unfair to the American people.  Instead, we are going to repeal the system and begin to replace it with something that will work better. Now, my friend'spoint is a fair one. There is not a single plan out there, but there are plenty of plans. I know I cosponsor a couple myself. Ithink we will be able to work through this relatively easily.  There has been a lot of discussion and a lot of diagnosis about what the failures of ObamaCare are, but there has been verylittle in the way of actual legislative remedy. We have a unique opportunity to do that. Frankly, I am proud of our Speaker, andI am proud of our conference that they are going to seize that and begin this process because I don't think there is anythingmore important facing us.  So I would urge the passage of the rule and then the passage, obviously, of the underlying legislation, particularly thebudget resolution that allows us to begin the necessary work in repealing and replacing ObamaCare, and, obviously, the waiverthat would allow us to have a distinguished Secretary of Defense, General  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I want to point out a couple of things.  First of all, according to the Brookings Institution, without the ACA, insurance premiums would be 44 percent higher.  And the other fact I point out for my colleagues is that healthcare costs are growing at the slowest rate in the last 50years. Families are spending over $3,500 a year less than they would have because of the I would say to my colleagues,yeah, we want to do better, but let's work to address some of the shortcomings of the ACA rather than repeal it and put indanger all these healthcare protections that people have.[[Page H480]]  I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (",CREC-2017-01-13-pt1-PgH477-2.txt,2259,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 78, SEC REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY",2017.0,13.0,January

I appreciate the committee's time, attention, and interest in the work of the  I am especially gratified by their support of my push to authorize all of the unauthorized agencies and programs under ourcommittee's jurisdiction. Last Congress, we came very close, but we fell one agency short. The Commodities Future TradingCommission ended the year as it began it, unauthorized.  The Commission, in fact, has not been reauthorized since October 2013. And since that time, the House of Representativeshave voted twice to fix that problem. The most recent effort was in June of 2015. Tomorrow, if we pass H.238, will be thethird time this House has done its work on this oversight business. Under this rule, we have the opportunity to pick up where weleft off and resume the House's debate on the Commodity End-User Relief  The text of H.238 is identical to the legislation passed by this House last Congress, except for four changes:  First, we included a specific annual spending authorization level, and it is set at the same level as last year'sappropriations. This ensures compliance with the majority leader's floor protocols on both specific authorization levels anddiscretionary  Next, two sections were removed because they were already signed into law.  Finally, we removed a section that required the Commission to report to Congress on the status of a pending Board of Traderegistration application. That application has been approved, so there is no longer a reason for the Commission to comply withthat language.  Other than those four changes, the text of H.238 includes every word passed by this House last Congress, includingamendments offered by Mr.Gallego to encourage diversity in the Office of the Chief Economist, as well as Mr.Takai toidentify information security vulnerabilities.  This bill does not just reauthorize the It also makes important process reforms and targeted changes to help MainStreet businesses continue to access the risk management tools that they need to serve their customers.  Over the past 4\1/2\ years, the House Committee on Agriculture has held almost two dozen hearings examining the Commissionand investigating the impacts that the Dodd-Frank Act has had on derivatives markets. What we have found is that some of therules have had unintended consequences for farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and other businesses who use these markets toprotect themselves from uncertainty.  Our witnesses, many of whom were market participants struggling to comply with burdensome rules and ambiguous portions ofunderlying statute, were consistent in their call for relief. To address their concerns, H.238 makes reforms that fall intothree broad categories: customer protections, commission reforms, and end-user relief.  The Commodity End-User Relief Act does not roll back any of the key reforms made under Dodd-What it does, however, isallow Congress to keep its promise to Main Street America: Main Street did not cause the financial crisis, so Main Street shouldnot have to pay for it. They shouldn't have to pay for it with new fees. They shouldn't have to pay for it in new complianceobligations. They shouldn't have to pay for it in higher transactions costs. And they shouldn't have to pay for it in lostopportunities to manage their business risks.

The two of them got deep into the weeds of financial reform.  I would also like to thank Mr.Lucas, who is a sponsor emeritus of this bill.

But the Democrats know that this is just the beginning.  Congressional Republicans have started their plans to not just repeal the Affordable Care Act, but to gut Medicare, Medicaidand Social  Republican proposals would threaten nursing home coverage for millions of seniors, undermine comprehensive health care forchildren by cutting Medicaid, and slash benefits earned after years of hard work.  The CPC and Congressional Democrats will not stand for this. That is why we introduced an amendment that would ensure theBudget Resolution we are voting on today or any future bill can't be used to cut benefits from Social Security, Medicare orMedicaid, increase the retirement age for these benefits, or privatize Social  But, the majority is not allowing debate or a vote on our amendment.  This sends a clear message: Congressional Republicans are willing to put the lives and futures of millions of children,seniors and working families at risk.  It also puts them on the wrong side of history. Cutting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security is not what the Americanpeople want.  President-elect Trump has promised several times that he will not support cuts to these important programs that helpmillions of Americans make ends meet.  This leaves Congressional Republicans in a tough spot. Whose side are they on?  Will they commit to protecting hard-working Americans? Will they protect America's children? Seniors? What about people withdisabilities?  Or, will they yet again cut the benefits of working people so they can give tax breaks to big corporations?  The Congressional Progressive Caucus and House Democrats will not back down. We will oppose any cuts to Medicare, Medicaid,and Social  I urge my colleagues to vote no and defeat the previous question so we can bring up the CPC amendment to block the House GOPfrom cutting Medicare, Medicaid and Social  Will House Republicans stand with us?

If Republicans repeal the ACA, at least 11 million people's Medicaid coverage will be at risk.  The House Republican budget plan far fiscal year 2017 would have cut federal Medicaid funding by $1 trillion--or nearly 25percent--over ten years. That is in addition to ending Medicaid expansion.  The Urban Institute estimated that the 2012 Ryan proposal would lead states to drop between 14.3 million and 20.5 millionpeople from Medicaid by the tenth year, in addition to the effects of repealing health reform's Medicaid expansion.

An      affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of the      Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall berequired to sustain an      appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised      under subsection (a).       (c) Waiver inthe House.--It shall not be in order in the      House of Representatives to consider a rule or order that      waives the applicationof subsection (a). As disposition of a      point of order under this subsection, the Chair shall put the      question of considerationwith respect to the rule or order,      as applicable. The question of consideration shall be      debatable for 10 minutes by the Memberinitiating the point of      order and for 10 minutes by an opponent, but shall otherwise      be decided without intervening motionexcept one that the      House adjourn.         The Vote on the Previous Question: What it ReallyMeans       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      Avote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democraticminority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedentsof the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to director      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the      previousquestion is to give the opposition a chance to decide      the subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's      ruling of January13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal      of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question      passes the control ofthe resolution to the opposition'' in      order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of      the majority party offered arule resolution. The House      defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition      rose to a parliamentary inquiry, askingwho was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, thegentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the      firstrecognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed toan      immediate vote on adopting the resolution .  .  . [and] has      no substantive legislative or policy implications      whatsoever.'' Butthat is not what they have always said.      Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative      Process in the UnitedStates House of Representatives, (6th      edition, page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the      previous question vote intheir own manual: ``Although it is      generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority      Member controlling the timewill not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question onthe rule .  .  .  . When      the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of      the time passes to the Member who led theopposition to      ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then      controls the time, may offer an amendment to therule, or      yield for the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchaptertitled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reportedfrom the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules,control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and      whocontrols the time for debate thereon.''[[Page H489]]       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantivepolicy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allowsthose with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

13961,topic-id,1734,"Mr.Speaker, an Olympic Gold Medal; groundbreaking international conferences on religious cooperation intolerance; membership in the World Bank, the IMF, and other international bodies; and recognition by more than 110 countries--these are only some of the accomplishments of the young nation of  The United States was among the first to recognize Kosovo, and today we are its strongest backer, and rightfully so. First recognized by President Bush, relations only deepened under President For that, Kosovo proudly has become the strongest supporter of the United States and Europe, sitting at an 85 percent approval rating.  This is not to say that Kosovo is a perfect country. We are not a perfect country. Corruption needs to be attacked in Judicial reform is progressing far too slowly. And official unemployment hovers at just above 30 percent. So there is hard work to be done. There is obviously a lot of work to do. But I have visited this country again and again and again and again;[[Page H2344]]and every time, I see progress, and I know there is a bright future.  I have often said that, as an American, I can go all around the world, but I will never get greeted with more love and friendship than I will in People there truly love Americans and all things  The best way to help Kosovo is through continued, strong support, as the United States has done for many years. But too many impediments stand in the way, many of them coming from outside of Kosovo's borders.  For example, Kosovo wants what most countries across the region want, to become part of a secure and integrated Europe, membership in the European Union and in Yet, just five European holdouts stand in the way of this progress for  When it comes to United Nations membership, Kosovo's way forward is blocked by Serbia and its ally, In fact, Serbia seeks to block Kosovo at almost every turn, and lately has been escalating tensions.  Both Serbia and Kosovo want to go to the European Union, and I support both of them getting into the European But one of those countries shouldn't try to block another one, and Serbia has repeatedly tried to make it difficult for Kosovo to get into the EU and to get other things as well.  Serbia recently sent into Kosovo's north a propaganda train emblazoned with the words, Serbia is Kosovo, written in 21 languages to foment discord among Kosovo's small Serbian population. It pushed the building of a wall in Metrovica, a tiny city straddling the cleavages of Kosovo's interethnic divide. While that wall has now come down, the scars remain.  Serbia has continued to deny justice to the loved ones of hundreds of victims of its campaign of ethnic cleansing, including three American citizens, the Bytyqi brothers. And there are all kinds of insults, from a train and other things, giving propaganda against Kosovo by Serbia pushed to the Serbian-Kosovo border that helps to escalate tensions rather than bring them down.  As a result of a Serbian INTERPOL arrest warrant, French authorities recently detained former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, who has already been acquitted twice by an international tribunal.  We in the United States have this wonderful thing of no double jeopardy. If you go to trial and you are acquitted, you cannot be tried on the same thing again. That isn't true of many countries.  So Ramush Haradinaj was accused of war crimes, went to The Hague, spent many weeks and months there, was acquitted, and then was recharged again, and had to go back to The Hague to have another trial on which he was again acquitted. Now, Serbia has manipulated INTERPOL to try to get a third trial on essentially the same matter for Ramush Haradinaj again. This, to me, is unconscionable and shows tremendous bad faith on the part of the Serbian  Serbia also fought Kosovo's membership in UNESCO, ultimately a self-defeating act, because among Kosovo's most cherished historical cultural institutions are its 13th century Serbian Orthodox churches. Kosovo did not get into It failed by three votes, and again the Serbian interruption played a major role in preventing them from getting into The United States fought to have Kosovo into UNESCO, but ultimately lost by three votes.  Kosovo and Serbia have sat down across the negotiating table in talks facilitated by the European Those talks showed some progress that resulted in an agreement calling for normalization. I even nominated, at that time, the Prime Ministers of Kosovo and Serbia, along with the EU's former policy head, Baroness Catherine Ashton, for the Nobel Peace  Unfortunately, today, I question these successes. What kind of normalization involves stoking tensions among a neighbor's minority population and standing in the way of international integration? That is what Serbia is doing to Kosovo, and it should be stopped.  In terms of Ramush Haradinaj, trying to try him again, I don't know why the Government of Serbia seems intent on rekindling 20- and 30-year-old Balkan wars. They were terrible things that happened in war and terrible things that happened on both sides, but the man was found innocent twice. This is nothing more than bad faith on the part of the Serbian Government and harassment.  It might come as a surprise to you, Mr.Speaker, but 9 years on, as a free and independent country, Kosovo still has no army. That is right. A sovereign nation-state without an army. It has a small, lightly armed security force, but nothing resembling the large Russian-equipped Serbian military just next door.  Earlier this month, Kosovo took a small step toward establishing its army. Legislation was submitted to parliament. Like the legislative process here in the United States, the introduction of a bill is only the opening note on a much larger and longer sheet of music, a score which involves consultation with regional partners, the international community, domestic minorities, and  We all know how this process works. There is back and forth, there is give and take. Supporters and opponents alike are welcome into the arena and all positions are heard. The process accounts for everybody's concerns in some way or another.  So what is in this proposal? What would Kosovo's army look like? It would be multiethnic, just as the Kosovo security force and the Kosovo police are now. It would partner with Western countries and hopefully NATO in pursuit of greater regional and international stability. It would be defensive and nonthreatening to Kosovo's neighbors. Mr.Speaker, it would be exactly what the United States wants to see in a partner.  Yet, while Kosovo slowly moves to set up its small defensive force, Serbia is beefing up its military with full Russian backing. It is taking deliveries of T-72 tanks, MiG-29 fighters, and S-300 antiaircraft missile systems, courtesy of Moscow and Vladimir  So I am a little confused, Mr.Kosovo, a country we support and which supports us, wants what every other country in the world has: a basic army in which its citizens can serve their nation, and probably serve alongside our own military if given the chance.  What do we do? We offer rebukes and diplomatic threats, and we make it clear that we don't support Kosovo having an army at this time. That is absolutely absurd and is a position that we ought to change, and change quickly. Yet Russian weapons and materiel are pouring into Serbia, courtesy of Vladimir Putin; and as far as I can tell, the United States has stood in silence.  Regardless, Mr.Speaker, America's relation with Kosovo is strong and the future is bright. We need to stay on that course. Kosovo is a young country. I have been there many, many times. It is not even 10 years old.  We know better than anyone that building a democracy is hard work. Sometimes you will face setbacks. Sometimes you need a helping hand. That is why American support is more important than ever. That is why the United States should work to deepen our ties, enrich our mutual understanding, and continue to bring stability to the entire Balkan region. That is the way to a more prosperous, democratic, and multiethnic Kosovo; and that is the way for the United States to see a Balkan region free, at peace, and part of the whole of  Meanwhile, France should send Ramush Haradinaj home. Enough is enough already. We cannot stand for any more of this nonsense.  The United States should stand by Kosovo is a free and independent country. For many years, they were fed all kinds of lies about the United States during the old Communist regime in the fifties, sixties, and seventies. You know what? The people of Kosovo didn't believe a word of it.  So I would say to my colleagues and to my friends and to all of our American citizens: When you visit Kosovo, you will know and you will be proud to be an American because people come up to you in the street and want to touch you, want to talk to you, want to do everything and be everything Those are the kinds of friends that we need.  America does much for many, many people around the world, many, many[[Page H2345]]nations, and sometimes we feel it is not appreciated--but not in Everything the United States has helped that country with is appreciated from everyone, from the Prime Minister to the President, to people in government, to the average people in the street.  I very often have people coming up to me in the street wanting to talk to me. They recognize me. They say: Thank you. Thank you to America for standing by us in our independence. Thank you to America for being strong and keeping us strong.  So those are the kinds of friends I want to have. Those are the kind of people I want to have.  So I would say to the people of Kosovo and the Government of Kosovo: The United States stands by you and always will stand by you.  I would say to the Government of Serbia: We support the aspirations of the Serbian people to enter the European Union, but Serbia ought to stop doing what it is doing to block Serbia ought to stop its belligerent moves against  Both countries should go into the European Union--and eventually, NATO--and each one should not stop each other.

13962,topic-id,1715,"Mr.Speaker, I want to spend the next couple of moments talking about a subject that is very near and dear to everyone's heart, and that is health care. I want to do it because tomorrow we have a big healthcare vote here in the Congress, and I think it is very important that we all very clearly lay out what we really feel should happen.  Last week, as part of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I was up for about 28 hours in a row marking up a bill that was done all night long. At the time when we marked it up, we thought it was a bit silly because the bill hadn't been scored by the Congressional Budget Office, so we had no idea what it cost. It was like buying a pig in a poke. How could you decide whether something is good or not when you don't even know what the cost is? Since we obviously don't have unlimited funds, if something costs more money, we have to pull it out of someplace else.                              {time}  1800  So we voted on a bill. Unfortunately, it was a strict party-line vote, and the bill passed. Shortly thereafter, a few days later, the Congressional Budget Office scored it; and I think it was, frankly, from my vantage point, a disaster for the bill.  Now, what I think that this Congress should be doing is I think that we should make tweaks and fix the Affordable Care Act, or There are many, many good things in ObamaCare, in the healthcare bill, in the healthcare act, that has now been here for many, many years. But there are also some problems with it.  You know, every major bill that has been passed by this Congress and signed into law needed some tweaks, needed some changes, because you pass a law with good intention, but sometimes it doesn't work out exactly as you wanted it to work out. So you need to change things, you need to make improvements. When you see what is working, what is not working, that is what you do.  That is what this Congress should do with We should say where premiums are going up or where certain jurisdictions only have one insurance company and, therefore, there is no competition, we can figure out ways to fix it. We can figure out ways to tweak it. That is what the American people would want us to do. The American people would want us to work together and would want us to work in a bipartisan fashion to try to fix what was wrong with  Now, there are many wonderful things about First of all, everyone knows it eliminated the so-called preexisting condition problem, where before, when you changed jobs and you went to a new insurance company, the insurance company said, ``Sorry, you have had cancer for 3 years and you have been treated; we are not going to treat you for cancer because it is a preexisting condition,'' or a heart attack or whatever it is. That was basically unconscionable.  And millions of people couldn't get help because they changed a job and, therefore, changed a healthcare plan. That was changed in And that was a very, very important thing because an insurance company can now no longer deny you coverage because of a preexisting condition.  Also, as everybody knows, children up to 26 years old can now stay and be insured under their parents' insurance plans. That was a very good plus of ObamaCare, or of the Affordable Care  And there were other very, very important, good things. We had more people being covered than ever before. People who had never had health coverage got it now because of the Affordable Care  So what do we see now? We see, instead of trying to put it together in a bipartisan fashion, trying to fix it, we have this bill which passed the Energy and Commerce Committee and passed the Ways and Means Committee and supposedly is going to be on the floor tomorrow if they can round up the votes. They are having difficulty rounding up the votes.  And what do we see when we look at this new bill that they are asking us to vote for? Let me tell you what we see.  If this bill would ever come into law, we would have much less coverage than ever before. Many people would lose their healthcare coverage, and we would have a smaller population actually being covered for health care.  We call it TrumpCare, and TrumpCare will take away health care from 24 million hardworking That is not acceptable.  Why shouldn't we be working together to improve ObamaCare? Why do we need a new plan that will insure 24 million less people than we insure now? It is bizarre. It makes no sense whatsoever.  We also feel, when we analyze it--and this is, again, what the Congressional Budget Office tells us--there are higher costs. TrumpCare forces families to pay increased out-of-pocket costs and higher deductibles.  So what does that all mean?  It means you pay more and you get less. That is a pretty bad deal. I don't think anybody wants that deal. I think Democrats and Republicans, alike, don't want that deal. I think Americans don't want that deal. We want it the opposite way. We would like to pay less and get coverage. But what TrumpCare does to the Affordable Care Act, you pay more and you get less.  If that weren't bad enough, an analysis of it finds that there is a crushing age tax. TrumpCare forces Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 to pay premiums which are five times higher than what others pay for health coverage, no matter how healthy they are. Talk about discrimination.  If you are a 50-year-old that is in good health, why should you have to pay five times more premium than what others pay for health coverage? Doesn't sound like a very good idea to me.  And then you say: How do they get the money to pay for whatever? Well, it steals from Medicaid and TrumpCare ransacks the Medicaid funds that allow seniors to get the long-term care they need and shortens the life of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years. Again, pretty bad deal for me.  And you say: Well, who benefits from this? If this is something that people are going to have to pay more and get less coverage, it is discriminatory for people ages 50 to 64. It hurts middle class people making $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, $60,000 a year, hurts them and hurts seniors, knocks seniors out. Well, who does it help?  Well, guess what? TrumpCare ransacks the Medicaid funds that allow seniors to get the long-term care they need. I said that before. But what does it do? It lowers tax cuts for the rich. So the rich get more tax cuts--I am sorry. It doesn't lower it. It gives the rich more tax cuts.  So it is really kind of nice, I suppose, when you have a billionaire President, it is nice to help the rich--but not at the expense of middle class  So when you look at this plan, it is a pretty bad plan for the middle class, pretty bad. So if you didn't like ObamaCare, you are going to dislike TrumpCare even more.  If it is passed, once it is passed, we are going to see, again, premiums rise, millions of people thrown out of insurance, and less coverage, but the very wealthy will get a nice, juicy tax break.[[Page H2346]]  So, you know who used to steal from the rich and give to the poor? This is stealing from the poor and giving to the rich. It is really disgraceful.  So I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Let's defeat TrumpCare because it doesn't help anybody, and let's put our heads together. We have enough talent in this place on both sides of the aisle, and that is what the American people want us to do. They want us to put our heads together. They want us to work together and come up with a plan that aids the largest amount of people at the lowest possible cost.  It won't be easy. It will be very difficult. But we should do it together, not jam TrumpCare down our throat, not tell people about false promises when you know people are going to be thrown off.  If you say: Well, you know what? It is going to be cheaper. Well, it is cheaper if you throw off all the sick people and you don't give them insurance, and you throw off all the seniors and you don't help them. Well, of course it is cheaper because all the people that are sick and really need the help won't get it. And after all, what is insurance about? Insurance is there just in case you get sick.  So I am very chagrined about this new bill. I hope it gets defeated tomorrow. I hope that we then go back to the drawing board and come up with a program that will help the American people, not a program that helps Democrats or a program that helps Republicans, but a program that helps Americans, because we are all in this together.  The bill proposed by my Republican colleagues called TrumpCare is not a bill for Americans that will aid them with help when they get sick. As Americans, I do believe that health care should be a right, not a luxury. I believe that the richest country that the world has ever known can give its citizens health care. I believe in the single-payer health care.  But even if it is not single-payer, let's take the original Affordable Care Act, keep what is good, enhance what is good and what needs to be corrected and changed. Let's do it. That is what the American people want. That is what the American people demand, and we should do nothing less.  This bill ought to be defeated tomorrow. Let's go back to the drawing board and come up with something we can be proud of.

14044,topic-id,647,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr.Hastings), my friend, classmate, and wonderful colleague, for yielding time to me.  I rise today in opposition to the rule and the underlying bills. I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that this bipartisan bill that I have written, the Presidential Tax Transparency Act, can be made in order for immediate floor debate and a vote.  The Presidential Tax Transparency Act would require the President and all future Presidents and Presidential nominees of the major parties, Democrats and Republicans, to publicly disclose their tax returns. It came as a surprise to many Americans, during the 2016 campaign, that this disclosure was not required by law. Instead, we have had a tradition of voluntary disclosure among every President of both parties since the post-Watergate era. Until now, our Presidents have recognized that those who seek or hold the most powerful office in the world should be held to the highest standard of transparency.  Donald Trump is the first President to refuse to release his tax returns since Gerald Ford, a man of the I remember when his remains were brought to the Capitol where he rested in the rotunda but came by the doors of the He was a man of the House and a man of integrity.                              {time}  1245  He along with a host of others, Democrats and Republicans, voluntarily released their tax returns. But Mr.Trump's 2016 candidate filing with the Federal Election Commission shows that he has 564 financial positions in companies located both in the United States and around the world, including relationships with state-affiliated businesses in several countries.  Why is this important to note? The President had an opportunity to resolve these potential conflicts of interest by divesting and placing his business assets into a true blind trust, as other Presidents have done, Republicans and Instead, he chose to turn over control of his business to his sons in an arrangement that the Director of the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics called ``wholly inadequate'' and ``meaningless from a conflict of interest perspective.'' Since he is taken office, these ethics concerns have been borne out in the form of his and his campaign's connections to Russia, deeply, deeply troubling to all of us and to the American people, legitimately so; his family's potential new business dealings in the Dominican Republic and Uruguay; and the hiring of a ``director of diplomatic sales'' at his Washington, D.C., hotel to attract high-priced business among foreign diplomats. This is deeply unsettling, to say the least.  Simply put, the President's business empire makes him more susceptible to conflicts of interest than any other President in the history of our country. Three of the President's nominees have already withdrawn their names from consideration due to potential financial conflicts of interest. Only a full release of the President's tax returns will provide the public with clear information as to his potential conflicts of interest and his potential entanglements with foreign governments and foreign businesses.  Last night, here on the floor, the House voted along party lines, unfortunately, to block an effort to obtain the President's tax returns under the House's existing authority. Today, we have another chance to honor the will of the American people and write this important disclosure tradition into law--into law.  According to a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, 74 percent of Americans believe the President should release his tax returns--74 percent. The top petition on the White House website has over 1 million signatures to it, calling on the President to release his tax returns.  I think the voice of the people, the American people, is clear. As their representatives, they deserve to have us take action on this because we all want a conflict of interest-free  I urge my colleagues to reject the previous question so we can hold an immediate vote on the Presidential Tax Transparency  ",CREC-2017-02-28-pt1-PgH1363-4.txt,355,IT'S TIME,2017.0,28.0,March

14225,topic-id,394,"Mr.Speaker, I would also like to highlight how important our relationship with Israel is, and how our ally in the Middle East is a huge asset to our Nation and the world.  Israel is a beacon of democracy in a sea of turbulence. It is a success story of enterprising spirit and indomitable will. I was fortunate enough to visit Israel in 2011 and saw firsthand the high level of strategic cooperation between the United States and Israel militarily, businesswise, technologywise, and socially.  Almost 32 years ago, the U.signed its first-ever free trade agreement with Israel, leading to almost $40 billion in trade annually. Israel makes up more than 40 percent of all investment in the United States from the Middle East and north Africa, and has companies listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, more than any other country other than the United States and  The ``Start-up Nation'' has given the world the USB flash drive, the first PC CPU, voice over IP phone system, and just recently, Intel acquired Israeli driver-assistance company, Mobileye, to help develop better autonomous vehicles.  Israel's drip irrigation technology has helped millions around the world grow crops on land that otherwise would be barren, and Israeli doctors have made medical discoveries improving the lives of millions of Americans and hundreds of millions of folks worldwide.  The U.and Israeli militaries also maintain a high level of cooperation and support. Our two nations regularly hold joint exercises and work side by side in developing new technologies, including missile defense systems, weapons technologies, and more.  Situated in an extremely hostile neighborhood, Israelis share a unique understanding of the threats posed by Islamic terror groups. Through cooperation, we are constantly monitoring and defeating new threats to both nations.  I have been heartened to see the renewal in U.S.-Israeli relations since President Trump took office and hope to see them continue to flourish. I encourage my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring H.1697, the Israel Anti-Boycott Act; H.1698, the Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act; and 218, Recognizing the importance of the United States-Israel economic relationship and encouraging new areas of cooperation.

13970,topic-id,2506,"Mr.Speaker, today we took up what was intended to be a very noble action on 11 to rein in the out-of-control and outrageous actions of so many despots that occupy positions of authority in the United The United Nations, whether you go back to Libya being in charge of human rights, you have U.troops molesting so many females. There are all kinds of problems that have been wrought, and yet the U.has the gall to continually show how bigoted it is and how anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli that it is.  It is easy to find, if anyone bothers to check, that the United Nations never asked once for any other country to pony up land, much less demand that other countries like Jordan, who is a good friend of the United States, but the U.never said: Look, you are occupying this land that they call Palestine, so you have to give it up. They never did until it was controlled by the Israeli people, thus making clear this is really a bigoted move by the U.to constantly slander and slam the nation of  Also, if one wants to conduct another test to check to see how bigoted, if it is, the U.is, you could check on the condemnations by the U.for activities of Compare the facts of those activities and self-defense efforts by Israel and compare them to acts of other nations--the genocide, for example, that even Secretary Kerry, as tough as it was for him to finally admit that there was a genocide of Christians going on in the Middle  Is there any outrage by the U.N.? In fact, the U.head of the refugees who is now the U.General Secretary made clear about over a year and a half ago or so that the reason that they weren't helping Christians to the extent that they were helping Muslim refugees is because of the historic importance Christians have in staying where they were--that means where they are being murdered, where they are having their throats slashed, being crucified, tortured, raped, incinerated. The U.General Secretary, when he was in charge of the refugee program, thought it was very important to leave Christians in the Middle East so they can be murdered in some of the most heinous and egregious fashions imaginable.  So it was just and proper, to borrow from history, that we condemn the United Nations Resolution 2334 as being an obstacle to peace in Palestinians have made clear they don't want peace with They want it eliminated from the map. They name holidays, squares, and all kinds of things for people who go out and kill innocent Jewish children and others just for being They reward the families of those who go and blow themselves up, killing, in atrocious fashions, innocent Israeli people. The United Nations turns a blind eye to it since the U.has become so racist, so bigoted, and so anti-Israel, the most antiterrorist country in all of the Middle East, including north Africa--although Egypt is of great help in that regard these days, and there are those in Libya who would like to. But after President Obama helped turn Libya into absolute anarchy and chaos, then Egypt is having their problems even coming from  What has the U.had to say about all that? Not really anything because if the Muslim Brotherhood supports it, so does, basically, the U.N., and far too often so has the Obama administration.  That is why, I guess, Israel got the lecture from Secretary John Secretary Kerry, even in the days when he talked about the heinous acts of Genghis Khan, never bothered to mention the plight of the poor Palestinians before 1967 when they were under control of the most non-Israeli people you could imagine. There has been no discussion about that, only leveling really bigoted allegations at  So we have 11 today, and I was thrilled because it meant that I was going to be able to come to the floor and vote to condemn the U.passage of U.Security Council Resolution 2334.  Unfortunately, as some of my friends here in Congress have pointed out, I am a bit anal at times. I actually want to read the things that we are going to vote on. So I got my copy of 11, immediately noting that, in the very first whereas, it says the United States has long supported a two-state solution. It does say ``sustainable two-state solution.'' It says: ``Whereas since 1993, the United States has facilitated direct, bilateral negotiations between both parties toward achieving a two-state solution . . . .''  Well, it is the truth that President Clinton twisted the arm of the Israeli Prime Minister and convinced him to basically give Arafat almost everything he wanted. Now, if you believe what Scripture says about Moses going and pleading to Pharaoh to let the Jewish people, the children of Israel, go, we are told that God hardens Pharaoh's heart so that He could make a big demonstration of His power and glory down the road. Although there was suffering that came--great suffering--ultimately, incredible miracles were performed as a result of his hardened heart.  I think it is likely that when Arafat got everything he wanted--almost everything he wanted--in the offer from Israel, I thank God that Arafat turned him down. For anybody that has been in the military and goes to Israel, you can see readily, if Arafat had accepted what the Prime Minister of Israel had been willing, finally, to offer, it would have virtually made Israel indefensible unless they were using nuclear weapons or the threat of nuclear weapons.  Israel needs to be able to defend itself. King David was ruling from Hebron in the year around 1020 B.to around 1012 B.Then he moved, and he was ruling over What is now called the West Bank was actually called Israel--I mean, it was part of the nation of Solomon had control, but he did so from the City of David because that is where, up to Jerusalem, that David had moved the capital from Hebron, which is also where Abraham and Sarah are buried.[[Page H177]]  I have also visited the tomb of David's father, Jesse, that is there in To be told: Oh, no, this needs to be Palestinian lands. The reason some of us think that Hebron, Judea, and Samaria should be Palestinian lands is because 1,600 years after David ruled from Hebron and then Jerusalem, Mohammed came along. Some say it was a vision, some say a dream. Some say he actually, during one night, was taken by a winged horse or donkey and flown to Some say he actually got there and back to bed before morning. Whatever the case, 1,600 years before that did or didn't happen, David was ruling over that whole country.  There is no one alive today descended from any occupants of the Promised Land, the land of Israel, descended from people who lived in that land predating King David and King Saul before him, King Solomon after him--nobody. Nobody alive today has a prior claim. There is nobody, no country, from whom the United Nations has demanded a secession of land back to people that attacked that country and the land was taken back in a defensive mode in protection from the attack.  So at page 3 of our 11, it points out that the U.resolution is a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution. At the bottom of page 5, it says: ``A durable and sustainable peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians will come only through direct bilateral negotiations between the parties resulting in a Jewish, democratic state living side-by-side next to a demilitarized Palestinian state in peace and security.''  Mr.Speaker, there cannot be peace and security in the Middle East when a people are allowed to occupy an area, and those people continue, with the encouragement of the United Nations, with John Kerry and this President, to conduct intensive terrorism on the people of Israel and we continue to condemn the victims of that terrorism.  You can't have peace in a land where the most powerful nation--possibly the most powerful nation up to now. We were at one time. Our Navy is down, I think, to pre-World War I standards, and our troops are down below pre-World War But at one time, we were the most powerful nation. The most powerful or near most powerful nation is taking up for the victims and encouraging that the victims give away more of the land that they have already given so much of to those who are inflicting terror upon them. It is like my friends on the far left, constantly complaining about bullies, who never had been bullied like I was as a small child because I was very small in elementary school.                              {time}  2045  I got beat up a lot, and I defended myself, but it didn't matter. When people are coming after you that are a foot and a half taller than you are and they flunked two grades, you are not going to come out well.  My fifth grade teacher, after I got beat up trying to get back my football I got for Christmas, took me up in front of the class. My nose is still bleeding, dripping down my shirt. She said: I want everybody to see what happens when the little boys try to play with the big boys.  She always took up for the bullies. And that is what this administration has been doing and this is what this United Nations has been doing: taking up for the terrorist bullies.  I am amazed that the nation of Israel has held back all hell breaking loose on the Gaza Strip because of the continued assaults day after day, sending rockets into Israel, Israel spending millions of dollars to protect themselves against the constant attack from the Gaza  And what happens?  They try to protect themselves with a legitimate blockade to make sure nobody is taking rockets in, and the U.and world opinion goes nuts over that.  Page 6 of our resolution we voted on today goes on to say that the House of Representatives calls for United Nations Security Council 2334 to be repealed or fundamentally altered so that it is no longer one-sided and anti- Here is my problem again. B, it allows all final status issues toward a two-state solution be resolved and have direct negotiations between the parties.  Nobody at the U.N., if we are a part of it, and nobody in the United States administration should even mention the little phrase ``two-state solution.'' This body should not even mention in a resolution that we are in any way endorsing a two-state solution.  I know there are a lot of Christians that aren't as familiar with the Bible, perhaps, as they will be one day, but my friend, Joel Rosenberg, pointed out numerous times in the book of Joel, chapter 3:       For look. In those days and at that time I will return the      exiles to Judah and Then I will gather all the      nations. I will bring them down to the Valley of      I will enter into judgment against them there concerning my      people Israel, who are my inheritance, whom they scattered      among the nations.  Then it lists the number one grievance that the God of the Bible, the God I believe in, had against those nations he is going to rain down only hell judgment on. The number one grievance is: they partitioned my land. They divided my land, the promised land.  When the United States Congress embraces, demands that Israel be divided into separate states instead of being able to live in, peacefully, the land that was occupied and promised over 3,000 years ago, I think we are making a big mistake. That is why I had to vote ``no'' on the resolution.  Now just as our leadership rushed this resolution to the floor, I am hopeful they will rush 311 to the floor. I filed it today, this afternoon. 311 is very basic. It says:  ``To withhold United States assessed and voluntary contributions to the United Nations, and for other purposes.  ``Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,  ``Section 1. Short title.  ``This Act may be cited as the `Refusing to Assist Paying for United Nations Actions Against Israel Act' ''.  United States assessed involuntary contributions to the United That is section 2. And the operative wording says:  ``No funds are authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available for assessed or voluntary contributions of the United States to the United Nations or to any organ, specialized agency, commission, treaty or treaty body, or other affiliated body of the United Nations . . . `'  It goes on: `` . . . until such time as United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, regarding Israel's Settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, is repealed in its entirety.''  Then, section 3 says: ``No funds are authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available to pay interest on assessed or voluntary contributions that are withheld under this Act.''  So the purpose of that is I am hoping and praying that this body will not just pay lip service to a U.resolution, and actually embrace, as John Kerry, apparently, was saying that day, not much difference between AIPAC's position in supporting this resolution. He may not have mentioned they would support the resolution, but AIPAC's position and John Kerry's position. If you look at what is in the resolution, he may have something there.  This would actually put some teeth into it. This is something that would send a message to the United Nations and the nations around the world that if you are going to continue to be so anti-Israel, so bigoted, so racist, so anti-Jewish, then the United States is not going to continue to fund your outrageous, bigoted activities, your lush, lavish lifestyle.  I would think if we could pass this, the United Nations delayed in withdrawing that resolution or rescinding it, then that should ultimately lead to our denial of any visas to diplomats of the United Then, once that occurs, apparently under the deed to the United Nations, it was only for such time as the headquarters in New York--is the main headquarters of the United So if they can't get diplomats there, they will have to move the headquarters elsewhere and that land would be ceded back to the foundation.  Hopefully, if we will go ahead and do something that has teeth in it and not embrace language that will be fatal to this nation of Israel, we can make a difference. That can bring peace in the world. Terrorists only understand power, and sometimes power is conveyed in the way of money.[[Page H178]]  We should not be funding a United Nations that is so bigoted and so hateful to the nation of  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgH176.txt,1801,DISAPPROVING RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR RELATING TO,2017.0,5.0,February
14122,topic-id,631,"Mr.Speaker, on December 12, 2016, the Obama administration published another overreaching midnight regulation in the form of the BLM's new resource management rule, commonly referred to as BLM 2.0. That same day, six Western States filed a lawsuit alleging the new rules will severely impair their ability to work with the BLM on future planning and management issues.  More than 3,350 comments were submitted on BLM's Planning 2.0 rule. Rather than reviewing and incorporating those suggestions, the Obama administration hastily rolled out another midnight regulation that failed to address the technical flaws raised during the public comment period.  Let me be clear: Planning 2.0 takes planning decisions away from local communities and centralizes those decisions with bureaucrats in Washington, D.BLM's Planning 2.0 rule is a significant departure from the planning process that has existed more than three decades and allowed significant local government involvement.  Planning 2.0 directs the BLM to perform large, landscape-scale planning efforts that stretch across county lines and State lines. This new regulation allows radical, special interest groups from other States to have the same influence as county and local officials in the planning process.  In many counties in the West, less than 20 percent of the land is privately owned. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the Bureau of Land Management manages more than 247 million acres of public land and administers about 700 million acres of Federal subsurface mineral estates throughout the  Rural counties and Western States depend on their ability to use BLM and public lands in order to support their livelihoods. Critical activities like grazing, forest thinning, mining, recreation, responsible energy development--including wind and solar--all take place on these lands and are the lifeblood of many communities. Unfortunately, Planning 2.0 will prevent many of these uses on BLM lands and cause significant harm to local communities.  The American Farm Bureau Federation supports Representative Cheney's bill and opposes Planning 2.0, stating: ``We . . . are concerned that the Planning 2.0 rule will diminish the statutory requirements multiple use and dismantle the cooperative ideals of . . . BLM did not fully evaluate the impacts on consumers, public lands-dependent ranching families, energy, mining, recreation, and rural communities across the American West.''  The U.Chamber of Commerce, who is key voting in support of the bill, stated: ``This Obama administration `midnight regulation' undercuts States from fulfilling their role as managers of resources and land use decisions. The shift in authority away from local planning and land management will inherently jeopardize jobs throughout the West in industries ranging from timber, energy, mineral development, grazing, and recreation.''  Western Energy Alliance has also raised serious concerns about BLM 2.0 and has urged adoption of Representative Cheney's bill, stating: ``Besides delaying oil and natural gas development indefinitely, Planning 2.0 would prevent ranching, mining, timber harvesting, and other productive uses of the West's working landscapes that sustain rural communities and livelihoods.''  Americans for Prosperity, who is key voting in support of the bill, stated: ``The process outlined by the Planning 2.0 rule is highly problematic--it limits public involvement in decisionmaking, centralizes planning in Washington rather than in State and field offices, redefines BLM's interpretation of the `multiple use' requirement, prioritizes conservation over sustained yield, i.e. mineral leasing, and could further lengthen an already long permitting process.''  The National Association of Conservation Districts supports the bill, stating: ``The CRA allows for the BLM to go back to the drawing board and write a planning rule that truly increases local government involvement as opposed to centralizing the planning process.''  Again, the BLM Planning 2.0 rule takes planning decisions away from local governments and, instead, allows those important decisions to be made by bureaucrats in Washington who aren't familiar with our land, water, or communities.  Mr.Speaker, I urge adoption of Representative Cheney's commonsense bill.

14105,topic-id,404,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, it is time to face the facts. Congressional Republicans do not value our Nation's public lands the way everyday Americans do. I know this because they opened the 115th Congress by adopting a rules package that makes it easier to sell our national parks and national forests to the highest bidder without pesky budget rules getting in the way. That was just a start.  Last week, they voted to gut clean water and clean air protections in coal country, suspended a rule requiring oil companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments, and pulled a plug on a waste prevention regulation that would have saved money and improved air quality.  Today, their assault on the environment and our public land continues with this misguided effort to scrap the Bureau of Land Management's effort to update its planning rule. This resolution targets what is commonly known as Planning 2.0, an initiative to make public land management more transparent and efficient by enhancing opportunities for public input and utilizing actual science.  The American public does not support erasing this new planning rule, and they certainly don't support the broad antipublic land agenda being pushed by the  Our constituents are sick of seeing corporate interests, especially big polluters, come first. They do not want their national parks and cherished natural places turned over to industrial polluters. We have seen this in the massive response to the Dakota Access pipeline, heartbreak over what happened in Flint, Michigan, and the millions of people who marched worldwide on the first full day of this new administration.  Just last week, we saw how much Americans truly value their public land. After a prominent Republican introduced a bill to sell off more than 3 million acres of taxpayer-owned land, thousands of people picked up the phone and called their Representatives to express their outrage. Because of that passion and deep concern, the sponsor of that bill has vowed to withdraw it from consideration for the first time in five  This is an important story because it speaks to our constituents' true priorities.

These plans govern our use of more than 175 million acres of public lands. The way in which we use those lands deeply affects the environmental quality, public health, and all Americans' quality of life. It is vitally important that we get our planning right.  This rule promotes transparency and consensus, creating more and earlier opportunities for public involvement in the planning process. It encourages greater use of high-quality scientific information, and it provides for a big-picture, landscape-level response to challenges like wildfire management and invasive species. The effect is to strengthen, streamline, and democratize a process that had previously bred litigation and delay.  Mr.Speaker, I have to wonder: Which of these changes does my friend across the aisle oppose?  Mr.Speaker, in the last week, the House voted to disapprove three other rules that protect public health and environmental quality. I am disturbed by that pattern, and I am disturbed by the haste with which we have moved, especially since all of these rules took years to create and craft.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the majority to think of their children, their grandchildren, and all the generations to come. They deserve to inherit a rich, healthy, and sustainable world.

It has only been done once before this year, but now it has become a regular part of the Republican playbook.  BLM's Planning 2.0 is not some midnight regulation that was rushed through at the last minute. BLM went through a transparent rulemaking process and responded to thousands of comments. We had two hearings last year about Planning 2.0 in the Natural Resources BLM was only invited by the majority to one of the hearings, but the agency listened and made significant changes before publishing their final rule. This rule took 2.5 years to develop. It is not anywhere near a midnight rule.  It has been over 30 years since BLM updated the regulatory framework governing its planning process. That[[Page H1036]]means we are relying on Reagan-era rules that were put in place before the widespread availability of cellphones and digital mapping techniques to oversee everything from energy permitting to cultural resource management on over 250 million acres.  Everyone engaged in the management of our public lands wants to see this process improved. Planning 2.0 is that opportunity. However, if this resolution becomes law, BLM will never be allowed to evaluate and modernize this process, and we return to management planning from the 1980s. That is not a good outcome for anybody.

14123,topic-id,401,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, when you don't look at the whole field, you make mistakes. Without using their vision, quarterbacks throw passes into double coverage and Presidents trigger angry protests of their ill-conceived policies. Seeing the whole field is what BLM 2.0 is all about.  Instead of managing lands by looking at isolated units and only soliciting the input of local governments, this new framework takes a landscape view of BLM's multiple use mission. This update is absolutely necessary if we expect BLM to address the problems we all acknowledge the agency has. Climate change, wildfire, drought, and invasive species are just some of the problems that need landscape-level solutions. On the flip side, coordinating planning for outdoor recreation and renewable energy development across multiple BLM units will help increase the growth of these industries.  Rejecting landscape-level planning is like rejecting air traffic control; you can do it, but the results won't be pretty. By repealing this rule and locking a broken system in place in perpetuity, Republicans hope to fulfill their own prophecy that BLM does a poor job managing public lands. If enough people believe them, they think, then maybe they will achieve their goal of giving away America's public lands. The problem, though, is that not enough people believe them. Those who do are shrinking every day, and the ones who don't are making their voices heard.  People who care about sound management of BLM lands know that the Planning 2.0 rule is an important step forward. They know it isn't an abuse of executive authority or a government land grab, and they are tired of hearing from discredited voices who say it is. These views are backward looking and ignore the fact that these lands belong to a kid from Chicago just as much as they do to an oilman from  Landscape-scale planning allows BLM, with the input of all stakeholders, to manage across the lands. Under Planning 2.0, BLM State offices and the scientists and the land management professionals they employ are finally allowed to build a consistent land management policy that doesn't stop at the State line.  Planning 2.0 helps our land managers see the whole field and looks to the future. The majority wants to send us back to the past. We shouldn't allow that to happen.

That is the year the previous rule was written, and that is the rule we would be stuck with if this resolution passes.  Voting for this resolution means voting for outdated science; it means voting for a return to managing individual parcels with blinders on to the larger landscape; and it means continuing to ignore our changing climate.  Overturning BLM 2.0 means you are okay with ignoring the overwhelming scientific and public support for the planning updates implemented in the rule.  Don't get me wrong, Mr.There were plenty of great things from the early 1980s: movies like ``Return of the Jedi'' and those early cell phones that were the size of bricks. And don't forget the fashions of the 1980s. I am sure people thought they looked great in parachute pants, but eventually we all updated our wardrobes.  We might have had early cell phones back in the 1980s, but we didn't have modern computing, current technologies for mapping, or even There is no doubt that it is time to update our land use planning to take advantage of these technologies and respond to new challenges and to current times.

Why are they so eager to throw away 2\1/2\ years of public input into a modern, transparent, science-driven planning process?  They allege some local counties aren't happy, but we have got letters from counties saying that they support the rule, and thousands of pages of comments from the agency demonstrating that they responded to any concerns. This can't be the real motivation, Mr. No, the true purpose of this resolution is to tie the hands of Federal land managers so they can't manage special places in ways that might hinder pollution or cut down on private profiteering. Apparently, congressional Republicans have decided to give Representative Zinke a parting gift as he leaves to be Secretary of the That gift is a pair of handcuffs.

14129,topic-id,430,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the BLM 2.0 rule represents the turning back of a clock of ignoring science, ignoring the need for public participation.  Although Republicans claim they want to take power away from government and give it to the people, why do they oppose every attempt to actually do that?  They don't want the people to use citizen suits to hold polluters accountable. They don't want the people to use the NEPA process to ensure government actions aren't harming their communities. Today, they don't want the people to have increased participation in managing our public lands.  The reason, of course, is that Republicans don't want all people to have a seat at the table. They only want certain people to be there.  In this case, the old BLM planning process gave local governments in the West--many of which are cozy with mining, drilling, and grazing interests--a privileged position in influencing land management planning. Given that these public lands belong to all Americans and not just those who happen to live close to them, that approach was wrong.  BLM's Planning 2.0 rule changes that, leveling the playing field and allowing more stakeholders and interested parties to get involved earlier.  Under BLM's new rule, tribes, local governments, and stakeholders across the spectrum who care about these places where they work, recreate, hunt, fish, and live are all now encouraged to provide input at the outset instead of waiting until the bitter end. This will save time and money, reduce litigation, and generally make government work better.  So why would Republicans oppose it?  Hunters, anglers, and others who value the outdoors are asking the same question and are lining up in opposition to this misguided resolution and other bills that would reduce their access to public land.  The people have grown wise to the Republican crusade to give away ownership of and authority over their lands to States, localities, and private interests. They have grown very weary of that. They understand that this resolution is part of that crusade.  So Republicans have a choice. They can continue doing favors for the dirty development interests of the past or they can embrace policies like BLM 2.0 and use it to give a boost to the ongoing jobs boom in sectors like solar, wind, and outdoor recreation. For the sake of Western economies and landscapes, I hope they choose the latter.  Planning 2.0 finally recognizes the value of the public's voice in the planning process. Let's not silence them.

14132,topic-id,3539,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record letters in opposition to this resolution. These letters come from a broad array of stakeholders, including sportsmen, county commissioners, county supervisors, and conservationists, highlighting the breadth and depth of support for Planning 2.0.                                                 February 6, 2017.       Dear Representative: As organizations committed to      preserving our nation's historic and cultural resources, we      urge you to OPPOSE the Congressional Review Act resolution      (H.44) to nullify the Bureau of Land Management's      final planning rule, commonly referred to as BLM Planning      2.0.       The Congressional Review Act is the wrong tool to address      resource management planning. While no regulation is perfect,      using the Congressional Review Act to overturn the Planning      2.0 rule would have far-reaching implications for cultural      resources and management of our public lands. This resolution      of disapproval would prohibit the BLM from developing any      ``substantially similar'' regulation in the future. The      result would be to replace the new regulation with BLM's      prior planning rule, which is more than 30 years old and does      not incorporate current technology and streamlining practices      to maximize efficient and effective decision-making. Locking      in inefficient and outdated regulations does not serve any      users of our public lands.       The BLM's Planning 2.0 rule is designed to bring much      needed efficiency, predictability, and transparency to BLM's      management of multiple uses on public lands. The rule is      carefully crafted to collect state and local government,      tribal, and public input early in the planning process. In      addition to making BLM's planning more efficient, improving      available information allows project developers to consider      potential impacts to environmental, cultural, and historic      resources at the outset rather than being surprised by      stakeholder concerns and information identified late in the      process. The rule also improves the planning process by      reducing the need for costly and time-consuming supplements      that can delay decision-making and inhibit private sector      investment.       The BLM's Planning 2.0 rule updates procedures for      developing individual resource management plans that guide      actions and decisions on the nearly 250 million surface acres      and more than 700 million acres of subsurface mineral      resources that the agency manages. These lands contain the      largest, most diverse, and scientifically most important body      of cultural resources of any federal land management agency,      including well over a million historic, archaeological, and      other cultural sites. Our organizations remain committed to      promoting a responsible land management planning process that      enhances public involvement, improves transparency, and      promotes sound, efficient decision-making based on full      information, including better data on cultural resources on      our public lands.       If the resolution passes, it will make management of our      public lands less efficient and less effective.

Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members      and supporters, we urge you to Vote NO on H.44, the      Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to rescind the      Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Planning 2.0 regulation.      This resolution is an extreme and unnecessary response to a      sensible and overdue rule.       H.44 would invalidate a new, collaborative,      science-based approach to land use planning that boosts      public engagement, improves administrative efficiency, and      increases responsiveness in planning on our largest public      land system. It allows managers to move beyond an outdated 30      year-old process to better address pressing challenges posed      by critical issues, such as wildfire, invasive species and      increased demand for domestic energy. More specifically, this      new guidance:       Increases efficiency and public participation in planning.      The BLM rule will save taxpayer dollars, shorten planning      times, and avoid disputes by investing time upfront to      collaborate with locals and stakeholders on prospective      management strategies. Public voices will help develop plans      with improved opportunities for participation, new electronic      options for submitting input, and updated processes for      filing plan protests--improving the likelihood that the plans      meet Americans' broad array of conservation and resource      needs.       Preserves priority status for local government in planning.      The new rule carefully preserves a priority role for local      government and other cooperators in BLM planning processes as      directed by Congress, ensuring that final plans consider      local and regional perspectives and priorities.       Increases transparency in planning. The rule will prevent      closed door decision making between the BLM and special      interests by updating guidance that provides the American      people the ability to participate in the planning process at      all stages.       Improves science-based decision making in planning. High      quality data will be a foundation for BLM planning and      management. Planning 2.0 will incorporate current science,      geospatial data and technology to evaluate landscapes at the      regional level. These changes will enable faster response to      today's environmental, economic and social realities with new      evaluation markers and agency flexibility to plan across      traditional administrative boundaries, keeping our lands      great places to hike, hunt, and fish.       Supports sporting pursuits on BLM lands. Hunters and      anglers support Planning 2.0 because the rule takes steps to      ensure that important habitats, such as migration corridors      and other intact habitats, are identified early in the      planning process so these important areas can be managed and      conserved as the agency makes decisions about other public      land uses.       Overturning this common sense rule will relegate hundreds      of millions of acres of public lands to planning under an      out-of-date rule that has not been substantially changed      since 1983. The public will lose opportunities to participate      in how these public lands--owned by all Americans--should be      managed. Without the new rule, public land management will      continue to be contentious, inefficient and costly.       Finally, if the rule is struck down by the CRA, the BLM      could be prohibited from issuing a similar rule in the      future, preventing the agency from modernizing its land use      planning regulation to adequately address contemporary issues      like energy development, grazing, wildlife, mining,      conservation, recreation, cultural resources protection or      any of the many multiple uses that occur on our public lands.       Planning 2.0 is a sensible and much needed rule that      updates an antiquated process that limited management      decisions to outdated concepts of resource planning, and      instead creates a framework to support more inclusive,      comprehensive planning and management on our public lands. We      urge you to stand up to protect the new planning rule and to      Vote NO on H.44.

Dear Director Kornze: Humboldt County includes over 86,000      acres of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) parcels, including      such special places as the King Range National Conservation      Area and Headwaters Forest The stewardship of these      lands is very important to my constituents, other local      residents, and countless visitors to this region. It is a      matter of great concern to many of us when the BLM begins to      develop individual management plans for these parcels.       The BLM's Proposed Resource Management Planning Rule      described at 81 Federal Register 8674 (February 25, 2016),      commonly known as Planning 2.0, requires the agency to      involve the public, other federal agencies, state and local      governments and tribes as key partners early in the process      of developing local plans. Encouraging public involvement      early and often in the development of these plans is a very      positive step indeed. This is especially important given that      the BLM's Arcata Field Office will be using this new and more      inclusive approach to public involvement as it revises its      existing 1995 Resource Management Plan, I am therefore      pleased to offer my support for Planning 2.0.       Thank you for your consideration.

Increasing access to the planning process and      targeting your efforts towards greater public involvement      enhances the relationship between the people and their      government, and we support your initiative.       Additionally, we note that the Proposed Rules also expand      opportunities for states and local governments to have      meaningful involvement in the development of BLM's land use      decisions. The Proposed Rules continue to provide for      coordination with state and local representatives in order to      ensure, to the extent available under federal law, that RMPs      are consistent with state and local land use plans, as      provided in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of      1976.

Director Neil Kornze,     Bureau of Land Management,     Washington,       Dear Director Kornze: We are writing you to commend you and      the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for your efforts to      improve BLM's planning process (Planning 2.0) and better      address the diverse interests found in Missoula County and      other communities across the western United       Missoula County is approximately 2,600 square miles in      size, and federal management in the county accounts for 52      percent of the land ownership. The BLM manages roughly 23,000      acres for the public in Missoula County and the sustainable      management of these public lands is vitally important to the      residents we represent. Our citizens and local economies      depend on state and federal lands for water quality and      quantity, as well as for multiple sustainable uses ranging      from outdoor recreation to livestock grazing to mineral      exploration and development. Consequently, we wish to thank      the BLM for proposing to address their land management      options from a landscape perspective. This approach      recognizes that the management of federal lands has a direct      impact on other properties well beyond those close to or      adjacent to BLM managed land.       We support the provisions of the BLM's Proposed Resource      Management Planning Rules, 81 8674 (25, 2016).      These rules provide additional opportunities for public      involvement earlier in the planning process, including the      chance to review preliminary resource management alternatives      and preliminary rationales for those alternatives. This early      public involvement will help resolve conflicts and produce a      Resource Management Plan that better reflect the needs of our      citizens as well as others who use the public lands and have      a stake in their future. Equally important is the improved      openness and transparency the rules bring to the process,      allowing any local government to actively participate and      share information on issues critical to local residents and      their elected representatives.       The proposed rules continue to provide for coordination      with state and local representatives in order to ensure, to      the extent allowable under federal law, that Resource      Management Plans are consistent with state and local land use      plans, as provided in the Federal Land Policy and Management      Act of 1976.       Thank you for considering our comments. If you or your      staff have any questions, please feel free to contact us.           Sincerely,     Board of County Commissioners,     Nicole Rowley,           Jean Curtiss,           Stacy Rye,                                        ____                                                           The Pew                                            Charitable Trusts,                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 2017.       Dear Member of Congress: Next week the House of      Representatives will consider H.Res 44, a resolution to      overturn the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) 2016 land-use      planning rule. The Pew Charitable Trusts opposes this effort      to reduce agency transparency and limit the public's ability      to have a say in how their public lands are managed, and we      urge you to vote against it.       BLM's rule, often called ``Planning 2.0,'' establishes      procedures for preparing, revising, or amending land use      plans, and provides new opportunities for stakeholders to      participate in the early stages of developing plans. This      means that states and counties, scientists, ranchers, hunters      and anglers, miners, hikers, boaters, the energy industry and      other users of the public lands will have more information on      what a plan will cover and will be able to express their      hopes and concerns about the plan.       Increased public participation will ensure that the BLM has      the best available information at the start of the planning      process, before issuing draft management plans. The broad      consideration of issues at this earlier stage is expected to      reduce controversy later in the planning process, and reduce      litigation after the plan is issued.       Planning 2.0 also includes steps to ensure that important      fish and wildlife habitats, such as migration corridors and      intact habitats, are identified early in the planning process      so these important areas can be managed and conserved as the      agency makes decisions about development, recreation and      other public land uses.       The rule also includes good government provisions such as      improved potential for better interagency communication, and      steps that increase efficiency and ease burdens on public.       Many concerns that were raised about an earlier draft of      the rule were addressed and corrected in the final rule. For      example, the public comment period once a draft plan is      released is now 100 days--more than the previous 1983      regulations or the original 2015 proposal allowed. The final      rule also takes meaningful steps to accommodate requests from      local governments and the public to improve the process,      preserving the special role of state, local and tribal      cooperating agencies, as specifically required by the Federal      Lands Policy and Management       Passage of H.Res 44 would force BLM to return to its      previous, long-outdated planning rule, which was published in      1983. Of additional concern is that the Congressional Review      Act prohibits the agency from writing a new rule that is      ``substantially the same'' without additional legislative      action. As a result, many good aspects of Planning 2.0 would      be precluded from being enacted indefinitely, thereby      stripping incoming Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke of      his authority to reformulate the rule.       We strongly urge Members to work with the new      administration to make refinements to a planning process that      many stakeholders championed. If H.Res 44 is enacted, the      BLM would be forced to continue using outdated guidelines for      land-use planning, which keep the public and development      interests alike in the dark until very late in the planning      process.       If you would like further information regarding Pew's      position on this resolution, please feel free to contact me.           Sincerely,                                                         Ken Rait,                                       Director U.Public Lands.[[Page H1040]]                                       ____     Chairman Rob Bishop,     Natural Resources Committee, House of Representatives,          Washington,     Ranking Member Raul Grijalva,     Natural Resources Committee, House of Representatives,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva: The      undersigned hunting, fishing, conservation, natural resource      professional and outdoor-industry organizations represent      millions of American sportsmen and women, and we are writing      to express our support for the Bureau of Land Management's      (BLM) recently revised land-use planning rule, also known as      Planning 2.0. The revised planning rule increases federal      agency transparency and incorporates best practices in land-     use planning, while maintaining the important cooperating      agency role of state and local governments.       Stakeholders from across the multiple-use spectrum agreed      that the previous BLM planning process could be improved.      Under the outdated process, opportunities for public      involvement were too few, and the public didn't learn about      agency plans until they were already proposed.       With the new rule, the BLM provides three additional      opportunities for cooperating agency and public involvement.      These extra steps enable the BLM to gather public opinion and      the best available information at the start of the planning      process, then vet preliminary alternatives before issuing the      draft resource management plan.       Further, the revised planning rule will identify important      areas for fish, wildlife and outdoor recreation well in      advance of plan development so that avoidance and      minimization of impacts to these vital areas can be achieved      as the agency plans for a range of uses of the land through      individual plans. Given advancements in wildlife science and      data collection since the previous planning rule was created      more than 30 years ago, these updates were sorely needed, and      the sporting and wildlife communities support this revision.       Finally, local, state, and tribal governments, including      county commissioners, will retain their preexisting      cooperating agency status and an elevated level of      involvement in BLM land-use planning as specifically required      by the Federal Lands Policy and Management In fact,      significant changes were made to the final planning rule in      response to requests from cooperating agencies.       The new rule is the product of two and a half years of      collaboration and is a productive step towards improving BLM      planning. If additional improvements are necessary, the      undersigned organizations are committed to working with the      new Secretary of Interior, interested lawmakers and      stakeholders to make such adjustments. However, Congressional      actions to delay or dismiss the new BLM planning rule are      unnecessary and counterproductive.

Dear Member of Congress: Tomorrow, the House of      Representatives will vote on H.Res 44, to overturn Bureau      of Land Management's (BLM) new land use planning rule,      ``Planning 2.0'', established in 2016. Wild Connections      opposes this resolution and we urge you to vote against an      effort that will reduce agency transparency, limit the amount      of input that the public has on their public lands, and lose      strong management designations for wildlife and ecological      biodiversity. Wild Connections is an organization that has      been promoting landscape connectivity on a watershed and      ecoregion-wide basis for over 20 years and which has been      actively involved in the management plan revision for the      BLM's Royal Gorge Field Office, which is currently under way.      As a locally based conservation organization, we believe that      it is important for citizens to have opportunities to work      with the BLM to decide future management for these millions      of acres of public land. Planning 2.0 is a step in the right      direction.       BLM's Planning 2.0 makes BLM land use management planning      more collaborative and transparent. It offers more and new      opportunities for stakeholders to get involved, including      local governments, Indian tribes, and the general public.      Planning 2.0 engages the public earlier in the land      management planning process leading to more input into the      process, enabling the BLM with the best available information      at the onset of the planning process. More and earlier public      involvement will not only broaden the scope of the plan, but      will likely reduce litigation after the plan is enacted.       This new planning rule is also important for fish and      wildlife habitat. Migration corridors and intact habitats are      identified early in the planning process so that these      important areas can be managed and conserved as the agency      makes decisions about development, recreation and other      public land uses. Hunters and anglers support Planning 2.0 as      the rule offers wildlife corridors as a management      designation, for a key type of wildlife habitat or an area of      ecological importance.       As you know, the BLM's ongoing Eastern Colorado Resource      Management Plan Revision has incorporated parts of the      Planning 2.0 planning rule. Wild Connections and our members      have benefited from the ``envisioning meetings'' in 6 towns      and cities within the planning area, offering the public      opportunities to voice their concerns and comments in      preparation for the full planning effort. The BLM has      received positive comments from a diverse voice of users,      including outfitters, horse-packers, grazing lessees,      environmental organizations, wildlife groups, hunters,      anglers, snowmobilers, off-highway vehicle users, and mining      claimants.       If H.Res 44 is passed, the BLM would return to its long-     outdated planning rule, which was established in 1983. Of      additional concern is that the Congressional Review Act      prohibits the agency from writing a new rule that is      ``substantially the same'' without additional legislative      action. Thus many important aspects of Planning 2.0 would be      precluded from being enacted indefinitely in the      reformulation of the rule.       We strongly urge Members to work with the new      administration to make refinements to this planning process      that many stakeholders have championed. Please vote against      H.Res 44 so--that we do not lose these important BLM      planning aspects that were just carefully constructed under      Planning 2.0.           Sincerely,                                                James Lockhart,                                                         ",CREC-2017-02-07-pt1-PgH1032.txt,1708,AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET,2017.0,7.0,January

The majority is not spending all this time and effort simply to repeal this planning rule. This is one of the steps in their massive campaign to convince Americans that Barack Obama wasn't a good They simply can't stand to allow the accomplishments of the previous administration to stand, so they reflexively strike out to destroy anything President Obama supported.  This is not legislating. It is certainly not public service, and it isn't even smart. To paraphrase a former Speaker of the House, Sam Rayburn: anybody can kick down a barn; it takes a carpenter to build one.  This isn't how our government is supposed to work. It is especially counterproductive when it comes to something like Planning 2.0, which is specifically designed to make a Federal agency more efficient and more transparent.  The BLM rule is about bringing our land use plans into the 21st century. It is about local input. It is about using the best available science. The majority wants to return to 1983 so that polluters and developers are the only ones with a seat at the table.  We should support BLM 2.0, reject this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do so.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

14041,topic-id,1095,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman from Georgia, my friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.  Mr.Speaker, I rise to debate the rule for consideration. As my friend across the aisle has already noted, this rule bundles together two unrelated pieces of legislation. We are developing a pattern here of doing that in the Rules  The first of these is H.83, a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval that seeks to overturn a Department of Labor rule on workplace injuries, undermining workplace safety and health in the process.  The second measure is H.998, the SCRUB Act, which establishes a new commission to review Federal regulations with the aim of needlessly politicizing and, thereby, undermining the regulatory framework that keeps our air clean and our water safe to drink.  I note that my friend on the other side of the aisle did not mention that this commission will cost $30 million for work that last night's presenter at the Rules Committee said that Congress can do, the argument being that Congress doesn't have enough staff so we are going to send it over to nine people and pay $30 million, starting, to have them do the work that we in Congress should be doing.  Beginning with the CRA resolution--the 14th such resolution considered by the House this month--the Republican leadership is continuing its onslaught against well-thought-out and measured regulations. I get it. Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White They are desperately trying to ram through their priorities before anyone notices what they are doing.  It is interesting to me, Mr.Speaker, where the Republican majority has focused its attention throughout the past month. I can't help but notice that 40 days into Donald John Trump's administration, he has not put forth one single jobs measure. Democrats, on the[[Page H1365]]other hand, continue to talk about the need for good, well-paying jobs. The United States Senate put out the Democrats' trillion-dollar jobs plan that anybody can read on their website on where we stand when it comes to well-paying jobs.  Yet, as we advocate for our plan to rebuild our Nation's infrastructure and create over 15 million jobs in the process, Republicans pass measures to drug-test applicants for unemployment insurance and repeal rules that require Federal contractors to disclose violations of Federal labor and worker safety laws.  This resolution repeals a Department of Labor rule pertaining to the Occupational Safety and Health The rule in question requires employers to keep and maintain accurate records of every recordable injury and illness in federally mandated logs for a period of 5 years.  It is worth mentioning that this policy has been upheld in cases dating back to 1993. The rule, when implemented, added zero new compliance obligations, zero new reporting obligations, and cost a total of--you guessed it--zero dollars. Yet, once again, this is what we are spending our time on this week: repealing a thoughtful rule designed to protect workers.  I am particularly concerned by this resolution as it actually jeopardizes workplace safety by allowing employers to avoid penalties for the underreporting of injuries over many years. Longstanding workplace hazards will and can certainly be masked.                              {time}  1230  This makes it less likely that employers or employees will take corrective actions or that OSHA will find the hazards when they do an inspection, leaving workers in danger.  It is also worth noting that due to its very small budget, OSHA is only able to inspect a workplace, on average, once every 140 years. You heard me correctly, once every 140 years. That makes data even more important. Yet, by diminishing the reliability of a worksite's injury data, which some employers systematically underreport, this resolution also takes away OSHA's ability to protect workers from the most significant hazards.  Mr.Speaker, throughout the past week, concerned Americans attended town halls across the country, and for those who were actually able to meet with their Republican representative in Congress, the conversations focused on protecting health care, creating jobs, and protecting the environment. At these meetings, constituents did not ask for fewer workplace protections, they did not ask for Congress to act to make it easier for people with severe mental illness to purchase guns, they didn't ask for Congress to ease disclosure requirements for oil companies making payments to foreign governments, and yet these are the things the Republican majority has already chosen to focus on this month.  Watching the news, I did not hear one person say: if only Congress would repeal anticorruption rules, undermine my retirement security, and then allow endangered animals on national wildlife refuges to be killed using inhumane methods, if only Congress would do these things, my life would be better. Not one person, Mr.Yet, in the past month, the House voted to do all of the things that I just mentioned. I submit to the American people watching at home right now that this is the face of today's Republican Tell me who you think is really on your side.  Turning our attention to the SCRUB Act, this bill would establish a $30 million commission with unlimited subpoena authority that is empowered to dismantle long-established, science-based public health and safety standards. The SCRUB Act would undermine the ability of agencies to react to immediate public health threats by adopting the regulatory CutGo process. The CutGo system is, in my opinion, completely detached from reality. This requirement will prohibit agencies from issuing any new rules, even in the case of emergencies or imminent harm to the public, until they repeal an existing rule to offset the cost. Along with bills that have already come to the House floor under this Republican Congress, as well as Donald Trump's executive actions mandating a regulatory freeze, this legislation demonstrates a continued attack on standards set in place to protect American families.  I guess it is not all that surprising that my Republican friends are pushing through legislation that prioritizes corporate profit over health and safety of the American people. Whether it is denying access to women's health care or rolling back environmental protections, Republicans are making it clear where their allegiances lie. For a party that prides itself on being anti-red tape, the SCRUB Act strangely duplicates existing requirements to conduct retrospective reviews of rules, rules on top of rules on top of rules. Our regulatory system should work for all American families and encourage companies to run safe, forward-thinking businesses. This legislation would move us in the opposite direction.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-02-28-pt1-PgH1363-4.txt,511,DISAPPROVING RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR RELATING TO,2017.0,28.0,January

I appreciate the passion of my friend from I would suggest to him that I am amused that he would get in the weeds in a rather substantial legal opinion. A portion of it he correctly cited, but he omitted the continuing part of the judge's remarks that said that, indeed, you could go back and put forth a resolution.  I find it particularly amusing that my friends on the other side, after not granting that judge a hearing so that he could become a Supreme Court Justice, now want to say what a great judge he is and what a great amount of work he does. Shame on everyone who did not give him an appropriate hearing. But I understand what it is to steal a Justice of the Supreme Court, and that is what my friends on the Republican side did.

I rise today joining in celebration and in mourning with Chinese democracy activist Zhu This past week, he turned 64, but he marked the occasion in prison.  Zhu Yufu has devoted his life to promoting democracy and human rights, to the ire of Chinese authorities. In 2012, he was condemned to 7 years imprisonment on unjust charges. Since then, his health has deteriorated, made worse by denial of medical care and inhumane treatment. His family fears for his life.  The poem that led to Yufu's imprisonment is called ``It's Time.'' I completely agree. It is time. It is time for the Chinese government to provide Zhu Yufu with proper medical treatment and humane care. More than that, it is time for the Chinese Government to release Zhu Yufu and political prisoners like him who are unjustly detained. It is time for the Chinese Government to recognize and support freedom of speech, assembly, thought, and belief.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1191-3.txt,2015,DISAPPROVING RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR RELATING TO,2017.0,15.0,March
13980,topic-id,806,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to share the story of a family that I have come to know. They came from a humble place, scraping by. Amidst instability in their native land, they could barely keep food on their table. For years, their government ignored their struggle and suffering. Like so many others, they dreamed of a better life in  Finally, they managed to cobble together enough money to make the dangerous journey to our shores. Yet, once here, they discovered that life wasn't so easy. They were resented for their accents, their faith, and their foreign ways. Doors were slammed in their faces when they sought work.  So they worked harder. They leaned on each other and those who came before. They forged a community and they organized. They built churches, businesses, and schools. Slowly but surely, they began to enjoy some measure of success and stability.  Mr.Speaker, I am sure that there are Garcias or Asgaris or Rodriguezes that share that same story, but the one I tell is not theirs.  This family's name is Struggling immigrants whose quest for a better life took them from Ireland's potato famine to Boston's immigrant barrios. It is the ageless story of a young man looking for a better future, of a family in search of a safe place to settle down, of the sacrifice that any parent would make for the benefit of their children. And it has been repeated millions of times in every corner of our world in the over 150 years since my ancestors fled their home to find a new one.  My father has a memory of my great-grandmother, Rose, that he shared with me once. He was playing outside with friends one day when she called him in. As he fidgeted around and impatiently tried to sit still, she pulled out a big scrapbook and flipped to a stack of carefully folded newspapers in the back. One after another, she opened them up to the help wanted section. There, she pointed to ad after ad marked in big block letters: No Irish need apply.  My great-grandmother's message was clear: Don't forget where you came from, don't forget the blood and the sweat and the tears that generations before you have shed so that you would never feel the sting of prejudice.  For my family and so many others, this became a deeply personal fight. In July of 1964, a young Attorney General named Robert Kennedy sat in front of the House Judiciary There, my grandfather urged Congress to act on immigration reform. Our system, he said, ``is a source of embarrassment to us around the world, it is a source of anguish to many of our own citizens, it is a source of loss to the economic and creative strength of our nation as a whole, it is inconsistent with our principles and out of step with our history.''  The opposition that he and other advocates have faced half a century ago sounds eerily familiar to so many of us today: Immigrants will flood our cities and towns. They will take American jobs. They will poison American culture. They aren't from here. They aren't like us. They are somebody else's babies.  Fifty years later, the opposition still hasn't updated their talking points. Fifty years later, our broken immigration system is still a source of embarrassment, but worse, of anguish and of loss. Fifty years later, we face a threat unlike almost any we have seen in recent history: a President who has built an entire campaign--and now an administration--on the scapegoating of immigrant families.  We have watched President Trump threaten our most fundamental American values with border walls and bad[[Page H2088]]hombres. We have heard his racial epithets. We have seen cold-hearted executive orders. We have stood in horror as his administration sweeps the country with raids that appear unprecedented in their utter disregard for family, community, and common decency.  That is why I stand here today, on the eve of Patrick's Day, the proud son of Irish immigrants and the humble beneficiary of our country's golden doors, to deliver a message to immigrant families: President Trump does not speak for all of us, and his immigration policies are opposed by leaders in Washington who do not take your patriotism for granted. We are grateful for your contribution to our communities, our culture, and our economy. We understand your willingness to walk to the ends of the Earth, to navigate oceans and mountains and deserts and war zones because every parent would do the same. We know what you have risked to give them a better future and what you have sacrificed to be a part of our United We stand by your side in the fight ahead.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

14048,topic-id,456,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National Court Reporting and Captioning Week and in[[Page H1130]]appreciation of court reporters across the country.  Court reporters play a critical role in our communities. They are the guardians of our public record. They have unique skills translating the spoken word into text to be recorded for history. They preserve judicial proceedings and assist individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing.  I have seen firsthand the dedication and professionalism shown by court reporters from my time as a special prosecutor in Wisconsin and, more importantly, from my wife Tawni, who has been a court reporter in western Wisconsin for nearly 25 years. I wish her a happy Valentine's Day today.  In addition to the critical role court reporters play in the courtroom, the National Court Reporters Association and its members have made significant contributions to the success of the Veterans History The Veterans History Project, which was created by legislation that I authored, is the largest oral history collection in the world, having collected over 100,000 stories from our Nation's veterans. Their stories are permanently stored at the Library of Congress and are available to the public.  Shortly after the Veterans History Project was launched in 2000, my wife Tawni encouraged court reporters across the country to partner with the Library of Congress to assist in transcribing veterans' stories; and to date, court reporters have submitted over 4,000 oral history transcripts to the Library of Not only have court reporters been willing to work with the Library of Congress to transcribe stories that had already been submitted, but many court reporters have personally gone and interviewed veterans in their local communities.  For example, last August, at the court reporters' national convention, the National Court Reporters Foundation celebrated Purple Heart Day by interviewing eight Purple Heart recipients for the Veterans History Additionally, the National Court Reporters Foundation recently launched a new program called the Hard-of-Hearing Heroes Project, where veterans with profound hearing loss will be interviewed for the Veterans History Project through the use of realtime captioning.  This is important because, according to the VA, hearing loss is one of the most common service-related injuries, and it is estimated that 60 percent of our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer some form of hearing loss. The program will help ensure every veteran has a chance to share his or her story.  As we celebrate National Court Reporting and Captioning Week, I want to thank the National Court Reporters Association and its many members throughout the country for their hard work and professionalism. I especially want to thank the court reporters for their significant contributions to the Veterans History Project and to preserving veterans' stories for generations to come.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1129-5.txt,1498,PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR,2017.0,14.0,February

During that time, he was the Navy's lead advocate on Capitol Hill and had the challenging job of communicating with all 535 Members of Congress, handling their constituent inquiries, and properly representing the Navy while taking into account military, political, and budgetary priorities.  Admiral Faller selflessly devoted the last 2 and a half years of his life to ensuring our Nation's sailors were represented in Congress, and he excelled in that role. He established warm and lasting relationships with my colleagues, garnering respect and admiration in both Chambers of Congress and on both sides of the aisle. He worked with us to establish the first-ever Senate Navy Caucus and broadened the Navy's outreach beyond members of defense committees. His efforts, along with those of the Chief of Naval Operations, introduced the Navy to Senators who would not otherwise have had exposure to the great work our sailors are doing around the globe.

Both parties forge an enduring relationship over the years through training exercises, military-to-military engagement, and security cooperation activities. These relationships are critical to our national security; they improve the capacity of friendly militaries, enhance our interoperability as allies, and allow us to promote our values in emerging nations. Furthermore, they provide members of the Guard with unique opportunities that make them more skilled military professionals and more experienced citizens.  The Maine National Guard partnered with Montenegro in December 2006, just 6 months after Montenegro declared its independence. In the decade since, the Maine National Guard has advised and assisted Montenegro as the young nation has transformed its military, transitioning to an all-volunteer force and contributing troops to the coalition fighting in This relationship has expanded beyond the military dimension: the Maine Marine Patrol has trained with the Montenegrin marine police, and Mainers have worked with numerous Montenegrin governmental agencies to improve their disaster preparedness and response. Through numerous joint exercises each year in both Maine and Montenegro, Mainers have developed close, lasting relationships with their Montenegrin counterparts.  Montenegro joined the State Partnership Program expressly as a means of achieving their desired accession to The Senate's ratification of Montenegro's membership bid reflects the hard work and enormous growth that Montenegro has achieved in the last 10 years.

13955,topic-id,1041,"Mr.President, I want to take the chance to have just a moment to be able to reflect on what the Senate has just completed. We have worked through a process of identifying what is called the Congressional Review Most Americans are not[[Page S1835]]familiar with this because it is so seldom used. In fact, it has only been used one time before this Congress successfully.  It is a moment for the Congress to be able to look back at regulations that have been promulgated by the administration and say: Was that the intent of the law?  It is something that we have worked at for a long time to be able to get as a frequent part of this national conversation. We call it the REINS It allows Congress to be able to look at each major regulation when it comes out from the administration and ask the simple question: When the regulations are created, are they consistent with the statute? That is what regulations are. No administration can just invent policy and say: We think this is a good thing to do. That is the task of That is why the Constitution says that all legislative powers shall reside in the Congress, because an administration can't make up the law. It has to come from this body, from the House of Representatives, and then be signed by the After that is done, then regulations are created that have to be consistent with the law.  The Congressional Review Act was created years ago to allow Congress to have a second glance at regulations as they are put out and say: Is that consistent with the statute we passed? This Congress has already gone through multiples of those.  In the last 6 months of the Obama administration, many regulations were created. When they were created, they were not consistent with the statute. This Congress has already turned back billions of dollars of regulations from the American people. One of those was done this week. Ironically, it is an issue that deals with unemployment benefits and drug testing.  Many States have requested the ability to be able to do drug testing for unemployment benefits. And this is not a situation where this Congress believes that all people on unemployment benefits need to be drug tested or are unemployed because of drug use--far from it.  In 2012, Congress passed the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation In that, it allowed States, if they chose to--they don't have to but if they chose to--to do drug testing for benefits eligibility, for unemployment benefits under two circumstances. One of them is if the applicant was terminated from their employment based on the unlawful use of a controlled substance. In other words, if they were just fired from a previous job because they were using drugs, they wouldn't be able to get unemployment benefits because they had already been certified as a drug user. The second one is that if the only available suitable work meant that they had to be drug tested, then they could be drug tested.  What is the design of this? The design of the policy was to encourage people to get back to work. If they were fired from a previous job because they used drugs, it is a natural thing to say: Before you can get unemployment benefits, we want to make sure you have gotten off drugs since that time period you were fired, or if you will be drug tested for the only job that is available to you in your targeted area, you are not available to be able to take that job if you haven't already had some sort of drug testing.  It is a commonsense measure, and it is given to the States to say to the States: You can choose to do this or not to do this, but if you choose to do it, you can, because unemployment benefits are a partnership between the Federal Government and local  We believe this is one tool of many to be able to help people who are trapped in the addiction of drugs to have one more incentive to be able to get off that addiction. Multiple different methods are also used within States to enable them to walk alongside families and individuals and help them get off their substance abuse habits as well.  It is a powerful motivator to say to people: If you want to get some support into your family to help you transition back into a job, the law says that to be on unemployment benefits, you have to be available for work. And if this person is currently addicted to drugs and using drugs, they are not available for work.  This measure was passed in 2012. The Obama administration took 4 years to promulgate the rules off of this commonsense measure, and once they finally promulgated the rules, they created a set of rules so complex, so complicated, with so many exceptions built into it, that the rule meant nothing. It put us in the situation of saying: What Congress passed 4 years ago, we actually wanted that to go into effect to give those States the right to be able to do it.  So this Congress--the House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted and this week the Senate also voted to be able to block out that last-minute regulation from the Obama administration, which they took 4 years to promulgate, and to be able to say to the States: If you choose to do drug testing with someone who was fired from a previous job because of drug use or because the only job available to that person will have drug testing, if you want to help families be able to get off substance abuse and to be able to set this standard for them, you can.  We have an epidemic of drug use in our We should do everything we can to not only deal with the interdiction of drugs coming into the country but to also deal with abuse of drugs in our country. This is one of those measures, and I am glad my State and other States will again have that opportunity to be able to use this.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-15-pt1-PgS1834.txt,2050,DISAPPROVING RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR RELATING TO,2017.0,15.0,March

14172,topic-id,1038,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for yielding, but also for her tremendous leadershipon so many issues, including as a champion for women and women's health and reproductive health care, and also for thisimportant discussion tonight.                              {time}  1915  I just want to mention that I serve on the Budget Committee, and you mentioned a nominee, Congressman Tom Price ofGeorgia, for Secretary of Health and Human Once again, we see President-elect Donald Trump making recommendations ofthose individuals who want to dismantle the safety net and dismantle health care within the agencies that they are going to run.This is a very, very troubling development in terms of these cabinet appointee nominees.  I note that--and many know--President-elect Trump ran one of the most divisive and prejudiced campaigns that we have witnessedin modern history. Since winning the Presidency, he has nominated billionaires to serve in his cabinet, proving that he willgovern just as he campaigned. Also, he has nominated individuals who want to dismantle, for the most part, the agencies thatthey will have jurisdiction over.  Another example is his choice for Secretary of State, which Congresswoman Watson Coleman mentioned, and that is I serve on the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee andunderstand the importance of our diplomatic initiatives, our USAID initiatives, and our efforts to really bring education andhealth care to the poorest of the poor around the world. Our Secretary of State serves as the Nation's chief diplomat andrepresents America's interests around the world. I have the opportunity and the privilege to serve on the committee that fundsthe majority of these efforts.  So the nomination of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson really troubles me. His extensive ties to the Kremlin raises thequestion: Whose interest will he represent?  Our country cannot afford a Secretary of State who will place private corporate interests over the needs of the Americanpeople and our national security interests. His recent confirmation hearing revealed what we have known all along in Republican-controlled Washington, that cabinet officials will cater to special interests, not to American families, based on the nomineesthat we have seen come forward.  It is not just the Secretary of State we should be concerned about. Here at home, President-elect Trump has nominatedcabinet officials that would turn back the clock on progress. His nomination for Secretary of Labor, Andrew Puzder, is anothermillionaire CEO who benefits from an economy rigged against families struggling to make ends meet. He earns more than $1 milliona year, but opposes a raise for low-wage workers earning just $15,000 a year. He says that food assistance programs keep low-wage workers like those he employs at, I believe, Carl's and Hardee's--he says that if low-wage workers apply for these foodassistance programs, then the programs actually discourage work. There are millions of people who are working two jobs beingpaid minimum wage who need food assistance, who need food stamps, because they can't survive in today's economy.  So the working, poor, low-income individuals, should be very troubled by this appointment as Secretary of Labor, which issupposed to look out for the rights of working men and women. We need a Labor Secretary committed to helping working familiesand addressing the epidemic of poverty, not one who caters to the most affluent.  Also, by nominating Senator Sessions to lead the Justice Department, President-elect Donald Trump is making it clearthat he will abandon our fundamental civil and human rights. Senator Sessions has a long history of opposing civil rightsand equality. I am very proud of members of the Congressional Black Caucus for really setting forth his record and his history,such as laying out the fact that he was rejected from serving as a Federal judge due to his blatantly racist comment. Heforcefully degraded the LGBT community, opposed the Violence Against Women Act, and violated the Voting Rights Act, calling itan intrusive piece of legislation.  Clearly, someone who has publicly shown prejudice and intolerance is not qualified to serve as the chief law enforcement forour civil rights laws. Once again, you see a nominee who really doesn't believe in the values of liberty and justice for all, aperson to head an agency that is supposed to be an agency that ensures the civil and human rights for all. Let me be clear,these nominations are a chilling indication of how a Trump administration intends to govern.  Our Nation has made tremendous progress in the fight to protect, preserve, and expand civil rights, civil liberties, andhuman rights for all We will not allow a Trump administration to drag us back into the past.  Finally, let me just say something that is troubling me tremendously at this point in our history. Our Nation prides itselfon being a democracy. We actually promote democracy abroad through our democracy programs, which, of course, I have historicallyopposed. The point I am trying to make and want to make clear is that this new administration, when you look at the majority ofcabinet nominees, they are very, very wealthy and do not fundamentally believe in a strong public sector and in many ways do notsupport the mission of the cabinets they are actually asked to lead.  Privatizing Medicare and other public sector programs that ensure that the most vulnerable have a safety net and anopportunity to live the American Dream by privatizing these agencies is dangerous. It will lead to chaos. Private sectortakeover of the government is dangerous and it erodes our public institutions that are required in a democracy.  So, Congresswoman Watson Coleman, I believe this is the dangerous, slippery slope that this administration has embarkedupon, and we need to expose every step of the way who these individuals are, their background, and we have to urge that theycomply with the ethics requirement and submit their financial disclosure statements and all the required ethics forms so thatthe public will know who they are. We must be transparent and, of course, we would like for our President-elect to release hisincome taxes also.  Again, we kind of see what is taking place now. We knew this during the campaign. I thought that we were going to see nowmore of an effort to unify the country, but, unfortunately, I think these nominees show us which direction, unfortunately, thisnew administration will take.

There is really no one in this body--maybe with the exception of Representative Carter of Georgia--who can tell the story of community pharmacists the way Representative Doug Collins does.  I thank Representative Collins of Georgia for putting this Special Order hour together. He has been such a strong leader on pharmacy issues. He has been a great partner on the legislation that we will be discussing this evening.  I am proud to say that this is a bipartisan issue, one of the few in this Congress at this point. It is one of the few in Washington, D.C., at this point. We have been able to find a consensus on this, at least with respect to one bill, and I think we are probably going to be able to do it with respect to others as well.

That is why I am proud to stand here today with my colleagues to recognize the quality and the affordable and the personal care that pharmacists provide every day.  Within that group of pharmacists, we have got a subset of pharmacists, and that is the community pharmacists and their pharmacies. They are also a great source not only of the expertise they provide, but economic growth in rural communities like those in my district and across the State of  As Mr.Collins mentioned, rural areas are very important in this as well. I am a member of the Small Business I recognize how challenging it can be for some of these small pharmacists to compete with the bigger companies. I appreciate their hard work to serve our communities.  Like most small-business owners, community pharmacists, they have to face challenges to compete and negotiate on a day-to-day basis with large entities as far as their business transactions are concerned. I frequently visit community pharmacists and I see the great job they are doing.  One pressing challenge facing many of our community pharmacists in particular that will be discussed tonight is the ambiguity and the uncertainty surrounding the reimbursement of generic drugs. Generic prescription drugs account for the majority of drugs dispensed by pharmacists, making transparency in reimbursement absolutely critical to the financial health of these small pharmacies.  But we know that pharmacists are reimbursed for generic drugs through what is called maximum allowable cost, or And this is a price list that outlines the upper limit or the maximum amount that an insurance plan will pay for a generic drug.

14173,topic-id,947,"I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for yielding, for hosting this Special Order, and for granting me thisopportunity to speak.  Since the first nomination was announced by President-elect Trump's transition team, phones in my office have been ringingoff the hook; and not a day goes by when I do not hear from my neighbors, friends, and constituents of their angst, frustration,and discontent. I share their anger and dread--that feeling of being punched in the gut--as name after name has been released.Each nomination from President-elect Trump has put the fox in charge of the henhouse.[[Page H463]]  We are not talking about simple differences in partisan ideology. We are talking about nominees who have devoted much oftheir professional lives to undermining the small-d democratic institutions that are the foundation of our country. This newadministration is so extreme that we cannot, in any good faith, give this President-elect the traditional deference to name acabinet that represents his governing philosophy because the appointments show it to be a philosophy that seeks to corrupt, ifnot fully destroy, our institutions, traditions, and values.  Senator Jeff Sessions, the nominee for Attorney General, was considered too racist to serve on the Federal bench by aRepublican Senate, much less to head the Justice Department, and is someone who has so little respect for women's rights hevoted against the Violence Against Women Act and called Roe v. Wade a colossal mistake.  Ben Carson, the nominee for HUD Secretary, said today in his confirmation hearing that he was against protecting LGBTAmericans from housing discrimination because protecting them from housing discrimination would be granting them extra rights,refusing to recognize that LGBT Americans deserve equal rights.  Tom Price, the nominee for HHS Secretary, wants to eliminate Medicare and Medicaid as we know them, repeal theAffordable Care Act without a second thought for the millions of Americans who would lose coverage or would be subject to limitson preexisting conditions and would be subject to lifetime and annual limits, and has so little understanding of women's healththat he insisted that not a single woman would lose access to contraception if contraception coverage were eliminated.  Betsy DeVos, the nominee for Education Secretary, advocated for years to move taxpayer dollars away from public schools andtowards for-profit, private schools that would leave behind low-income students, minority students, and children withdisabilities.  Scott Pruitt, the nominee for EPA administrator, does not believe in climate change and is so linked to the fossil fuelindustry that he has sued the EPA a dozen times to block environmental regulations designed to protect us from the effects ofclimate change.  The list goes on and on, each more horrifying than the one before. These are not the values the majority of Americans votedfor in November, and I don't just mean because Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 3 million. I cannot imagine that thevoters who wanted to drain the swamp and voted for Mr.Trump for that purpose and have the needs of working people representedare thrilled to see him name the wealthiest cabinet--with the greatest collection of Wall Street insiders--in American history.  The fact is, President-elect Trump and the Republican Party do not have any mandate from the people to carry out thedystopian horror show this cabinet presents. Rather than rubber stamping the most extreme cabinet I have seen in my 25 years inWashington, the Senate should reject these extreme nominees, and then both Houses should do their constitutional duty to conductoversight of the administration.  I am ready to do that work. Over a month ago, along with my Democratic Judiciary Committee colleagues, I sent a letter toChairman Goodlatte asking him to hold hearings on the conflict of interest and ethics provisions that apply to thePresident of the United I have not heard a response. Every Democrat in this House signedon to the Protect Our Democracy Act, legislation to create an independent, bipartisan-appointed commission to investigateRussian hacking in the 2016 election and to make recommendations to ensure nothing like that happens again. It is interestingthat not a single House Republican has joined us.  I join my constituents and millions of Americans in wanting to know why Republicans are working so hard to protectPresident-elect Trump from having to answer questions about Russian influence in this election. Why are Republicans working sohard to support President-elect Trump's extreme and out-of-touch cabinet? Why aren't Republicans asking the same questions abouthow President-elect Trump will avoid conflicts of interest?  I have served in this body for nearly 25 years. I have seen this body take on the big questions of our time--the role ofgovernment in the lives of everyday Americans, the threat of terrorism in the city I call home and around the country, the rightof every American to marry whomever they love, the right of every American to vote free of intimidation, and the right of everyAmerican to make their own healthcare choices. I have seen us come through those battles bruised and battered but stronger.  That is why I refuse to despair. I refuse to put my head down and hide. I refuse to give up on I will stand hereand fight for the country we all believe in. I will do everything in my power to represent the strong progressive values of themen and women who sent me here.  I will work with my colleagues here in the House and the Senate to stand united against any effort to undermine the rightswe have fought so hard to achieve, whether it comes from the other end of the world or the other end of Pennsylvania  But if there is to be any check on this administration, congressional Republicans will need to join in that fight, and itstarts with rejecting the shameful slate of nominees.

14018,topic-id,957,"Mr.Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 40, providing for theconsideration of two important pieces of legislation: H.238, the Commodity End-User Relief Act, and H.78, the SECRegulatory Accountability  The rule provides for the consideration of these measures under a structured rule and makes in order any amendment submittedto the House Rules Committee, including all five Democratic amendments to H.78, as well as all eight amendments submitted forH.238, allowing for a balanced debate on these very substantial issues.  H.238 is essential to the smooth functioning of the American economy and is long overdue for enactment into law. Thisimportant legislation reauthorizes until 2021 the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, also known as the CFTC, which had itsstatutory authority lapse in 2013. The House passed the Commodity End-User Relief Act with bipartisan support in the 114thCongress, and a similar bill was also adopted in the 113th Congress, establishing a strong record of bipartisan support for thismeasure. Unfortunately, in both instances, the Senate failed to take up the legislation before the end of its respectiveCongress, which is why it is imperative that we pass this bill through both Chambers and send it to the President's desk.  After the financial crisis of 2008, practically everyone agreed that changes needed to be made to our financial servicessector in order to protect families, farmers, small businesses, and our economy, as well as to prevent another crisis in thefuture. Like many of my colleagues, I have concerns with some of the reforms that were instituted in response to the crisisbecause they have put overly burdensome restrictions and regulations on our economy and our business communities. But like everymajor, comprehensive law, there are always unintended consequences that need to be addressed, and H.238 does exactly that.  For example, the authors of Dodd-Frank argued the law's main purpose was to reduce systemic risk to our economy. However, Idon't think anyone would argue that farmers who are simply trying to lock in a good price for their corn or their wheat are asystemic risk to the economy. Similarly, restaurant chains looking to make sure they have enough beef, enough pork, or enoughpotatoes to sell to their customers don't pose a systemic risk, just as utility companies seeking to ensure that they haveadequate power supplies to meet the needs and demands of their ratepayers did not cause the financial crisis. Unfortunately, thecurrent law imposes rules that treat all of these entities as major risks to our economy, and it imposes overly burdensomecapital and paperwork requirements on them.  Mr.Speaker, critics may claim that this bill undermines consumer protections. However, this could not be further from thetruth.  Title I of the legislation puts in place greater consumer protections, like requiring brokerage firms to notify investorsbefore moving funds from one account to another in order to prevent abuses like those that occurred at MF Global prior to itsbankruptcy.  Title II makes reforms to the CFTC and strengthens the cost-benefit analysis the Commission must perform when consideringthe impacts of its rules. Opponents have claimed that requiring cost-benefit analyses will open up the CFTC to lawsuits.However, H.238 merely gives the CFTC a standard for writing good rules the first time, which will be a benefit for all of us.  Title III provides relief to the farmers, the restaurants, the manufacturers, the utilities, and other entities which relyon a steady supply of commodities and inherently want to avoid risk but have been caught up in the unintended consequences ofthe Dodd-Frank reforms. These users have a genuine need to use markets to hedge against bad weather, natural disasters,inflation, price shocks, and other unforeseen circumstances that could jeopardize their ability to serve their customers.  The rule also provides for the consideration of H.78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability This legislation replacesguidance adopted by the SEC in 2012 that currently governs the use of economic analysis in SEC rulemakings and requires the SECto identify and assess the significance of problems prior to regulating. It directs the agency to conduct a review of existingregulations within 1 year of enactment--and then every 5 years thereafter--to determine the sufficiency, the effectiveness, andthe burdens associated with their implementation. Further, H.78 instructs the SEC's Chief Economist to conduct a cost-benefitanalysis on regulations the agency is promulgating as well as to provide an explanation describing the SEC's decision-makingprocess, including the implications of not taking the regulatory action.  Economic analysis is the cornerstone of prudent rulemaking and entails evaluating the qualitative and quantitative costs andbenefits of proposed regulations as well as potential alternatives in order to determine the correct action an agency shouldtake. We must ensure Federal regulators are thoroughly assessing both the need for the regulation and adequately evaluating itspotential consequences--intended as well as unintended--to prevent small businesses and job creators from being unnecessarilyburdened by onerous Federal regulations.  Mr.Speaker, this is a good, straightforward rule, allowing for the consideration of twobills that will hold Federal agencies and their rulemaking processes accountable to the American people. Voters sent a clearmessage in November that they want a Federal Government that is smaller, less intrusive, and more discerning in its regulatoryactions. House Republicans created our A Better Way agenda by listening to Americans about the ideas for our Nation, and thenew, unified Republican government will continue our work to change the status quo and provide real progress for all Americans.The adoption of this rule and the passage of the underlying bills is yet another opportunity to show that we heard this messageloud and clear and that we will reinforce our commitment to restoring the people's voice in our Federal  I am proud to support the rule providing for the consideration of these measures, and I urge my colleagues to support therule and the underlying bills.

In onesentence, it says: ``Thank you in advance for your support of this bill that is so important to U.farmers, ranchers, hedgersand futures customers.'' It is signed, like I said, by over two dozen organizations.  I include in the Record the letter I received this morning, I think, as did my colleague, Representative Polis,from over two dozen agricultural groups and associations located throughout the country in unanimous support of H.238.                                                 January 11, 2017.       Dear Member of the House ofRepresentatives: The undersigned      organizations represent a very broad cross-section of U.     production agriculture andagribusiness. We urge you to cast      an affirmative vote on H.238, the ``Commodity End-User      Relief Act,'' when it moves to thefloor for consideration.       This legislation contains a number of important provisions      for agricultural and agribusiness hedgerswho use futures and      swaps to manage their business and production risks. Some,      but certainly not all, of the bill's importantprovisions      include:       Sections 101-103--Codify important customer protections to      help prevent another MF       Section 104--Provides a permanent solution to the residual      interest problem that would have put more customer fundsat      risk--and potentially driven farmers, ranchers and small      hedgers out of futures markets--by forcing pre-margining of      theirhedge accounts.       Section 306--Relief from burdensome and technologically      infeasible recordkeeping requirements in commoditymarkets.       Section 308--Requires the CFTC to conduct a study and issue      a rule before reducing the de minimis threshold for      swapdealer registration in order to make sure that doing so      would not harm market liquidity and end-user access      tomarkets.       Section 311--Confirms the intent of Dodd-Frank that      anticipatory hedging is considered bona fide hedgingactivity.

14027,topic-id,1424,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I certainly appreciate the discussion over the past few minutes. I believe that this rule and the underlyingbills are strong measures that are important to the future of our country.  This rule provides for ample debate on the floor, the opportunity to consider and vote on both H.238 and H.78, as wellas every amendment that was submitted to the House Rules Committee, which reflects the balanced, open, and deliberative processafforded by this rule.  H.238 is a solid, substantial measure that will address several critical issues that the CFTC and end user are facing,while also addressing the CFTC's lapsed reauthorization with reauthorizing the Commission through 2021. While some opponentshave called for an open rule, this structured rule makes all eight submitted amendments in order.  Mr.Speaker, no one wants to see complete deregulation of our financial services industries and our commodities andderivatives markets. However, it is critical that the regulations put in place are appropriate for our economy and our users.These rules have to provide safeguards and prevent systemic risk but should not hinder our entire economy with one-size-fits-allregulations.  As we have discussed today, the current rules place enormous compliance and financial burdens on small businesses, onfarmers and ranchers, utilities, and manufacturers. They take these small, risk-averse entities and place them under the sameregulatory scheme as large financial institutions and hedge funds. H.238 will differentiate and exempt the end users who arenot a cause of systemic risk--as these entities inherently want to avoid risk--and, thus, shouldn't be subject to the same rulesand requirements as financial and investment firms that are less risk averse in nature.  The Commodity End-User Relief Act would make much-needed reforms at the CFTC to strengthen their rulemaking process and addcommonsense consumer protections so these regulations are not a continual burden on ourNation's farmers and small businesses.  Mr.Speaker, the rule also provides for consideration of H.78 under a structured rule and makes all five Democraticamendments in order. This legislation takes important steps to engrain a stronger commitment to economic analysis at the SEC,which will facilitate the promulgation of reasonable rules that do not unduly burden registered companies or negatively impactjob creation. The measure will increase transparency and oversight, while facilitating additional analysis and reviews ofexisting regulations, which should be something that all Members of this body can support.  As elected Representatives, I believe we must ensure our regulatory framework is not politicized and that Federal regulatorsare thoroughly assessing both the need for the regulation as well as adequately evaluating its potential consequences. This billtakes important steps towards achieving all of these goals.  It is important to remember that the financial crisis was not caused by the farmer who grows the food you eat for dinner, orby the utility you buy electricity from, or by the people who provide the wood in your desk or the metal used in your car. Idon't know of any reason why we should continue to treat them as if they were responsible, which is what the current law doesand is what H.238 seeks to correct.  Further, better informing the American people of the true impact of major regulations does nothing to diminish the abilityof regulators to adequately address illegal or inappropriate activities but, rather, increases transparency and the efficacy ofFederal rules, which is why passage of H.78 is so critical both to our constituents and to our economy.  Mr.Speaker, this is a strong rule that provides for open and fair consideration of these vital pieces of legislation aswell as every amendment that[[Page H321]]was submitted to the House Rules I am proud to speak in favor of this rule, and Iurge all of my colleagues to support House Resolution 40 and both of the underlying bills.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Polis is as follows:            An Amendment to 40 Offered by Mr.Polls       At the end of the resolution,add the following new      sections:       6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant toclause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union forconsideration of the bill (H.     371) to address financial conflicts of interest of the      President and Vice The firstreading of the bill      shall be dispensed with. All points of order against      consideration of the bill are waived. General debateshall be      confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally      divided and controlled by the Majority Leader and theMinority      Leader or their respective designees. After general debate      the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-     minute rule. All points of order against provisions in the      bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the      bill foramendment the Committee shall rise and report the      bill to the House with such amendments as may have been      adopted. The previousquestion shall be considered as ordered      on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without      intervening motion exceptone motion to recommit with or      without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and      reports that it has come to noresolution on the bill, then on      the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after      the third daily order of businessunder clause 1 of rule XIV,      resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       7.Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.371.                                  ____         The Vote onthe Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a specialrule, is not merely a procedural vote. A      vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against      the Republican majorityagenda and a vote to allow the      Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should bedebating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on      theprevious question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made bythe Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before theCannon cites the Speaker's ruling of      January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain thedemand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. OnMarch 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a memberof the opposition rose to a      parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon(R-Illinois) said: ``The      previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New      York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked thegentleman to yield to      him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``thevote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and]has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to      theRepublican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135).Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible toamend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, thesame result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . When the      motion for the previous question isdefeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member,because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler'sProcedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to orderthe previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment andfurther debate.''      (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ``Upon      rejection of the motion for the previous question ona      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question,who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previousquestion on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose theRepublican majority's      agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

This legislation does not permanently change the law nor does it diminish the founding principle of civilian control of ourmilitary. In fact, this rule allows for consideration of legislation providing for a one-time exemption that does exactly theopposite. It reinforces the doctrine of civilian control of our military. By setting into motion this unique procedure, thepeople's elected representatives are taking the seriousness of this circumstance to heart, to debate and carefully weighgranting a historic exception, only provided on one other occasion in our history.  The man at the center of this matter demonstrates the extraordinary nature of the situation we currently face. General Mattis has served our Nation with unparalleled distinction over the past 40-plus years. Born in Pullman, Washington, GeneralMattis grew up in my congressional district, the Fourth District of the State of He attended what was then ColumbiaHigh School, now Richland High, and graduated from Central Washington  It was growing up along the banks of the Columbia River in Richland where General Mattis' parents instilled in him a deeppassion for reading, which then developed into a renowned lifelong devotion to intellectualism, military and world history, andthe study of war.  General Mattis has been in command at increasing levels throughout his career within the United States Marine Corps, wherehe began as a student enrolled in ROTC, rose to the rank of general, and served as commander of the United States CentralCommand responsible for American military operations in the Middle East, Northeast Africa, and Central Few individualscommand the respect and admiration General Mattis has earned amongst the troops, national security experts, and military andcivic leaders.  This rule allows for the consideration of legislation to provide the United States Senate its proper role of advice andconsent regarding the nomination of General Mattis to serve as our next Secretary of                              {time}  0945  I urge my colleagues to support this rule so the Senate can rightfully provide its constitutional guidance, which I amconfident will overwhelmingly support this distinguished leader and public servant from the great State of  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

14019,topic-id,955,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman for the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying bills.  I start by, again, mentioning the fact that we have before us, under this rule, H.238, the Commodity End-User Relief Act,and H.78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability I will talk about them in a minute.  There are 56 Members of this body who are new Members and who had no chance to participate in marking up[[Page H318]]these billsin their committees of jurisdiction. Sure, I am back and Mr.Newhouse is back, but 56 people who were in that Congress inDecember are not here now, and there are 56 new people.  Again, a regular order process would allow these bills to go through committee and have ideas and the participation fromDemocrats and Republicans, who represent, collectively, tens of millions of people in this country, in improving these bills. Wedid not allow it. These bills just appeared fait accompli in the Rules Committee yesterday. Here we are on the floor. None ofthe new Members had a chance in their committees to offer them.                              {time}  1245  In fact, I am not sure where the Republicans are in their process, but Democrats are still finalizing our committeeassignments. We have some of them, and the rest will be completed shortly.  For Congress to work well, we need to have regular order. And for regular order to work, we need to make sure that the 56new Members who represent tens of millions of people are not disenfranchised in this process.  Now, getting to the bills. H.238, the Commodities End-User Relief Act, has been brought to the floor even before theAgriculture Committee convened or held its organizing meeting. It reauthorizes the Commodities Futures Trading Commissionthrough 2021. It makes a lot of changes to internal changes and modifies a number of provisions that were designed to preventfinancial meltdowns.  Additionally, H.238 includes language on issues that the Commodities Futures Trading Commission has already addressedthrough its own efforts. For example, the Commodities Future Trading Commission has acted on 16 of 22 provisions in titles I andParticularly, many of us are concerned by the cross-border language in the bill, which would undercut efforts alreadyunderway by the Commission to negotiate an international system of safe and robust derivative rules.  H.238 would actually require the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to create a rule that would automatically allowU.banks and foreign banks conducting business in the U.to do so under the rules imposed by foreign jurisdictions, whichcan be substantially different than those of our own, removing the confidence in the marketplace that is needed for a commoditymarket to work.  Finally, as you know, Congress passed a number of reforms to enable regulators to respond quickly to changing markets. Theprovisions in title II would weaken the CFTC's ability to respond in a timely and effective manner.  The financial services industry continues to innovate. It is important that regulators keep pace and prevent systemic risks,prevent meltdowns, prevent bailouts. This bill would make it harder to do that.  An example of how the Commission is engaged with and talking about innovation is how to fully embrace emerging technologieslike blockchain and decentralized distribution ledgers. They are doing that because many financial firms are focusing on how toincorporate this technology into their business models. Therefore, it is imperative the Commission is given the ability to stayinvolved and understand the implications of new technology and innovations and is not hamstrung by this overly prescriptive law.  Now, the Commission does need reauthorization, and I would love the opportunity to work with my colleagues on the other sideto do so. It should be in a thoughtful, bipartisan manner that gives the agency the ability it needs to effectively look atincredibly complicated financial transactions, make sure that consumers and users of commodities that hedge their risks are notabused in the process. We do not want to hamstring the agency by unnecessary and counterproductive requirements as this billdoes.  The other bill, H.78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act, also was brought forward before the Financial ServicesCommittee got organized. This bill was not even considered by the House last Congress, and it stalled in the Financial So you actually have a bill that didn't even clear committee last I was complaining about how the 56Members that are new to this body didn't have a chance to put their imprint on the first bill. The second bill didn't even makeit through the Financial Services Committee and didn't even pass the House floor last session. Yet, here it is without theappropriate committee consideration, depriving new Members representing tens of millions of Americans--Democratic andRepublican--the ability to improve this bill.  Under the guise of regulation changes, H.78 would actually require the SEC to conduct enhanced cost-benefit analysis inorder to ensure that benefits of their regulation justify the cost. In effect, the bill directs the SEC to look at things likemarket liquidity and small businesses, which, of course, it already does as part of its economic analysis. So, again, it is abill that would bury the SEC in regulatory paperwork.  H.78's cost-benefit analysis is weighted toward helping large financial institutions save money. I support reducing costsfor financial institutions. Who wouldn't? But that is not the primary drive of our regulatory structure. We should put consumersand our systemic risks first and foremost and, of course, where we can reduce the unnecessary costs for our financialinstitutions in the hope that those would be passed along to those they serve.

14164,topic-id,268,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This bill expands the Fort Frederica National Monument to include a 20-acre property, known as the North Marsh, currently owned by the Simons Land The National Park Service evaluated the property in a 2014 study and determined that its acquisition would provide additional opportunities to protect and interpret resources that are associated with the site.  Fort Frederica, which is located on Simons Island, Georgia, was built by James Oglethorpe in 1736 to protect the Colony of Georgia from Spanish The National Park Service has managed the fort since 1936 when President Franklin Roosevelt used the Antiquities Act to designate the site as a national monument. This bill is an important reminder of how a decision to protect and elevate our shared national heritage resonates generation after generation.  Here we are today, 80 years after President Roosevelt made the decision to establish a national monument, and we are looking at a terrific opportunity to expand it and increase the resources it protects. By using money from the Land and Water Conservation Fund--a Federal program that wasn't yet around in President FDR's time and of which I fought hard to reauthorize in this body--we can continue this important legacy. It is good to highlight the work of the Land and Water Conservation Fund as we pass this bill with regard to a national monument that has been with us for 80 years.[[Page H988]]  I thank the majority for advancing this bill, and I look forward to working with them to advance similar legislation.

My friends on the other side of the aisle did not want to have a full debate on the merits ofthese nominees in committee, so they should be prepared to do so on the Senate floor.

If ever there were a group of Cabinet nominees who cry out for rigorous scrutiny, it is thisone. I have never heard such a parade of potential ethical violations.

14199,topic-id,337,"I thank my colleague for yielding me the time.  Mr.Speaker, it is unconscionable to me that the majority is prioritizing a repeal of the Affordable Care Act as its toppriority for the 115th Congress as the Nation's infrastructure crumbles and as the cost of education continues to skyrocket. Itis particularly outrageous that this budget puts the wheels in motion, as my colleague has said, for a repeal of the healthcarelaw without there being anything to take its place.  This budget would also increase our Nation's debt by $9.5 trillion over the next 10 years. Apparently the party that hastried to claim the mantle of balanced budgets for years doesn't really care about fiscal responsibility.  It is the first step toward defunding Planned Parenthood, which serves 2.5 million patients--men and women--across the countryevery year and provides preventative care, like birth control and cancer screenings. It seems to me, for the majority of myadult life, I have been trying to defend Planned The excuse given that the community health centers can pick up theslack is so enormously wrong that the community health centers are scared to death that they are going to be asked to try topick up that slack of 2.5 million patients. That is absolutely a cover for something that doesn't make any sense at all.  I was shocked to read a study over the summer that found that the rate of pregnancy-related deaths in the State of Texas,since they did away with Planned Parenthood, seems to have doubled since 2010, making Texas one of the most dangerous places inthe world to have a baby.  What was happening in Texas during this time?  The State legislature was not only making cuts to family planning clinics where many low-income women received the onlymedical care they got, but the State was absolutely refusing to expand its Medicaid program, which would have given lower incomewomen desperately needed access to prenatal services.

14131,topic-id,521,"Mr.Speaker, at its heart, this rule is about one thing. It is about taking power away from local officials, including local BLM officials, and moving that power to Washington, D.C., to faceless bureaucrats who sit in cubicles here in this city and make decisions that have enormous impacts upon families and upon individuals. In many cases, these bureaucrats have never been to the States, and may never be.  There is a county in my district that is 97 percent controlled by the Federal I have two counties that are 90 percent controlled by the Federal So many of the decisions that are made that impact these counties and these families are made in Washington rather than at the local level. That is what we are here today to talk about: this egregious consolidation and power by D.bureaucrats.  The Bureau of Land Management's final rule is exactly that--a snapshot of everything that is wrong with the previous administration. The rule is so flawed that a couple of administrative[[Page H1038]]fixes simply won't fix it. It has to be repealed.  The previous rule was on the book for decades. This rule was introduced and finalized in less than a year. Thousands of comments were intended to fix flawed reasoning in the rule. State and county commissioners' comments were largely ignored. Let's remember, those State and county commissioners represent the people. They understand the needs of the people.  Once again, 2.0 moves all of that decisionmaking out of the local office and back here to Washington, D.These D.bureaucrats don't have the on-the-ground knowledge of the situation; they don't know the land, they don't know the needs of the county, and they don't know the people.  That is not the only instance of diluting local voices. Planning 2.0 also undercuts the involvement of counties and other local government agencies by inviting distant voices to the planning table who would steer resource management plans away from multiple use early on in the planning process. This is a 180-degree turn from previous planning regulations.  Not only did 2.0 dilute local control, it also dilutes real local impacts. Let me explain what that means. When you look at local impacts instead of looking at the actual communities around where these decisions are being made, they can look out very broadly.  In my case, you look at a national park in They can look at the impacts of that and say, well, this has had a positive benefit, but that is because they may be looking at a community that is 100 miles away. They may be looking at  Why not look at Las Vegas? Why not look at Los Angeles and say, Oh, those communities are doing fine; the local economic impacts have been positive?  It is not a fair reflection of what is happening to the local communities. Once again, the local people, the local families.  While many lauded the BLM for giving this planning process an update--and I am glad that it did; it was necessary--they fell short of delivering a final rule that helps people.

Speaker Knudsen, thank you for doing your part to honor      this tradition.       But first, I would like to take a moment and thank the men      and women who have made our country the leader of the free      world for so many generations: our veterans. Would all of the      fine folks who served our country please stand to be      recognized. Thank you for your service to our country. As the      incoming Ranking Member of the VA Committee, I promise we do      not take our responsibility to you lightly. Whether it is      getting the Southwest Vets Home in Butte built or holding the      VA accountable for long wait times, we will work together to      do right by our veterans.       As a citizen legislature, we have veterans, farmers,      teachers, and small business men and women. And for 90 days      or so, you come to Helena to represent your district, vote      your conscience, and make Montana proud. Our state's founders      knew that whether you are a rancher from Bloomfield or a      teacher from Helena, for these 90 days, your priority would      be to your constituents and our great state. Despite our      differences, we have a common goal, to ensure Montana      continues to be the Last Best Place for generations to come.       We know Montana is already a great place. With Glacier and      Yellowstone National Parks, world-class hunting and fishing,      and the best agriculture products in the world, folks from      all over come to our state to experience a little slice of      the paradise we get to call home. From Sidney to Regis      and everywhere in between, Montana is full of the hardest      working people in the nation.       I hope to work with you to create good paying jobs across      Today I will present a thoughtful, common sense,      Montana-focused plan to strengthen our economy and create      high paying jobs. I am calling it Employ Employ      Montana will rebuild our infrastructure, create a marketplace      for our products, pave the way for innovation, invest in our      workforce, and responsibly develop our resources. This will      let folks know Montana is open for business.       But in order to compete in a global marketplace Montana      needs more than scenery and a dedicated workforce. My first      objective, as part of Employ Montana, is to invest in our      infrastructure. Together, we can ensure that folks have an      infrastructure that allows them to get to work during the      week and to play on the weekend and that businesses big and      small can get their products to market.       That's why I worked to pass a long-term highway bill that      ensures Montanans gets more bang for their buck. Thanks to      the highway bill, for every dollar that hardworking Montanans      contribute to the federal Highway Trust Fund, our state gets      about two-and-a-half bucks back. This year, that's about $424      million for our roads, bridges, and highways.       But we only get that funding if the state agrees to put up      a certain amount as well. The Governor provided a temporary      fix that ensures we get that funding this year. But this is      still a systemic issue that we must address in the future.      Montanans need you to ensure the tens of millions of dollars      that Montana families pay into the Highway Trust Fund are not      sent to New York, California, or Alabama instead. Our      construction workers, contractors, and middle class families      cannot afford to see money left on the table because their      politicians can't agree. I've seen this body rise to the      challenge time and time again and I know you will not      disappoint.       Montana's infrastructure needs go beyond our bridges,      streets, and water systems. That's why Employ Montana will      also prepare our state for the 21st Century economy by      ensuring responsible investments in rural broadband. In 2015,      the second phase of the Connect America Fund delivered nearly      $100 million to two broadband companies that serve I      want to see that money resulting in fiber being laid down      across this state as soon as possible. That's why I plan to      hold CenturyLink and Frontier's feet to the fire and find out      what progress they are making. We've invested in them, and it      is time to find out what kind of return we are receiving.       Strong connectivity across Montana will attract businesses      to our state and allow our Montana made companies to market      their product worldwide--companies like Kracklin Kamut, a      healthy wheat-based snack food. I am pleased to have Thomas      joined by his wife Heather and daughter Grace who just moved      to Big Sandy to work for Kracklin An innovative start-     up like Kracklin Kamut brought Thomas and his family to Big      Sandy to work, and with stronger broadband, Kracklin Kamut      can be sold even in the biggest markets, which could bring      more jobs and more families to the community.       In Montana, we know that, whether it's snack food or      textiles, we make a superior product and we are proud to see      ``Made in America'' slapped on the label. It is time that we      make sure our taxpayer dollars are being used to support      American workers, not lining the pockets of foreign      corporations.       Through my Employ Montana plan, I will introduce the Berry      Amendment Extension Act, which would require the Department      of Homeland Security to purchase their supplies from American      companies. I think of Bozeman's own Mystery Ranch, which      could provide the folks on the border with their quality      multi-purpose backpacks. This is a common sense solution that      will create jobs here in Montana and keep our taxpayer      dollars within our own borders. Whether Montanans produce      backpacks, airplane parts, beef, or wheat, we are competing      in a global marketplace.       President-elect Trump and I agree: we need to ensure      America has fair trade, not free trade. And as part of my      Employ Montana plan, I look forward to working with the      President-elect to develop trade policies that ensure Montana      producers get a fair shake while protecting American workers.       My friends from the forested counties can agree: it's time      to negotiate a new softwood lumber agreement. I will work      with the new Administration to create a fair, effective, and      sustainable softwood lumber agreement. This will help our      timber industry get the certainty they need to responsibly      cut trees and help get our mills back to work.       Our timber industry is not the only one suffering from      unfair trade practices. Farmers across Montana continue to      feel the consequence of unfair wheat grading by the Canadian      government. There is many a company that gets stopped at the      border because of unfair trade practices. Montana farmers      produce the best product. To see it immediately downgraded to      feed grade at the border is unacceptable. I'll do my part,      and I want the Trump administration to do their part to      ensure Montana farmers can be competitive in the global      marketplace. This will create a strong market for Montana's      farmers, putting more money into the hands of our farmers,      more money that they can spend on Montana products.       I believe the best way to create jobs is to build an      economy that empowers innovators. Often times, creative      Montanans lack the access to capital in order to start their      business. A large part of my Employ Montana plan is dedicated      to ensuring Montana innovators have access to capital and the      means to develop private partnerships. Programs like the      Small Business Innovation Research Program provide grant      money to companies to help them get off the ground.       I am pleased to have one of those innovators, Stan Abel, of      SiteOne Therapeutics, in the gallery today joined by his wife      Stan saw the opioid crisis ravaging our country and      worked with scientist to try and find a better, less      addictive, way to manage pain. With the help of SBIR grants      Stan was able to get his business started and went on to      secure private investment from Montana's first successful      Venture Capital firm Next SiteOne will continue to      grow and employ more and more people in Montana because of      Stan's ability to see a problem and think of an innovative      solution to solve that problem. A Montana business supported      by Montana capital makes SiteOne a model for our state and we      need to look to spread their success statewide. With      increased SBIR grants, we will have more innovators like Stan      leading the way.       Small business grants are only one piece of the puzzle. The      next part of my Employ Montana plan is to cut red tape and      increase access to capital for community banks. I am pleased      to have Bob Nystuen and his wife Kim in the gallery today as      well. Bob is President of Glacier Bank in       Bob has worked for community banks from Miles City to      Kalispell, and he tells me that Montana is bursting with new      ideas and ripe for a growing business climate. But our      community banks are hampered by regulation that was meant to      police the big guys, not the small credit unions and      community banks that serve rural America and Main All      you have to do is spend five minutes with Bob to understand      the differences between him and a Wall Street banker. As a      member of the Banking Committee, I will work with Democrats      and Republicans to provide responsible reforms to Dodd-Frank,      to cut red tape for Bob and other Montana banks that are the      cornerstone of our rural communities. With regulatory relief,      our businesses will have better access to capital and be able      to invest in their product, hire more workers, and expand      their markets.       Luckily, for our businesses, Montana's workforce is second      to none. My Employ Montana plan includes lean and mean      investment in our workforce, an investment that is designed      to meet the needs of the community.       In the gallery today, we have Mike Robbins, the Chairman of      the Board of Montana Precision Montana Precision      Products builds components for GE This company      needs welders and has plans to hire 80 to 100 people by 2020.       And that's why they've partnered with the Anaconda Job      Corps to build a skilled pipeline of employees. The Employ      Montana plan proposes to boost our Job Corps programs in      order to meet the needs of Montana businesses. So folks like      Ray Ryan, the Site Manager for Anaconda Job Corps, can train[[Page S393]]     up the next generation of skilled workers, workers like Megan      Widmer and Katie These two young ladies are active in      the Anaconda Job Corps and they are here today with I      want to thank them for their dedication to       With additional resources, we can ensure the Anaconda Job      Corps and programs like it expand, create good paying jobs,      and meet the needs of local industry with well-trained local      workers.       But these types of community partnerships should not just      be limited to Job Corps--we need to look at our education      system and ensure it is creating a workforce that meets      Montana's needs. Our two-year colleges are the key. That's      why as part of Employ Montana, we need to give our community      colleges the resources they need to develop the talent our      employers are asking for. Because of our investment in      education, a kid from Columbia Falls can go down to Flathead      Community College, join its culinary program, and start a      restaurant in And a young woman from Terry can      travel southwest to Miles City Community College, enroll in      its Commercial Driver's License course, and learn to drive an      18-wheeler hauling grain up to the Port of We can      work together to build on the success of our community      colleges and expand our job training programs so that our      workforce is ready to answer the call. Investing in our      education is an investment in Montana's future.       Developing our human resources is critically important to a      strong economy. But in Montana we have an incredible supply      of natural resources as well. Included in Employ Montana is a      plan to responsibly develop an all-of-the-above energy      strategy. I plan to introduce the Carbon Capture Utilization      and Storage Act, which will incentivize investment in the use      of carbon capture technology. This legislation will provide      tax credits to allow for Montana companies to burn coal      cleaner and create good paying jobs.       But we can't ignore the fact that our climate is changing.      This isn't a tree hugging issue; it's a jobs issue, and it's      a food security issue. Montana's number one industry,      agriculture, will lose profits and be more dependent on the      federal government to pay the bills if we don't start taking      proactive steps to protect our clean air and water. This is      Montana's Constitutional right.       So I hope you will join me in supporting Employ      From stronger infrastructure, to better broadband, increased      start up grants and access to capital. From strengthening      workforce programs and tapping our energy economy--Employ      Montana will create high paying jobs and an economy we are      proud of.       Now I would be remiss if I didn't take the last few minutes      to talk about health care. It's a pressing issue and one that      both Congress and the Montana Legislature will have to      grapple with. Thanks to your good work last session Montana      expanded Medicaid to over 60,000 hardworking people. For the      first time in their lives these people were able to afford      health coverage, you should be commended for that.       Repeal and replace. Repeal and            Here are the facts: The health care industry accounts for      over 52,000 jobs in Health care in Montana is a $4      billion industry. If Congress repeals the Affordable Care      Act: Coverage would be ripped away from the 60,000 folks you      gave hope to just two years ago. Montana's economy would lose      $3.1 Billion--with a capital ``B''--between 2019 and 2023. It      would add $350 Billion to the deficit. We would lose 8,200      jobs in 2019 alone. And rural areas would feel it the most,      hospitals in towns like Culbertson, Hamilton, and my home      town of Big Sandy would potentially have to board up their      doors. Working together to fix the Affordable Care Act is      just good business.       I've been around the state and the message is clear: People      don't want Congress taking away their health care. Right now      we have an incredible opportunity to find bipartisan      solutions that can make health care more affordable for      middle class families. But instead of having that important      conversation, Congress is on the cusp of repealing all the      progress we've made.       I want to be clear. I know premiums are rising. We cannot      settle for any situation where middle class families cannot      afford health insurance. I know that. But let's work together      to keep the accountability up, and the costs down. Repealing      the ACA without a plan for what comes next will not lower      costs. Our families' health care is too important to throw it      into chaos. We need to look before we leap. And we can't      throw the baby out with the bath water. We need to be working      to provide affordability to families and certainty to the      rural communities that rely on our hospitals. I know we can      find common ground to deliver that to       In Montana, there is far more that unites us than divides      us. We can all agree that Montana raises the best agriculture      products in the world. We can all agree that on a summer      afternoon we'd rather be on the river than cooped up in an      office. And we can all agree that Montana is home to the      hardest working men and women in the world. We owe it to      these hardworking men and women to come together to build a      stronger       Together, we can build stronger roads and bridges. We can      build a 21st Century infrastructure. We can build the quality      products to supply folks at home and abroad. We can build a      business friendly environment that encourages innovation and      investment. We can build a more efficient workforce to meet      the needs of our changing economy. We can build an energy      sector that doesn't mortgage our future for today's profits.      We can build a health care system that works for everyone,      not just big insurance or drug companies. And we can build a      stronger, better Montana for our next generation.       Good luck in the coming weeks.       God bless you, God bless Montana, and God bless this great      country.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgS391-2.txt,1829,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 78, SEC REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY",2017.0,23.0,February
14113,topic-id,428,"Mr.Speaker, the Bureau of Land Management manages 245 million acres, or nearly 10 percent of the total area of the United States, and a whopping 700 million acres of mineral estate. Nearly all of this acreage is in our Western States, which makes it imperative that the agency extensively cooperate with the State and local governments during the planning process.  It is true that the BLM's new planning rule, Planning 2.0, included revisions to several aspects of the planning process, some of which seemed to make some good sense.  Unfortunately, the new rule also introduced a significant measure of confusion regarding how planning areas would be determined, and, most distressingly, diminished the historic and valued role that State and local governments play throughout the process.  In many of the counties in my district, it is not uncommon for the public lands to make up well over half of the total area. For these communities, having an equal seat at the planning table isn't merely a luxury. It is an essential ingredient to ensuring that our way of life is proudly maintained over many generations and is not extinguished.  Because of this, the BLM is required by law to consult and to coordinate with State and local governments and maintain consistency across their management plans and policies. Yet, the agency's new planning rule envisioned weakening that partnership in several regards. For one, the agency intends to dismiss consistency requirements with anything other than the officially approved and adopted plans. This not only places an undue burden on rural communities who likely do not have the resources available to draft and maintain comprehensive plans, but significantly lessens the importance of an array of other policies and agreements that are germane to the planning process.  The importance of a State Governor's review of a Federal management plan is also reduced, as it appears to limit input only to the identification of inconsistencies with State and local plans, but precludes formal input and observations regarding other aspects of the plan.  Americans the Nation over treasure our public lands and thoroughly enjoy our ability to be able to access them. But it cannot be denied that, in many of our communities, decisions made by Federal Land Management agencies like the BLM have amplified the impact. No planning process revision should weaken the voices of our communities as Planning 2.0 would do.  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I applaud the efforts of my colleague out of Wyoming for her efforts on this and urge passage of this resolution.

14115,topic-id,380,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution which would do away with the new procedures established under BLM Planning 2.0.  Planning 2.0 encourages, at its foundation, early and frequent public input. By rolling back this planning effort, public input--in particular, tribal input--will be removed.  Federally recognized tribes have the right to engage in government-to-government consultation, and, under Planning 2.0, tribal rights to participate in the planning process are clearly enumerated and protected.  By introducing the resolution we are considering today, the majority is making clear it doesn't value tribal input in the development of BLM's resource management plans. In this updated planning process, the BLM worked hard to ensure government-to-government consultation was accomplished. Tribes were encouraged to submit comments through the formal comment period and through government-to-government consultation. But BLM recognizes the hard work of tribes and has been inclusive of tribal concerns.  In fact, BLM has recognized the quality and value that tribes' traditional ecological knowledge brings to planning efforts. It is important to incorporate this information to avoid resource conflicts and to protect hunting and fishing grounds.  In many areas, the BLM and tribes actually have to manage resources together. How can they do this when tribes are not invited to be a part of the consultation process? By including government-to-government consultation early in the planning process, all taxpayers benefit in the long run because we can develop a stronger plan that doesn't end up in court being litigated.  We want BLM to be an agency that actively embraces the people who live on and use the land they manage. By formalizing the tribal consultation role and recognizing the value tribes bring to the planning process as Planning 2.0 does, the BLM is taking important steps to fully engage with all their constituents.  Land management is about looking at the bigger picture, and tribes understand that more than anyone. They deserve to be recognized in the planning process, and Planning 2.0 does that.  Repealing this rule through the CRA is shortsighted and wrongheaded. BLM[[Page H1035]]Planning 2.0 allows for the very kind of oversight and public input my Republican colleagues claim to want, and helps avoid the costly court battles they complain about.  I urge my colleagues to vote against this measure and keep Planning 2.0 in place.  ",CREC-2017-02-07-pt1-PgH1032.txt,2231,FORT FREDERICA NATIONAL MONUMENT BOUNDARY EXPANSION ACT,2017.0,7.0,February
14108,topic-id,506,"Mr.Speaker, last week, the Republican majority pushed through legislation attacking clean air, clean water, and blocking public transparency into payments made to foreign governments by oil and mining companies.  Today we are considering legislation that will roll back opportunities for the American people to have a say in how our Nation's public lands are managed. The idea that there should be national public lands that belong to and are managed on behalf of the American people is a value that dates back to the founding of our country and is embedded in our  Generation after generation of Americans has endorsed the idea that our public lands should be managed to balance many competing uses: recreation, responsible economic development, sustainable resource extraction, renewable energy, military purposes, and conservation of historic American landscapes, just to name a few.  We all want to see this important aspect of our national heritage managed in an effective and efficient manner, balancing conservation for future generations with sustainable productivity for local communities.  The Bureau of Land Management's Planning 2.0, as it is known, will help us better achieve this balance on the approximately 245 million acres of land managed by the As American citizens, we all have a right to provide input on how we would like to see these public lands managed; but the current process for doing so is slow, lacks transparency, and fails to incorporate over 30 years of updated science and understanding of our changing climate. In fact, this process hasn't been substantially updated since the Reagan administration. States, local governments, and other stakeholders all agreed that the process was in need of updates.  BLM agreed with this consensus and began a 2-year review, receiving over 3,000 public comments on what changes needed to be made. Two years, 3,000 public comments, this was no midnight regulation. Their final product, which the resolution before us today would permanently overturn, increases transparency, enhances the role of science and decisionmaking, and strengthens the role of the public's voice earlier in this planning process.                              {time}  1400  Planning 2.0 also upholds the Federal Land Policy and Management Act's commitment to States, local government, and tribes in land management decisions.  The Bureau of Land Management made several changes in between the draft rule and the final rule to clarify coordination requirements and promote consistency with local land use plans, all in response to concerns raised through the public input process.  According to a BLM fact sheet on the final rule, ``The new rule does not change the special relationship and opportunities provided by statute for cooperating agencies,'' and, ``The final rule establishes several new opportunities for coordination between the BLM and our government partners.''  We should be working together on proposals that strengthen management of our public lands, balance conservation with economic development, and provide sustainable benefits to the people who rely on them for their economic livelihoods. The resolution before us today flies in the face of these goals.  I urge my colleagues to reject this Congressional Review Act resolution and vote ``no.''

14066,topic-id,1675,"Mr.President, I know several Members are ready to come here and talk on a veterans issue, and they will let me know when they are ready to start. I thought there might be a good chance to get this in.  Our democracy is under attack. U.intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russian Government interfered in the U.Presidential election and intervened to help Candidate Around the same time, Candidate Trump began making flattering statements about Russian President Putin and proposing pro-Russia policy changes while criticizing longstanding U.allies, including in  President Trump continues to defend Putin and offend Western allies. Now we have come to learn that there are unexplained ties between the President, his campaign staff, his associates, and Russia; that many close to the President had meetings and telephone calls with Russian officials during the campaign and the transition; most critically, that the FBI and the Department of Justice are investigating whether the President and his associates coordinated or conspired with the Russian Government to interfere with the Presidential election--an investigation that began last July and is likely to continue for months.  The President and his associates keep giving the American people reason for worry--inaccurate denials, evasive answers, explosive attacks they can't back up, scheming with the chair of the House Intelligence Committee on the committee's investigation of the White New, very disturbing information comes to light every day.  A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll showed that two thirds of Americans believe a special prosecutor should be appointed. The American people want answers. What was the scope of the interference? Who knew what, and when? How can we protect ourselves and our allies, who are facing similar cyber attacks? What is the appropriate government response to such an attack?  I appreciate the work the Senate Intelligence Committee is doing. I believe that is the first step, but I believe we must go further. That is why I am again calling for an independent, bipartisan national commission modeled on the 9/11 Commission to fully investigate Russia's interference with our election and our election processes and to investigate the ties between the President, his family businesses, and his close associates and Russia that may threaten our national security. I am also again calling on the Department of Justice to appoint a special counsel to investigate potential criminal conduct that may jeopardize our security.  Questions about the President's ties to Russia will divide the country, undermine his Presidency, and distract Congress, unless we take these steps. The American people are right to be concerned. The President's stance on Russia is perplexing, starting when he first denounced the role of NATO last spring, calling it ``obsolete,'' suggesting that it would be OK if NATO broke up. Then, he publicly asked Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails.  Then, Mr.Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was forced to resign because of his close political and financial ties to Ukraine's former pro-Russian He became the subject of a multi-agency investigation. We don't have the full story, but we do know that he failed to register as a foreign agent while he lobbied for pro-Russian Ukrainian interests in the United It appears that Manafort has a $10 million contract with a Russian oligarch who is very close to Putin that would ``greatly benefit the Putin Government'' and that he had at least 15 offshore bank accounts in Cyprus that even Cypriot bank officials thought were suspicious. Once those bank officials began asking about money laundering activities, Manafort closed the accounts rather than answer questions.  During his campaign, Mr.Trump stated that he would ``be looking at'' whether to recognize Crimea as Russian and to lift sanctions. President Trump and his team apparently took little or no interest in the debate over the party platform in the Republican National Convention, except for one thing--They intervened with delegates to get more Russia-friendly language in the Republican Party platform. Candidate Trump's national security policy staffer J.Gordon told CNN: ``This was the language Donald Trump himself wanted . . . and advocated for . . . back in March.'' Now Gordon is reportedly under investigation for his ties to  We have all heard the President compliment President Putin, calling him a strong leader. Why is the President so enamored, when Putin's actions are authoritarian, violent, and anti-democratic? Putin seeks to weaken NATO and the European He annexed Crimea in violation of international law and treaties. He interfered with our national election. Putin has crushed free press in the Russian Federation, placing restriction upon restriction on the press, quashing independent news organizations, and harassing and jailing journalists. The President's outspoken admiration is inexplicable.  So we are still left with a President who has expressed policy views toward Russia that run counter to U.ideals and treaty obligations, as well as global norms of international affairs. While we don't know the full extent of the President's financial, personal, and political ties to Russia and Putin, we have plenty of reason to seek an impartial investigation. The President still has not released his tax returns, unlike any previous modern His son Donald Junior volunteered, as far as[[Page S2141]]back as 2008, that ``Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. . . . We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.''  In 2013, Mr.Trump said on a talk show: ``Well, I've done a lot of business with the Russians.''  Due to his history of bankruptcies, no major U.bank would loan to Donald Trump in recent years. So he has needed new sources of capital for his real estate projects. There is growing reason to believe that Russia--or at least wealthy Russians--have financial interests in the Trump organization. Recent reports link the President and his companies to ten wealthy former Soviet businessmen with alleged ties to criminal organizations or money laundering. The extent of corruption and criminal ties among the oligarchs of Russia are well known, and to stay wealthy oligarchs, they must stay friendly with the Putin regime.  Is the Trump organization reliant on Russian capital or loans from Russian banks? What relationships are there between Russian oligarchs that are tied to the Russian Government and the Trump organization and between those former Soviet businessmen and Trump's properties? We need to get to the bottom of this, with a credible, deliberate, nonpartisan investigation.  Mr.Trump has surrounded himself with associates with close Russian ties--not just Mr.Michael Flynn headed to Russia within 18 months after his retirement as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Russian Government's media outlet Secretary John Kerry called RT a ``propaganda bullhorn'' for Mr.Flynn was paid for that trip by RT, a potential violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution, and appeared regularly on Flynn, of course, had to resign as National Security Advisor after 24 days in office. But the President knew of Flynn's misrepresentations weeks before he was fired and did nothing until it became public. We now know that Russia's payments to Flynn were generous. In 2015, Russian entities paid him $65,000. We know he worked for pay as a foreign agent for Turkey during the campaign and during the transition, but he failed to register as an agent at the time, as required by law.  Other Trump associates and campaign staff--Roger Stone, Carter Page, and Mr.Gordon--all are reportedly under investigation for intercepted communications and financial transactions with Stone admitted at least 16 contacts with Gufficer 2.0, the Twitter handle covering for Russian intelligence that released the Democratic National Committee hacked emails.  Page, who has strong financial ties with Russia, admitted to meeting with the Russian Ambassador during the Republican Convention and traveling to Russia during the campaign.  The President's Attorney General was forced to recuse himself from any Department of Justice investigation into Trump and Russia because he did not disclose to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he met with the Russian Ambassador during the campaign.  Now the President's son-in-law and senior adviser is set to testify before the Senate's Intelligence He will talk about his contacts with the Russian ambassador, a close Putin ally who is head of a Russian-owned bank.  Where does it stop, folks? Where does it stop?  These contacts give us enough reason for pause. Combined with Mr.Trump's positions on NATO, sanctions relief, and Russia's human rights violations, they raise serious security questions for the United States and As I said, we need an independent prosecutor at the helm to ensure that the whole of the investigation is not compromised--one who is not subject to White House pressure and not in a position of investigating his or her boss--and a bipartisan commission along the lines of the 9/11 Commission that is independent of politics.  The chair of the House Intelligence Committee is compromised and damaged beyond repair. He has coordinated with the subjects of his committee's investigation, and he has completely lost credibility. I compliment my Senate colleagues who are working together on an investigation. But the Senate committee does not have the resources to fully investigate this, and the ranking Democrat on the committee agrees we need an independent investigation that could go further, that could be public, and could be transparent.  A former Acting Director of the CIA called the Russian interference in our election one of the most successful covert operations in history. Former Vice President Cheney has said that what they did could be ``considered an act of war.'' By covert interference in a U.election, Russia pursued a policy to install its favorite candidate as President of the United Yet the President has dismissed the National Security Agency findings, accused our national security agencies of acting like Nazi Germany, and leveled fake charges at the former  The American people are not fooled, and they want Congress to get to the bottom of this.

14125,topic-id,340,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, after serving on a school board, in my State legislature, and now in Congress, I have witnessed firsthand that government works better when it is closest to the people. That is why I rise today in support of H.44, which disapproves the Bureau of Land Management's 2.0 Planning rule.  I commend the gentlewoman from Wyoming for introducing this legislation on behalf of her constituents as[[Page H1037]]well as Americans all across the country that desire more effective government.  The Planning 2.0 rule will fundamentally change the way land management decisions are made, and I believe it will fundamentally change them for the worse. Planning 2.0 puts faith in a faraway, Washington-based one-size-fits-all approach to land management decisions.  BLM has a light footprint in my home State of Arkansas, but last year I had the opportunity to attend a field hearing in George, I saw firsthand the mismanagement by the BLM and how it impacts real people.  Individuals from Washington County, Utah, told our field hearing of the heavy-handed approach BLM takes toward local landowners in management decisions. Local officials talked about how BLM has also ignored the will of Congress by ensuring updated resource management plans decrease grazing permits or effectively stop the construction of roads that are authorized in Federal legislation. Land management changes should be made in a collaborative way, with ample State and local input.  Despite what some people may think, Congress and Congress' will still matters. Planning 2.0 marginalizes State and local officials in favor of unelected bureaucrats and special interests. By passing H.44, we will remind Federal agencies that they work for the people.  Mr.Speaker, we are not a people of the government, by the government, and for the government. We have a government that is supposed to be of the people, by the people, and for the people. The people's voice should be heard in major land management decisions. H.44 will make the BLM listen to their voice.  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

14143,topic-id,5284,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate your agreeing to be down here with me tonight. I came down to talk about health care, but I actually have a personal story I want to tell before that begins, right there in the middle of the realm of health care, a friend of mine back home in His name is Jon  Mr.Speaker, you have folks like Jon Richards in your district, people who just believe that, if only they work hard enough and long enough, they can make things better for their entire community. Jon is one of those folks. And what I love most about Jon is he looks for those things that other folks aren't doing.  You know, there are those folks back home. Everybody wants that glamorous job. Everybody wants to do that thing that comes with the perks or the fringe benefits. Jon Richards was attracted to those jobs that he knew would matter, that he knew needed to get done but other folks weren't filling those shoes.  Mr.Speaker, I tell you this about Jon because Jon was diagnosed with liver cancer; and as is always true when you have a friend get diagnosed with cancer, you believe that they are going to be better. I learned this week that Jon has been moved to hospice and isn't getting better.  Mr.Speaker, Jon was one of the first folks to give me even the time of day when I thought about seeking this opportunity to serve. Jon was the first person there every Saturday morning when breakfast was getting started for the Gwinnett County Republican Party, and he was the last one to leave when the Young Republicans down at the University of Georgia were finishing up.  It was young people that were his passion, Mr.Jon saw a Republican Party that he worried was going to become more closed. He worked to open it up. Jon saw a Republican Party that was getting grayer. He was working with young people who were our future. Jon saw a Republican Party that had an opportunity to make a difference, and he seized that opportunity every single day.  In 2014, Mr.Speaker, the entire State of Georgia, Georgia Republican Party, named Jon Richards the Volunteer of the Truth be told, he would have won that honor every single year, you just can't give it to somebody over and over again. I think Jon appreciated that.  If you go back and try to look for pictures of Jon so you can put a name with a face, Mr.Speaker, you are likely not to see too many. He was also the guy who had the camera around his neck taking pictures of everybody else, making sure that everybody else had something to remember the day by, making sure that everybody else was involved and appreciated, making sure everybody else was served.                              {time}  2115  I have known Jon Richards for a long time. I have never known him to do a single thing to benefit himself. Time and time and time again, he did the things that others wouldn't do. Time and time and time again, he would pull me aside and say: Rob, I know how we can be better together.  There is no replacement for Jon Richards--not in our county, not in our State, not in my life.  Mr.Speaker, I haven't had much experience saying good-bye to folks over the years. I have been extremely blessed in that way. But I hope that you will join me as you say your prayers tonight in praying for my friend in hospice, Jon Richards, and for his family as he enters what will be a very long weekend for him.  Mr.Speaker, Jon would be the first one to be standing outside these doors pushing us forward on healthcare reform, and he would be doing it because he sees the human condition that is affected by health care. He sees the families that have expectations, families to whom promises have been made, families to whom promises have been broken. And he knows that we can do better.  Mr.Speaker, what he and I would often sit and talk about is that there are challenges in this country that absolutely, positively have to be addressed. I have friends on the right, I have friends on the left, and I often believe that if we could just sit down in a room together, we would solve them if we could agree on what the problem was.  Mr.Speaker, I have a chart here. You can't see it from where you sit, but it shows you where America gets its healthcare coverage. I bring this up because that is the crux of the healthcare debate that we are having here. About 46 percent of Americans, Mr.Speaker, get their coverage from their employer. When the President was pushing the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010, he was talking about the uninsured Americans, and surely we can do more for those families who don't have access to health care. But 46 percent of Americans had access to health care, had it through their employer, were not seeking help or improvement, but in an effort to make a difference for the small percentage of Americans who are uninsured, the President and my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle chose to reregulate all health care across the country.  It wasn't just the lie of the year, as the newspaper PolitiFact called it, Pinocchios--if you like your doctor, you can keep it; if you like your doctor, you can keep it. It wasn't just that that promise was broken; it is that folks who weren't seeking any help at all got caught up in this net of a new Federal regulatory scheme.  Mr.Speaker, about 46 percent of Americans get their health insurance from their employer. About 17 percent of Americans are on We have got another 17 percent of Americans that are on Medicaid or CHIP or those safety net programs. Even here today, after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, 8 percent of Americans are uninsured. Now, we have folks who are in the exchanges--they are represented here--that is about 12.4 percent of the population. We have folks who are on Medicaid represented here; that is about 11.3 percent of the population. And we have folks who don't have any insurance at all.  Mr.Speaker, if we would come together to solve the problem for folks[[Page H2365]]who didn't have access to health care, I believe we could have found a solution together. Instead, what we tried to do was reregulate the entire healthcare system, even for all of the Americans who were perfectly happy with their care. And it didn't work.  You don't have to take my word for it, Mr.I can quote from my big newspaper back home in my district, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution: ``Aetna to pull out of Georgia's ObamaCare insurance marketplace.''  Many counties in Georgia now, Mr.Speaker, only have one insurer to choose from. Humana has announced it is pulling out.  Union Leader in New Hampshire: ``Another ACA failure Bad idea keeps getting worse.''  Over in Kaiser Health News in Arkansas: ``Largest U.Health Insurer Pulls Out of Health Exchanges in Georgia, Arkansas.''  From The Washington Post: ``Aetna chief executive says ObamaCare is in a `death spiral.' ''  And from the Courier-Tribune in North Carolina: ``Blue Cross projects $400 million loss in NC on ACA in just two years.''  Mr.Speaker, while we can argue about whether we correctly identified the problem to begin with, while we can argue about whether or not we crafted the right solution to begin with, what is undisputed is that the Affordable Care Act is failing, and it is taking American families down with it. That is not just the newspapers talking, Mr. I will quote from former President Barack In August of last year, he says: ``Despite this progress''--he is talking about the progress of the ACA--``too many Americans still strain to pay for their physician visits and prescriptions, cover their deductibles, or pay their monthly insurance bills; struggle to navigate a complex, sometimes bewildering system; and remain uninsured.''  Twenty million Americans remain uninsured. After all of the President's efforts, he still recognized in August of last year there was much more to be done because the efforts that he tried failed.  Governor Mark Dayton, a Democrat from Minnesota, in October of last year, he says: ``The reality is the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. . . . ''  The aspiration was that premiums would come down by $2,500, but the reality is that premiums were going up by double digits, and in some cases triple digits. The Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.  And former President Bill Clinton, in October of last year, Mr.Speaker, he said: ``So you've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It's the craziest thing in the world.''  There is a group of people, mostly small-business owners and employees, who make just a little too much money to qualify for Medicaid expansion or for the tax incentives who can't get affordable health insurance premiums in a lot of places.  Mr.Speaker, I don't believe health care is a partisan issue. Regulation and how we use it may be a partisan issue. Federal control of whether we should use it may be a partisan issue, but providing Americans access to health care is an American issue, and every one of these Democrats I have just cited recognize the failures of the current system. I don't say that, Mr.Speaker, to try to point the finger of blame. I say it because either we believe that everything is working just great and we should all pack our bags and head back home to the district, or we believe that there are American families in crisis that are calling on us to serve them.  You can't see this map, Mr.Speaker, but it shows some of that crisis. In just 1 year, from 2016 to 2017, Mr.Speaker, the number of counties in America that only have one insurer to choose from quintupled. I will say that again. In just 1 year, from 2016 to 2017, so severe is the death spiral of the exchanges across the country, the number of American counties that no longer have choices and are limited to a single insurer has increased 500 percent.  Mr.Speaker, the number of counties that only have one insurer is represented here in the color of orange. You see it in 2016, you see it in 2017. Five entire States, Mr.Speaker, in a healthcare system that was designed to provide consumers with choices, have no choice of insurer whatsoever. I say that because we have gotten wrapped around the political axle here, Mr.Speaker, as if somehow if you are on the Republican side of the aisle, you cannot recognize that the Affordable Care Act achieved any successes whatsoever, and if you are on the Democratic side of the aisle, you can't recognize that the Affordable Care Act has failed anyone in any way whatsoever. Both of those positions are nonsense.  I tell you that if you have spent a trillion dollars on this program--and you have--I hope a family has been helped. I know some families that have been helped. But I also know families that have been crushed. We need to repeal the Affordable Care Act for those families that have been crushed, and we need to replace the Affordable Care Act for those families that have been helped because that help is rapidly eroding.  Mr.Speaker, I want you to think about the thought, the idea that is the Affordable Care The idea is we are going to provide these choices, and then we are going to provide these government subsidies, and folks are going to have access to health care for the very first time. It is a wonderful idea: provide choice, provide support, provide access. The reality is, though, Mr.Speaker, with those choices, with those subsidies, with that offer of access, almost 20 million Americans said: Forget it, I am out.  Now, you remember this whole plan was put together where the IRS comes and fines you if you are out. So what began as an idea that said, ``We are going to provide you with choice, we are going to provide you with support, and that is going to get you your access,'' 20 million Americans have decided that plan has so failed them, they would rather pay the IRS a penalty to the tune of $4 billion last year--rather, pay the IRS a penalty than access the Affordable Care That is a failure. It is a failure.  Who is it failing most, Mr.Speaker?  If you look at those folks who are in this almost 20 million pool, 45 percent of them are age 35 or younger. I don't fall under the age category of 35 and under, Mr.Speaker, but I can tell you that folks who are 35 and under cost less to take care of than folks who are my age bracket and older. So if you are going to try to craft a national insurance system, you need these people who are 35 and under to be involved--enthusiastically involved. Rather than getting involved with the choices and with the subsidies to get the access, 20 million Americans have said: It is not for me. I will pay the fine instead.  Most of them young people. If we can't agree that that is a failure, Mr.Speaker, if we can't agree that the system can't stand in that way, we are going to have a tough time finding a solution.  What you heard so often today about the solution that is being proposed in this body is that older Americans are getting the toughest end of the deal. There is a little truth to that, Mr. What the Affordable Care Act did is it said you have young, healthy people; you have older people who are likely to be sicker. The law of the land at the time was that the cost spread between the youngest and the oldest could be 500 percent, 5 times more for the oldest, highest risk people than the youngest, lowest risk people.  Sure, it is insurance, right?  Older cars, different pricing than newer cars. Houses with sprinkler systems, different prices than houses without sprinkler systems. It is just actuarial experience.  But the Affordable Care Act says we are going to compress that from one to five, a 500 percent spread, down to one to three, a 300 percent spread. What that did was lower rates below the actuarial experience for older Americans--that was great for older Americans--and, at the same time, raise rates for younger Americans, which forced all the younger Americans out of the marketplace, which then raised rates for all  I will quote from Grace-Marie She is the president of the Galen She testified in front of the Committee on the Budget this year on[[Page H2366]]this issue. She said this, Mr.Speaker: `` . . . young people purchasing individual policies in or out of the exchanges are required to pay much more for their policies than their actuarially-expected costs because of the law's required 3:1 age rating band. Forcing the young to pay more drives costs up for everyone.  ``The average 64-year-old consumes six times as much health care, in dollar value, as the average 21-year-old.''                              {time}  2130  Insurance is about experience. There is a 1 in 100 chance of something bad happening to you, you pay 1 one-hundredth of the price of that bad episode, 100 of you get in the pool together, you share the risk.  Actuarially, a 64-year-old consumes six times more health care than a young person. But we compressed that to three times in terms of the billing.  Turner goes on to say this: ``Under the ACA's age-rating requirements, insurers cannot charge their oldest policyholders more than three times the price they charge their youngest customers.''  If every customer were to remain in the insurance market, this would have the net effect of increasing premiums for 21-year-olds by 75 percent, and reducing them for 64-year-olds by 13 percent. Now, think about this. This is the system that we have created.  If you can get the young people to stay in the system--which you cannot--the young people are paying rates 75 percent higher than they should so that older Americans can pay premiums 13 percent lower than they should. But we are losing all the young people because 77 percent is forcing these folks out. They are not dumb folks. They are making good choices about their own self-interests. If their insurance prices are too high, they reject the insurance.  An individual in my district, Mr.Speaker, from Buford, Georgia, wrote to me and said: Rob, I am a full-time student with a part-time job that doesn't offer health or dental insurance. I can't get health insurance through my parents because they are on I shop for health plans, but most are out of my budget. I shouldn't have to pay a fine if a healthcare plan is not in my budget. There should be alternatives to this plan. Please help.  Say young people don't want insurance. I don't believe that is true. I do think young people believe they are going to live forever and they are never going to get sick. But they do worry about that rainy day, forbid the thought, should something bad happen. But you can't buy a policy you can't afford, and we have priced these young people out of the marketplace.  When we price young people out of the marketplace, rates go up for everybody. When rates go up for everybody, more young people drop out of the marketplace. And that death spiral that Aetna's CEO recognized, grows faster and faster. Which brings us to the solution that we are working on here together.  I don't know what you thought of President Trump when you first met him, Mr.I don't know what you thought of the campaign and how things were going to transpire in these first 60 days of a new administration. But I think a lot of folks in my district imagined the President as a take-it-or-leave-it kind of guy, my-way-or-the-highway kind of guy. I think you would agree with me that nothing could be further from the truth in our experience.  This is what he tweeted out. As you know, that is our new method of communication here in Washington, D.This is what he tweeted out when this House dropped its healthcare bill. He said: ``Our wonderful new healthcare bill is now out for review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster--is imploding fast.''  It is out for review and negotiation. And those weren't just words, Mr.You have seen it. You have seen it going on this week. You have seen it going on even to the eleventh hour. The President has never said: My way or the highway. He has brought people in from every end of the political spectrum to work with them on their ideas, to work to see what we could do more for children, more for the near elderly, more for families, how do we get the incentives in the right place. Day in and day out, 16, 17, 20 hours a day, the President has been working to make this better.  I could not feel better about the process. I don't believe any particular party has a monopoly on good ideas. I don't believe any particular Member has a monopoly on good ideas. I believe we work best when we work collaboratively. And I am so proud of our President for embracing exactly that--the art of a deal.  Mr.Speaker, there are four main parts of our replacement plan, four main parts.  Number one, Medicaid reforms to allow States the freedom to run their own Medicaid programs.  I serve on the Rules Committee with Liz Cheney from I promise you, the rural nature in the low-population area of Wyoming means she needs a very different Medicaid program than the high-density, high-population area of metro Atlanta that I serve.  So often, the State programs dictated by the Federal Government lock States in to a one-size-fits-all solution. Or the States can come begging to Washington, D.C., for an exception or an exemption or a waiver. You shouldn't have to come beg Washington, D.C., to best serve your constituents, Mr.We give folks the flexibility to run these State-based programs to serve the most vulnerable of State populations.  Number two, a patient and State stability fund.  Mr.Speaker, the challenge at any insurance pool is what do you do with the sickest of the individuals in that pool. If I buy insurance today and I am not yet sick, well, now I am in the insurance pool and I am paying for whatever my actuarial risk is. But forbid the thought if somebody has already gotten sick, they have been fighting illness their entire life, they are trying to run their small business, and they show up to buy a new insurance policy, they have struggled mightily throughout my lifetime to get access to coverage.  Now, in 1996, President Bill Clinton and Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, right here on this very floor of the House, passed a bill that abolished preexisting conditions for every federally regulated plan. Those are the plans that the big companies use, like Coca-Cola, Home Depot, or All of those plans, those big employer-based plans, the Federal Government abolished preexisting conditions in those plans decades ago.  But States have moved a little bit slower. And the mechanism that many States are trying to use as high-risk pools to say that when folks find themselves ailing and trying to find insurance for the first time, perhaps they need a different kind of medical home, perhaps they need a different incentivize to get into the insurance pool. These high-risk pools are funded in order to make insurance available, accessible, and affordable for folks who have preexisting conditions and are outside the insurance pool today. We have got to get them on the inside. We provide money to do that.  Personal tax credits, Mr.Refundable, advanceable personal tax credits. What we say in this bill is, you don't have to pick a plan off of an ObamaCare exchange that isn't right for you and your family. You don't have to wait for the government to approve what your choices are. You can pick any plan, anywhere that serves your needs that you believe is best for your family. And if you are a middle-income or low-income American, we will help you defray the cost of that insurance policy.  Now, everybody has got skin in the game. There is no free lunch here, Mr.Everybody has to have skin in the game. We are putting people in charge of their own choices. But if you are a 63-year-old couple and your kids have left the house, we ask: Do you need to buy a policy that covers maternity care? Is it important to you that you have a policy that covers pediatric care? Or, because you are in that older American status, you are in that age bracket where the actuaries say you are likely to consume six times more health care dollarwise than young people do should you be able to pick and choose those benefits so that you get the policy that provides the best value for you and your family. These personal tax credits go to the individual, so the individual can make choices about what is best for them.[[Page H2367]]  And it creates health savings accounts. Oh, Mr.Speaker, I did not understand the economics of health care until I got my first medical savings account. I thought health care costs $50 a visit, because that is what my copay was.  When I got my first medical savings account, my insurer sent me a list. And they said: Rob, if you want to go to the doctor for a CT scan, you can go to this one down the road that charges $200, or you can go to this one down the road that charges $2,000. You just do whatever you think is best.  I went and looked last night, Mr.If you want to go in for a CT scan in Washington, D.C.--we have fabulous hospitals here--you can go to George Washington University right down the street here in Foggy Bottom, and if you have a United plan, the cost is going to be $1,500 for your CT scan. If instead of driving west to George Washington University, you drive north to Howard University, you can go to Howard University hospital and get the same CT scan for $200.  Mr.Speaker, I can't bring down health insurance costs unless I bring down healthcare costs. And I can't bring down healthcare costs unless we have transparency in healthcare pricing so that you and I and 300 million Americans become more active consumers of these products. Health savings accounts give us that opportunity.  But I can't solve all of our healthcare problems in one bill. And shame on this Congress for having created the expectations across a decade of stuffing giant bills through this body at one time, that we have come to set expectations that we can do everything for everybody in a single bill. We can't. And even if we could, we shouldn't. Taking issues one at a time leads to better legislating.  So we have a three-phase approach here, Mr. First, we are going to pass the American Health Care Act, which repeals the Affordable Care Act taxes and penalties, it replaces the mandates with policies that will stabilize markets and increase individual choices. We are going to do that tomorrow morning.  Then comes the administrative action: What can we do through the White House?  You will remember when they passed the Affordable Care Act, they delegated much of that authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Today, that Secretary is my good friend from across the river in Georgia, Tom So the second phase is for Tom Price to grab ahold of those dials that he has at Health and Human Services and make those changes that will encourage choice and lower prices, stabilize markets.  And then third, we are going to come back to this body, back to this floor, back to the United States Senate and pass stand-alone legislation that authorizes association health plans, that promotes competition in insurance, that deals with the IPAB repeal, and on and on. In fact, we have begun that this week, Mr. There are two legislative processes. There is the process where you can pass something in the Senate with 51 votes. That is called reconciliation. And there is the process where you have to deal with the filibuster in the That is for everything else.  Mr.Speaker, right now, we are still getting the rust out of the gears here in this body. There are lots of new Members here. We have got a chance to pass a bill tomorrow morning that can move through the Senate with 51 votes. But then we are going to be back.  Like I say, we have started this week. We have already passed, in a bipartisan way, legislation to increase competition in the insurance market and legislation to allow small businesses to band together so that they can provide better plans at lower costs to their constituents.  Mr.Speaker, there is some suggestion that fixing a failing ObamaCare, an ObamaCare that is in a death spiral, is somehow a partisan issue. Again, as I began, I said there are folks on the Republican side who sometimes say nothing good ever happened in ObamaCare and folks on the Democratic side who sometimes say nothing bad ever happened.  But the truth is, 20 different times, this Republican-controlled House passed bills that President Obama signed into law to fix problems in the Affordable Care Act--20 different times. One of the first bills I voted on when I came to Congress was one of those bills. The President signed it into law.  The Affordable Care Act--I don't need to go through the whole history with you, Mr.You remember. It was jammed through the Senate on Christmas It moved through the House on a Sunday night at midnight with no amendments and no changes. It was not ready for prime time. It needed these fixes. And even with these fixes, the death spiral continues.  But we needn't say to one another that collaborating to solve a failing ObamaCare system is anathema to what anyone believes. We have done it not once, not twice, but 20 times during the Obama Presidency alone.  Mr.Speaker, I will close with this tonight. It is a Kaiser Family Foundation study. They went to folks who have policies in the Affordable Care Act exchange system, and they said: Are you better off today than you were before the passage of the Affordable Care Act?  Again, these are folks who have enrolled in the Affordable Care  What they found is it is about 50/50. It is just this small red and green sliver, Mr.Speaker, of the entire healthcare market in this country, just this small sliver that enrolled in the Affordable Care Again, almost twice as many people rejected the Affordable Care Act, are paying penalties to the IRS, and are staying out of the system as got into the system. But of those people who got into the system, about 80 percent of which are receiving Federal subsidies to stay in the system, only about half said that they are better off today than they were before.  That is $1 trillion that we have spent--borrowed from our children and spent--to reform health care for 300 million Americans even though most Americans valued the plan they had, created a system where more Americans opted out and decided to pay a penalty than agreed to take the free health care that was being offered. And of those who agreed to take the health care, more than half of them believe things were better before.                              {time}  2145  Mr.Speaker, I will stipulate, if it is valuable, that folks who passed the Affordable Care Act before you and I got here were trying to do the best they could to serve their constituency the best they know how, but it didn't work. Insurers are leaving the plan. Families are losing their policies. Premiums are skyrocketing double and even triple digits annually.  We can do better. We can do better, and we have an opportunity to start that process tomorrow. I regret that even the word ``ObamaCare'' has become so toxic that it divides people even upon its mention. But families are being caught in that divide. Families are being caught in the political crossfire as we discuss this.  The President has said: Send me a bill because I want to put a stop to that uncertainty. I want to put a stop to that insecurity. I want to put the American healthcare system back on track.  We can do it together tomorrow.  America needs us to do it together tomorrow, and I hope that we will.  Mr.Speaker, thank you so much for agreeing to be here with me during this time tonight, and thank you for agreeing to keep my friend Jon Richards in your prayers as you lay your head down this evening.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-23-pt1-PgH2364-2.txt,2008,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF S. CON.

But there are times where moving expeditiously is required, and today is oneof those days.  You are not going to see a rule like this come very often because we are considering the FY17 budget resolution today.Historically, as you know, in this Chamber, when we get ready to consider budget resolutions, Mr.Speaker, we are consideringevery single one that any Member of Congress would have an opportunity to write. That process takes place every spring to meetthe statutory deadline of passing budgets by This is not that budget today, Mr. This is a budget, as you know, to move us forward on a reconciliation process to finish up the FY17 budget process, andrather than considering all the amendments that one might have to offer, we have made in order just one.

Mr.Speaker, when it comes to consideration of the measure to waive a statutory prohibition on naming a civilian Secretaryof Defense who has been out of the military for less than 7 years, we are also offering that under a closed rule today. Noamendments are going to be made in order. You may not know, Mr.Speaker, but that is the[[Page H478]]only statutory change that haspassed the United States Senate in 2017.  When we talk about having to move expeditiously, when we talk about whether or not we are going to have an open process or aclosed process, understand that while this body has passed dozens of statutory changes in just these first 9 days of legislativeactivity, the Senate has passed but one.

Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Woodall) for yielding me the customary 30minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I rise in very strong opposition to this restrictive rule, and I rise in strong oppositionto the underlying legislation.  Because of Republican in-fighting, Congress was unable to do one of its most basic jobs last year, passing a full budget forSo now House Republicans have brought this budget bill to the floor, but we all know that this is just a vehicle for themto repeal the Affordable Care Act and take away health care from millions and millions of  For nearly 7 years, my Republican friends have railed against the Affordable Care Their well-funded allies have spentbillions of dollars distorting the ACA and lying to the American people about what it actually does. And for nearly 7 yearsthere has not been a single comprehensive healthcare bill brought to the floor by Republicans as a replacement for theAffordable Care Not one.  We have voted over 60 times to repeal the ACA on the House floor. I will be the first to admit that ACA is not perfect, butrather than work together to tweak it or to make it better, all we get from them are repeal bills, repeal bills, repeal bills.Let me again point out that not once, not once, was there a replacement bill offered.  Not only do Republicans not have a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act and protect access to health care for more than20 million Americans who gained coverage, they can't even agree on a timeline for when they will pass their replacement.President-elect Trump says repeal and replace will be done on the same day, and he wants it to happen now. RepresentativeSteve Scalise said Republicans will replace the ACA over the course of the next fewmonths. Senator John Thune said it could take 2 or 3 years for the replacement to be implemented. Representative ChrisCollins said Republicans have 6 months to work out the replacement plan, and Senator Mitch McConnell refused to even givea timeline, just saying that it would happen.  Well, while the Republicans fight with each other over timelines, I think it is appropriate to ask: If they did have areplacement, what would that replacement be?  Well, President-elect Trump has the answer. When asked what we should replace ObamaCare with, he said: ``Somethingterrific.'' When pressed for further details, and more specificity, he said: ``Something that people will really, really, reallylike.''  Mr.Speaker, you can't make this stuff up. It would be laughable if it weren't so tragic. It is tragic because whatRepublicans are trying to do is take healthcare protections away from millions and millions of families.  Now, no one in this Congress has to worry about health care if the Affordable Care Act is repealed, and the Donald Trumps ofthe world certainly don't have to worry about health care if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. If someone in their familygets really sick, they will just sell some stocks or close down another American factory or not pay their workers, as ourPresident-elect has been known to do on many, many occasions.  But for millions of Americans, it will be a different story. Repealing the ACA would mean over 30 million Americans wouldlose coverage, including nearly 4 million children. More than 52 million individuals with preexisting conditions could havecoverage rescinded or see their premiums dramatically increased. Millions of young adults would be unable to stay on theirparents' plans until they are 26. Over 14 million individuals enrolled in Medicaid under the expansion would lose coverage, andnearly 140 million individuals with private insurance would lose access to preventive services without copays and deductibles.And millions of seniors would see their prescription drug prices increase because it would reopen the so-called doughnut holethat the ACA has begun to close.  Republicans want to slash Medicaid, a healthcare program that does a lot of good stuff and enables mothers to work their wayout of poverty by providing affordable coverage for their children. As someone who represents Massachusetts, this is especiallypersonal because Medicaid is one of the best tools we have in the fight against opioid addiction, providing real care for theaddiction and underlying conditions that drive the opioid epidemic in our communities. Repealing Medicaid expansion under theACA would rip coverage away from an estimated 1.6 million newly insured individuals with substance use disorders.  That is what is at stake, and that is what my Republican colleagues are so happy, giddy, and excited to do. It is sad. It ispathetic, but they are moving forward anyway with no replacement in sight. I suppose they can roll out their oldies but goodies,like health savings accounts or their other healthcare prescription, take two tax breaks and call me in the morning. But thatdoesn't do it.  Mr.Speaker, we have a complicated healthcare system, no doubt. I wish it were simpler. That is why I have always favored asingle-payer system and that is why I favored a public option. But the problem with our system before ObamaCare was that it leftall the decisions up to the insurance companies.  Do you remember the days when insurance companies could charge women more for health insurance because they said being awoman was a preexisting condition?  They can't do that anymore. Why? Not because of my Republican friends. They can't do it anymore because we passed the  This budget bill would also give Republicans a green light to defund Planned To my colleagues who are so anxiousto defund Planned Parenthood just to satisfy their rightwing base, let me ask: Have you ever visited a Planned Parenthoodclinic? Because if you had, you would understand why what you are doing is so wrong.                              {time}  0930  The fact is that Planned Parenthood plays a critical role in protecting and providing access to critical health services forboth women and men. One in five women has relied on a Planned Parenthood health center for care in her lifetime, and PlannedParenthood serves 2.7 million patients each year. One of the most important statistics that my Republican friends like to ignoreis that more than 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does nationally is preventive care, including cervical cancerscreenings, breast cancer screenings, and family planning, not abortion services.  Add to this fact that Planned Parenthood clinics are often one of the few affordable healthcare options available for manywomen. Nearly 80 percent of women using Planned Parenthood clinics have incomes at or below 150 percent of poverty. It is easyto see why a majority of Americans don't think Federal funding should be eliminated. In one recent poll, 63 percent of voters,[[Page H479]]including 72 percent of independents, do not agree with my Republican friends that Federal funding for Planned Parenthoodshould be eliminated.  In fact, we also heard very little about the consequences that defunding Planned Parenthood would have for families acrossthe country. One of the biggest myths perpetrated by Republicans is the idea that our Nation's community health centers, which Ilove and adore and respect, could suddenly pick up the slack if Planned Parenthood is defunded.  For the millions of low-income women who depend on Planned Parenthood clinics, defunding them would mean the loss ofaffordable and accessible contraceptive services and counseling, as well as breast and cervical cancer screenings. Simply put,for the many communities served by Planned Parenthood clinics, recklessly cutting funding would wipe out access to vital healthservices for the people who need them the most.  Let me make something very clear. Zero Federal dollars go towards the abortion services provided by Planned Parenthood--zero.The vast majority of funding that Planned Parenthood receives comes in the form of Medicaid reimbursements for preventive carethat they provide.  Mr.Speaker, it is a cruel thing to do, to take away people's health care. I will say to my Republican colleagues that theyneed to know that we are going to fight you every step of the way on this. There are some battles on behalf of the Americanpeople that are worth having and worth fighting, and this is one of them--making sure that their health care protections remainintact. I came to Congress to help people, not make their lives more miserable.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, let me comment briefly on the other piece of legislation in this rule, 84. General James Mattis hasbeen praised by both Democrats and Republicans, but there is very real concern about civilian control over the military, thelanguage of the underlying legislation, and the duties and responsibilities of the House of  General Mattis has a distinguished career, but we are talking about changing the law here. Approving a waiver for him toserve in the Cabinet so soon after his military service is a serious decision. It is so serious that such a waiver has happenedonly once before in the entire history of the United Now, we should debate this. Instead, the Trump transition teamcanceled General Mattis' testimony before the House Armed Services Committee and now expects us to vote for him willy-nillywithout us being able to ask him any questions.  Congress is supposed to be a check on the executive branch, but if the House is denied the opportunity to meet with andquestion the military officer who is nominated as our next Defense Secretary, how can we fulfill our duty and blindly just votefor him?  I would also say to my Republican friends, this is an early warning sign of the disregard that this new administration hasfor the House of General Mattis was willing to testify, but the Trump team said no. They said no to the Houseof Caving in on this issue will only mean continued disregard for the people's House in the future, and I thinkthat that is regrettable.  I reserve the balance of my time.

I am stilloptimistic, as it is a long year ahead of us.  What the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.Pocan) is suggesting, Mr.Speaker, is that we ensure the failure of SocialSecurity going forward. The only guaranteed benefit in Social Security is that it is guaranteed to fail. Those are not my words.These are the words of the actuaries who are in charge of protecting Social The nonpartisan actuaries who governSocial Security say that there is not enough money today to pay the benefits that folks are expecting. The law of the land, asit exists today, requires that, when that day comes, benefits will get cut dramatically. Only a 75 percent realization ofbenefits is what the law requires that befalls our senior citizens. If we pass the amendment that is suggested by my friend, wewould be prohibited from considering any solutions to that problem. Means testing, which my colleagues have advocated for years,is off the table under that scenario.  Mr.Speaker, to suggest that anyone on this side of the aisle wants to undermine the commitment that this country has madeto our seniors is ludicrous; but to suggest that I go to a 22-year-old, whose polling today suggests he or she believes they aremore likely to see a UFO in their lifetime than a Social Security check in their lifetime--to suggest that going to that 22-year-old and my thinking that maybe his retirement age would be a year or two higher thanhis great-grandparents' since he is now living decades longer--I will remind my colleagues we came together in a bipartisan wayto raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 in 1983, not because one of us hated seniors and one of us loved seniors, but becausewe all believed in our commitment to seniors.  Mr.Speaker, don't let the Record reflect anything other than that this budget resolution provides the framework tobegin this discussion, to begin the discussion of what comes next. There is not a single line of authorizing language in thisbudget resolution. Any suggestion that the law will change tomorrow because of this budget resolution is false.

I mean, that iswhat we are trying to prevent.  If you want to privatize Social Security, if you want to privatize Medicare and turn it into a voucher system, then standwith them. But if you want to protect these programs--and the vast majority of Americans--Democrats, Republicans, and Independentswant to protect the integrity of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--then oppose this budget.

I just don't understand why my colleagues would deny that folks who used to have care, now don't. Folks who used to haveaffordable plans, now don't.

The House heardfrom 181 witnesses, both Democrats and 239 amendments were considered in the three committeesof jurisdiction, and 121 of them were adopted.

The Senate Health Committee held 47 bipartisan hearings,roundtables, and walkthroughs on the healthcare reform bill.  So to say that this was not a thoughtful process is just wrong.  Compare that to the way this budget bill is being brought to the floor. There is no committee consideration, nodeliberation. It is just given to us. In fact, most of the committees aren't even organized yet in the House of  So there is a contrast there, and I stand with the way we approached the Affordable Care Act as opposed to the way theRepublicans have approached this budget deal.

Everything the gentleman from Massachusetts said was true, until the U.House abdicated any responsibility whatsoever andpassed exactly what the Senate did with no amendment whatsoever. All of the work product the gentleman talked about, all of thework that the gentleman talked about went for naught in this U.House of  To deny that this is not the bill that folks wanted to have crafted is to deny reality. To deny that this is not the billthat folks wanted to have crafted is to deny the nine different times the Republican House and Senate sent to the Presidentrepeals of ObamaCare, things that were so broken even the President couldn't live with it and he signed those repeals into law.  Mr.Speaker, I am not trying to denigrate any of the motives of my friends on the other side of the aisle. I just can'tunderstand, for the life of me, why they don't want to try to do better.  That pride of authorship, that arrogance, it has a real impact on the men and women that I serve, and I am asking my friendsto partner with me to help me fix it. But if they won't partner with me, I am going to move forward and fix it anyway.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We have been willing to work with our Republican friends to try to improve the Affordable Care Act for nearly 7 years. Theyhave been unwilling to work with us in a bipartisan way. Instead, they just want to repeal, repeal, repeal.  Now, I don't know what their motivation is. Maybe it is because they don't like President Judging from some of therhetoric that we have heard on this House floor over these years, I think some of the Members over there actually hate thePresident of the United States, and this is all driven by this personal animosity.  Let me just say to the gentleman that the Affordable Care Act may have started out with a different bill number, but thefacts remain that there were hundreds of hours of hearings on the Affordable Care Act, 181 witnesses testified; hundreds ofamendments were considered in committee.  The process of using a different bill number is very common in both In fact, the House Republicans have done itseveral times in the past 3 years. Regardless of the bill number, the work that went into forming this legislation was one ofthe most open processes in the history of the Congress, and it has resulted in providing protections and health care formillions and millions of people in this country. All of that is at risk with this budget resolution.  Mr.Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.Blumenauer).

14212,topic-id,507,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I am fond of telling folks back home, Mr.Speaker, when they tell me they know exactly what is going to happen over the next2 years, that I don't think they are telling me the truth. Because I confess to you, I have absolutely no idea what is comingover these next 2 years. I think these next 2 years are going to be unlike any we have seen in the history of self-governance inthis land; and, candidly, I am excited about that because the status quo isn't working for the 700,000 people that I represent.  I don't know what's going to happen over these next 2 years, but I believe that, for the first time, we are going to grapplewith some really, really, really hard problems that folks on both sides of the aisle have been ignoring for too long.  Mr.Speaker, I don't question the commitment of my friends on the other side of the aisle to the American people. I questionthe legislation that they use to deliver it. You heard my friend from Oklahoma talk about premiums going up 67 percent for hisconstituents. That is indefensible. It is not okay. We can do better, and, with the passage of this budget resolution, we willhave the tools to do that. I say again, the law will be the same tomorrow as it is today, but we will have the tools to grapplewith these problems.  Eight million Americans were so failed by the Affordable Care Act that they paid a tax penalty instead of accessing care.That is not okay. I don't believe a single Member on the other side of the aisle decided they just wanted to tax young peopleinstead of provide young people with quality care. This budget will give us the opportunity to have the tools to fix thatproblem.  Billions of dollars, Mr.Speaker, have gone into State-based co-ops that have failed, gone bankrupt, and terminated all oftheir plans which not only ripped health care out from under the American people, Mr.Speaker, but threw billions of dollarsaway in administrative costs at the same time. That is not okay. That is indefensible. We can do better. Passing this budgetresolution will give us those tools.  Mr.Speaker, I made a commitment in the Rules Committee last night to do everything I could to stop poisoning the well ofpublic discourse. Then I re-[[Page H488]]upped for the Rules Committee, and I realized that is going to be a tough promise to fulfill.We have difficult work to do, and we are passionate about the quality of that work.  But, Mr.Speaker, we all know the status quo has failed. We all know that we have the opportunity to deliver, and we allknow that a vote of ``yes'' on this budget resolution will give us more tools to deliver that success than we have today. Weneed to do this. We need to celebrate doing this.  Mr.Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the rule and support the two underlying measures that it will bring to thefloor.

14180,topic-id,813,"Mr.President, today I wish to commemorate the retirement of my friend Wayne  Wayne is retiring as my central Oregon field representative after more than two decades of outstanding service to our State--and more specifically serving at one point or another the residents of Baker, Crook, Deschutes, Gilliam, Grant, Harney, Hood River, Jefferson, Klamath, Lake, Malheur, Morrow, Sherman, Umatilla, Union, Wallowa, Wheeler, and Wasco  Suffice to say, Wayne knows everyone, and most of those folks could spend hours recounting their own tales of this quintessential public servant.  Simply put, he will be deeply missed.  But before Wayne takes his well-deserved retirement to his native New England--where he can be nearer to family and maintain closer supervision of his beloved Boston Red Sox and New England Patriots--I want to share my personal appreciation for this exemplary public servant, all-around good guy, and wonderfully avuncular curmudgeon.[[Page S2174]]  Wayne can forever lay claim to a significant piece of Oregon history. He opened Oregon's first Senate field office east of the Cascades shortly after I first took office in 1996.  Wayne opened and ran my eastern Oregon office in La Grande before moving to  In his service to Oregonians, he has put more miles than anybody I know on Oregon roads, at all hours, in all kinds of weather, to towns where there often are more cows than people.  Wayne's fierce sense of loyalty and commitment to public service has driven him to cover all the ground he has over the years from Wasco to Wagontire, Ontario to Olene, Joseph to John Day, Bend to Burns, Madras to Mitchell, and all points in between.  That loyalty extends to the rural communities he serves and the Oregonians in those communities who might not otherwise have a voice.  Wayne always keeps the door open for cattlemen, farmers, and countless others who often feel the government is removed from their struggles.  It is Wayne's ability to reach out and make connections with all of those folks that played such a large part in ensuring ``every nook and cranny'' in Oregon gets a voice.  Wayne is not just a champion in general for rural Oregon communities. He has also proven to be an able advocate for creating opportunities for rural women that allows them to bring their voices into statewide discussions.  Let me tell a couple of anecdotes about Wayne to provide a glimpse into this wonderful character--and all that he has meant to  For my colleagues who have not been to central and eastern Oregon, I would only note that the distances between towns can be great, but Wayne never let those long drives be a roadblock.  In fact, his goal was to be anywhere and everywhere. He achieved that goal by--I believe in his words--making sure that, if anybody was so much as dedicating a new soda machine, he would be there to put in the first dollar.  Just as great at times as the challenges of distance in his area are the weather challenges. Again, Wayne never let that be a roadblock.  I remember well flying into rural Condon, OR, for a townhall in the snow, and who should I see with the local police chief sweeping the runway of snow?  It has been said by some that there is an unbridgeable urban-rural divide in I know from more than 800 townhalls in every part of Oregon, that is untrue.  In fact, I have come to use the term ``the Oregon way'' to describe how it is in our State's DNA to put aside partisanship in favor of civil conversations to find the best solutions.  Among the many tributes in recent days in Oregon to my friend, I was struck by something I read about Wayne that captures how he ``lived and breathed'' the Oregon way.  On Wayne's Facebook page recently, a Republican posted this powerful praise: ``Had lunch today with a good friend. Politically, Wayne and I are polar opposites. He is a Democrat, an officer with the Oregon Democratic Party and staff member with Senator Wyden, and I have served on the Executive Committee of the Oregon Republican Party, as well as County Central Committee Over the years, we have had some great discussions, even disagreements about some very important issues, but we have handled our disagreements respectfully and remained friends. Wayne has announced his retirement and is also leaving our great state to move back east so he can be near family. The Oregon Democrats, and Senator Wyden are losing a tremendous asset, and a great leader of their Party.''  Oregon truly is losing a tremendous asset, and so am  I will miss Wayne tremendously, but I take heart that his work will live on in the issues he has resolved for Oregon and the relationships he has deepened among  As Wayne begins his well-earned retirement, he has my eternal gratitude, and he has Oregon's.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-03-pt1-PgS2173.txt,1247,TRIBUTE TO WAYNE KINNEY,2017.0,3.0,April
