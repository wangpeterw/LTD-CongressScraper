               CONGRESS NEEDS TO BEGIN WORK ON GUN SAFETY

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, many of us will be going home to our 
districts, facing constituents who will be asking the question: Why?
  It really is painful when fellow Americans lose their lives. It is 
painful as we watch our soldiers go off into battle, and many of them 
do not come home in any other way but as a fallen soldier.
  This past week, Americans, who were not in battle but were enjoying 
the life and the liberty of this Nation, fell by a murderous actor. I 
think we will have to go home and comfort our constituents, and we will 
also tell them what we are going to do.
  I don't know why we have to climb this high mountain of understanding 
that laws can make a difference; not end all violence, but make a 
difference: legislation that says that guns have to be locked to save 
the lives of children; gun legislation that deals with banning armor-
piercing bullets that would harm and injure our first responders; and 
then to get rid of the kits that this murderous individual utilized to 
make a semiautomatic an automatic.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask this Congress, together, to begin to do work on 
gun safety that will save American lives. I go home to my district to 
meet with my constituents, and I am going to tell them that I am going 
to do something that makes sense for the American people.
