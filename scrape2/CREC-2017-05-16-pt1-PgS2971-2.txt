                           FBI INVESTIGATION

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in a week full of revelation after 
revelation, on a day when we thought things couldn't get any worse, 
they have. I was shaken by the report in the New York Times that 
alleged that the President tried to shut down an active FBI 
investigation into a close political associate, and we are only 1 day 
removed from stunning allegations that the President may have divulged 
classified information to a known adversary.
  Concerns about our national security, the rule of law, the 
independence of our Nation's highest law enforcement agencies are 
mounting. The country is being tested in unprecedented ways.
  I say to all of my colleagues in the Senate: History is watching.
  I yield the floor.
