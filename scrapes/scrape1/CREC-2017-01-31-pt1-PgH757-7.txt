                           SPY CAR STUDY ACT

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, American families today 
are at an increased risk of cyber attacks. Additional reports of cyber 
vulnerability in cars threaten the safety of American families by 
allowing a hacker to access a vehicle and take control from the driver. 
Vehicle safety is of great importance to me because South Carolina is 
America's leading exporter of automobiles and tires, with BMW, soon 
Volvo, along with Michelin, Bridgestone, Continental, and Giti in 
Singapore.
  Last week, I was grateful to introduce the SPY Car Study Act of 2017 
with Congressman Ted Lieu of California. This bipartisan legislation 
directs government partners and private automobile manufacturers to 
conduct a study on the security and privacy threats to our motor 
vehicles.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops; and may the President, by his 
actions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on 
terrorism.
  President Donald Trump has taken positive action to vet refugees who 
ISIS has threatened to infiltrate so as to commit mass murder as they 
did in France and Germany.
