                 RECOGNIZING SERGEANT THOMAS REID, JR.

  (Mr. CHABOT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and thank Sergeant 
Thomas Reid, Jr., for his 45 years of service with the Cincinnati 
Police Department.
  A lot has changed since he joined the department back in 1972, after 
serving in Vietnam, but one thing has remained the same. For 4\1/2\ 
decades, Sergeant Reid continued to dedicate himself to keeping our 
community safe.
  During his time on the force, Sergeant Reid led by example and passed 
his knowledge and experience on to his fellow officers, often advising 
them to ``treat others as you want to be treated.''
  Sergeant Reid retired at the end of December as the Cincinnati Police 
Department's longest-serving member, and his leadership and guidance 
will be missed. The city of Cincinnati is a better place because of his 
service, and his legacy and impact will be felt in our community for 
years to come. For that, Mr. Speaker, we Cincinnatians are deeply 
grateful and indebted to him.
  Thank you, Sergeant Reid.
