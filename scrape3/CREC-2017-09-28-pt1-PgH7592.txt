                         SUPPORT THE DREAM ACT

  (Mrs. NAPOLITANO asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in calling 
for a vote on H.R. 3440, the clean Dream Act, a bipartisan, bicameral 
bill with 200 cosponsors in the House.
  It builds upon the great success of DACA, which opened the door for 
nearly 800,000 DREAMers who had come forward, passed background checks, 
and have been granted permission to live and work legally in America 
without fear of deportation.
  They kept their promise to the Nation they know and love, and our 
government must honor its commitment to protect them. The faith 
community and business leaders are imploring Congress to pass the Dream 
Act. Polling shows that the American people strongly believe and 
support the DREAMers. Eighty-six percent of Americans support a right 
to residency for undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United 
States as children, according to a recent ABC News/Washington Post 
poll.
  Mr. Speaker, as a proud nation of many immigrants from around the 
world, the Dream Act honors our history and our heritage. I thank my 
Republican colleagues who have signed on, and I urge all others to join 
us. It is the right thing to do for our young people, especially our 
country. Support H.R. 3440, the Dream Act.
