   CONGRATULATING TEXAS CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY'S MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM

  (Ms. GRANGER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Texas 
Christian University's men's basketball team on their National 
Invitational Tournament championship.
  After a 12-win season last year, the Horned Frogs showed the grit and 
tenacity my hometown of Fort Worth is known for. They finished the 
season with 24 wins.
  With their win over the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in the title game 
last week, the Horned Frogs capped off a memorable and historic 
comeback season. In fact, this 2017 NIT title is Texas Christian 
University's first postseason championship in school history.
  I want to recognize the TCU players and coaches for a job well done. 
Go Frogs.
