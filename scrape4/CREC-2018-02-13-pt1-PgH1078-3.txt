                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  As we meditate on all the blessings of life, we especially pray for 
the blessing of peace in our lives and in our world. May Your special 
blessings be upon the Members of this assembly as they return from a 
long weekend in their home districts. Give them wisdom and charity, 
that they might work together for the common good.
  May all that is done this day in the people's House be for Your 
greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
