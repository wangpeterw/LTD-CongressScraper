              CONGRATULATING HARLEY DREW ON HIS RETIREMENT

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend, the 
beloved Augusta radio host Harley Drew, on his recent retirement. He is 
one of the most successful and longest tenured radio personalities in 
the history of Georgia broadcasting.
  Harley was born at Fort Gordon, Georgia, and has always called 
Waynesboro, Georgia, home.
  He became interested in radio and electronics at the age of nine, and 
got a part-time job at WBRO in Waynesboro at the age of 14, where he 
worked full time after graduating from high school.
  Harley moved to Augusta in 1962 to help put WFNL on the air. I can 
remember in my high school days listening to ``Handsome Harley Drew'' 
on WBBQ, as he was known for playing the all-time best oldies.
  He is also a past recipient of Augusta's Best Radio Personality award 
from Augusta Magazine, was given the Louis Harris Award by the West 
Augusta Rotary, and has received numerous State and national awards for 
programming excellence.
  Harley was a founding board member of the Georgia Radio Hall of Fame 
and also served as its vice president. In honor of his career 
achievements, he was inducted into the Georgia Radio Hall of Fame in 
2011.
  Harley anchored Augusta's morning news on WGAC until his retirement 
last Friday, September 29, 2017.
  Harley, congratulations on a remarkable career.
