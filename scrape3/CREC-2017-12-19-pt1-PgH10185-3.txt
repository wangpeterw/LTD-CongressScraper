         CELEBRATING 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF JACKSON HEALTH SYSTEM

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to celebrate 
the 100th anniversary of Jackson Health System.
  Jackson Memorial Hospital first opened its doors in south Florida a 
century ago as a 13-bed community hospital. In the years since, Jackson 
has grown to become one of the Nation's largest and most renowned 
public hospital systems.
  But, throughout the many periods of growth and expansion, Jackson has 
remained true to its core mission: to build and improve the health of 
our community by providing the best possible care for Miami's 
residents.
  Mr. Speaker, by caring for those most in need, Jackson Health System 
has created a solid foundation that has empowered our families to 
thrive.
  Congratulations to their leader, Carlos Migoya, and all of the staff 
of Jackson Health System on a century of excellence and care to our 
community. I thank them for continuing to serve as stewards of 
Jackson's legacy and for continuing to use healthcare to improve 
people's lives and to help shape their bright futures.
