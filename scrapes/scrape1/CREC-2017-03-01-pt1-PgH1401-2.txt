                NATIONAL EATING DISORDERS AWARENESS WEEK

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as we observe National Eating 
Disorders Awareness Week, I urge our south Florida community to attend 
the Alliance for Eating Disorders Awareness Walk this Saturday, March 
4, at Tradewinds Park. The walk will celebrate everybody's shape and 
also encourage screening for eating disorders.
  Eating disorders impact millions of Americans and has a proportionate 
impact on teens and young adults. That is why, Mr. Speaker, I have led 
bipartisan legislation that urges the Federal Trade Commission to 
uphold its duty to protect the next generation by promoting fair and 
responsible advertisements, especially for products geared for children 
and teens.
  I was so proud that last year we were able to enact into law the Anna 
Westin Act, which I introduced with my colleague Ted Deutch, in order 
to allow an avenue for millions of young Americans impacted by eating 
disorders to seek the help that they need.
  Let's celebrate and commemorate Eating Disorders Awareness Week, and 
I encourage everyone to help spread awareness and promote authentic 
healthy body images.
