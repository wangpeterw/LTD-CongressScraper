                        NATIONAL AGRICULTURE DAY

  (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, President Trump has declared today to be 
National Agriculture Day, a time of celebration and gratefulness to our 
Nation's farmers and ranchers. Whether we realize it or not, 
agriculture is a part of all of our daily lives from morning until 
night. In fact, each American farmer feeds over 144 people, providing 
vital nutrition, and helping us better connect with our God-given 
resources.
  Every $1 of United States agricultural products and food exports 
creates another $1.27 in business activity. Our country's agricultural 
exports are valued at more than $100 billion, including $4 billion from 
my own home State of Florida. Every $1 billion in exports supports 
approximately 8,000 American jobs. That is over 8 million jobs created 
by agriculture.
  While celebrations such as these mark tremendous achievements for 
U.S. agriculture, we must continue to construct policies that supports 
and strengthens all of our farmers and ranchers. As lawmakers, let us 
make this celebration a time of action and work towards initiatives 
that continually uplift our ag industry.
