                     OUR CHILDREN ARE NOT FOR SALE

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, sitting a mere 20 feet away from the 
man that raped and trafficked her daughter, Jennifer waited anxiously 
in the courtroom as the judge prepared to announce the sentence.
  The amount of pain and turmoil this criminal inflicted on her family 
could never be undone.
  A few years ago, this man pulled up alongside Jennifer's daughter as 
she walked down the street. He lured the 15-year-old into his car, and 
he sexually assaulted her. He then took her to a motel and began 
forcing her to have sex with numerous men for money. He posted an ad 
about her online offering buyers a chance to ``play with innocence.'' 
He literally stole her youth, her happiness, and he sold her to the 
highest bidder.
  When Jennifer finally heard the judge's sentence, she wept with tears 
of joy--180 years in prison for the trafficker, from the right-thinking 
judge.
  Let the word get out to deviants and traffickers and buyers: Our 
children are not for sale. There is a price to pay for the trafficker 
who sells our kids.
  And that is just the way it is.
