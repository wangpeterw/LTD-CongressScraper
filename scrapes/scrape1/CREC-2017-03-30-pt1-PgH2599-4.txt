            By Mr. BISHOP of Utah:
        H.R. 1800.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution provides 
     Congress with the authority and responsibility to ``provide 
     for the common Defense and general Welfare of the United 
     States,'' and to ``promote progress of Science.'' This 
     measure will help ensure that public lands already in use for 
     important scientific and defense-based research will remain 
     available into the future to support those important public 
     purposes.
