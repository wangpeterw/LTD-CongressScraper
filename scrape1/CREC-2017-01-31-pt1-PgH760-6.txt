   PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD REMOVE STEVE BANNON FROM NATIONAL SECURITY 
                                COUNCIL

  (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on President 
Trump to remove Steve Bannon from the National Security Council.
  Mr. Speaker, the National Security Council was created in 1947, and 
it is

[[Page H761]]

designed to provide the President of the United States with diplomatic, 
military, intelligence, and economic information to coordinate, to 
plan, and to implement national security, and to make sound decisions 
affecting national security with input from professionals and not from 
political operatives. And the National Security Council has done that 
for seven decades.
  Yet, last week, the President issued an ill-conceived, dangerous, and 
unconstitutional executive order that bans Muslims. It puts Americans 
abroad, American communities at home, and American soldiers around the 
world at risk; and I believe that Steve Bannon, who might become a 
member of the National Security Council, was the architect of that 
executive order.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask President Trump, if he is not willing to remove 
Mr. Bannon from the White House, at least, for the safety of this 
country, remove him from the National Security Council.
