          DENY TERRORISTS THE RECRUITS OF THE NEXT GENERATION

  (Mr. KINZINGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, we woke up this morning to yet more 
horrific images of dozens of people killed by another chemical weapons 
attack in Syria.
  Mr. Speaker, this included children who were gasping for their last 
breath as they perished because of the brutal, murderous dictator 
Bashar al-Assad, who decided that chemical weapons would be used to 
extinguish their life.
  Mr. Speaker, for 6 years, we have failed in the Western world to 
address this horrific act. In fact, for the first time since World War 
II, we are accepting the use of chemical weapons as just a normal part 
of everyday life.
  Mr. Speaker, the Western world, the free world, needs to stand up, 
needs to make clear that Assad needs to go, and needs to stand up for 
humanity, lest we see these images again.
  We wonder how to defeat terrorism. Mr. Speaker, you do it by denying 
terrorists the recruits of the next generation, of which Bashar al-
Assad is creating many.
