                  CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW ACT RESOLUTIONS

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, the 
Senate will soon act to prevent workers from being forced into risky 
government-run savings plans. Then we will turn our attention to an 
additional opportunity to protect the American people from Executive 
overreach with another resolution under the Congressional Review Act.
  On its way out the door, the Obama administration issued a regulation 
that prohibited States from allocating certain health preventative-care 
funds in a way that best serves local communities. It substituted 
Washington's judgment for the needs of real people, controlling 
Americans' access to healthcare services while hurting the community 
health centers that so many Americans--especially women--depend upon. 
This regulation is an unnecessary restriction on States that know their 
residents' own needs a lot better than the Federal Government.
  Fortunately, by sending the CRA resolution before us to the 
President's desk, we can once again return power back to the people, 
and we will do so without decreasing funding for women's healthcare by 
a single penny.
  I would like to recognize my colleague, Senator Joni Ernst, who 
introduced the Senate companion to the House resolution we will vote 
on, for her leadership on this important issue. I look forward to 
supporting it later today.
