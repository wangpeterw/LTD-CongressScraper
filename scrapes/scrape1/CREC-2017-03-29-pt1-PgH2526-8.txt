                 DON'T SILENCE THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, it looks like my colleagues 
have wasted no time moving back to familiar territory after their 
healthcare disaster last week.
  Instead of fighting over how many people should lose health coverage, 
they decided that it is easier to unite around the shared cause of 
climate denial. This week President Trump announced plans to gut 
President Obama's landmark Clean Power Plan, and the House will vote on 
legislation to block the EPA from reviewing peer reviewed scientific 
research when forming regulations.
  So think about that for a second--the majority couldn't agree on how 
many people should lose healthcare coverage; so they are united around 
the shared cause of climate denial. The President likes to claim that 
climate change is a hoax created by the Chinese.
  Well, I know that the President and his party have developed a 
disdain for fact-checkers, but silencing the scientific community takes 
things to a whole new level.
  Mr. Speaker, I have to ask: Can my colleagues handle the truth?
