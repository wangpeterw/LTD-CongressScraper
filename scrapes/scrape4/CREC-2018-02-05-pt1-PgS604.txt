                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN BREWER

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize John Brewer 
and his excellent service as a part of our team. Going into my first 
term as Senator, I was proud to be the first Maryland Senator in almost 
100 years to serve in the Senate Agriculture Committee. Understanding 
the importance of this role, John hit the ground running as our USDA 
fellow. With his past experience in both public and private sectors, 
John leaned into every project, from advocating on behalf of land grant 
universities to funding nutrition programs, with great enthusiasm that 
stemmed from his dedication to serve the needs of Marylanders. Besides 
his vast expertise, we will miss his kindness and dedication. Although 
we wish we didn't have to give him back to the Department of 
Agriculture, my whole staff and I know he will continue to achieve 
great things.
