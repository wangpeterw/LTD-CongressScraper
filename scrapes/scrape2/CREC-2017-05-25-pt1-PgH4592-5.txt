                        REMEMBERING DR. AMY REED

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that we say 
good-bye to Dr. Amy Reed, a recognized physician, exemplary mother and 
wife, and dedicated patient advocate.
  Dr. Reed didn't ask for the situation she found herself in following 
a procedure in 2013, but it was immediately evident to anyone that met 
her--and her family--that she was going to be a fighter, not only for 
herself but for others.

  Through her loving husband's, Hooman's, campaign to bring awareness 
to the dangers of power morcellators, there is no doubt that women's 
lives around this country have been saved and device manufacturers and 
regulators have been forced to review their safety protocols and 
standards.
  This is Amy's gift, and we are eternally grateful. My thoughts and 
prayers are with her dedicated husband and partner, their six children, 
and her entire family. Let our community embrace them in their time of 
sorrow and vow to carry Amy's legacy and mission forward.
