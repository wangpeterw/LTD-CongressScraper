  MICHIGAN ON THE FOREFRONT OF AUTOMOTIVE AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION

  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight an exciting, new 
development that builds on Michigan's leadership in the auto industry.
  Earlier this week, General Motors and Honda announced a joint venture 
to produce an advanced hydrogen fuel cell system. With an investment of 
$85 million, this operation will bring new, good-paying jobs, and it 
will be based at a manufacturing facility in southeast Michigan. This 
is just the latest example of how Michigan continues to be on the 
forefront of automotive and technological innovation that has the 
potential to revolutionize the industry.
  Mr. Speaker, that is not all. A few weeks ago, GM also announced a 
plan to invest an additional $1 billion in United States manufacturing, 
which will create thousands of jobs for American workers.
  With our State's world-class workforce and commitment to cutting-edge 
research, Michigan will remain a global automotive leader for 
generations to come.
