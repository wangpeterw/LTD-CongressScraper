                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Wonderful God, Your promises are sure. Provide us with the will to be 
productive citizens of Your Kingdom. Fill our lawmakers with Your 
Spirit so that their ordered lives will provide evidence of Your power. 
Lord, give them a sure confidence in Your love and a faith to tackle 
the challenges of our time. May they grow daily in Your grace and in 
the knowledge of Your will for their lives. Help them to be humble, 
gentle, patient, and generous as they seek to do Your will on Earth, 
even as it is done in Heaven. Provide them with the wisdom to claim 
their true identity as Your children, who have Your image engraved upon 
their hearts.
  We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
