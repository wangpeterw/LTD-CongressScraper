                                 PRAYER

  Father Phillip Ganir, Gonzaga Jesuit Community, Washington, D.C., 
offered the following prayer:
  Compassionate God, source of all life, we thank You for the gift of 
the people we represent, for strength of mind and body, and for the 
blessing of freedom in our country.
  During these days for recess, a time when our work and rest meet us 
elsewhere, when many of our citizens mark religious holidays, and when 
the winter months give way to spring, send Your spirit to renew us, to 
help us learn from the history we inherited, to sustain the values 
which define our homeland, to work for a more just future, sensitive to 
the weakest among us.
  We pray with the hope that when we work for unity and peace, we see a 
little more heaven among us.
  Amen.
