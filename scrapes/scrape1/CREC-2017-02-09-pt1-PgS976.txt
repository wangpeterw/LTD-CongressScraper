                    SENATOR-DESIGNATE LUTHER STRANGE

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, of course the departure of one Senator 
typically heralds the arrival of a new one. Today is no different. I 
hope colleagues will join me in welcoming Alabama's newest Senator 
later today, Luther Strange, who will be sworn in this afternoon.
  You won't have much trouble finding him. He will be the tallest guy 
around here. Now, you would expect nothing different from a former 
college basketball player. Senator Thune and Senator Cotton last night 
were somewhat distressed by the notion that they would be replaced by 
an even taller Senator, and that will happen later today.
  Luther Strange, like the man who preceded him, is a devoted Eagle 
Scout. He shares his interest in the law too. He even argued 
successfully before the Supreme Court. It is notable experience to 
bring to any job, especially this one, and especially at a time when we 
are actively involved in the process of considering a new--and superbly 
qualified--nominee to the Court.
  We are looking forward to the contributions that Alabama's newest 
Senator will make. He will have the chance to get started right away. 
We have important work to do, and that starts with confirming more of 
the qualified Cabinet nominees who are before us.
