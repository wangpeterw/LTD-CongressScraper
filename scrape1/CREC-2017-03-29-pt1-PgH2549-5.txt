CHAIRMAN OF HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE SHOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND 
                             RECUSE HIMSELF

  (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I am someone who 
believes in this institution. So, Madam Speaker, this week, to me, has 
been an embarrassment. It is an embarrassment that we here in the House 
can't have a real, genuine bipartisan investigation by our Intelligence 
Committee.
  Fortunately, this afternoon, the chairman and ranking member--one 
Democrat and one Republican--of the Senate Intelligence Committee have 
signaled in a joint press conference that they are interested in having 
a real investigation.
  Wouldn't it be nice if the House of Representatives would do the 
same?
  Madam Speaker, it gives me no pleasure to say this, but the chairman 
of our House Intelligence Committee has acted in a way that makes a 
real

investigation in our House impossible. He should do the right thing and 
recuse himself, and this House should join the Senate in having a real 
investigation.
