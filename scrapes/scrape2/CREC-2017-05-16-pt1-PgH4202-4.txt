                                 PRAYER

  Dr. Bruce Hargrave, Bruce Hargrave Ministries and Charities, Rowlett, 
Texas, offered the following prayer:
  Almighty God, we thank You this day for the bountiful blessings You 
have poured out upon the peoples of the United States of America and to 
the men and women elected and assembled here today to serve the ``We 
the People.''
  Grant us, O God, Your grace, knowledge, and wisdom in the affairs 
that we will deliberate, debate, and vote upon. May the outcome of our 
endeavors be for the great benefit of the American people.
  Help these Members as Representatives of their various congressional 
districts be more than an elected Representative. Help each of them to 
be servant leaders guiding all of us to greater heights and 
achievements for all the American people.
  I ask all of this in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord.
  Amen.
