47,topic-id,161,"Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act, or the SCRUB  This legislation establishes a commission to review existing Federal regulations and report to Congress those that should be repealed to reduce unnecessary costs to the economy--kind of like a regulation report card.  Federal rules and regulations have sucked the life out of our small businesses for the last 8 years. Unlike some lawmakers, I have the unique experience of having operated a business under Obama-era rules and regulations. Let me tell you that it was very difficult. Our struggles were not an isolated event. Georgians and Americans across the country bore those same burdens.  We are ready for growth and innovation and an environment that encourages an economy like we have never seen before. The SCRUB Act is a solid step forward in restoring life to the American small-business community.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1403-4.txt,2239,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,1.0,March
45,topic-id,160,"Madam Speaker, we have a new era that has dawned on American politics. Our citizens are demanding that we don't conduct our business as usual.  These are times that call for bold leadership and bold action. Over the last couple of years, my observation is that we don't need new solutions. We have reforms for immigration, reforms for regulations, reforms for our Tax What we need is courage: courage to act, courage to keep our promises, as our President said last night, and finish what we started.  ObamaCare is a disaster, to repeat what the President said. The facts are undisputable. This isn't a situation where we have a leaky roof in need of repair. We are on faulty foundation, and it is shifting under our feet. If we don't act swiftly and decisively, the house will collapse.  Leadership is about courage. Leadership is about keeping our promises. We all owe it to the American people to act accordingly.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1403-3.txt,2350,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR--,2017.0,1.0,March
217,topic-id,205,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Doug Collins for leading this very Special Order on a topic that is very near and dear to my heart, the invaluable role of community pharmacists in our society.  As a rural dentist who practiced for 35 years, I can relate to the plight of community pharmacists who must overcome all of the challenges involved in running a small business while serving their patients and serving their customers and doing their job as a medical professional.[[Page H1451]]  Just like my small hometown of Woodville, Texas, where I practice, many of the areas in which community pharmacies are located are rural and have underserved, low-income and elderly populations. This can present unique challenges and, oftentimes, results in community pharmacists performing a lot of services, such as face-to-face counseling and planning services for patients' medication regimen at no charge, care that is uncompensated by Medicare and not typically reimbursed by private insurance companies as well.  What is even more challenging is the uphill battle that community pharmacists continually face in just getting adequate payment for the lifesaving medications that they dispense on a daily basis and still be able to earn a small profit.  Community pharmacists rely on pharmacy benefit managers, or PB",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1449-4.txt,2270,LEGISLATIVE SESSION,2017.0,1.0,March

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUSTAINING NATIONAL SPACE                          It is the sense of Congress that--[[Page H1554]]       (1) honoring current national space commitments and      building upon investments in space across successive      Administrations demonstrates clear continuity of purpose by      the United States, in collaboration with its international,      academic, and industry partners, to extend humanity's reach      into deep space, including cis-lunar space, the Moon, the      surface and moons of Mars, and beyond;       (2) NASA leaders can best leverage investments in the      United States space program by continuing to develop a      balanced portfolio for space exploration and space science,      including continued development of the Space Launch System,      Orion, Commercial Crew Program, space and planetary science      missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope, Wide-Field      Infrared Survey Telescope, and Europa mission, and ongoing      operations of the ISS and Commercial Resupply Services      Program;       (3) a national, government-led space program that builds on      current science and exploration programs, advances human      knowledge and capabilities, and opens the frontier beyond      Earth for ourselves, commercial enterprise, and science, and      with our international partners, is of critical importance to      our national destiny and to a future guided by United States      values and freedoms;       (4) continuity of purpose and effective execution of core      NASA programs are essential for efficient use of resources in      pursuit of timely and tangible accomplishments;       (5) NASA could improve its efficiency and effectiveness by      working with industry to streamline existing programs and      requirements, procurement practices, institutional footprint,      and bureaucracy while preserving effective program oversight,      accountability, and safety;       (6) it is imperative that the United States maintain and      enhance its leadership in space exploration and space      science, and continue to expand freedom and economic      opportunities in space for all Americans that are consistent      with the Constitution of the United States; and       (7) NASA should be a multi-mission space agency, and should      have a balanced and robust set of core missions in space      science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight      and exploration, and education.     202.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Returns on the Nation's investments in science,      technology, and exploration accrue over decades-long      timeframes, and a disruption of such investments could      prevent returns from being fully realized.       (2) Past challenges to the continuity of such investments,      particularly threats regarding the cancellation of authorized      programs with bipartisan and bicameral support, have      disrupted completion of major space systems thereby--       (A) impeding planning and pursuit of national objectives in      space science and human space exploration;       (B) placing such investments in space science and space      exploration at risk; and       (C) degrading the aerospace industrial base.       (3) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration      Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-155; 119      2895), National Aeronautics and Space Administration      Authorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-422; 122      4779), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration      Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.18301 et seq.) reflect a      broad, bipartisan agreement on the path forward for NASA's      core missions in science, space technology, aeronautics,      human space flight and exploration, and education, that      serves as the foundation for the policy updates by this       (4) Sufficient investment and maximum utilization of the      ISS and ISS National Laboratory with our international and      industry partners is--       (A) consistent with the goals and objectives of the United      States space program; and       (B) imperative to continuing United States global      leadership in human space exploration, science, research,      technology development, and education opportunities that      contribute to development of the next generation of American      scientists, engineers, and leaders, and to creating the      opportunity for economic development of low-Earth orbit.       (5) NASA has made measurable progress in the development      and testing of the Space Launch System and Orion exploration      systems with the near-term objectives of the initial      integrated test flight and launch in 2018, a human mission in      2021, and continued missions with an annual cadence in cis-     lunar space and eventually to the surface of       (6) The Commercial Crew Program has made measurable      progress toward reestablishing the capability to launch      United States government astronauts from United States soil      into low-Earth orbit by the end of 2018.       (7) The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, in its 2015 Annual      Report, urged continuity of purpose noting concerns over the      potential for cost overruns and schedule slips that could      accompany significant changes to core NASA programs.    TITLE III--MAXIMIZING UTILIZATION OF THE ISS AND LOW-EARTH ORBIT     301. OPERATION OF THE       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) after 15 years of continuous human presence in low-     Earth orbit, the ISS continues to overcome challenges and      operate safely;       (2) the ISS is a unique testbed for future space      exploration systems development, including long-duration      space travel;       (3) the expansion of partnerships, scientific research, and      commercial applications of the ISS is essential to ensuring      the greatest return on investments made by the United States      and its international space partners in the development,      assembly, and operations of that unique facility;       (4) utilization of the ISS will sustain United States      leadership and progress in human space exploration by--       (A) facilitating the commercialization and economic      development of low-Earth orbit;       (B) serving as a testbed for technologies and a platform      for scientific research and development; and       (C) serving as an orbital facility enabling research upon--       (i) the health, well-being, and performance of humans in      space; and       (ii) the development of in-space systems enabling human      space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit; and       (5) the ISS provides a platform for fundamental,      microgravity, discovery-based space life and physical      sciences research that is critical for enabling space      exploration, protecting humans in space, increasing pathways      for commercial space development that depend on advances in      basic research, and contributes to advancing science,      technology, engineering, and mathematics research.       (b) Objectives.--The primary objectives of the ISS program      shall be--       (1) to achieve the long term goal and objectives under      section 202 of the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.18312);      and       (2) to pursue a research program that advances knowledge      and provides other benefits to the       (c) Continuation of the ISS.--Section 501 of the National      Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of      2010 (42 U.S.18351) is amended to read as follows:     ``501. CONTINUATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE       ``(a) Policy of the United States.--It shall be the policy      of the United States, in consultation with its international      partners in the ISS program, to support full and complete      utilization of the ISS through at least 2024.       ``(b) NASA Action.--In furtherance of the policy set forth      in subsection (a), NASA shall--       ``(1) pursue international, commercial, and      intragovernmental means to maximize ISS logistics supply,      maintenance, and operational capabilities, reduce risks to      ISS systems sustainability, and offset and minimize United      States operations costs relating to the ISS;       ``(2) utilize, to the extent practicable, the ISS for the      development of capabilities and technologies needed for the      future of human space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit; and       ``(3) utilize, if practical and cost effective, the ISS for      Science Mission Directorate missions in low-Earth orbit.''.     302. TRANSPORTATION TO       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that reliance on foreign      carriers for United States crew transfer is unacceptable, and      the Nation's human space flight program must acquire the      capability to launch United States government astronauts on      vehicles using United States rockets from United States soil      as soon as is safe, reliable, and affordable to do so.       (b) Sense of Congress on Commercial Crew Program and      Commercial Resupply Services Program.--It is the sense of      Congress that--       (1) once developed and certified to meet the      Administration's safety and reliability requirements, United      States commercially provided crew transportation systems can      serve as the primary means of transporting United States      government astronauts and international partner astronauts to      and from the ISS and serving as ISS crew rescue vehicles;       (2) previous budgetary assumptions used by the      Administration in its planning for the Commercial Crew      Program assumed significantly higher funding levels than were      authorized and appropriated by Congress;       (3) credibility in the Administration's budgetary estimates      for the Commercial Crew Program can be enhanced by an      independently developed cost estimate;       (4) such credibility in budgetary estimates is an important      factor in understanding program risk;       (5) United States access to low-Earth orbit is paramount to      the continued success of the ISS and ISS National Laboratory;       (6) a stable and successful Commercial Resupply Services      Program and Commercial Crew Program are critical to ensuring      timely provisioning of the ISS and to reestablishing the      capability to launch United States government astronauts from      United States soil into orbit, ending reliance upon Russian      transport of United States government astronauts to the ISS      which has not been possible since the retirement of the Space      Shuttle program in 2011;       (7) NASA should build upon the success of the Commercial      Orbital Transportation Services Program and Commercial      Resupply Services Program that have allowed private sector      companies to partner with NASA to[[Page H1555]]     deliver cargo and scientific experiments to the ISS since      2012;       (8) the 21st Century Launch Complex Program has enabled      significant modernization and infrastructure improvements at      launch sites across the United States to support NASA's      Commercial Resupply Services Program and other civil and      commercial space flight missions; and       (9) the 21st Century Launch Complex Program should be      continued in a manner that leverages State and private      investments to achieve the goals of that program.       (c) Reaffirmation.--Congress reaffirms--       (1) its commitment to the use of a commercially developed,      private sector launch and delivery system to the ISS for crew      missions as expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-155;      119 2895), the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration Authorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-422;      122 4779), and the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.18301 et      seq.); and       (2) the requirement under section 50111(b)(1)(A) of title      51, United States Code, that the Administration shall make      use of United States commercially provided ISS crew transfer      and crew rescue services to the maximum extent practicable.

FINDINGS ON HUMAN SPACE       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) In accordance with section 204 of the National      Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of      2010 (124 2813), the National Academies of Sciences,      Engineering, and Medicine, through its Committee on Human      Spaceflight, conducted a review of the goals, core      capabilities, and direction of human space flight, and      published the findings and recommendations in a 2014 report      entitled, ``Pathways to Exploration: Rationales and      Approaches for a U.Program of Human Space Exploration''.       (2) The Committee on Human Spaceflight included leaders      from the aerospace, scientific, security, and policy      communities.       (3) With input from the public, the Committee on Human      Spaceflight concluded that many practical and aspirational      rationales for human space flight together constitute a      compelling case for continued national investment and pursuit      of human space exploration toward the horizon goal of       (4) According to the Committee on Human Spaceflight, the      rationales include economic benefits, national security,      national prestige, inspiring students and other citizens,      scientific discovery, human survival, and a sense of shared      destiny.       (5) The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed that Mars      is the appropriate long-term goal for the human space flight      program.       (6) The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended that      NASA define a series of sustainable steps and conduct mission      planning and technology development as needed to achieve the      long-term goal of placing humans on the surface of       (7) Expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and      advancing toward human missions to Mars requires early      planning and timely decisions to be made in the near-term on      the necessary courses of action for commitments to achieve      short-term and long-term goals and objectives.       (8) In addition to the 2014 report described in paragraph      (1), there are several independently developed reports or      concepts that describe potential Mars architectures or      concepts and identify Mars as the long-term goal for human      space exploration, including NASA's ``The Global Exploration      Roadmap'' of 2013, ``NASA's Journey to Mars-Pioneering Next      Steps in Space Exploration'' of 2015, NASA Jet Propulsion      Laboratory's ``Minimal Architecture for Human Journeys to      Mars'' of 2015, and Explore Mars' ``The Humans to Mars Report      2016''.     432. HUMAN EXPLORATION       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and      advancing toward human missions to Mars in the 2030s requires      early strategic planning and timely decisions to be made in      the near-term on the necessary courses of action for      commitments to achieve short-term and long-term goals and      objectives;[[Page H1559]]       (2) for strong and sustained United States leadership, a      need exists to advance a human exploration roadmap,      addressing exploration objectives in collaboration with      international, academic, and industry partners;       (3) an approach that incrementally advances toward a long-     term goal is one in which nearer-term developments and      implementation would influence future development and      implementation; and       (4) a human exploration roadmap should begin with low-Earth      orbit, then address in greater detail progress beyond low-     Earth orbit to cis-lunar space, and then address future      missions aimed at human arrival and activities near and then      on the surface of       (b) Human Exploration Roadmap.--       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall develop a human      exploration roadmap, including a critical decision plan, to      expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit to the surface      of Mars and beyond, considering potential interim      destinations such as cis-lunar space and the moons of       (2) Scope.--The human exploration roadmap shall include--       (A) an integrated set of exploration, science, and other      goals and objectives of a United States human space      exploration program to achieve the long-term goal of human      missions near or on the surface of Mars in the 2030s;       (B) opportunities for international, academic, and industry      partnerships for exploration-related systems, services,      research, and technology if those opportunities provide cost-     savings, accelerate program schedules, or otherwise benefit      the goals and objectives developed under subparagraph (A);       (C) sets and sequences of precursor missions in cis-lunar      space and other missions or activities necessary--       (i) to demonstrate the proficiency of the capabilities and      technologies identified under subparagraph (D); and       (ii) to meet the goals and objectives developed under      subparagraph (A), including anticipated timelines and      missions for the Space Launch System and Orion;       (D) an identification of the specific capabilities and      technologies, including the Space Launch System, Orion, a      deep space habitat, and other capabilities, that facilitate      the goals and objectives developed under subparagraph (A);       (E) a description of how cis-lunar elements, objectives,      and activities advance the human exploration of Mars;       (F) an assessment of potential human health and other      risks, including radiation exposure;       (G) mitigation plans, whenever possible, to address the      risks identified in subparagraph (F);       (H) a description of those technologies already under      development across the Federal Government or by other      entities that facilitate the goals and objectives developed      under subparagraph (A);       (I) a specific process for the evolution of the      capabilities of the fully integrated Orion with the Space      Launch System and a description of how these systems      facilitate the goals and objectives developed under      subparagraph (A) and demonstrate the capabilities and      technologies described in subparagraph (D);       (J) a description of the capabilities and technologies that      need to be demonstrated or research data that could be gained      through the utilization of the ISS and the status of the      development of such capabilities and technologies;       (K) a framework for international cooperation in the      development of all capabilities and technologies identified      under this section, including an assessment of the risks      posed by relying on international partners for capabilities      and technologies on the critical path of development;       (L) a process for partnering with nongovernmental entities      using Space Act Agreements or other acquisition instruments      for future human space exploration; and       (M) include information on the phasing of planned      intermediate destinations, Mars mission risk areas and      potential risk mitigation approaches, technology requirements      and phasing of required technology development activities,      the management strategy to be followed, related ISS      activities, planned international collaborative activities,      potential commercial contributions, and other activities      relevant to the achievement of the goal established in this      section.       (3) Considerations.--In developing the human exploration      roadmap, the Administrator shall consider--       (A) using key exploration capabilities, namely the Space      Launch System and Orion;       (B) using existing commercially available technologies and      capabilities or those technologies and capabilities being      developed by industry for commercial purposes;       (C) establishing an organizational approach to ensure      collaboration and coordination among NASA's Mission      Directorates under section 821, when appropriate, including      to collect and return to Earth a sample from the Martian      surface;       (D) building upon the initial uncrewed mission, EM-1, and      first crewed mission, EM-2, of the Space Launch System and      Orion to establish a sustainable cadence of missions      extending human exploration missions into cis-lunar space,      including anticipated timelines and milestones;       (E) developing the robotic and precursor missions and      activities that will demonstrate, test, and develop key      technologies and capabilities essential for achieving human      missions to Mars, including long-duration human operations      beyond low-Earth orbit, space suits, solar electric      propulsion, deep space habitats, environmental control life      support systems, Mars lander and ascent vehicle, entry,      descent, landing, ascent, Mars surface systems, and in-situ      resource utilization;       (F) demonstrating and testing 1 or more habitat modules in      cis-lunar space to prepare for Mars missions;       (G) using public-private, firm fixed-price partnerships,      where practicable;       (H) collaborating with international, academic, and      industry partners, when appropriate;       (I) any risks to human health and sensitive onboard      technologies, including radiation exposure;       (J) any risks identified through research outcomes under      the NASA Human Research Program's Behavioral Health Element;      and       (K) the recommendations and ideas of several independently      developed reports or concepts that describe potential Mars      architectures or concepts and identify Mars as the long-term      goal for human space exploration, including the reports      described under section 431.       (4) Critical decision plan on human space exploration.--As      part of the human exploration roadmap, the Administrator      shall include a critical decision plan--       (A) identifying and defining key decisions guiding human      space exploration priorities and plans that need to be made      before June 30, 2020, including decisions that may guide      human space exploration capability development, precursor      missions, long-term missions, and activities;       (B) defining decisions needed to maximize efficiencies and      resources for reaching the near, intermediate, and long-term      goals and objectives of human space exploration; and       (C) identifying and defining timelines and milestones for a      sustainable cadence of missions beginning with EM-3 for the      Space Launch System and Orion to extend human exploration      from cis-lunar space to the surface of       (5) Reports.--       (A) Initial human exploration roadmap.--The Administrator      shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress--       (i) an initial human exploration roadmap, including a      critical decision plan, before December 1, 2017; and       (ii) an updated human exploration roadmap periodically as      the Administrator considers necessary but not less than      biennially.       (B) Contents.--Each human exploration roadmap under this      paragraph shall include a description of--       (i) the achievements and goals accomplished in the process      of developing such capabilities and technologies during the      2-year period prior to the submission of the human      exploration roadmap; and       (ii) the expected goals and achievements in the following      2- year period.       (C) Submission with budget.--Each human exploration roadmap      under this section shall be included in the budget for that      fiscal year transmitted to Congress under section 1105(a) of      title 31, United States     433. ADVANCED SPACE SUIT       Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this      Act, the Administrator shall submit to the appropriate      committees of Congress a detailed plan for achieving an      advanced space suit capability that aligns with the crew      needs for exploration enabled by the Space Launch System and      Orion, including an evaluation of the merit of delivering the      planned suit system for use on the     434. ASTEROID ROBOTIC REDIRECT       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) NASA initially estimated that the Asteroid Robotic      Redirect Mission would launch in December 2020 and cost no      more than $1,250,000,000, excluding launch and operations.       (2) On July 15, 2016, NASA conducted its Key Decision      Point-B review of the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission or      approval for Phase B in mission formulation.       (3) During the Key Decision Point-B review, NASA estimated      that costs have grown to $1,400,000,000 excluding launch and      operations for a launch in December 2021 and the agency must      evaluate whether to accept the increase or reduce the      Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission's scope to stay within the      cost cap set by the       (4) In April 2015, the NASA Advisory Council--       (A) issued a finding that--       (i) high-performance solar electric propulsion will likely      be an important part of an architecture to send humans to      Mars; and       (ii) maneuvering a large test mass is not necessary to      provide a valid in-space test of a new solar electric      propulsion stage;       (B) determined that a solar electric propulsion mission      will contribute more directly to the goal of sending humans      to Mars if the mission is focused entirely on development and      validation of the solar electric propulsion stage; and       (C) determined that other possible motivations for      acquiring and maneuvering a boulder, such as asteroid science      and planetary defense, do not have value commensurate with      their probable cost.       (5) The Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission is competing for      resources with other critical exploration development      programs, including the Space Launch System, Orion,      commercial crew, and a habitation module.[[Page H1560]]       (6) In 2014, the NASA Advisory Council recommended that      NASA conduct an independent cost and technical assessment of      the Asteroid Robotic Redirect       (7) In 2015, the NASA Advisory Council recommended that      NASA preserve the following key objectives if the program      needed to be descoped:       (A) Development of high power solar electric propulsion.       (B) Ability to maneuver in a low gravity environment in      deep space.       (8) In January 2015 and July 2015, the NASA Advisory      Council expressed its concern to NASA about the potential for      growing costs for the program and highlighted that choices      would need to be made about the program's content.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) the technological and scientific goals of the Asteroid      Robotic Redirect Mission have not been demonstrated to      Congress to be commensurate with the cost; and       (2) alternative missions may provide a more cost effective      and scientifically beneficial means to demonstrate the      technologies needed for a human mission to Mars that would      otherwise be demonstrated by the Asteroid Robotic Redirect            (c) Evaluation and Report.--Not later than 180 days after      the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall--       (1) conduct an evaluation of--       (A) alternative approaches to the Asteroid Robotic Redirect      Mission for demonstrating the technologies and capabilities      needed for a human mission to Mars that would otherwise be      demonstrated by the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission;       (B) the scientific and technical benefits of the      alternative approaches under subparagraph (A) to future human      space exploration compared to scientific and technical      benefits of the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission;       (C) the commercial benefits of the alternative approaches      identified in subparagraph (A), including the impact on the      development of domestic solar electric propulsion technology      to bolster United States competitiveness in the global      marketplace; and       (D) a comparison of the estimated costs of the alternative      approaches identified in subparagraph (A); and       (2) submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a      report on the evaluation under paragraph (1), including any      recommendations.     435. MARS 2033       (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall contract with      an independent, non-governmental systems engineering and      technical assistance organization to study a Mars human space      flight mission to be launched in 2033.       (b) Contents.--The study shall include--       (1) a technical development, test, fielding, and operations      plan using the Space Launch System, Orion, and other systems      to successfully launch such a Mars human space flight mission      by 2033;       (2) an annual budget profile, including cost estimates, for      the technical development, test, fielding, and operations      plan to carry out a Mars human space flight mission by 2033;      and       (3) a comparison of the annual budget profile to the 5-year      budget profile contained in the President's budget request      for fiscal year 2017 under section 1105 of title 31, United      States       (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to the      appropriate committees of Congress a report on the study,      including findings and recommendations regarding the Mars      2033 human space flight mission described in subsection (a).       (d) Assessment.--Not later than 60 days after the date the      report is submitted under subsection (c), the Administrator      shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress an      assessment by the NASA Advisory Council of whether the      proposal for a Mars human space flight mission to be launched      in 2033 is in the strategic interests of the United States in      space exploration.                    Subtitle D--TREAT Astronauts Act     441. SHORT       This subtitle may be cited as the ``To Research, Evaluate,      Assess, and Treat Astronauts Act'' or the ``TREAT Astronauts      Act''.     442. FINDINGS; SENSE OF       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Human space exploration can pose significant challenges      and is full of substantial risk, which has ultimately claimed      the lives of 24 NASA astronauts serving in the line of duty.       (2) As United States government astronauts participate in      long-duration and exploration space flight missions they may      experience increased health risks, such as vision impairment,      bone demineralization, and behavioral health and performance      risks, and may be exposed to galactic cosmic radiation.      Exposure to high levels of radiation and microgravity can      result in acute and long-term health consequences that can      increase the risk of cancer and tissue degeneration and have      potential effects on the musculoskeletal system, central      nervous system, cardiovascular system, immune function, and      vision.       (3) To advance the goal of long-duration and exploration      space flight missions, United States government astronaut      Scott Kelly participated in a 1-year twins study in space      while his identical twin brother, former United States      government astronaut Mark Kelly, acted as a human control      specimen on Earth, providing an understanding of the      physical, behavioral, microbiological, and molecular reaction      of the human body to an extended period of time in space.       (4) Since the Administration currently provides medical      monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment for United States      government astronauts during their active employment, given      the unknown long-term health consequences of long-duration      space exploration, the Administration has requested statutory      authority from Congress to provide medical monitoring,      diagnosis, and treatment to former United States government      astronauts for psychological and medical conditions      associated with human space flight.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) the United States should continue to seek the unknown      and lead the world in space exploration and scientific      discovery as the Administration prepares for long-duration      and exploration space flight in deep space and an eventual      mission to Mars;       (2) data relating to the health of astronauts will become      increasingly valuable to improving our understanding of many      diseases humans face on Earth;       (3) the Administration should provide the type of      monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment described in subsection      (a) only for conditions the Administration considers unique      to the training or exposure to the space flight environment      of United States government astronauts and should not require      any former United States Government astronauts to participate      in the Administration's monitoring;       (4) such monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment should not      replace a former United States government astronaut's private      health insurance;       (5) expanded data acquired from such monitoring, diagnosis,      and treatment should be used to tailor treatment, inform the      requirements for new space flight medical hardware, and      develop controls in order to prevent disease occurrence in      the astronaut corps; and       (6) the 340-day space mission of Scott Kelly aboard the      ISS--       (A) was pivotal for the goal of the United States for      humans to explore deep space and Mars as the mission      generated new insight into how the human body adjusts to      weightlessness, isolation, radiation, and the stress of long-     duration space flight; and       (B) will help support the physical and mental well-being of      astronauts during longer space exploration missions in the      future.     443.

837,topic-id,596,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017. This bipartisan and bicameral bill grew to maturity through many long and serious discussions about the future of our Nation's space program.  I am encouraged by the bill's persistent emphasis on the continuity of purpose and stability. It is crucial that we continue to support NASA's ongoing human exploration efforts.  I am proud to note the inclusion of the To Research Evaluate, Assess, and Treat Astronauts Act, better known as the TREAT Astronauts Act, which will ensure that our Nation's astronauts receive support for medical issues associated with their service. The language of this bill is exactly the same as the TREAT Astronauts Act that was passed in the House on December 7, 2016.  As a medical professional myself, I care deeply about this issue. I am honored to have sponsored the original legislation, and am proud to contribute to an important program that will support the brave men and women of our astronaut corps. Outer space poses many medical challenges. The human body simply is not designed to thrive in microgravity, or weightlessness. We know that spending time in space is risky. We want to understand the reasons why the TREAT Astronauts Act will ensure the retention of our astronauts' medical data and help to continue our research in aerospace medicine, while also providing our astronauts with the medical care that they need and deserve after risking so much in service to our country.  This bill continues support for the important work on the Space Launch System, the Orion crew vehicle, and commercial cargo and crew programs.[[Page H1569]]                                {time}  1815  The future of the International Space Station is another key topic addressed in this legislation. We are committed to operating the ISS until 2024. Beyond that date, however, maintaining NASA's current level of support for the ISS will dramatically affect the rest of NASA's portfolio, particularly in human spaceflight.  This bill opens the debate about how and under what circumstances NASA's presence in low-Earth orbit can and should be continued beyond 2024. Balancing NASA's presence and low Earth orbit and beyond low Earth orbit will require thoughtful and informed decisionmaking. My hope is that NASA will explore unique partnerships that will maintain NASA's ability to utilize low Earth orbit in an efficient manner by leveraging private sector investment. This bill will help inform and frame that imminent debate.  This bill also addresses NASA's facilities and infrastructure here on NASA must develop a plan so that its labs, tools, facilities, and infrastructure can support a robust exploration agenda. Right-sizing NASA's footprint is a longstanding challenge. We must maintain critical capabilities but also find efficiencies where they may exist.  The bill before us would call on NASA to develop a policy to ensure that NASA maintains infrastructure to support bold exploration. If NASA determines that facilities are not necessary or could be transferred to the private sector, the bill calls on NASA to do so in accordance with a transparent and equitable process.  The bill also urges the administration to pursue a sensible policy on termination liability so that NASA makes the best possible use of taxpayer dollars rather than the inefficient policy implemented by the previous administration.  This bill sets out clear intentions for NASA as we move forward into the next chapter of American space exploration. I invite my colleagues to join me in supporting this very important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgH1553.txt,2270,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,7.0,March

635,topic-id,653,"Mr.President, today I wish to honor the life of my friend Edward ``Ed'' Ed spent his lifetime fighting for equality, justice, and fairness for all Wisconsinites and Americans and did so with passion, joy, and a great Irish wit.  Ed was born in 1940 in Burlington, WI, to Edward and June His legacy of leadership and service began at a young age. He emerged as a young leader in Wisconsin through Badger Boys State and as student body president at the University of Wisconsin- Ed's lifelong commitment to social justice and racial equality began in college. As a member of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Council, Ed traveled to the South to join the African American civil rights movement. Following 2 years serving our Nation in the Army, Ed attended the University of Wisconsin Law School, graduating in 1969.  Thereafter, Ed joined the Minneapolis law firm Lindquist and Vennum and worked for the newly formed National Football League Players Association--For 12 years, Ed fought for labor rights for NFL players and workers, first as the NFLPA's attorney and eventually as its first executive director. He won greater freedom and economic fairness for the players, securing a fair share of profits for players who at the time needed second jobs to supplement their $35,000 salaries.  Ed was never shy or deferential. He spoke truth to power and challenged the system anywhere he found an injustice. He loved a good fight, and he took great pleasure in the battles, but he was always respectful and driven by the progressive values that guided him. In moments of the greatest conflict, Ed would often use humor to disarm others while making a point. Even his greatest adversaries appreciated his principled positions and enjoyed his wit and intellect.  After more than a decade with the NFL, Ed returned home and was named Wisconsin Deputy Attorney General, where he took on big polluters and fought for environmental protections. He ran for the Senate twice, and in his bid for Governor in 1998, Ed not only fought for campaign finance reform, he led by example because he has always been deeply committed to changing a system where powerful interests have too much influence over public policy. While Ed came up short in his campaigns, he never gave up his fight for the ``little guy'' as a respected lawyer and as a leading progressive voice in our  Ed understood how important it is to pass on to the next generation our proud, progressive tradition in He founded ``Fighting Bob Fest'' to honor the legacy of former progressive Wisconsin Governor and U.Senator Robert ``Fighting Bob'' Each year, Ed brought progressives together from across the country to share this tradition and give people a voice.  Ed's list of accomplishments and successes is long and has one thing common: He was committed to something bigger than he was. If you asked him, he would say his greatest accomplishment was his family. He spent more than five wonderful decades filled with adventures with his wife, Betty, and their three daughters, Pam, Kathleen, and In recent years, his four grandchildren were his greatest joy. I know that their wonderful memories of him will stay with them always.  I feel so privileged to have known and worked with Ed since my early years in public service. Ed lived his life and pursued his work with persistence and purpose. He loved Wisconsin and stood up for people from different walks of life because he wanted to make a difference in people's lives.  Perhaps most important, Ed inspired generations of young people to enter politics and law, to engage in our democracy, to let their voices be heard, and to never be intimidated by those of wealth, power, and privilege. I am a better person for having fought with him in support of a more progressive Wisconsin, and I am honored to work to continue his important legacy. ``Forward!''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-02-pt1-PgS1575.txt,1558,REFUGEES WANT TO LIVE IN PEACE,2017.0,2.0,March

966,topic-id,706,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about bipartisan legislation designed to strengthen our Nation's nuclear energy capacity. It is called the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization I am a strong supporter of American nuclear energy. It is a vital component of our ``all of the above'' American energy plan. My home State of Wyoming plays a key role in American nuclear energy supply. In Wyoming, we produce more uranium than any other  Nuclear energy is clean, safe, reliable, and affordable. It also provides a major boost to the economy. American nuclear plants provide thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in benefits to local communities. U.nuclear powerplants have run safely for decades, and many of them will serve our country for years and decades to come. But after decades of reliable power from our traditional nuclear powerplants, these nuclear powerplants are experiencing innovation with opportunities that are now taking shape in the nuclear industry. Increased private investment is occurring in nuclear energy, and it has led to improvements in safety, security, and in cost.  This is no longer a traditional nuclear industry. There are nuclear startups which are being backed by American entrepreneurs. Research and work are being done by Bill Gates, of all people. These folks envision fundamentally transforming nuclear energy technology. I believe the advances are exciting. The biggest challenges these innovators face, however, are the costs and delays from regulatory redtape. Many of these delays come from trying to navigate a regulatory system that was developed around one specific technology, which is water-cooled reactors. The traditional water-cooled reactors have powered our Navy and our electricity grid and have done it successfully for decades, but today's entrepreneurs are pursuing very different designs. They are using high-temperature gases, molten salts, and other high-tech materials to advance the safety, efficiency, and reliability of nuclear energy.  The nuclear regulatory system needs to be updated to enable this innovation. That is why I join with my colleagues in introducing the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization[[Page S1613]]Cosponsors include Senators Whitehouse, Inhofe, Booker, Fischer, Capito, and We come together having introduced 512. Our bipartisan bill seeks to modernize the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by providing a flexible regulatory framework for licensing advanced nuclear reactors. The NRC needs a modern regulatory framework that is predictable and efficient. Reactor operators for both traditional and advanced reactors need timely decisionmaking from the Nuclear Regulatory At the same time, the Commission needs to maintain its ability to assess a variety of technologies and meet its mission of administering safety and security to the American people. Additionally, our legislation will update the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's fee recovery rules.  This measure is going to bring increased transparency and accountability to the NRC, while also improving the Commission's efficiency and timeliness.  This bill will also help to preserve the uranium producers who are essential to powering the technology. The Energy Information Administration reports that uranium production in 2016 was at its lowest level since way back in 2005. It is crucial that we restore our American uranium sector and preserve these important jobs.  Our bipartisan legislation is going to enable the development of innovative reactors with bold, new technologies. As a nation, we can either lead this technology revolution or we can defer to our competitors. China and Russia are already developing advanced technologies regardless of what we do here in the United America needs to be a leader of nuclear development. We need to create an environment where entrepreneurs can flourish. This is the way to create jobs here at home and revitalize our nuclear energy sector at the same time.  One way to enable innovation for advanced reactors is to provide a regulatory framework that is predictable and cost-effective and that maintains the NRC's safety and security mission. The bill we haved introduced, the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act, does all of this.

I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From The Daily Sentinel, 1, 2017]                            Aligning Values       Colorado's biggest political guns are marching to the beat      of the same drum, proclaiming the Centennial State is the      perfect new location for the massive Outdoor Retailer Show      which is leaving Salt Lake City over the extreme stance      Utah's political leaders have taken on public lands.       Democratic John Hickenlooper and U.Cory      Gardner, a Republican, and Democrat Michael Bennet sent a      joint letter Monday to the Outdoor Retailer Show hailing      Colorado's bipartisan commitment to maintaining and      protecting public lands.       Considering that Utah is ground-zero for a movement to      transfer management of public lands from the federal      government to the states, it's not hard for Colorado to claim      that its values are more closely aligned with the outdoor      industry, which relies on public lands for its livelihood.       Colorado could enhance that claim if Gardner and Bennet      refuse to overturn the first major revision of the Bureau of      Land Management's land-use planning process in three decades.       Congress is seeking to overturn BLM's Planning 2.0      initiative under the Congressional Review The House has      already voted to eliminate the rule. If the Senate follows      suit, it will undo an effort to increase public involvement,      improve transparency and promote science-based decision-     making in public-lands planning.       Planning 2.0 is not without its critics. The Western      Governors' Association has asked Congress in a 10 letter      to ``direct the BLM to re-examine the final Planning 2.0      rule. Any revisions . . . should be crafted collaboratively      with western states.''       But there can be no revisions if the rule is repealed under      the CRA, which is a ``nuclear bomb'' of a legislative tool.      The CRA would not only overturn the rule, but block future      rulemakings that are ``substantially the same'' without prior      approval from       That means the BLM would be stuck with an antiquated      planning process, hobbling the agency in a way that      reinforces all the negative perceptions that already exist      regarding the way it manages public lands.       Sportsmen's groups, the Pew Charitable Trusts, conservation      groups and the Outdoor Industry Association all support      Planning 2.0. The WGA wants to keep it alive to improve it.       Public lands are the backbone of the outdoor industry,      which contributes $646 billion to the economy annually.       Gardner sponsored the Outdoor Recreation and Jobs Economic      Impact Act, which was signed into law by the president last      year. It requires the Bureau of Economic Analysis to      calculate the economic impact of the outdoor recreation      industry and requires the Commerce Department to provide      Congress with a full evaluation of the outdoor recreation      industry.       He obviously recognizes the importance of the outdoor      recreation industry as a jobs creator and an economic engine.      He should also understand that the industry equates killing      the rule with hampering growth.       The Senate vote may have not any bearing on whether the      Outdoor Retailer Show relocates to But supporting      2.0 is a show of good faith that our senators get what's at      stake.

770,topic-id,630,"Mr.Speaker, today I rise to urge all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to oppose this bill that repeals the Affordable Care Act, and here is why.  I stand here not as a Member of Congress, but as a doctor. When I took the oath to enter medicine, like thousands of other doctors, there are really three basic ethics in there:  Benevolence: to do good.  Mr.Speaker, this bill does not do anything good. It makes it harder for people to get health care.  The second ethic was non-malfeasance: to do no harm.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is going to harm millions of It is going to pull healthcare coverage away from folks. In fact, I have heard from folks who have come to my townhalls and have talked about how the Affordable Care Act has saved their lives. If you pull health care away from them, people are going to get sicker, and some people may potentially die.  And the third ethic is patient autonomy: the ability of patients to make the choices that impact their lives.  Mr.Speaker, this bill does not empower patients to make their own choices. This bill limits those choices. It takes choice away from them.  This is a bad bill that goes against everything that we in the medical profession swear to when we enter the profession. That is why you see doctors standing up and opposing this bill, hospitals opposing this bill, and health plans opposing this bill. That is why, when patients see what is in this bill, you will see American patients pushing back.  If you thought the townhalls have been boisterous over the last few months, just try to pass this bill and take necessary health care away from folks. You are going to see those patients showing up in your townhalls.  Let's talk about some of the good things that have happened in the Affordable Care The Affordable Care Act expanded and made coverage for birth control much more readily available. That is a good thing. Whether you are anti-choice or pro-choice, like I am, it is a good thing. What we have seen by expanding coverage to birth control is the number of unintended pregnancies are near all-time lows. That is what we ought to be doing.  The Affordable Care Act expanded access to preventive health services. We know if we want to bring down the cost of health care, let's diagnose the cancer early. Let's treat it and let's save that life. Let's better manage disease.  Let's not go back to the old days where the patient showed up with the heart attack and then we went into action. That costs us a lot more. Let's prevent that heart attack. Let's provide better access to care.  Mr.Speaker, let's not make the President have to renege on a promise that he made. On the campaign trail and after being inaugurated, the President has said that any healthcare legislation was going to expand coverage, it was going to be cheaper, and it was going to be more accessible to patients.  We know this bill that is being introduced does none of that. It cuts coverage. It is going to be more costly for people and fewer people are going to get it.  Mr.Speaker, don't make the President have to renege and go against the promise that he made. The American public is going to hold him accountable for that.  Mr.Speaker, do the right thing. Let's put American patients first. That is what we as doctors do every day, and that is why, again, doctors are against it, hospitals are against it, and health plans are against it.  Mr.Speaker, let's reject this bill. I urge all my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to stand against this bill. It is a bad bill.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgH1542.txt,2102,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,7.0,March

This bicameral and bipartisan bill that we are considering today, the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017, authorizes NASA's appropriations for the fiscal year 2017.  If enacted, the bill's provisions will provide important stability and funding and consistent vision that we need for NASA to succeed as they continue to make progress across disciplines of space and earth science, in human exploration and spaceflight, innovative technologies, biomedical research, and in aeronautics.  Mr.Speaker, NASA truly is a symbol of American excellence and ingenuity. For NASA to continue doing the great things that it does, including preparation for flying SLS and Orion, launching the James Webb Space Telescope, and landing humans on Mars, it is critical that 442 be enacted.  And while I would have preferred a more comprehensive outlook of NASA's science discipline--namely, in earth science, planetary science, astrophysics, and heliophysics--I am pleased the bill provides the consistent policy direction our Nation's space and aeronautics programs require and deserve. Notably, the bill sets the long-term course of sending humans to the surface of Mars and directs NASA to provide a human exploration roadmap outlining the capabilities and milestones needed to achieve the goal.  In closing, Mr.Speaker, NASA's space and aeronautics programs help maintain our competitiveness, stimulate innovation and economic growth, and inspire the next generation to dream big and garner the skills to turn those dreams into action.  NASA and our space program have a long history of bipartisan support. I urge Members of the House to pass 442, the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017.

7,topic-id,729,"Mr.Speaker, in this Chamber last night, as I listened to the President's address to the joint session, I could only think of one word: ``resist.''  Whether one voted for Donald Trump or not, we are all obligated to resist his incoherent and contradictory pledge to dismantle the protections of the Affordable Care Act with empty slogans.  Perhaps the most revealing moment of the Trump administration so far was his declaration Monday in his meeting with America's Governors that health care is complex. ``Who knew?'' he said.  Well, anybody who has done any work, any research, or had even had conversations with the people who rely on health care, who study health care, or deliver health care. This was not a secret that it is complex. Yet, for months, he has made reckless, misleading comments and has unleashed efforts to make the Affordable Care Act less effective and to destabilize insurance markets.  We should resist his cynical and cruel step of singling out people who have somehow been harmed by illegal immigrants as a special category. Why not an office dealing with the far greater number of Americans whose lives are turned upside down as a result of gun violence--which, by the way, is the method of choice for homegrown terrorists who, experts in his own government point out, are responsible for more terrorist acts and violence and death of Americans than people who are foreign-born.  We should resist empty promises to rebuild and renew America by failing to provide any meaningful detail. That squanders an opportunity for bipartisan cooperation and a badly-needed effort to revitalize America and put millions of Americans to work at jobs that can't be outsourced overseas and that will strengthen each community. It is important to resist an administration program long on divisive rhetoric, misinformation, and lost opportunities.  The least popular new President in our history, as near as we can tell, has mobilized millions of Americans to be involved, to resist. It is critical that Americans of good conscience, who care about the future of their country and want to change the trajectory and tone of politics, dive in now to protect programs they care about which are under assault, to reject shortsighted policies that will spend billions of dollars on things we don't need, like even more nuclear weapons. How many times do we have to be able to blow up the world in order to achieve deterrence?  We should resist spending less on critical parts of our defense. For example, the diplomacy and international aid saves human lives; it undercuts the calls to radicalism for people without hope. Making the job of our diplomats and our aid workers harder and more dangerous and less effective should be resisted at every turn.  We should resist draconian budget cuts and hiring freezes that undercut the opportunity to take care of our veterans, especially their health. Their health is a long overdue promise that Trump has occasionally talked about but is now actively undermining.  We should resist unparalleled potential budget assaults on things that make a difference to our communities, like arts, public broadcasting, programs for children, things that matter deeply.  Together, we can resist these destructive policies in Congress, in the budget, and in legislation, while we strengthen their support for similar programs at home. Everybody should resist by being involved in their community. There is something every one of us cares about at home and on the national stage. We should resist politics of division, hatred, and hopelessly flawed and failing priorities.  We should resist. It is within our power to dramatically change the political equation. Remember, Donald Trump lost the popular vote by almost 3 million votes, while Democrats picked up seats in the House and the The country is much more evenly divided, and they are not united in support of this administration.  By doing our job now, it makes it possible to build on the successes by making sure everyone has a chance to participate in the voting process. Fight efforts at voter suppression.  It is time for all of us to engage in that resistance that adds energy and hope across It must start now and will continue until we defeat hate, bigotry, shortsighted policy, and misallocated priorities.  America can halt and reverse the damage that has been set in motion. We should resist. We should resist now.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1396.txt,99,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,1.0,March
312,topic-id,935,"Mr.President, I am proud and honored to follow my very distinguished colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen, and Senator Murray of Washington in this cause which invokes a line that I think the President used last night in his address to us, pledging cooperation for causes where we can make a common cause.  Surely no cause is more important than healthcare, no goal is more important than preventive services for[[Page S1528]]women so we can all avoid the costs not only in dollars and cents but the cost of human suffering and foreclosed futures that will come when women are denied these kinds of basic services.  I met this morning with a group from Planned Parenthood, patients and providers working in clinics across New They told me their story--some of them patients, some of them service providers and volunteers--about the kind of transformative effect that primary care, examinations and screenings, can have for women who would otherwise lack those services. The community health centers cannot substitute for them.  Family planning programs under title X are often the only Federal programs dedicated to providing comprehensive services in family planning but also in related preventive health services.  Over the past year alone, title X providers have provided cancer and HIV screenings, contraceptive services, and other primary and preventive services to over 4 million women and men at nearly 4,000 health centers in New England and across the country. This network of healthcare providers is a safety net. They compose a network, the title X network, including providers of State and local health departments, federally qualified health centers, and family planning councils. They create a network that provides a critical source of healthcare to people who otherwise would be denied it. They are trusted providers who are willing to serve the uninsured, the uninsured and low-income individuals who risk losing all access to healthcare if it was not for this network.  These clinics are often the only healthcare providers in rural areas and other parts of the country. So the political attacks on providers that provide abortion services would mean a loss of access to all family planning and preventive healthcare in these parts of the country--rural, metropolitan, suburban. Not only are these services necessary, but family planning services are really good investments, especially when it comes to the money that otherwise would be spent when illnesses or diseases become more serious.  In 2010, the $1.14 billion that was spent in this country on family planning resulted in more than $8 billion in gross savings. That is a clearly worthwhile investment.  The resolution that passed the House last month that Senator McConnell is considering bringing to the Senate floor would eliminate protections that prevent discrimination against these very providers, discrimination based on facts or sometimes nonfacts that have nothing to do with the quality of care or the worthiness of the investment in these clinics and healthcare providers.  The regulation that Republicans are seeking to eliminate ensures that no qualified providers will be excluded from eligibility for Federal funding for discriminatory reasons outside of that provider's ability to provide care. That is really the criterion that matters. The ones who want to eliminate this regulation apparently would rather risk limiting access to healthcare in order to score political points. Unfortunately, it is really that simple.  At a time when Republicans continue to try to push ahead with repealing the Affordable Care Act, which also includes essential support for preventive healthcare, they also want to disrupt the country's healthcare system for this kind of women's healthcare.  Just last night, after President Trump claimed he wanted to work with Members of both parties to invest in women's health, we are threatened with this step to eliminate an important regulation that protects women's health. I ask the President and my colleagues across the aisle to join in this common cause, which should unite us on a bipartisan basis. If they want to continue these attacks, we are ready for the fight, but we would much rather cooperate and collaborate in the cause of women's healthcare.  I urge my Senate colleagues to listen to the kind of providers and patients whom I met with this morning, the kind of provider that Senator Shaheen brought with her last night as her guest, the kind of providers and patients and volunteers who work in these clinics all across the country, whether it is Planned Parenthood or other kinds of clinics. I ask them to listen to the advocates here, supporters, like the National Coalition of STD Directors, the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, the American Psychological Association, the National Association of County and City Health Officials, the ACLU, and the American Medical Student They are just a few of the stakeholders who advocate strongly that this regulation be continued and who oppose the step the House passed and that the majority leader may bring to the floor.  These people have dedicated their lives and their careers to assisting the vulnerable, whether they are providing healthcare or legal services or other kinds of support, and they are saying to us: Do not eliminate this regulation. I think we ought to listen to them. I hope my colleagues will.  I am determined that we will fight tooth and nail if we need to do so, but I would much rather that we follow the President's offer and that we collaborate to stop the elimination of this regulation, which is so important to making sure that women's healthcare is based on quality, not on discriminatory reasons based on political motive.

593,topic-id,596,"Mr.President, in the minutes remaining before this vote, I want to briefly call attention to an impending constitutional crisis we are facing in this Chamber and in this country as a result of recent revelations coming to our attention, literally within the last 24 hours, about contacts between now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, our former colleague, and the Russian  Nearly 2 months ago, my Judiciary colleagues and I were told by then-Senator Sessions--and the Presiding Officer is on the Judiciary We were told in no uncertain terms that he ``did not have communications with the Russians,'' and we took him at his word.  Last night, we learned that Senator Sessions' statement was inaccurate. These inaccurate, possibly intentionally false, statements misled us. They misled me, personally, and I feel they failed to provide the whole truth about his communications with and ties to the Russians, likely on behalf of the Trump campaign. These contacts were in the midst of an unprecedented attack on our democracy, an act of cyber warfare against our democratic institution that not only violated our law but subverted our electoral process.  The potentially false statements on this topic by then-Senator Sessions were not only deeply relevant and critically important in their own right, but they leave us with the question: What else is missing or misleading in that testimony, and the consequential questions about his fitness to lead the Department of Justice must be answered.  Unless Attorney General Sessions can provide a credible explanation, his resignation will be necessary. Senator Sessions' false statements heighten my deep concern about credible allegations that the Trump campaign, the transition team, and the administration officials have colluded with the Russian Government, not only in actions prior to the election but possibly since then in what may amount to a coverup. Unless the whole truth is uncovered--and if there is a coverup, truly the adage will be fulfilled that the coverup is as bad as the crime. The only way to deter Russian aggression and continued cyber attacks on our democracy is to uncover the truth and deter this kind of aggression in the future.  At the time of his meetings with the Russian Ambassador, Senator Sessions was chairman of the Trump campaign's National Security Advisory Ambassador Kislyak is, of course, the same individual whose repeated covert contacts with former LTG Michael Flynn, President Trump failed to disclose both to the American public and to his own Vice General Flynn's failure to make those disclosures led to his own termination as National Security  Contacts between these two men would raise concerns under any circumstances, but Senator Sessions' decision to, in effect, conceal them makes them even more troubling. I use that word with regret because I sat in the committee hearing as he answered those questions, and, personally, I can reach no other conclusion than to say he must have intended to conceal them and hide them from us as committee members.  The Attorney General, who is the most important law enforcement official in our country, must be held to an even higher standard. The sudden disclosure that he met repeatedly with the Russian Ambassador after denying under oath any such contact, gives us all the more reason--indeed compelling evidence--that a special counsel is necessary, and necessary now, to investigate Russian ties and contacts with the Trump campaign.  I have called for such a special counsel or prosecutor for weeks now and led a letter with more than 10 of my colleagues asking that Attorney General Sessions designate such a special prosecutor.

711,topic-id,1149,"Mr.President, I am pleased to be here with a number of my colleagues to oppose H.37. As it has just been announced, we will vote on it later today. I am glad to be joined by so many of my colleagues to fight against efforts to limit the application of the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive order.  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I fought to ensure that harmful provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2017 seeking to limit the applicability of this Executive order to DOD were stripped from the final bill signed into law in December, and I continue to feel strongly that we must do everything possible to defend American workers. That is what this issue concerns.  In 2014, President Obama issued a critical Executive order, the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive order. Then, last summer, after thorough analysis and due diligence by the Department of Defense and several other agencies, he implemented what is known as the fair pay and safe workplaces rule. That rule requires companies doing business with the Federal Government to disclose when they violate any of 14 laws. The list of laws include some that are very familiar to all of us, like the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and the Civil Rights This list includes some other laws that may be somewhat more obscure, but those laws have been around for decades. They are well known in the workplace, and they are designed to protect[[Page S1592]]veterans, women, and people with disabilities from harmful, debilitating discrimination.  There is no requirement that companies disclose trivial allegations; rather, the rule requires disclosures of violations that rise to a determination by a court or administrative body of an actual violation or serious pending administrative proceeding by an agency. Companies would know of such violations.  Most companies play by the rules; all they need to do is check a box confirming they are in compliance. For those companies with compliance issues, the contracting agency would take information about those violations into consideration in the procurement process, and the contracting agency would then try to work with the company to make sure that it comes into compliance with the law. This Executive order is not about exclusion or about blackballing; in fact, it is about including and working with companies to bring them into compliance so they obey the law, knowing what the rules are, and wanting everybody to play by the same rules--not having an unfair advantage.  This rule is not about blackballing or blacklisting companies. It is about ensuring that, if they want to do business with the Federal Government, they follow the law and provide a safe and equitable workplace, protecting American workers--veterans, women, and people with disabilities--who may be victims of harmful, debilitating discrimination.  The rule is an effort to make Federal resources go to companies that are complying with the law or that are coming into compliance with Federal law. The reason behind it is to protect American workers, but it is also about creating a level playing field for all contractors and making sure there is a relationship of trust with contractors because we need partners who can be trusted to carry out the Federal Government's important work, especially in the area of building our defense weapons.  Companies that violate the law are creating an unlevel playing field, forcing law-abiding companies into unfair competition, potentially raising their costs. They skirt the law, saving dollars, presenting low-ball offers, based on noncompliance, cutting corners by, in effect, ducking their legal obligations. If they are hired, they are also at risk of providing poor performance because a company that violates the law and disregards its obligation is much more likely to disregard its moral as well as its legal duties in complying with the contract.  It is not just about saving dollars. It is about workers. Every year, tens of thousands of American workers are denied overtime wages, they are unlawfully victims of discrimination in hiring and pay, they have their health and safety put at risk by Federal contractors when they do cut corners, or they are denied basic workplace protections. That is another reason we need this rule, this Executive order, protecting workers and creating a level playing field.  Some have called the fair pay rule one of the most important advances for workers in years, and it is. According to one assessment, one in five Americans are employed by companies that do business with the Federal Ensuring that those one in five workers are protected helps countless It helps them in those workplaces, and it also sets a model for workplaces elsewhere.  It is basic, simple transparency that enables the American people to know who executive agencies task with the work, using taxpayer dollars. So requiring companies to disclose--and this rule is about disclosure--compliance records is something that many States, including Connecticut, already have in place through responsible bidder programs that use self-reporting to improve contractor quality by identifying companies with records of violating workplace laws, among other things.  President Trump was rightly praised by many of my colleagues in calling for a ``level playing field'' for businesses in his speech before us, in Congress, last week, and he has been lauded for saying we need to deliver ``better wages for Americans.'' Yet here we are, just weeks into the administration and this new Congress, and we are seeing what the real priorities unfortunately are. Once we put aside the rhetoric, actions are what matter, and these actions truly demoralize and destroy law-abiding companies' chances to compete fairly, and they decimate rights of workers to safe and fair workplaces.  I am troubled that rolling back this Executive order which I fought to achieve in the NDAA is so high a priority for the new administration and my colleagues here. Many organizations opposed this effort, and I am proud to join them in trying to forestall this rollback--the Easterseals organization, Paralyzed Veterans of America, VetsFirst, Vietnam Veterans of America, and many others who rightly fear that this course of action will do damaging injustice to our veterans and constituents with disabilities. It will also do potential damage to countless other workers involved in doing the people's work, such as performing contracts for the Federal Government funded with taxpayer dollars--our dollars--that can be used in discriminatory and unfair ways if this resolution is approved.  I urge my colleagues to vote against H.37 later today and protect the fair pay and safe workplaces rule. For the sake of our constituents--women, veterans, workers with disabilities, and businesses of America--we must reject this assault on fairness and common sense.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

576,topic-id,1568,"Mr.President, I want to talk a few minutes about the challenges so many of our Cabinet members face trying to restore our infrastructure, to maintain our park system, and to create the public-private partnerships the President mentioned earlier this week in his vision for infrastructure reform.  Certainly Governor Perry, whose nomination we are debating right now, will have many opportunities in Energy to do that, in the research components of Energy and the partnership components that can be there.  We just confirmed a new Secretary of Interior, Ryan One of our great assets as a nation is the Federal park system. We are now entering the second hundred years of that Federal park system, and that second hundred years is going to be defined by partnerships in ways the first hundred years weren't.  The park system is a great way to enjoy the blessings we have and the rich geography, the scenic beauty--some of these parks really reflect the great challenges people faced as they settled the country--and also there are historic parks that reflect the history. Sometimes our parks do both of those things.  I think all of my colleagues are aware of the Gateway Arch in Louis, one of the most visited national parks, the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial there celebrating President Jefferson, celebrating the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, and really celebrating that long movement as people moved west--eventually really west and really northwest, Mr.President, where you live in But the Gateway Arch is visited often. It opened in 1967, and so now we are 50 years into that particular part of our system. The original park itself needed a lot of restoration, but 50 years later, you look at that park and you look at how it has been used and decide how it could be better used.  What most of my colleagues probably aren't aware of is that right now, it is the biggest investment the National Park Service is making in the system at this moment, trying to connect the Gateway Arch to the Old Courthouse in Louis, the Federal courthouse where the Dred Scott case was tried--they are trying to connect that park to[[Page S1553]]the rest of the city in ways that--when it was built, it was separated by an interstate highway, so you would go see the park, but you wouldn't get to the rest of the national park side there very often.  Rethinking that is important, but what is maybe even more important is this is the biggest park project in the history of the country where private donors provided more of the money than the government did. This is not easily done. If for 100 years you have been doing something one way, it is not easy to immediately begin to say: We are going to do it another way from now on.  If you are in charge, like Secretary Jewell was put in charge of this project--and by the way, I think she has done a good job, as has her regional director, understanding that if you are going to do things differently, they have to be different.  It would be great if the city and private donors--the city even voted a tax just for this project, to provide millions of dollars that the project would be spending. Of course, I think initially the Park Service would think: Isn't that great? We now get this money from private donors, and we now get this money from a city tax, in addition to a portion of the money we are still getting appropriated by the Congress, and we will just spend it the way we have always spent it, as if we had no partners. But that didn't work out very well at all. The partners in the project actually wanted to be partners in the project.  As we look at the next hundred years of this great National Park System, I think we have to understand that for that to work and for that to work in a new way, we have to treat it differently. We are seeing that in We are seeing the three different groups come together in ways that have provided the funding. But, frankly, they also need to be at the table when you talk about how you are going to spend the funding.  We changed the law in Congress just a couple of years ago so that private money, if it is being held by the Federal Government, as it has been on that project, if there is any interest to be earned, if there is any benefit from that money, it also goes to the project rather than going into general revenue.  The goal here would be to do everything we can, if we are going to have a different park system for the next hundred years, to really encourage the next group of people to step up and say: We want to provide--as in the case in Louis, MO--more than half of the money, but we would like to have some input on how that is going to be used and how this is going to meet the needs of the community.  But also everybody who visits there, as they connect with the community uniquely in that Louis park--Missouri has a great park system. I think we are rated as one of the top four park systems in the country, our State system. In fact, right now we are looking at one of those State parks at Genevieve, which was a part of our State that was first settled by French settlers. The number of buildings there dating right back to the turn of the 19th century--1801, 1804--is reflective of how French settlers built buildings, which is different from how other settlers did.  There is a lot to learn about how we come together as a people in so many of our parks, as well. So when Secretary Zinke takes that job, one of the new opportunities is to build on what is already started in places like Louis and figure out how we can have those kinds of partnerships when the President talks about infrastructure expansion and how we are going to look for new ways to do that. As you look at new ways to do that, you have to really be willing to think of how you approach this in a way that encourages partners to be part of it.  Clearly, infrastructure--one of the great benefits of where we are located is where we are located. We have an ocean on two sides. We have a river that runs up the middle of the country, that connects the country in unique ways to all the water travel of the world. We have these coasts on each side that are beneficial to this if we connect ourselves in the right ways.  So the President's view that the road system, the airport system, the port system all need to work in a way that links us up to be better competitors and links us up in a way that allows us to create economic opportunities and better jobs for families is important.  So that kind of partnership, the partnership the park system is in--I think we are seeing the mold established, the model established for how that would work in Louis right now at the In the next couple of years, that project will be completed. It will be different than it was 50 years ago because people want to see things differently than they did 50 years ago.  With Secretary Perry, who should be confirmed today--I think clearly will be confirmed today--his opportunities at Energy to look for partners who add to what we can do there in ways we haven't thought of before--just like we use research money now, take that research money in health research and research money in ag research to bring other people into this discussion that creates opportunities for who we can be.  As we move slowly and in a way that has really made it difficult to take advantage of this new administration, we are apparently going to be able to confirm two nominees to the Cabinet today. But we are still way behind, by any measure, the history of the country in working with a new administration to let them take responsibility. There are going to be 500, 1,000 nominees--I think there are about 1,000 Deputy Secretaries and Under Secretaries who come once we are done with the I hope we can all find a way to get this done, with an understanding that whether or not you agree with the election, the election was held and the new administration has the responsibility for government. It is the job of the Senate and the Senate alone to be sure that those Cabinet officers and the people who support those Cabinet officers and departments are put in place early, as well.  Looking at the park system, looking at partnership, and looking at how important it is that we are willing to do things in a different way is something we ought to be thinking about in this week that we confirm the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Interior, and, later today, the Secretary of  I yield the floor.

67,topic-id,239,"Mr.Chair, I rise today in support of the amendment to protect student loan borrowers from the dangerous provisions of the SCRUB  More than 40 million Americans have student loan debt. Roughly one-quarter of these borrowers are behind on their payments either in delinquency or default. The Federal Government has a responsibility to protect these borrowers and American taxpayers from unscrupulous institutions that saddle students with exorbitant debt in exchange for an education of dubious value.  Hardworking students, like those who attended Corinthian Colleges or ITT Tech, could be harmed if Congress passes a law that potentially strips them of a clear process for having their debt forgiven after institutions fabricate job placement figures or close unexpectedly.  This bill could allow institutions like Corinthian Colleges to require pre-dispute arbitration clauses, and prohibit class-action lawsuits--making it much less likely that students will get the justice they deserve when a school misrepresents the quality of its programs.  Millions of borrowers who rely on popular income-driven repayment plans could be left without options for keeping their payments affordable.  Active-Duty servicemembers could lose access to deferment benefits.  Rules banning incentive pay could be undone, exposing student veterans and others to aggressive marketing.  This bill could weaken Federal protections for millions of student loan borrowers when, instead, Congress should be working together to make college more affordable.

77,topic-id,301,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment to exempt rules related to title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act from the misguided provisions of the SCRUB  Title I is the core feature of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, a critical civil rights law that holds States accountable for helping all students succeed.  The SCRUB Act threatens rules for implementing title I, which, in turn, threatens students. For example, title I rules clarify important accountability requirements that we passed into law just last session with strong bipartisan support.  Clear rulemaking is necessary to give education leaders certainty so they can benefit from the law's new flexibility and innovate on behalf of students.  Title I rules also include important details about the use of assessments in schools. These rules were negotiated with broad consensus. Would the SCRUB Act repeal them and deny States clarification about reducing the burden of testing?  My colleagues across the aisle may argue that no rule should be exempt from the SCRUB Act and that somehow the unelected commission in the bill will identify only bad rules. I am not so sure. The commission in the bill could create any methodology for targeting rules and, without knowing the commission's method, it is disingenuous to say that essential rules, good rules, wouldn't be affected.  Additionally, rules are rarely black and white as the majority suggests. Title I accountability rules, for example, sometimes push States to report on how they are serving each subgroup of students. But where some local officials may complain, these rules make sure that low-income and minority families are being counted.  Will the commission hear the concerns of those families?

291,topic-id,7280,"Mr.President, I rise in support of Carson for Secretary of Housing and Urban However, I just can't resist, as I listened to my friend Senator Cornyn--and I do like and respect Senator Cornyn, and I do mean that. It is always said here, but I actually do. I am just amused by the term ``obstructionism.'' This President was 100 yards down the hall speaking last night and still hasn't put any legislative proposals forward--nothing on immigration except Executive orders; nothing on infrastructure even though Democrats have followed the four corners, if you will, of his proposal, $1 trillion over 10 years--put ink to paper and actually written a real plan that includes public transit, that includes highways and bridges and water and sewer and housing and airports and ports and all of the things we do in doing it right on infrastructure, on public works. So we are all still waiting.  The President has made a lot of speeches. Last night he was not as combative as usual. That was welcome. I think we all, as Senator Cornyn said, applauded that. But we are still looking for substance. We are looking for one bill. Repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act--what does that mean? He still hasn't given us anything specific. They have been voting on replacing and repealing the Affordable Care Act for more than a decade, but they still don't have a plan.  If we listen to the Governor from my home State, the State where the Presiding Officer grew up--they should listen to our Republican Governor, who admonishes colleagues here: Don't repeal the Affordable Care Act unless you have a way to take care of 700,000 Ohioans who have lost their insurance under Medicaid; not to mention 100,000 who will lose their insurance who are on their parents' health plan; not to mention 100,000 who are on the exchanges; not to mention 100,000 seniors who are saving $1,100 on their prescription drugs a year; not to mention 1 million Ohio seniors who get free, no copay, no deductible osteoporosis and diabetes screenings and physicals and all the things the Affordable Care Act gives them. They offer no proposals to replace any of those services. They talk about State lines, and they talk about health savings accounts, and they talk about tort reform. That is like this many people compared to this many people. They know that. Yet I still hear this talk of obstructionism. Give us stuff. Give us legislative proposals.  The assistant majority leader started off by talking about I guess a slow-walk of nominees. Now, I am the ranking Democrat, and my friend Senator Crapo is now the chairman of the committee. He was not chairman then, and he is not mostly responsible for this. But I am on the Banking Committee, and last year, with a Democratic President--I don't want to look back and do tit-for-tat. It is not about that. It is about moving the country forward. But last year--what was it--25 to 30 nominees came from the Some were very significant, including the Export-Import Some were Federal Some of them were inspectors general, and most people don't quite know what they do. But all nominees, more than 25, more than two dozen nominees--1 of them was confirmed by the Senate last year, 1 of 28 or so in our committee, and he was confirmed in December, in the 24th month of the 2-year term. So don't lecture us about people slow-walking and obstructionism and all of that. There were more than 25 nominees, and 1 of them was confirmed. SEC, Securities and Exchange Commission, didn't move; Federal Reserve, didn't move; the public transit administrator, didn't move--one after another after another. The Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial crimes didn't move. Even though he was originally a Bush nominee and then was promoted in the Obama years, he didn't even come to a vote because of whatever reason the Banking Committee gave us. So we don't need that lecture.  But more important, on these nominees, we all know the history. When I look at criticism and hear ``Why aren't these nominees all passed?'' let's look at about 6 or 8 months ago. Every Presidential candidate, until this last election, starts to put together a transition team in August, and President Trump--Candidate Trump began to do that but not with much seriousness. Then the person he had leading his[[Page S1516]]transition team he fired in November, soon after the election, so he had to start again. So he had no people kind of ready to go on these nominations, what, in fact, he was going to do on all of these Cabinet positions.  After that, he didn't really vet, he didn't really analyze, he didn't really look at the backgrounds of these nominees. So if they didn't do it--usually the President's people look at these nominees and analyze and see how corrupt they are, if they have conflicts of interest, all of that. Well, they didn't do that in this administration because apparently they didn't have time. So they nominated these people, and we have never seen this many conflicts of interest, we have never seen this kind of wealth, and we have never seen this many billionaires appointed to the  Just out of the Finance Committee, the Secretary of Health and Human Services bought and sold health care stocks of companies--on the floor of the House of Representatives, he was working on bills and amendments; yet he bought and sold hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of health care stock, and then he didn't tell the committee the full story.  The Secretary of the Treasury had a $100 million investment he forgot to report. Maybe somebody out there would forget if they had a $100 million investment. They might forget they had it, but most Americans wouldn't forget that. He lied to the committee. He lied to the committee about robo-signings. Hundreds of--and this was directly related to this nomination--hundreds of Ohioans, at least, maybe thousands, lost their homes--including in the Presiding Officer's home city where he grew up--because of these robo-signings.  So that is why this has been slowed down--because many of these nominees are unqualified for the jobs, many of them have conflicts of interest, and many of them have very complex financial holdings and portfolios that take a long time to sort through. That is the reason for the delay, and to accuse us of anything else is just playing politics.  As I said, I am here today to argue for the confirmation of  I voted for a number of these nominees when I thought they could offer something to our country. I voted against some of the most corrupt and some of the most out-of-step and some of the most far-right, radical nominees, and that list is, unfortunately, much longer with this President than any President in American history.  Carson had a distinguished career as a pediatric neurosurgeon. We know that about him, and that is good. His remarkable life story is well known to millions of We know that about him, and that is good. But he is not the nominee I would have chosen to lead In fact, he is not the nominee any President in my lifetime would have chosen to lead HUD because he has no direct experience with the housing and community development fields.  He made troubling statements on public policy issues prior to his nomination. My colleagues and I on the Banking Committee asked Carson several very direct questions about his views now that he is the nominee for Secretary of I will give Carson the benefit of the doubt--that is why I will vote for him--because he made commitments to me in person, sitting in my office, across the table, and he made commitments in the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee in his testimony and in his written responses.  Carson promises to address the scourge of lead hazards that threaten the health and the future of children in Ohio and nationwide.  Under oath, he pledged to uphold the Fair Housing Act and the housing rights of LGBTQ individuals. That wasn't what his past has been. He has made comments that I find offensive or worse about gay people in this country, but he made the commitment under oath to our committee that he would fight any discrimination against people because of their sexual orientation.  He has pledged to advocate for rental assistance and investment to end homelessness. He has pledged to push to include housing in the President's infrastructure plan.  Those are commitments he made. Those are commitments he made under oath. Those are commitments I will hold him to in spite of perhaps his prior philosophy of government and in spite of perhaps some of his comments he might have made in the past. My job is to hold him accountable for this. The job of everybody in this Senate, of both parties, is to hold him accountable.  Carson's responses to my questions for the record are available as part of the record of the Banking Committee's January 12, 2017, hearing on the nomination of Carson to be Secretary of the U.Department of Housing and Urban I have also made them available online as part of my statement on the Banking Committee's approval of Carson's nomination on January 24, 2017.  My statement and the link to the questions for the record are available on the Banking Committee's website at http://www.banking.senate.gov/public.  Mr.President, as the ranking member of the Banking Committee--and I would emphasize the committee--while the last 2 years, it might only have been called banking, maybe it could have just been called Wall Street for the way it was running, but the full name of the committee is Banking, Housing, and Urban It is important to remember that. We oversee housing policy, and I see how important this Department is for people in Ohio and across our country.  HUD is in charge of enforcing fair housing laws. It has been an essential partner in our national efforts to prevent and end homelessness for veterans--something Senator Crapo talked about--for the chronically homeless, and for youth and families. The Department's primary rental assistance program helped 4.5 million low-income families, the elderly, and people with disabilities find a place to call home--something that should be a right in this country.  HUD has assisted cities and towns in their efforts to revitalize neighborhoods and invest in communities and promote lead-safe, healthy housing for children. There is still a great challenge in States like mine where there is deteriorating lead paint in old homes that threaten so many children. In my hometown of Cleveland and where I grew up in Mansfield and in Appalachia and in city after city and community after community in my State, there are lots of older homes. In the city of Cleveland, well over half the homes are at least 60 years old.  I asked somebody from the Cleveland health department: What percentage of those homes have toxic levels of lead? And he said 99. Understand that old homes in this country--homes that are 60, 70, 80 years old--many homes fall into that category, and they overwhelmingly have toxic levels of lead.  My support for Carson centers around the fact that he may not know much about housing policy yet--I am hopeful that in the tours he takes, including to my State and the chairman's State of Idaho--I hope and I assume he will learn more about housing, but one thing he does know as a brain surgeon is he knows what lead does to the development of children.  The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported 70 census tracts in Cuyahoga County where as many as one in three children are poisoned because of the age and the condition of the housing stock. One in three children has her or his physical and emotional and mental development sometimes arrested or slowed because of lead poisoning.  Through the Federal Housing Administration, HUD works with lenders to help creditworthy borrowers access stable mortgage credit so they can purchase a home. FHA played a central countercyclical role in providing mortgage credit following the financial crisis when the private sector largely withdrew from the field, as we remember. It has since receded into its typical share of the housing market. It is still essential, though, for home buyers, including many first-time and minority home buyers. HUD'S role will only become more important as housing communities' development challenges have grown. The need for affordable housing has grown dramatically since the great recession. The demand for units has increased while wages have stagnated.  The market alone is not producing sufficient housing for families and those on fixed incomes. Studies have demonstrated that many people who perform essential work--child care[[Page S1517]]teachers, school bus drivers, retail workers, people working full time, people working just as hard as the staff in front of me, people working just as hard as people who have titles like mine--simply can't afford the rent in the communities they serve. Half of the people who rent pay more than 30 percent of their income for housing.  One-quarter of all renters--25 percent of all renters, 11 million people in this country--pay more than half of their incomes for rent. If you are paying 51, 52, 55 percent of your income in rent, if one bad thing happens--a sick child, your plant lays you off for 2 weeks, your roof leaks, any number of things can happen. When you are living on the edge, when half of your income is for housing, what happens? You lose your home. You get evicted.  These burdens are more severe at the bottom of the income spectrum among extremely low-income renter households--those with incomes at or below 30 percent of median income, and 75 percent may pay more than half of their income in rent.  The National Low Income Housing Coalition identified a shortage of 7 million affordable and available rental units for the Nation's extremely low-income renter households. We are reaching only one out of four of those eligible families. Many end up on years' long waiting lists for lack of funding.  Government extends a hand to some of these families, but not to nearly enough. That needs to change. Despite the growing need for affordable housing, we risk losing the affordable housing resources we have due to physical deterioration or the end of long-term affordability contracts of property owners.  Families burdened by high housing costs have fewer resources available to meet other needs such as transportation for work and food and medicine. They even face eviction and homelessness; 500,000 people were homeless on any given night in January of 2016--550,000, actually.  The Department of Education data, which includes families doubled up for economic reasons, indicates that 1.4 million school children and their families were homeless at some point during the 2013-2014 school year. Think about that. Some of these kids were exposed to lead and have learning disabilities. Others don't get enough to eat, in spite of the family school breakfast and lunch program, because they don't eat so well on weekends and at night and on summer vacations or whenever. In addition, 1.4 million are homeless.  Matthew Desmond wrote a book called ``Evicted.'' He is a gentleman I have gotten to know a little bit. He lived in Milwaukee, a poor White neighborhood, a poor Black neighborhood. He wrote about people he got to meet and got to know, and he spent enough time where he got to know people. When he signed this book, he wrote: Home equals life. If you don't have a decent place to live--and I would imagine that none of us in this Chamber has that challenge. When you don't have a place to call home, your life can be upside down. With all of the challenges and all of the things that can happen, when you get evicted, your kids have to move to a new school district. You don't know where you are going to end up. You lose the few possessions you have when you're evicted. This book is recommended reading for anybody who works on housing issues. It is a book called ``Evicted'' by Matthew  One last point: I look forward to working with colleagues in the administration on the President's proposed $1 trillion investment and infrastructure, including housing. To jump-start the conversation about the President's proposed infrastructure package, my colleagues and I announced a blueprint to rebuild America's infrastructure.  I find it interesting, again, that the assistant majority leader talked about Democrats' intransigence and Democrats' obstruction when the President has put nothing out there on infrastructure, nothing out there on housing, nothing out there about healthcare--repeal and replace--none of those kinds of legislation.  We don't even know what he is talking about, other than saying ``$1 trillion.'' Democrats acted responsibly and put out our $1 trillion 10-year plan, hoping the President's $1 trillion 10-year plan can match up and we can work together. This blueprint talks about ways we invest in American infrastructure to improve the Nation's transportation, water, housing, and community infrastructure and create thousands of good-paying union jobs in construction and manufacturing jobs with strong ``Buy American'' provisions.  Even though the President in his prior life as a businessman wore suits, sold suits, sold tableware, and sold glassware made overseas, and even though this suit I wear is made by union workers 10 miles from my house, the President, now that he is President--the issue is not his own private business or his family's own private business where they outsource jobs to do production so they make more money. I don't like that, but that is no longer our business. What is our business is that the President steps forward with ``Buy American.''  ``Buy American'' means if there is steel in an infrastructure project, it should be made by steelworkers in Youngstown or Lorain, OH, or somewhere in If there is iron in these projects, if there is aluminum in these projects, if there is concrete, if there is any kind of product, if taxpayers are paying for it, it should be made by American workers.  Our blueprint is central to HUD's mission. It includes $100 billion to rebuild Main Street and communities. It includes ideas to address affordable housing challenges, eliminate blighted properties that bring down local property values, and remediate lead hazards that threaten children. We are ready to work on real infrastructure.  As I said, I am going to vote for Ben Carson for Secretary of He is not an inspiring choice, but he is someone who is an accomplished man. I count on him to help us address this terrible lead problem. I count on him to stand with us, as he pledged, to address the scourge of lead. I count on him to uphold the Fair Housing Act and the housing rights of LGBTQ individuals. I count on him to advocate for rental assistance and investment and homelessness. I count on him to push to include housing in the President's infrastructure plan. I count on him to fight the If the President is going to increase defense by $50 billion and cut a whole host of housing and urban programs, I count on this nominee. He promised our committee. He said it. He said it in private meetings. He said it in public meetings. We will hold him accountable. I plan to vote yes.  To reiterate, I rise today to speak on the pending nomination of Benjamin Carson to be the new Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, or  Carson is not the nominee I would have chosen to lead HUD, due to both his lack of direct experience with the housing and community development fields, and his often troubling public statements prior to his nomination.  Despite my reservations, and my disagreements with some of his positions, I will give Carson the benefit of the doubt based on commitments he has made to me in person and to the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee in his testimony and written responses.  This includes Carson's promises to:  Address the scourge of lead hazards that threaten the health and futures of children in Ohio and nationwide; Uphold the Fair Housing Act and the housing rights of LGBTQ individuals; Advocate for rental assistance and investment to end homelessness; And push to include housing in the President's infrastructure plan. Let me be clear: I will do everything in my power to hold Carson accountable for making good on his promises.  Role of As the ranking member of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee responsible for housing policy, I have seen how important the Department is for people in Ohio and across the country.  HUD is charged with enforcing our fair housing laws. It has been an essential partner in our national efforts to prevent and end homelessness for veterans, the chronically homeless, and youth and families.  The Department's primary rental assistance programs help over 4.5 million low-income households of families, the elderly, and people with disabilities find a place to call home.[[Page S1518]]  It assists cities and towns in their efforts to revitalize neighborhoods and invest in communities; and promotes lead-safe, healthy housing for children.  Through the Federal Housing Administration, HUD works with lenders to help creditworthy borrowers access sustainable mortgage credit so they can purchase a home.  The FHA played an essential, countercyclical role in providing mortgage credit following the financial crisis, when the private sector largely withdrew from the field.  It has since receded to its typical share of the housing market, but it is still essential for many homebuyers, including first-time and minority homebuyers.  HUD's role has only become more important as our housing and community development challenges have grown.  The need for affordable housing has grown dramatically since the Great Recession, as demand for rental units has increased and wages have stagnated.  The market alone is not producing sufficient affordable housing for families and those on fixed incomes.  A person with a full-time job would need to earn an hourly wage of $20.30 in order to afford a modest, two-bedroom rental at HUD's national average fair market rent.  This ``housing wage'' is far above the minimum wage, income available to people with disabilities who rely upon Supplemental Security Income, or even the median wage earned by renters.  Studies have demonstrated that people performing essential work--like child care teachers, school bus drivers, and retail workers--are often unable to afford rent in the communities they serve.  Half of all renters--over 21 million households--paid more than 30 percent of their incomes towards housing in 2014. And a quarter of all renters--over 11 million--paid more than half their incomes for rent.  These burdens are more severe at the bottom of the income spectrum. Among extremely low income renter households--those with incomes at or below 30 percent of area median income, 75 percent pay more than half their incomes on rent.  In 2016, the National Low Income Housing Coalition identified a shortage of 7.2 million affordable and available rental units for the nation's ELI renter households.  We are reaching only one out of four eligible families. Many end up on years-long waiting lists for lack of funding.  Despite the growing need for affordable housing, we risk losing the affordable housing resources we have due to physical deterioration or the end of long-term affordability contracts with property owners.  Public housing alone needs an estimated $26 billion in major repairs. HUD estimates that we are losing 10,000 units of public housing every year due to physical obsolescence.  According to Harvard's Joint Center on Housing Studies, nearly 2.2 million units of HUD-assisted and low income housing tax credit-supported housing will reach the end of their affordability periods by 2025. Families burdened by high housing costs have fewer resources available to meet other needs like transportation to work, food, and medicine, and they may even face eviction and homelessness.  Nearly 550,000 people were homeless on a given night in January 2016. Department of Education data, which include families doubled up for economic reasons, indicate that nearly 1.4 million school-age children and their families were homeless at some point during the 2013-2014 school year.  The hardships stemming from evictions and homelessness make it harder for families to climb the economic ladder.  As Matthew Desmond, author of Evicted, points out: ``Eviction is a cause, not just a condition, of poverty.''  Trump Urban Renewal Throughout his campaign, President-elect Trump promised to rebuild America's ``inner cities,'' which he labeled ``hell holes.''  Mr.Trump spelled out his views in his, quote, ``New Deal for Black America, With a Plan for Urban Renewal.''  The plan covers issues such as school choice, investing in law enforcement, tax reform, trade, and infrastructure investment.  At a time when more than 11 million families are paying more than half their income toward rent, and half a million people have no place to call home, the President-elect's plan does not mention this housing crisis.  In addition, cities, like Black Americans, are not monolithic.  In recent years, many cities have seen a wave of population growth and investment that have led to greater economic activity, tighter rental housing markets, and rising rental housing costs.  As a result, many lower-income families and businesses who endured challenging decades in their communities are finding themselves priced out of their long-time neighborhoods just when additional economic opportunities are opening up.  Loss of housing in urban neighborhoods can push residents away from access to jobs, transit, and local support networks such as hospitals and child care.  In many of these neighborhoods, federally-assisted housing may be coming to the end of long-term affordability contracts or at risk of loss due to physical deterioration and HUD will be called on to help low-income people access the opportunity that has finally come to their neighborhoods.  HUD will need to respond to a diverse set of challenges across the country.  Ben Carson is a distinguished pediatric neurosurgeon. His remarkable life story is well known to all of us, and to millions of Americans beyond this room. He is an inspiration and a testament to the American dream.  Carson's experience, while impressive, does not automatically qualify him to lead  In reviewing Carson's nomination, I had the opportunity to question him extensively about his plans as His answers were responsive, in contrast to many of President Trump's nominees.  Carson committed to: Address the scourge of lead paint hazards that threaten the future of too many of Ohio's children; Uphold the Fair Housing Act and housing rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) individuals; Advocate for rental assistance and investment to end homelessness; and Push to include housing in the President's infrastructure plan.  Some of Trump's appointees have taken positions antithetical to the agencies for which they would be responsible. In his testimony, Carson did not seem to be in this camp.  At that hearing, Carson stated that he plans to go on a listening tour across the country and at HUD to learn what is working and what is not. And he promised to surround himself with pragmatic, bipartisan, senior advisers.  He said: ``I will surround myself with people who have a passion for improving the agency, not breaking down its programs.''  In many cases, Carson moderated or reversed controversial positions he had taken previously.  I will discuss a few of the commitments Carson made during our committee process.  Lead Paint Carson promised to work to end the scourge of lead poisoning that threatens the health and futures of too many children in Ohio and across the country.  There is a growing realization that safe, affordable housing is a platform for good health.  Whether that is healthy housing that protects kids from lead and asthma-inducing mold, accessible units that help seniors safely age in place and avoid expensive institutional care, or housing that enables people with disabilities to live in the community.  As Carson said in his written statement: ``There is a strong connection between housing and health . . . Housing (and housing discrimination) is a ``social determinant'' of health . . . These problems occur across America--in cities as well as suburbs and rural areas . . . We cannot have social mobility without a strong healthy foundation in the home.''  When Carson and I met privately, we discussed the tragic effects of lead in Ohio and nationwide. He knows--from a medical perspective--the terrible price that children and society pay for the legacy of lead in water, industrial settings, and, all-too-often, deteriorating paint in their homes.  While we have rightly focused on lead in water in Flint, MI, and Sebring, OH,[[Page S1519]]the most prevalent source of childhood lead poisoning is lead-based paint in homes built before the federal government stepped in to prohibit its use in 1978.  Approximately 23 million older homes have significant lead paint hazards, 3.6 million of which house children under six who are most susceptible to the effects of lead paint poisoning. This is a great challenge in states like mine that have a lot of older homes.  The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that that there are nearly 70 census tracks in Cuyahoga County, where I live, where as many as 1 in 3 children are likely poisoned because of the age and condition of the housing stock.  This is a tragedy not just for these kids and families, but for society. We all absorb the increased costs of medical care, education, criminal justice, and lost economic potential that stem from childhood lead poisoning.  If confirmed, I look forward to working with Carson to address the avoidable tragedy of childhood lead paint poisoning.  Fair Carson pledged to uphold the nation's fair housing laws, which includes the requirement that HUD's grantees affirmatively further fair housing.  At the hearing, Carson was clear about his support for the Fair Housing Act, stating:  I think the Fair Housing [Act] in 1968 was one of the best pieces of legislation we had. It was modified 1988. LBJ said no one could possibly question this, I agree with him.  I asked Carson about a 2015 Washington Times Op-Ed in which he objected to HUD's rule implementing the Fair Housing Act's Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing provision, likening it to a failed socialist experiment.  The rule, which implements a requirement of the Fair Housing Act, was adopted after a two-year public comment period and responds to GAO criticism of HUD's previous guidance in this area.  Carson stated that his op-ed had been ``distorted by many people.'' He went on to say that he has no problem with ``affirmative action or . . . integration'' but that he does have a problem with people dictating policy when they don't know the area when we have ``local HUD officials . . . who can assess what the problems are in their area and, working with local officials, can come up with better solutions.''  The fair housing rule is such a locally driven conversation, because it requires HUD grantees to analyze their own situations and develop locally driven plans to address their fair housing challenges.  Finally, Carson stated in writing that he would enforce the Fair Housing Act and support HUD's 2015 rule.  If Carson were to reverse the fair housing rule, it would violate his commitments at the hearing and in writing.  LGBTQ Housing During the Committee's process, I sought information on Carson's views of the housing rights of LGBTQ individuals.  In the past, Carson has made troubling comments about LGBTQ people that raised questions about whether LGBTQ people should enjoy the same rights as everyone else.  Carson's views in this area are important because the HUD Secretary oversees the housing rights of all Americans, including LGBTQ people. LGBTQ people face housing discrimination, bullying, and an alarmingly high incidence of youth homelessness.  In his written statement, Carson clearly stated that he wants to improve the lives of all families and communities ``no matter their race, creed, color, or orientation.''  In light of his previous statements, my colleague and I asked further questions.  I asked Carson whether he believes that HUD has a duty to take actions that promote equal access to housing opportunities for LGBTQ people. In response, he stated that he believes that ``all Americans . . . should be protected by the law,'' but went on to say that no one gets ``extra rights.''  To clarify his meaning, I asked whether he could think of any instances where protecting equal access to housing opportunities for LGBTQ people would mean providing them ``extra rights.''  His response was ``I cannot.''  I also asked whether he believes that HUD provides ``extra rights'' to LGBTQ people that need to be withdrawn.  His response was ``I do not.''  In other statements, Carson also clearly pledged to protect the LGBTQ community from discrimination and to continue to support and enforce HUD's equal access rules.  These rules ensure that all individuals have equal access to the Department's programs ``without regard to actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity or marital status'' and in accordance with their gender identity.  If Carson is confirmed, any actions that he or the agency take to discriminate against or limit the housing rights of LGBTQ individuals and families would be contrary to his statements to me and the  Rental Carson promised to be an advocate for HUD rental assistance.  During the hearing, Carson backed away from his previous position calling for 10 percent across-the-board cuts to Federal programs as a budget-cutting measure.  At our hearing, Carson noted that he had revised his position to 1 percent across-the board cuts as a way to achieve budget savings. While I do not subscribe to this policy, it shows moderation of Carson's previous position.  With respect to HUD programs, he recognized the value of HUD rental assistance programs in meeting the needs of the lowest income individuals, stating:       When it comes to deep affordability, though, removing all      regulatory barriers won't get you there. It comes down to      subsidy. . . . I think we can all agree that we will all make      sure housing is a key consideration in every appropriations      bill . . . If confirmed I will be a vocal advocate internally      for funding, but prioritization will continue to occur in      this Administration as it did in the last.  Carson also recognized the value of the important safety net provided by HUD programs, stating that ``the rental assistance program is essential'' and that ``safety net programs are important. I would never . . . advocate abolishing them without having an alternative route for people to follow.''  Ending In 2010, Opening Doors, the Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness, set out goals to end homelessness for veterans, the chronically homeless, families, children, and youth and all other homelessness.  Through a combination of bipartisan federal investments in appropriate housing solutions particularly permanent supportive housing for the chronically homeless and HUD-VASH vouchers for veterans and improved practices at the federal and local levels, we have made real progress toward these goals. Since 2010, such investments have helped reduce chronic homelessness by 27 percent and veterans' homelessness by 47 percent.  Yet, more remains to be done.  According to HUD's ``2015 Annual Homeless Assessment Report'' to Congress, approximately 549,928 people were homeless on a given night in January 2016. Nearly 195,000 of the homeless on this night were in families including at least one child.  Stating that ``No one can argue with the goal of ending homelessness,'' Carson said he intends to build on the progress we have made toward ending homelessness. He also said he will ``call for continued investment to end homelessness for veterans, the chronically homeless, and children and families.''  Carson also praised the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, which coordinates Federal efforts to efficiently and effectively combat homelessness and helps facilitate local communities' coordinated efforts.  Housing and The President's promised $1 trillion investment in infrastructure is one of the pillars of the President's Plan for Urban This is an area where I have said I would like to work with the new administration.  Our grandparents built an infrastructure for us that was the envy of the world and became the foundation of our economy for years to come. But after decades of neglect, we need to reinvest.  My colleagues in the Democratic caucus and I are taking the President up on his call for a $1 trillion investment in American infrastructure.[[Page S1520]]  To jump-start the conversation about the President's promise, we announced ``A Blueprint to Rebuild America's Infrastructure.''  This blueprint talks about ways we can invest in American infrastructure to improve the Nation's transportation, water, housing, and community infrastructure while creating thousands of construction and manufacturing jobs in Ohio and across the country.  Our blueprint includes $100 billion to rebuild our main streets and communities, which is central to HUD's mission.  This includes ideas to address affordable housing challenges, eliminate the blighted properties that bring down local property values in neighborhoods, and remediate lead hazards that can set children back for life and increase public costs.  We need to invest in the infrastructure of our communities.  I've talked about the need to address lead-based paint to prevent childhood lead poisoning.  In communities across Ohio and the country, blighted properties are holding our neighborhoods back. They reduce neighbors' property values, reduce tax base necessary to support public services, and create crime and safety threats.  A 2015 report from Policy Matters Ohio estimated Ohio alone would need $750 million to address the State's residential demolition needs.  Our public housing alone needs an estimated $26 billion in repairs.  When we met, Carson said that he is supportive of investing in our public housing infrastructure.  In questions following the hearing, I asked Carson whether he would work with the President to ensure that there is a real infrastructure package to address the needs of our urban and rural communities and that it includes funding for preserving and creating affordable housing.  In response, Carson responded by saying, ``I will absolutely commit to advocating for the inclusion of housing in the President Elect's infrastructure package.''  I look forward to working with Carson to ensure that the administration supports these job-creating investments in our housing and other infrastructure.  Support Despite As I stated at the outset, Carson is not the nominee that I would have chosen to lead  I do not agree with all of his positions.  For example, Carson wants to help people increase their incomes so that they can become self-sufficient. I also believe we should do everything we can to help families escape poverty and find good, middle-class jobs that can sustain a family.  However, Carson seems to believe that this can be done without raising the minimum wage and without the Labor Department's overtime rule that would help 100,000 workers in my state get the pay they deserve. He believes incomes will rise just by creating the right ``environment.''  I believe that the Federal Government should stand on the side of workers rather than advancing a billionaire agenda.  But despite my reservations and my disagreements with some of his positions, I am voting to confirm him, based on the commitments he made to the committee that I discussed here today.  The National Low Income Housing Coalition, or NLIHC, is a leading national organization advocating for safe, affordable housing for low-income people, including the residents of HUD-assisted housing.  NLIHC recently circulated a statement that reads:       Despite our initial concerns about Carson's lack of      experience with and knowledge of the HUD programs that he      would oversee, NLIHC does not oppose his nomination:       As demonstrated in his Senate confirmation hearing, Carson      has clearly taken the time to begin to understand and come to      appreciate the importance of HUD's programs.       Once confirmed, NLIHC is committed to working with      Carson to ensure that the lowest income people in America      have decent, affordable and accessible homes.  In the coming years, I will do everything in my power to hold him to his promises and to advocate for HUD's important work.  I Hope the Administration Helps Him Even if Carson and I shared the exact same views, I would be concerned about what the next few years bodes for HUD and our communities.  On January 23, the Trump administration adopted a hiring freeze and called for a reduction in the Federal workforce.  HUD already experienced the greatest percentage drop in career employees across the government from 2005 through 2014, and now HUD faces the highest percentage career employees eligible to retire by 2019.  According to HUD's FY 2017 budget justifications, ``This retirement wave can cause a loss of leadership and institutional knowledge at all levels.''  Such a loss could also cause a failure to ensure that the Department is upholding its duties to taxpayers by ensuring the quality of federally-assisted housing, fair housing enforcement, and overseeing FHA lending programs, for examples.  Carson says he wants to learn from and be on the side of HUD's career staff. Let's hope the administration gives him sufficient staffing to accomplish his mission.  I am also very concerned about HUD's budget going forward.  The Senate recently confirmed Mick Mulvaney, an ideologue who threatened to default on our debt and wants to gut our retirement safety net, to lead the President's Office of Management and  There have been reports that the administration has been considering using Heritage Foundation budget blueprints as the basis for its budget proposals.  Heritage has proposed budget outlines that would literally zero out the HUD rental assistance programs and the Community Development Block Grant  We are also hearing reports that the Trump administration is making plans to cut nondefense discretionary programs by $54 billion in fiscal year 2018--about a 10 percent cut--in order to fund increased defense spending.  This cut would come on top of the sequestration-related cuts to nondefense discretionary, or NDD, programs that will kick in in FY 2018 if we don't do something to stop them.  NDD programs at HUD have already absorbed cuts. Since 2010, funding for public housing has fallen 21 percent, while funding for the HOME program has fallen by more than 50 percent.  Sequestration cuts in FY 2013 reduced the number of housing vouchers by more than 80,000. In recent years, Congress and local agencies have been able to restore many of these lost vouchers, but further cutbacks will reverse this trend.  At a time when our families are facing growing affordable housing needs, the administration may be considering cuts that would devastate our housing safety net and leave families, seniors, formerly homeless veterans, and communities reeling.  All of this is coming at the same time that they are repealing the ACA and working to repeal rules that protect workers, consumers, and retirees.

727,topic-id,702,"Mr.President, Americans are working longer and Americans are working harder than ever before, with less and less to show for it.  Over the last 40 years, GDP has gone up, corporate profits have gone up, executive salaries have gone up--all because American workers are more productive. Again, GDP is up, corporate salaries are up, corporate profits are up, executive salaries are up--all because of the productivity of American workers. Unfortunately--tragically--a big problem in our society is that workers don't share in the economic growth they have created for their companies.  On Friday, at the John Glenn School in Columbus, I rolled out a plan to do something about it. Instead of working to raise wages, the Senate is debating a measure to give large corporations even more ability, more leeway, more opportunity to shortchange American workers. It is as simple as that. One in five Americans works in a company that does some business with the American We are talking about a rule that affects companies employing as much as one-fifth of the workforce. These workers deserve to be paid what they earn. They deserve safe workplaces, just as all American workers do.  Before this worker protection rule was put in place, nearly one-third of the companies in the United States with the worst safety and health violations were receiving taxpayer dollars in the form of Federal contracts. Federal dollars are going to these companies. They then turn around and hire workers in contract with the government and hire workers and cheat them and shortchange them. These corporations broke the law. They didn't pay their employees what they were owed or they broke health and safety rules. Yet they continue to rake in Federal dollars. That is unfair to workers. It is unfair to the good companies that play by the rules. It is unfair to those who are undercut, competitors that willfully and constantly follow the law. The good companies often are losing out. They are playing by the rules, yet lose out to the companies that aren't.  That is why the Obama administration put in place the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive order. If you want the privilege of doing business with American taxpayers, if you want a contract with the Federal government paid for by taxpayers, you must follow the law. It is as simple as that. That was yesterday. Also, yesterday the rule ensured that workers have accurate information about the hours they work, the overtime pay they can earn, the wages they are being paid--basic things that above-board companies are already doing anyway. That was yesterday.  Today this body is voting to undo that. Why would we want to roll back commonsense worker protections? Why would we reward companies that cheat their workers by giving them more taxpayer dollars? There is only one possible explanation: to make it easier for some big companies to cheat both their own workers and their competitors. When voters reject Washington, it is maneuvers like this they have in mind: Congress watering down rules that protect workers, that protect taxpayers, that let corporations that break the law off the hook.  The President came to Ohio a lot last year. He made a lot of big promises during his campaign. He is already facing a choice on issues like this one. Is he going to keep his promises to working families in Trumbull County, OH, Warren, Mansfield, Toledo, Springfield[[Page S1600]]or is he going to sell them out in favor of the same old corporate billionaire agenda?  The President has come to a fork in the road. He can go down the fork where workers will do better in this administration--make better wages, have a safer workplace--or he can take the other fork in the road that undercuts wages, that shortchanges workers, that makes the workplace less safe. Unfortunately, the President and, I am afraid, this Senate have chosen that fork in the road, the one that undercuts workers and makes the workplace less safe.  I hope my colleagues will join me in rejecting this attempt to undercut American workers.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

1010,topic-id,2197,"Mr.President, the House's plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act is dangerous and irresponsible. Just listen to Governor John Kasich, Republican Governor of my State, who says we should not be throwing 500, 600, 700,000 Medicaid beneficiaries--mostly people who have jobs and work in low-income jobs--we shouldn't throw them off their insurance. In fact, in Ohio there are 900,000 people--700,000 on Medicaid, 100,000 on their parents' healthcare plan, and another 100,000 on the exchanges--who would lose their insurance if the House succeeds and the Senate goes along in changing dramatically or repealing the Affordable Care  My office is flooded with letters and calls from Ohioans begging us not to take away their care. Let me share some of those letters.  A woman from Beachwood, OH, in Northeast Ohio wrote to me on January 11 terrified of possible changes to the Medicaid system that helps fund nursing homes like the one where she lives. She writes:       I strongly believe changes would drastically diminish my      quality of life and many other residents' in the nursing home      setting. My care needs are currently well managed by      qualified and caring staff members. I am a 2-person assist      with dressing, bathing, and getting to the bathroom. I also      require two people with getting dressed every morning.       Medicaid cuts would decrease the number of staff members. .      . . Without adequate staff, I am afraid of extensive wait      periods and frequent bathing accidents. . . . It would be      very difficult to endure, cause embarrassment, while      destroying my dignity in the process.       I am not as strong as I used to be. I have children who      love and care for me and placed me in a safe environment.      Living in the nursing home has allowed me to live a little      better, smile a little longer, and enjoy my days with family      members.  ``Please consider,'' she writes, ``the people who will be affected the most.''  Understand that most Medicaid dollars--dollars that unfortunately Republicans want to block-grant or capitate in some way, whatever terms they want to use here, send to the States, shrink those dollars, and people like this lady from Beachwood will be the losers as a result. Understand again that most Medicaid dollars--two-thirds of them--go to nursing home care. ``Please consider the people who will be affected the most,'' she writes.  Another woman from Mount Vernon, OH, a part of the State where I grew up in Mansfield, wrote to urge us not to rip coverage away from individuals who are currently receiving mental health and addiction services. She writes:       As a constituent concerned about preserving access to      lifesaving mental health and addiction services, I am writing      today to urge and request your support in protecting the      Affordable Care Act and preserving Medicaid expansion.       I work as a substance abuse counselor in Knox County and      work with adolescents and women with co-occurring disorders.      Without the Medicaid expansion, many of our clients would not      be able to get the help they need.  Without ObamaCare, without the Affordable Care       Without the Medicaid expansion, many of our clients would      not be able to get the help they need.  Today in Ohio, 200,000 people are in the midst of opioid addiction treatment, and 200,000 of them have insurance so they could get that treatment delivered in the right way and have insurance because of the Affordable Care This House proposal would just rip it away from them.  She goes on to write:       Knowing that they can receive help and healthcare often is      one of the motivating factors for our clients to begin to      make change. Their ability to access medications such as      Vivitrol through Medicaid has been a strengthening point in      the recovery process of many. With our teens, I have seen      them be able to change substance use with the resources that      Medicaid provides.  In other words, some of them are breaking their addiction and some of them are being cured because of the Affordable Care Act, because they have       Medicaid allows our rural and low-income teens--  And of the 88 counties in Ohio, 70 or so are classified as small town or rural, like the county I grew up in, Richland County--     many of whom otherwise would not be able to attend treatment      due to transportation barriers--to attend treatment through      public transportation. Working with these clients, you learn      their stories. So many have been through unimaginable trauma,      losses, and emotional/physical pain. Many have never had the      support to help them begin to work through these issues      underlying the substance use.  She is worried. The lady in Mount Vernon, OH, is worried, with very good reason, that these repeal plans would ``leave millions of Americans without access to needed mental health and addictions treatment in our state and communities.''  Most recently, a woman in Butler County--the congressional district of former Speaker John Boehner and some members of my staff, past and present--writes:       I am extremely concerned about the cuts President Trump and      the Republican-led Congress propose to make in the Medicaid      program and services for the developmentally disabled.  Her son is 14 years old. He was diagnosed with a specific type of autism. He is nonverbal, with severe cognitive and physical challenges. She wrote to my office how Medicaid has been ``a godsend'' for her and her family. Before her son received a waiver under the Medicaid Program, her family was spending $100 a month in copays for psychiatric medications alone. That is in addition to all the extra medical costs in caring for a severely challenged child. They couldn't afford the physical therapy he needs, despite having insurance coverage through her husband's employer. She wrote that Medicaid ``more than anything else, improved the quality of my son's life, and by extension, the life of our whole family.''  Understand that health challenges--especially mental health challenges but health challenges overall--in one member of a family afflict the whole family. That is something we should remember as this Congress seems to rush pell-mell into trying to repeal Medicare, trying to repeal the Affordable Care  These three letters are three of hundreds of thousands that we received--hundreds of thousands of letters and calls that Members of the Senate are receiving. I don't understand how, when 20 million people will lose their insurance, so many Members of Congress, who themselves have government-financed health insurance--we have health insurance in this body paid for by taxpayers, most of us. Yet we think it is appropriate to pass legislation in part giving tax cuts to the richest Americans and at the same time stripping away Medicare benefits, taking 22 million people who now have insurance off of that insurance and proposing minor insurance for some of them but not nearly all of them. If we are people of God, if we are people who care about our constituents, how we can do that is just beyond me.  I go back to the quote from one of the people I read about today from She writes: ``Please consider the people who will be affected the most.''                  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  Mr.President, President Trump declared this week Consumer Protection Week, but his proclamation has gaping holes. It ignores the many ways large corporations cheat consumers and the biggest tool Americans have to fight back.  Not once did the proclamation mention the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has returned $12 billion to 29 million consumers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created under Dodd-Frank 8 or 9 years ago. Not once does it talk about the unscrupulous lenders who targeted Americans with predatory mortgages before blowing up the economy in 2007 and 2008. Not once does the President's Consumer Protection Week proclamation mention the millions of fake accounts opened by Wells Not once does it mention the shady outfits that set up shop outside the gates of our military bases and the payday[[Page S1632]]lenders and other unscrupulous lenders who set up shop outside the gates of the military bases because they aren't allowed on the military bases as they try to exploit our service men and women and their families.  Not only did the President ignore some of the most pressing consumer protection issues, his administration is attacking the most important consumer advocate indeed--the Consumer Financial Protection  Last week, President Trump's Department of Justice filed papers in Federal court signaling that it will argue that the CFPB shouldn't be independent. The President and White House want the CFPB under their control so they can weaken it, so they can help Wall Street, so they can take away some of its power. They think the President should have the power to fire the head of the agency for any reason.  The whole reason we wrote it to be independent was to protect it from a President who chose Wall Street over Main It was Presidential Candidate Trump who sounded pretty good standing up to Wall Street and helping Main If you look at the nominees, his appointments, and his actions so far, it has been exactly the opposite. He has been the president of Wall Street and at the same time exploiting Main It means that what the President has proposed is that the President can fire his director for doing his job: stepping on the toes of special interests.  The CFPB works in part because it has an independent The current Director of the CFPB, Richard Cordray from Ohio, has protected consumers, has returned billions to Americans who were cheated and who were taken advantage of by big companies.  The CFPB has an independent budget. Banks can't kill it by lobbying it and cutting off its budget. That is the point. People whom he has in many cases recovered money from because he represents consumers--those banks, those large Wall Street banks and other financial institutions, because of the way it is set up, can't lobby Congress to take money away from it and put it out of business. Special interests have relentlessly attacked the CFPB since the day we created it.  President Trump ran on the promise of protecting the little guy, but he hasn't followed through on the promise of protecting ordinary Americans from some of the wealthiest, most privileged special interests in this town.  If you are one of the 29 million Americans who received help from CFPB, you might know how important saving it is, but you might not know how important it is to especially protecting one group of people, and that is protecting our veterans and our servicemembers. The CFPB has an entire office that is dedicated to helping men and women who have served in uniform--the Office of Servicemember  A couple of weeks ago, my Rhode Island Senator friend, Jack Reed, was in the Armed Services Committee with the senior enlisted advisers of military services--the Army, Air Force, Navy, Their job is to make sure our servicemembers and their families are getting the support they need. Every one of them had great things to say about the CFPB's Office of Servicemember Affairs--of the value it provides and the support it provides to the men and women who sacrifice so much for our country.  Senator Reed brought up an alarming figure. A recent report estimated that thousands of servicemembers are forced out of service every year because of financial hardships--problems with their mortgages, with payday loans, with credit card debt. One will remember earlier in the presentation that I talked about how many of these financial groups set up right outside military bases. That causes a tragedy for these men and women who want to serve their country, and it causes tragedy for their families. It costs taxpayers $57,000 every time someone is forced out of service. Many other servicemembers lose their security clearances because of financial trouble, which directly affects the mission readiness that is brought on by shady business practices.  The CFPB is stepping in to protect these heroes who are often taken advantage of. The CFPB's Office of Servicemember Affairs is led by men and women who have served in the military and know what kind of help servicemembers need. They visit 145 military facilities across the country in order to help servicemembers get their finances straightened out and to hear about their concerns. They have handled 70,000 complaints from servicemembers and veterans about abusive practices by financial institutions. They have returned $130 million back to servicemembers and their families simply by enforcing the law and protecting those consumers.  The CFPB protects the men and women who protect our country. It protects all of us. The best way to celebrate Consumer Protection Week is not through words and proclamations, it is through actions.  We need to combat cyber crimes and identity theft, as the President mentioned, but we also need to combat all kinds of tricks and traps--loans with outrageous interest rates, for-profit colleges that promise far more than they deliver, lenders who discriminate based on race. The list goes on and on.  I urge my colleagues to join me in working to ensure that the CFPB remains a strong, active ally in the cause of consumer protection this week, next week, every week.

H.1009 already codifies and improves upon the practices of the Office of Information and Regulatory My amendment strengthens the language even further, requiring OIRA to hold Federal agencies accountable for coordinating and consulting with State, local, and tribal governments before issuing new regulations. In other words, we are giving governors, local officials, and tribal leaders a say in the regulations that affect them. These local officials know what their communities need much better than the bureaucrats in  Unfortunately, our Federal agencies have a habit of issuing regulations and policies without consulting local and State governments. For example, we just need to look at the EPA waters of the United States rule.[[Page H1440]]  Historically, States have had significant authority over water management. Governors have worked with local and tribal leaders to set up their own laws and regulations to ensure that water is properly allocated, that water meets certain quality standards, and that water in their State is protected from misuse.  The EPA's WOTUS rule is excessive and burdensome because they disregarded the role of the States in crafting waterway regulations. The agency held no substantive consultation with State governments prior to issuing the rule, despite States' historical roles in regulating their water supplies, despite the State-level experts who could have helped the EPA craft a better regulation, despite President Clinton's Executive Order 13132 ensuring that Federal agencies consult with State, local, and tribal officials before issuing a rule.  Federal officials never gave State, local, and tribal officials the opportunity to explain how their States were currently handling the situation and how this rule could negatively impact their jurisdictions. Since the EPA bureaucrats barreled ahead without State, local, or tribal input, they proposed an overreaching rule.  This amendment would require the EPA and other Federal agencies to account for how proposed rules will affect impacted States, localities, and tribes.  The amendment under consideration simply requires Washington to listen to and learn from local governments because local governments are closer to the people. And the people of this Nation should have a say in the rules and regulations that are affecting their livelihoods.  In closing, this amendment is simple.

126,topic-id,611,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.83, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, America's workers deserve responsible, commonsense, regulatory policies to ensure safe and healthy working conditions. Let me say that again. America's workers deserve responsible, commonsense regulatory policies to ensure safe and healthy working conditions.  They deserve a Federal Government that holds bad actors accountable, and a government that takes proactive steps to help employers improve safety protections and prevent injuries and illnesses before they occur. Just as importantly, they deserve to know that Federal agencies are following the law.  For years, Republicans have called on OSHA to reject a top-down approach to worker protections and, instead, collaborate with employers to identify gaps in safety and address the unique challenges facing workplaces.  Unfortunately, under the Obama administration, our concerns usually fell on deaf ears. In fact, one of the administration's parting gifts to workers and small businesses was a regulatory scheme that reflects not only a backwards, punitive approach to workplace safety, but one that is completely unlawful.  Here's why. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, employers have long been required to record injuries and illnesses and retain those records for 5 years. The law explicitly provides a 6-month window under which OSHA can issue citations to employers who fail to maintain proper records; 6 months. It is written in the law. This approach helps ensure workplace hazards are addressed in a timely manner.  However, in 2006, OSHA took action against Volks Constructors for recordkeeping errors that occurred well beyond what the law allows, well beyond 6 months. The errors were from nearly 5 years earlier. That is why a Federal appeals court unanimously rejected OSHA's overreach. The opinion for the Court stated: ``We do not believe Congress expressly established a statute of limitations only to implicitly encourage the Secretary to ignore it.'' Even President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Garland, agreed OSHA's action was ``not reasonable.''  What came next was an outright power grab. OSHA decided to take its unlawful action one step further. This time it would not only ignore the law, but rewrite it. The agency finalized the ``Volks'' rule, unilaterally extending the statute of limitations from 6 months to 5 years. OSHA undertook for itself the power that only this Congress has to write laws.  The agency created significant regulatory confusion for small businesses. Many would likely face unwarranted litigation because of unlawful regulatory policies. Of course, further judicial scrutiny also means hardworking taxpayers will foot the bill when OSHA is forced to defend its lawless power grab once again.  Simply put, OSHA had no authority to do this. We have a Constitution that grants Congress, not Federal agencies, the power to write the law. But that is not the only reason we are here today. We are also here because this rule does nothing to improve workplace safety.  Maintaining injury and illness records is vitally important and can help enhance worker protections. But that is not the goal of this rule. This rule only serves to punish employers. As we have said repeatedly, OSHA should, instead, collaborate with employers to help them understand their legal responsibilities and ensure safe measures are in place to prevent workplace hazards in the future.  Fortunately, Congress has the authority to reject this failed approach to workplace safety and block an abuse of executive power that began under the Obama administration.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I hope we can all work together to encourage a more proactive approach that prevents injuries and illnesses from happening in the first place.

127,topic-id,414,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to read very briefly a quote from the court's decision: ``We find this statute to be clear and the agency's interpretation unreasonable in any event''--in any event.  There is no way to rewrite this regulation to comply with the law that is clear. There is no way for the agency's interpretation to become reasonable. It is unreasonable according to the court in any event.  My friend from Virginia talked about the fact that OSHA just updated the regulation to impose a continuing obligation. OSHA does not have that authority. Only this Congress has that authority. No agency can unilaterally decide to change a statutory provision that the court has said is clear. He said this applies to only a few categories of employers. It applies to nearly every category of employers that has 10 employees or more. So you could have an employer with 50 employees, and they are subject to this regulation. This applies to virtually any employer.  OSHA has 6 months to enforce this law--6 months--from any violation. Now, why 6 months? Because it is important to investigate these things quickly and determine whether there has been a violation because things get lost and people leave their employment. Congress made the decision for 6 months because that was a period of time in which OSHA could perform its duties reasonably, and we could get justice the way it ought to be done.  We can amend OSHA, but we have not chosen to do so. Until this Congress chooses to change OSHA, the agency has to comply with the clear wording of the statute as it has been passed by this The agency does not have the right to do this. It would be a waste of taxpayer money and time to force an employer to go challenge this in court when we already know what the result is going to be. It is not up to the committee or to the Congress to go back and review an agency interpretation we know, as a matter of law, is wrong.  So this is a responsible act to take, and I would suggest to the agency and to my fellow Members of Congress that if we want to reconsider a statute of limitations we do it on this floor and not in that agency.

129,topic-id,1644,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the gentleman from Virginia referred to continuing violations. There is no provision in this law for continuing violations.  Looking again at the court's decision. They said this: the statute of limitation provides that ``no citation may be issued . . . after the expiration of six months following the occurrence of any violation.''  They go on to say this: ``Like the Supreme Court, we think the word `occurrence' clearly refers to a discrete antecedent event--something that `happened' or `came to pass' `in the past.' ''  By any common definition, there was no occurrence; i.e., no discrete action, event, or incident, no coming about, and no process of happening within the requisite 6 months. You can't take that wording and slip into it a continuing violation requirement unless you change the statute. The agency can't change the statute.  The court, in its decision on the Volks rule, also looked at something very important, and that is: Why do we require this agency to do its work in a good period of time?  It says: ``Nothing in this statute suggests Congress sought to endow this bureaucracy with the power to hold a discrete record-making violation over employers for years, and then cite the employer long after the opportunity to actually improve the workplace has passed.''  In other words, we gave the agency 6 months to do its job, and it should do its job.  Now, other people have looked at this, people who are experts in workplace safety. I refer you, Mr.Speaker, to a letter that was written on October 27, 2015, by the American Society of Safety Engineers, which I include in the                                               American Society of                                             Safety Engineers,                                 Park Ridge, IL, October 27, 2015.     Re ASSE Comments on OSHA Notice of Proposed Rule          Clarification of Employer's Continuing Obligation to Make          and Maintain an Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury          and Illness [Docket No: OSHA-2015-0006].     David Michaels,     Assistant Secretary, Occupational Safety and Health          Administration, OSHA Docket Office, U.Department of          Labor, Washington,       Dear Assistant Secretary Michaels: As you well know, the      more than 37,000 member safety, health and environmental      (SH&E) professionals of the American Society of Safety      Engineers (ASSE) intimately know the details of collecting      workplace injury and illness data, recording that data for      employers, and the careful work needed to report that data to      the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).      Perhaps more than any stakeholders, our members understand      the value of this data in managing workplace safety and      health risks as well as its appropriate use by OSHA in      developing better means to focus the agency's resources on      the most difficult risks facing American workers. Our members      use injury and illness data to help them protect workers.      They expect no less of an effective       That being said, ASSE cannot support the requirement that      employers have a duty to record an injury or illness      continues for the full duration of the rccord-retention-and-     access period--five years after the end of the[[Page H1425]]     calendar year in which the injury or illness became      recordable--that OSHA proposes in its July 29, 2015 Notice of      Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) Clarification of Employer's      Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record      of Each Recordable Injury and Illness [Docket No: OSHA-2015-     0006]. ASSE respectfully opposes the adoption of a Final Rule      as proposed in this rulemaking for the reasons that follow.                          nature of violations       ASSE members do not look at the issues raised in this      rulemaking with the same viewpoint of the occupational safety      and health bar that, no doubt, will provide substantive legal      arguments against the case OSHA makes for addressing the      Volks II decision through this rulemaking. Rather, our      members' view is a practical one that comes from years of      experience on the job as the professionals charged with      meeting OSHA's recordkeeping requirements.       Our members know the inadvertent mistakes they themselves      can make in recordkeeping and reporting. They also know what      they typically find when they are hired by a company to help      improve workplace safety and health. As they assess the      workplace's risks and past safety performance to help them      develop safety and health management plans, the reporting      mistakes our members typically find are not very often the      worst cases that, unfortunately, seem to be creating this      rulemaking. The errors in reporting they see are, by far,      minor, isolated, and, if continuing, it is only in the sense      that a typo can be repeated day after day.       They also see mistakes that come from a widespread lack of      understanding of OSHA's detailed reporting requirements. When      seasoned safety and health professionals consistently use      ASSE's educational conferences, our social media, and      opportunities to meet with OSHA staff through the ASSE-OSHA      Alliance to get the best and latest information about OSHA      recordkeeping requirements, we know that, even for them, the      task of meeting those requirements can be too often      confusing. Given that the vast majority of employers report      to OSHA without the help of a safety and health professional,      it is not difficult to see that the significant increase in      records retention that OSHA is attempting to require of      employers here will not succeed in a significant impact on      safety and health among American workers.                        unintended consequences       No reporting error is excusable. But a company's errors to      which OSHA is determined to have access to for a period that      can be up to six years through this rulemaking will not very      often correlate to the risks facing workers, especially the      risks a safety and health professional is trying to address      for the company in the present. The statements OSHA makes      about the value of data collected through current injury and      illness recordkeeping are merely conclusory and are counter      to our members' experience.       Measured against our members' belief that the additional      data will provide little help to them or OSHA, they are      particularly concerned that this rulemaking can only succeed      in driving more employers towards greater expectations that      safety and health professionals will focus energy and      resources on collecting and reporting the lagging indicators      that OSHA requires, taking them away from risk assessment and      management tasks and their efforts to move their employers      towards performance measurements based on leading indicators      that we know can better measure a company's safety and health      performance.       Many of our members, especially those who work in or for      mid-sized and small companies, face a difficult uphill climb      in selling their employers risk management and moving from      lagging to leading indicates. We know OSHA values these      approaches also. But when OSHA uses its limited resources to      focus on measures that do not reflect cutting-edge safety      principles and push our members' efforts backwards, OSHA is      making their job more difficult. Our members value OSHA but      want an OSHA that works with them to advance the best ideas      for advancing workplace safety and health. Requiring this      data to be available for OSHA's use for nearly six years does      not meet our members' hope for an effective                             direct burden       ASSE is also concerned that the OSHA's estimates of the      direct burden this rulemaking will place on employers are      inadequate. The economic analysis states that there will not      be a new cost burden. This was based on a 2001 analysis that      it takes 0.38 hour to record an injury or illness, with a      total cost per case of $17.75. From an informal survey of      involved ASSE members, a more realistic estimate is that an      hour is needed for each case over the five-year period,      taking into account the variety of tasks involved, including      determining if there was medical treatment beyond first aid,      verifying lost and restricted day counts, and adjusting for      changes in the status of a case. An updated economic analysis      is needed, which we urge OSHA to conduct before a Final Rule      is proposed.                        a measure of the problem       Related to our members' concern over the rulemaking's      direct burdens on employers is OSHA's failure to discuss in      the NPR why OSHA faces such difficulty in obtaining adequate      data from employers. No doubt, employers are responsible for      meeting OSHA's reporting requirements. Our members suspect      that OSHA's reporting rules and. deadlines are not effective      and cost employers unnecessarily.       Before requiring more extensive reporting, it would be      helpful both to OSHA and the safety and health community to      know more about why employers do not report. How many      employers blatantly disregard the requirements and how many      are simply making errors? What do employers and their workers      not understand about the requirements? What training or level      of expertise would help fill the gaps in reporting that OSHA      believes exist? We urge OSHA to examine these issues as an.      extension of its economic analysis. With more knowledge,      there may be better ways to address recordkeeping that can      support better employer reporting.                               conclusion       As we say above, our members want a strong and effective      OSHA, But their view of an effective OSHA is an OSHA that can      embrace the best our members already understand about how to      achieve safe and healthy workplaces. An OSHA injury and      illness prevention plan standard that is truly risk-based      would help make OSHA more effective. Greater reliance on      control banding to achieve better protection limits, as we      have recently suggested to OSHA, would. Establishing      professional competencies to define ``competent person'' in      OSHA standards would. Finding a better way to update      consensus standards in OSHA's standards would. Rethinking      OSHA's reporting requirements to help move employers towards      leading indicators and more advanced ways to measure safety      performance certainly would. The areas where OSHA and our      members agree on making OSHA more effective are many. Adding      lengthier reporting burdens that will do little to help OSHA,      employers or occupational safety and health professionals      better manage workplace safety and hcalth will not.       As always, ASSE is more than willing to discuss these      concerns further. Thank you for listening to our members'      views.           Sincerely,                                             Michael Belcher, CSP,                                                         ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1421.txt,2197,"OIRA INSIGHT, REFORM, AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT",2017.0,1.0,March

At its core, the Volks Rule is an extreme abuse of      authority by a federal agency that will subject millions of      American businesses to citations for paperwork violations,      while doing nothing to improve worker health and safety.      Finalized on December 19, 2016, the rule attempts to extend      to five years the explicit six month statute of limitations      on recordkeeping violations in the Occupational Safety and      Health (OSH) Act of 1970. This regulation simultaneously      represents one of the most egregious end runs around      Congress' power to write the laws and a clear challenge to      the judicial branch's authority to prevent an agency from      exceeding its authority to interpret the law.       In 2012, citing the unambiguous language in the OSH Act,      the U.Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held      that OSHA could not sustain citations against an employer for      alleged recordkeeping violations that occurred more than six      months before the issuance of the citation because, as the      employer asserted, they were outside the six month statute of      limitations set forth in the OSH The court was      unequivocal in its rebuke of Judge Janice Rogers Brown      expressed particular concern on the issue of the agency's      overstepping its authority: ``we were rightly troubled by the      notion of being asked by an agency to expand that agency's      enforcement authority when Congress had evidently not seen      fit to do so.'' Judge Merrick Garland, in his concurrence,      plainly rejected OSHA's rationale for issuing the fines,      ``the Secretary's contention--that the regulations that Volks      was cited for violating support a `continuing violation'      theory--is not reasonable.'' The Volks decision has since      been endorsed by the Fifth Circuit in the Delek decision,      issued in December 2016, where the court found ``its      reasoning persuasive.''[[Page H1426]]       In response to the Court of Appeals ruling, OSHA      promulgated this regulation specifically to negate the Volks      case ruling and extend liability for paperwork violations      beyond the six month window permitted under the OSHA      issued the final rule in the waning days of President Obama's      Administration with an effective date of January 19, 2017.      Although the regulation was issued in December, it was not      submitted to Congress until January 4, meaning that the      window for CRA consideration is for a regulation that has      just been issued, and is therefore shorter than if it was      being considered under the ``reset'' provisions of the       We urge you to help put a stop to OSHA's abuse of its      authority and support swift passage of a joint resolution of      disapproval for this burdensome, unlawful rule. Because the      final rule directly contradicts both clear statutory language      and two U.Courts of Appeals rulings, it must not be      allowed to stand.

Re AGC Key Vote--Support Joint Resolution Disapproving of          ``Volks Rule.''     Paul Ryan,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan: On behalf of the Associated General      Contractors of America (AGC) and its 26,000 commercial      construction company members, I strongly urge you to support      the Congressional Review Act (CRA) joint resolution of      disapproval to stop the Occupational Safety and Health      Administration's (OSHA) expansion of the statute of      limitations for recordkeeping violations in the ``Volks      Rule.'' AGC will score this vote as a key vote for the      education of its members on its congressional candidate      scorecards.       This resolution repeals a rule that was issued by OSHA as a      challenge to the judicial branch and congressional authority.      Section 9 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act      subsection (c) says ``No citation may be issued under this      section after the expiration of six months following the      occurrence of any violation.'' That seems pretty clear and      the courts agreed. In 2012, the U.Court of Appeals for the      District of Columbia Circuit held in AKM LLC dba Volks      Constructors v. Secretary of Labor that section 8(c) of the      OSH Act (the section that requires accurate recordkeeping)      does not supersede 9(c) and therefore does not permit a      continuing violation for paperwork errors and that the agency      is overstepping its authority. Additionally, in 2016 the      Fifth Circuit endorsed the Volks decision in Delek      v. Occupational Safety & Health Review When OSHA      issued its rule, it deliberately and specifically designed      the rule to counter the ruling in the Volks case. Because the      final rule directly contradicts both clear statutory language      and two U.Courts of Appeals rulings, it must not be      allowed to stand.       The rule is designed to be punitive. It is a regulatory      attempt to expand opportunities to cite companies for      paperwork violations. It was issued in the waning days of the      Obama Administration as an attempt to get around the existing      statute of limitations for recordkeeping violations and      expand that limitation to sixty-six months. It creates no new      recordkeeping requirements. It does not change the data      required under recordkeeping requirements. It does not exempt      smaller companies from this regulation or these      investigations. It does not create any new, safer work      practices. The rule tells OSHA inspectors and company      employees to fix typos from years ago rather than walking the      jobsite, providing safety training or otherwise preventing      tomorrow's accidents. We take worker safety very seriously      and, unfortunately, OSHA's rule would require a colossal      misallocation of resources. That is why we urge you to      support the Congressional Review Act resolution.       Thank you for your consideration of this request.

ABC urges you      to vote ``yes'' on H.83 and will consider this a KEY      VOTE for our 115th Congressional       Currently, the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act      clearly states the statute of limitations for recordkeeping      violations is six months. The D.Circuit Court of Appeals      also unanimously issued a decision holding OSHA could not      issue a citation for a recordkeeping violation beyond the      six-month statute of limitations, and it was later endorsed      by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in the Delek case. The      Obama administration's final rule not only contradicts the      clear statutory language of the OSH Act, but also two federal      appeals courts.       Nullifying the ``Volks'' rule does not remove an employer's      obligation to record injuries or illnesses. OSHA still has      the right to cite employers for a recordkeeping violation      under the OSH ABC members understand that safety and      health practices are inherently good for business; however,      this rulemaking does nothing to improve workplace safety and      is simply a paperwork burden. OSHA's promulgation of this      rulemaking is a clear overstepping of its authority and a      contradiction of the OSH Act and U.Court of Appeals      decisions.       We urge you to SUPPORT H.83 and we thank Byrne      for introducing this important resolution and look forward to      working with Congress to restore the rule of law.

Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan:  On behalf of the more than 140,000      members of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB),      I write in strong support of H.Res 83. This important      legislation will disapprove OSHA's Volks Rule, which is      nothing more than a regulatory end run around Congress and      the courts. If this rule is not disapproved, small businesses      will be subject to recordkeeping paperwork violations that do      nothing to improve worker safety. NAHB is designating support      for passage of H.Res 83 as a KEY       Finalized on December 19, 2016, the rule attempts to extend      to five years the explicit six-month statute of limitations      on recordkeeping paperwork violations in the Occupational      Safety and Health (OSH) Act of 1970. Subsequent court rulings      have affirmed applicability of the six-month statute of      limitations; nonetheless, the Agency proceeded with its      rulemaking. This regulation is an egregious end run around      Congress' power to write the laws and a clear challenge to      the judicial branch's authority to prevent an agency from      exceeding its authority to interpret the law.       Given the vast overstep the Volks Rule represents, one      might expect significant gains in worker health and safety as      the result. Unfortunately, that is simply not the[[Page H1430]]     case. The Volks regulation only changes the window during      which OSHA can issue a citation for recordkeeping paperwork      violations. Employers will have the exact same obligation to      record injuries as they always had, and OSHA will have the      exact same opportunity to issue a citation as the statute has      always permitted. The regulation is about paperwork      violations and does nothing to improve worker health and      safety.       NAHB urges you to support H.Res 83, and designates a      vote in support of H.Res 83 as a KEY           Sincerely,     James Tobin                                  ____                                     U.Chamber of Commerce,                                Washington, DC, February 28, 2017.     Re Key Vote Alert!       To the Members of the United States Congress: The U.     Chamber of Commerce supports H.83, which would      invalidate the regulation issued by the Occupational Safety      and Health Administration (OSHA) entitled ``Clarification of      an Employer's Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an      Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury and Illness,'' and      will consider including votes related to it in our 2017 How      They Voted scorecard.       The rule would have the effect of extending to five years      the statute of limitations on recordkeeping violations that      the Occupational Safety and Health Act sets at six months. It      was OSHA's attempt to negate a 2012 decision from the D.     Circuit Court of Appeals involving a construction company      known as Volks The decision blocked OSHA from      sustaining citations for recordkeeping violations that      occurred beyond the six month statute of limitations      specified in the Occupational Safety and Health The      court's unanimous 3-0 ruling included Judge Merrick       The court unequivocally rebuked OSHA, expressing particular      concern on the agency's overstepping its authority: ``We do      not believe Congress expressly established a statute of      limitations only to implicitly encourage the Secretary to      ignore it . . . The Act clearly renders the citations      untimely, and the Secretary's argument to the contrary relies      on an interpretation that is neither natural nor consistent      with our precedents.'' The Volks decision has since been      endorsed by the Fifth Circuit in the Delek decision, issued      in December 2016, where the court found ``its reasoning      persuasive.''       OSHA's Volks Rule will improperly subject millions of      American businesses to citations for paperwork violations,      while doing nothing to improve worker health and safety. It      simultaneously represents a usurpation of Congress' power to      write the laws and a direct rejection of the judicial      branch's authority to rein in an agency when it exceeds its      authority.       The Chamber urges you to vote in favor of H.83, to      invalidate OSHA's Volks regulation and restore the statute of      limitations for citations enacted by           Sincerely,                                                      Jack  ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1421.txt,2197,"OIRA INSIGHT, REFORM, AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT",2017.0,1.0,March
137,topic-id,428,"All of those groups I just mentioned support the repeal of this regulation that would come about by virtue of the bill that is before us. Why? Because we have a right to expect in this country that these regulatory agencies that Congress sets up will do their job with the significant sums of taxpayer money that they are provided by this Congress, the money that comes from the people of America to do their job in a timely fashion. And this agency comes forth and tries to act like it doesn't have the money or the authority to investigate violations and enforce the law within 6 months of a violation. That is balderdash. The American people have a right to expect more from these agencies than that.  But more to the point, the reason we are here today is really simple. We are here today to overturn a rule that is blatantly unlawful. We are here to put a stop to a rule that does nothing--I repeat nothing--to improve workplace safety. We are here to put a check on the very top of executive overreach the Congressional Review Act sought to address.  By blocking this punitive and overreaching rule, we will affirm Congress' commitment to proactive health and safety policies that help prevent injuries and illnesses before they occur. If we wait until the illness or injury has occurred, we have waited too late. OSHA has waited too late. It is time for OSHA to work with these employers, work with these people in the workplace to make the workplace safe, not show up 5 years after the fact when they don't have the authority and say: now we are going to issue a violation.  Mr.Speaker, the approach that we have demanded of OSHA for years is to proactively work in the workplace to ensure that it is safe, and we will continue to do that under this new administration.

The American people deserve for us to do a good job of digging into the backgrounds of the various nominees so that the people know who exactly the President has chosen to run these important government agencies. We are going to continue this process both for Cabinet-level nominees and also those nominated to serve in sub-Cabinet positions.  I am here today to speak about the nominee to serve as Secretary of Energy--Governor Rick Perry of Most people probably remember Governor Perry for his famous quip during a Presidential debate during which he announced he wanted to get rid of three agencies, but could not remember that the Department of Energy was one of them.  So he became famous for forgetting that he wanted to abolish the Department of In some ways, this allowed everyone to focus on exactly how important the Department of Energy is to our The Department's vital missions not only help us with the R&D of the future, but also with our national security. The national laboratories that are overseen by the Department drive our leadership in a global economy. They are based on innovation and play a vital role across the Nation for people who rely on affordable and efficient energy to heat their homes, run their appliances, and connect to the internet.[[Page S1554]]  The Department of Energy safeguards our nuclear arsenal. It also is responsible for cleaning up the waste generated by our nuclear weapons complex facilities that helped us win World War II and the cold war. The Department also plays a key role in protecting our energy infrastructure from cyber attacks. It also makes important contributions to our understanding of climate science, enabling the collection and management of data needed to understand our changing environment and is a major driver of innovation.  Before Mr.Perry was even nominated, the transition team was already targeting Department of Energy climate scientists. The transition team sought a list of those Department employees and contractors that had worked on climate change issues during the Obama This came across as an attempt to try to shut down those climate scientists and target them in a Trump  Silencing scientists is outrageous. We need an Energy Secretary who is not only going to protect the scientists who work at DOE no matter what their responsibility is but who is also going to make sure we use that important data for research and for mitigating the impacts of climate change on our coastal communities and pristine areas. Climate change is already producing significant impacts in the State of Washington and throughout the We need scientists working on this issue to get our States and local governments the best data and information possible.  As I previously mentioned, the Department of Energy is also an important driver of innovation. There is so much happening in the areas of smart buildings and modernizing our grid and resiliency and energy efficiency.  The thing that concerned me most about Governor Perry was his unwillingness to commit wholeheartedly to preserving the Electricity Office and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy within the We need these offices and their R&D so that the U.can continue to create jobs in our growing energy economy.  Continued aggressive research and development is necessary if we are going to become more energy efficient and consumers are going to have access to reliable and affordable electricity. We need a Secretary who is going to emphatically push the Trump administration in the proper direction. That is exactly what we wanted to hear from Governor Perry in the Energy committee. Four members of the committee asked about his commitment to these programs. Unfortunately, the nominee dodged the questions. I followed up with Governor Perry after his confirmation hearing, and he still failed to provide a commitment to fight for these important programs. So I regret that I will not be able to support this nominee.  We need to make sure that the United States will continue to support the R&D, the scientists, the investments in electric grid modernization, and the investments in cyber security that are going to help make our Nation safe and our economy strong. I urge my colleagues to oppose this nomination, and I hope that we can move forward on making sure that we have an aggressive energy strategy for the future.

580,topic-id,1882,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague for coming to the floor and for her statement on this important issue. She and I are partners in making sure that Hanford waste is cleaned up. We so much want to continue to make progress on this important issue for our Having dealt[[Page S1555]]with previous Energy Secretaries, we know that it is always a fight to make sure that Hanford gets the priority it deserves, so I thank her for that.  I want to resume my comments about the key functions the Department of Energy performs and why it is vitally important that the agency succeeds in its missions, rather than be dismantled by a President who may not understand the significance of the work the Department does.  I am speaking specifically about the Department of Energy's programs to enhance our energy efficiency, promote renewable energy innovation, mobilize, modernize and bolster the security of our electricity grid, and continue to make significant advancements in science. I have spoken to Governor Perry on a couple of occasions, but, as I mentioned earlier, I failed to hear him commit to these essential DOE programs.  Our Nation's energy sector is undergoing an unbelievable transformation from fossil fuels. These changes are giving consumers more choice and lower energy bills and producing a more robust job-creation environment.  There are now 2.2 million Americans who work in the energy efficiency industry alone. In fact, energy efficiency accounted for 14 percent of all new jobs created in this country last year. That is an incredible number. We need to continue making investments in smart cars and smart buildings and homes of the future and how they are going to be integrated to reduce energy use and lower bills.  We just had a hearing this morning in the Commerce Committee and talked about broadband and white space and the continued development of the mobile economy and how we need to continue to take advantage of those advancements, particularly in rural communities.  The solar power workforce is also growing at a rapid rate. Last year, 1 out of every 50 new jobs in the United States was from solar power. The solar industry now employs more people than the oil and gas extraction or coal mining industries. These are important economic sectors.  In the last administration, the Energy Department's Quadrennial Energy Review estimated that 1.5 million new energy jobs will need to be filled, many of which will be in emerging energy technologies that will help define our clean energy economy. There are approximately 60,000 people in my home State of Washington who are employed in the clean energy sector. In fact, clean energy employment is growing twice as fast as the overall job rate in the State of  We have made too much progress, we have come too far in continuing to advance these important technologies to reverse course now. These advancements are going to help drive more savings and efficiency for consumers and businesses so they can be competitive. We must have leadership at the Department of Energy making sure that progress continues.  I take Governor Perry at his word that he has now been fully briefed and he no longer believes the Department of Energy should be abolished. But his testimony raised questions about whether he will fight to protect the Department's essential programs from ideologues in a Trump administration that want to defund and eliminate these programs.  To better understand these challenges, let's briefly review the history. Just before the President was elected, the transition team's energy group sent a memo outlining 14 energy and environmental initiatives the new administration would be pushing. The memo pointed out that the Trump administration was going to eliminate and rescind and relax several Obama administration initiatives that are important to energy efficiency, important to reducing greenhouse gases, and require agencies to take the costs associated with climate into account. Shortly afterwards, the transition team sent an unprecedented questionnaire to the Energy Department, targeting scientists and civil servants who worked on these issues and asked the Obama administration to identify them.  The morning of Governor Perry's hearing, we awoke to news that the President's team was working on a proposal to eliminate the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the Office of So all those jobs I previously mentioned that are key in my State, key in the United States, and, I guarantee you, key to the U.economy's competitiveness in the future, would be at risk. Driving down the cost of electricity and keeping our businesses competitive is key to our Nation's economic strategy. I know that as a Senator who comes from a State with very affordable electricity. It has built our economy over and over and over and over again.  If you think about how our manufacturers have to compete in a global economy and look at where some of the manufacturing has gone or where our competition exists, these issues of cost-effective and efficient energy are key to our competitiveness as a nation.  We have seen in the State of California unbelievable results from energy efficiency. It is far cheaper to save a kilowatt of energy than it is to produce one, and this key factor is what has made California the leader in our Nation in energy efficiency and helped California businesses to be competitive. So we do not want to eliminate the Office of Energy Efficiency or the Office of  As I said earlier, we tried to get Governor Perry to take a solid stance on these issues and commit wholeheartedly to fighting any attempt to do away with these important offices, but he failed to make a commitment.  During the President's very first hour in office, the administration announced it was going to eliminate the Obama administration's climate action plan. This plan even included a program started by President George H.Bush--the Global Climate Research Initiative to assess and predict the impacts of climate change in the future.  This is not a partisan issue. President George Bush called on Congress to enact energy efficiency legislation, which he subsequently signed into law, and based on bipartisan energy legislation passed in 2005 and 2007, we improved lighting efficiency by 70 percent and increased fuel efficiency standards for automobiles. So I don't understand why the Trump administration is apparently so hostile to energy efficiency.  The Energy Department's energy efficiency programs are expected to save American consumers $2 trillion on their utility bills by 2030 and reduce carbon emissions by 7.3 billion tons over the same period. That is equivalent to taking 1.6 billion cars off the road. The fact that businesses could save $2 trillion by reducing their utility bills in the future is something we should all be passionate about. Our manufacturing base needs to remain competitive.  In addition, the Bush administration worked to get the United States and China--the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters--to work together on clean energy solutions. President Bush also chose in his State of the Union Address to be an advocate for energy efficiency, electric vehicles, biofuels, R&D, and a clean energy economy. I now appreciate even more now how much he advocated for those programs. It seems strange now to see a new Republican administration that seems so single-mindedly against these important energy advancements that are going to help our economy.  The Department of Energy also plays an essential role in protecting the electric grid from cyber and physical attacks. The Office of Electricity plays a very key role for our Nation, and, as we know, there is a full-throated debate about what cyber security attacks can do to the United States of  These issues about how some regime could undermine our U.democracy are critical. We need to address it, and we need to be aggressive as a nation about it.  The Office of Electricity plays a key role, and we want the Department of Energy to be aggressive in asserting its leadership on cyber security. If you are not committed to the Office of Electricity, if you are not committed to these vital programs, how are you going to be committed to protecting us on cyber security?  It should not have been difficult for Governor Perry to speak more urgently about these programs or to say he disagreed with the administration's reported desire to cut them. For instance, he spoke eloquently about energy diversification and pointed us to his record as But, as I looked[[Page S1556]]back at his record, I noticed that he tried to add 11 new coal plants, 8 of which were subsequently canceled after a court overturned his executive order expediting the coal permitting process. This is the kind of leadership we cannot afford at the Department of That is not about holding on to the past; we need a plan for the future.  Finally, I want to mention President Trump's recent Executive order regarding the National Security While it is within the discretion of the President to structure his National Security Council as he sees fit, the Secretary of Energy is a member of the National Security Council by virtue of statute. The President's Executive order removed the Secretary of Energy from the principals committee and what under the Obama administration was called the senior interagency forum for considering policy issues that affect the national security interests of the United  I can guarantee you that energy is an issue of national security. We need leadership out of the Department of Energy to be strategic on electricity, transmission, and cyber security.  The Department of Energy's technical expertise is vast and is not limited to the implementation of the Iran deal. The Department plays a key role on nuclear security issues.  I take the Governor at his word that he will come to Hanford, that he will look for funding to make sure that cleanup happens, and I take him at his word that he does want to work with Members of  Unfortunately, his unwillingness to commit to critical offices at the Department that are responsible for important scientific research, giving our government and our communities more data and information about climate science, making the investments we need in our electricity grid of the future, is something that concerns me about his nomination. I cannot support Governor  I know so much will get boiled down to this sound bite of him being the nominee of an agency that he said he wanted to abolish and then, at the same time, could not even remember the agency. I guarantee you, the Energy Department is a vital, functioning program not just for today's energy needs, but as the quadrennial review said, for our future energy needs.  So we could have an Energy Secretary who is going to help us with the transformation, protecting us on cyber security, making sure our businesses reap the benefits of greater energy efficiency, and, when it comes to the electricity grid of the future, making sure we plan for those 1.5 million jobs that are going to be needed. But those aren't the commitments we have had from Governor  I hope my colleagues will recognize that this nomination is not the direction the Department of Energy needs to go in and oppose Governor Perry for the Department of  Madam President, I yield the floor.

713,topic-id,1340,"Mr.President, I come to the floor this afternoon to talk about the affordable housing crisis in the United States of America and to talk about the reintroduction of legislation from last Congress that is going to be reintroduced by me, Senator Hatch, Senator Wyden, Senator Heller, Senator Schumer, Senator Murkowski, and the Acting President pro tempore--Senator Young--and several other of our colleagues.  The reason we are introducing this important legislation is to say that we need to increase the tax credit for affordable housing in the United We are saying this because we know from reports and statistics that we have a housing crisis in the United States of America, and unless we increase the affordable housing tax credit, we are not going to see much more new supply. That is because 90 percent of the affordable housing that is built in the United States of America is built with a tax credit.  Today, we are also releasing a report that is showing that the demand for affordable housing is exploding and construction is definitely not keeping pace. We are showing that seniors and veterans are at a greater risk for homelessness and that about a 60-percent increase in the need for affordable housing is being driven by Americans who are paying more than 50 percent of their income in rent, making it an unaffordable situation.  We are introducing this important legislation that, we hope, will build 400,000 additional affordable housing units across the United States and that will also help create additional jobs.  This is an issue that we are sending to the Finance Committee before, and I would hope my colleagues on the Finance Committee would take swift action. I say that because the report found three key factors. One is an increase of 9 million renters since 2005. That is a huge increase since 2005. How did we get there?  Over 7 million Americans lost their homes due to foreclosure in the economic crisis. As a result, home ownership rates have been at their lowest levels since the mid-1960s. Over the last 10 years, we have seen the largest gain in the number of renters in any 10-year period of time on record. That is right. We increased the number of renters in this last 10-year period of time more than at any other time on the books.  It kind of makes sense if you think about it. If the economic crisis caused you to downsize, and you were in a home and you could no longer afford it,[[Page S1593]]you would put pressure on the rental market. For those already in the rental market, it pushed many of them out of market-based rates and into solutions that were less affordable. As we all know, in major cities and urban areas across our country, it caused an actual homelessness crisis, as well, as many people could no longer even afford basic rent.  The affordable housing crisis is exploding all over the country, and we face pressures from all sides. Demand for rental housing has increased by 21 percent, but we are building units at the lowest rate since 1970. It does not take more than basic economics to see that, with demand so high and supply so low, we need to do something if we are going to make a dent in this problem. If we do not increase the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, then, by the year 2025, we are going to have 15 million Americans who are spending more than half of their income on rent, and this is truly unacceptable.  Our report shows that in the last decade the total number of Americans who have faced this extreme housing problem--that is, paying more than half of their incomes in rent--ballooned by 60-percent, and that has put a lot of pressure on many of our For my home State, the affordability crisis is actually getting worse than the national average. Since 2000, median rents have risen by 7.6 percent, which is 2.5 percent higher than in the rest of the country. As I said, it is all of those people coming from the foreclosure market into the rental market. On average, there is about a 3.5-percent increase in rents across the United In addition, there are 16 percent fewer affordable rental homes available in Washington State compared to the U.average. Overall, 400,000 Washingtonians are paying more than half of their monthly incomes in rent.  We saw these numbers, and we saw specifically how seniors and veterans and homelessness are also driving the increase in demand. Senior unaffordability, which is the term given to people who are paying more than half of their incomes in rent, rose by 30 percent. With the veteran unaffordability, which is the number of the veterans who are returning and being part of the housing market, we will see an increase of over 500,000 veterans who need affordable housing.  I think the Acting President pro tempore knows well that in his home State there are people who are trying to provide solutions in small towns and urban areas for our veterans so that they can have affordable places to live. The report also shows that doing nothing is going to continue to exacerbate the problem. We will see another 25-percent increase in unaffordability. That is just unacceptable.  To help solve the problem of affordable housing, my colleague, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and I are reintroducing the bipartisan Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act to strengthen and expand the Low-Income Housing Tax  Under this provision, the expanded tax credit would help create and preserve 1.3 million affordable homes over a 10-year period of time, which would be an increase of 400,000 new units nationwide. According to the National Association of Home Builders, annual LIHTC development--this is the overall appropriation--supports approximately 95,700 jobs and $9.1 billion in wages. Investing in the low-income housing tax credit, which gives our citizens more affordable housing, is good for them, but it is also good for our economy. Enacting the proposal would create an additional 450,000 jobs over the next 10 years and would support the construction of these important units.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the National Association of Home Builders that talks about the economic benefit of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and this particular proposal, with their estimates of increased Federal revenue of $11.4 billion, State and local revenue of $5.6 billion, and a total of 452,000 jobs being created in that 10-year period of time.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           National Association of                                                Home Builders,                                Washington, DC, November 11, 2016.

714,topic-id,383,"Mr.President, I enter that into the Record because it is so important for our colleagues not to get stymied over the next several months, as we discuss proposals for economic development and for infrastructure across the United States, and not take action on this issue because we do not know how we can afford it. What we cannot afford is the rising number of Americans who no longer can afford rent or home ownership. What we need to do is to make sure that there is a roof over their heads and that they can be productive parts of our economy.  Since its creation over the last 30 years, this tax credit has financed nearly 2.9 million homes across the United States, leveraging more than $100 billion in private sector investment. That is what I like most--a little bit of the tax credit going a long way to leverage the private sector into making investments in affordable housing. Between 1986 and 2013, more than 13 million people have lived in homes that have been financed by this tax credit.  I hope my colleagues will take a look at this legislation that we are introducing today and help us support it. The crisis is real across Our report shows the crisis is only going to be exacerbated because of demographics and demand. The best way out of this problem is for us to make an investment that only we can make, as 90 percent of the affordable homes are built with the tax credit. Without increasing the tax credit by 50 percent, we are just writing our own statistics for a very, very dire situation across the United States of  I see communities in my State that look like and reflect pictures that I have seen from the Great I know the recession hit us hard, but we have to climb out of this homelessness problem by making an investment in the affordable housing tax credit.

964,topic-id,2117,"Madam President, I come to the floor to speak in opposition to this resolution. Many of my colleagues know that we have had discussions in the Senate on several Congressional Review Act resolutions. In principle, Congressional Review Act resolutions--besides repealing these existing Executive regulations--also have the unfortunate aspect to them that they negate an agency's ability to make new rules anytime soon in the same area. For example, if you like some of this rule but not all of it, by using the CRA, you are literally preventing the agency from moving forward on any improvements to the rule.  I always believe in the legislative process. Working with my colleague from Alaska or working with my colleagues from other areas, I think we have proved that we can resolve key issues. But passing this Congressional Review Act resolution on an issue so important as our public lands and negating the hard work that the executive branch did over a long period of time is something that my colleagues and I just have to say no to.  When it comes to public lands, we want transparency; we want sunshine. We want a bottom-up approach when it comes to land management, and we certainly want collaboration.  As was said earlier, the Bureau of Land Management manages about 245 million acres of public land. That is about 10 percent of the Nation and 30 percent of our Nation's minerals. So when it comes to this management, it is very important that they continue to follow a very good bottom-up process for land management.  I will read now from the actual requirements from the law that oversees them, the Federal Land Policy and Management They have to use and observe the principles of multiple use and sustained yield; consider present and potential uses of the public lands; weigh long-term benefits to the public against short-term benefits; consider the relative scarcity of the values; give priority to areas of critical environmental concern; provide for compliance with applicable pollution control laws, including State and Federal air, water, noise, or other pollution standards or implementation plans; and coordinate with Federal Departments and Agencies, State and local governments, and Indian  So all of these things are part of what is already in existing law. The concept here is to make sure that we continue to have a transparent and open process that is bottom-up. And I certainly believe in a bottom-up process because our public lands must not be territories owned and operated, for example, for the sole benefit of the oil, gas, and mining industries, and we can't have polluters polluting in these areas and not have input from the various communities about their concerns on those issues.  For example, in 2001, the Bush administration proposed revisions to six land use plans in eastern Utah, and these plans were finalized in 2008 at the end of the Bush administration, with only limited opportunity for public involvement. All six plans were challenged in Federal court by several motorized recreation and conservation organizations.  It is now 2017, and these plans still remain tied up in litigation. That is why those in the off-road vehicle industry did not feel as though they had input at the very beginning stages of the process. In January the Obama administration negotiated a settlement, which is still pending in court, but this shows how, if there isn't meaningful public involvement, we are just going to hit a logjam. This is why I think it is so important for us to update this rule.  It has been a long time since the agency updated this rule; I think since 1983. That was the last time--over 30 years ago. I guarantee you, in those 30 years, we can come up with a better process for input from our constituents on important land use issues.  I know the new Interior Secretary likes to talk about Teddy Roosevelt, who once said: ``The Nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next generation increased, and not impaired, in value.''  Ensuring we are preserving and increasing the value of our public lands is exactly what is meant by this planning rule that the Bureau of Land Management put out. This rule wants to make sure that we have input from the local community.  I think it is important to note that this is not a rule that regulates any specific use on public lands. It does not restrict any particular activity. It simply updates the current law in saying that it is better to have input from local officials and to use that input from local officials to update the process in an earlier way.  I said to my staff: It is like us huddling and saying that we should write legislation and then me not coming back for 7 years and then letting them know I am on my way to the Senate floor to drop a bill. We would never do that, and the land plans in these communities shouldn't be done that way either.  Once a local Bureau of Land Management official starts to discuss a plan, there should be transparency. The local community should know exactly what that plan looks like before it is going to be finalized. It needs to encourage collaboration of the stakeholders or else--as the example I just gave in Utah--you are going to end up in litigation or an elongated process before such management plans can take place.  It seems to me that these are pretty reasonable goals: Have a bottom-up process that encourages discussion throughout the plan so that local communities are not caught off guard, and continue to emphasize the roles of State, local, and Tribal governments and cooperating agencies so that they can have input in the process as well.  Finally, I know that there are some who would like to claim that the BLM State director oversees the planning process in their specific State and that somehow that might change, but that is not the case.  Many organizations understand that there will continue to be a bottom-up process under the new rule. That is why so many sportsmen and outdoors groups--like the Outdoor Industry Association, the National Wildlife Federation, Trout Unlimited, the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, the Nature Conservancy, the Wilderness Society, and the National Parks Conservation Association--all say: Do not overturn the rule that was implemented. These groups know that 30 years is too long of a period of time to have to wait to encourage public involvement and collaboration, that[[Page S1612]]these issues are too important to try to turn back the clock and to try to exclude sportsmen and various interests of public access from the planning and use of our public lands.  I hope my colleagues will turn down this override of a very important project that has guaranteed public access, transparency, and sunshine in planning for our public lands.                                Medicaid  Madam President, I would like to come to the floor to discuss the proposed Medicaid changes that are part of what the House is proposing to the Affordable Care This is so important because, as many people know, Medicaid has been a bedrock of how individuals get access to healthcare in our country. And in many parts of our States--at least the State of Washington--Medicaid has been a lifeline in both rural communities and in urban areas and we have heard much from various people that it is actually helping to stabilize healthcare costs, so costs are not rising as fast and giving people access to care in the most serious situations where we are trying to fight opioids or are trying to find more efficiency in our healthcare system.  First of all, I think the House bill is literally a war on I say that because it is a capitation of healthcare costs.  The federal government, according to one budget analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, would shift the cost to the States by more than $500 billion over the next 10 years. That would mean that millions of people would lose coverage and be affected by this kind of repeal.  Now, many people have talked about how they might block-grant I also thought that was a horrible idea because, really, it just becomes nothing but a budget mechanism to reduce the Federal partnership that exists between the Federal Government and the States on But the House chose not to do exactly block-granting. They said, instead, that we are just going to have a budget cap at the Federal level on how much money they are going to spend on Medicaid and then work toward the repeal of Medicaid expansion. This is a very bad idea.  The actual per capita cut--I know my colleagues like to come out here and talk about a patient-centered relationship, which is exactly what getting off fee-for-service and going to managed care does. But a per capita cost is nothing but a budget mechanism to cap the Federal responsibility to Medicaid and cut costs and basically shift the pain onto the  I have been on various meeting tours in the State of Washington, talking to my constituents about this. In Seattle, Spokane, and I met with hospitals, community clinics, women's health groups, local and State government officials, civic leaders, civil rights organizations, and I heard many things.  I basically heard hospitals say there is evidence that Medicaid is actually lowering the commercial insurance premiums because of less uncompensated care. And I heard a safety net hospital in Spokane tell me that the population is already 70 percent Medicaid and Medicare and that there is no way they can absorb this kind of a cut to the Medicaid program and it would just mean healthcare costs would rise in the future. I heard a hospital in Seattle tell me that this kind of attempt is nothing but a budget trigger. It is not a reform of the system. It is simply a way to cut the budget.  What we believe is that Medicaid is a key part of our healthcare delivery system. The expansion has worked well and we should continue to move to ways to innovate Medicaid as a way to save costs.  Unfortunately, right now, many people misunderstand how important Medicaid is in the mental health and addiction area. Basically, when you take what we have tried to do to address the opioid epidemic, those individuals who are working through the bills that we just recently passed to try to help patients in the emergency room or who are in psychiatric care or who are trying to deal with this grave problem we have in the United States, getting rid of Medicaid for those individuals, you might as well roll back all the assistance we just provided as part of the CURES and other legislation. Why? Because these individuals will not be able to access the type of care they need without the support.  I do believe that what we need to do is innovate instead. There are many examples of innovation in our healthcare delivery system. One example, as I have mentioned on the floor several times, is going from nursing home care to community-based care.  Medicaid is going to equal long-term care. So many Americans are not going to be ready to deal with their long-term healthcare issues, and when they are not, they are going to use Medicaid for their long-term care.  We showed in the State of Washington over more than a decade's period of time that we could save $2.7 billion by shifting our Medicaid population to community-based care instead of nursing home care. If we would do that same kind of innovation at the Federal level, we could achieve substantial savings instead of saving money by cutting.  The issue here is that innovation in our delivery system--innovation, not a budget cap--is what is going to help us with our healthcare needs for the future when it comes to the Medicaid population.  So I urge my colleagues to speak loudly against this proposal to try to cap Medicaid, to try to shift the burden to States and local providers, to county governments, to jails, to all of those individuals who are going to see that population when and if they don't have Medicaid coverage and instead work together on expanding the innovation in Medicaid and coming up with savings we need to take care of and to provide health insurance coverage to so many  With that, I yield the floor.

993,topic-id,523,"Mr.President, we had a chance earlier today to talk about this Congressional Review Act resolution before us that I urge my colleagues to turn down. This resolution basically would negate a very important aspect of a rule that was put in place to help the public have more input on public lands.  The rule was pretty straightforward--common sense--to make sure that there was a lot of increased public input to bolster the decisionmaking process and to ensure that there are 21st century management policies in place.  There is nothing in this rule that was implemented in the last administration that erodes or takes away from the States' and local governments' planning processes and the decisionmaking they do.  So it is very important to me that we continue to have the transparency and openness and sunshine in our public planning. I think one editorial from the Post-Register from Idaho said it best. So I will read from it.       Resource management planning. Sound boring? But if      you are a Westerner, it definitely shouldn't be.       Resource management planning (RMP) affects how you can or      can't use the vast swaths of public lands outside your back      door for things like hunting, camping, four-wheeling, hiking,      fishing, and rock climbing--a lot of the things you probably      love about being a       With a new Republican presidential administration in power      and the GOP-controlled Congress rubbing its hands together in      delight, ready to implement part one of its grand scheme for      public lands--cashing in on[[Page S1625]]     those resources--RMPs should get a whole lot more interesting      to       Since 2014, BLM officials have been toiling away,      rebuilding the current rules for land use planning in a      significant way for the first time since 1983. . . .       One important change is that Planning 2.0 would let the BLM      take into account local impacts from the beginning.  Going on to read from the editorial:       The Republican-controlled House has already passed a      resolution to strike Planning 2.0 from the books once and for      all. The Senate will vote within days on whether or not      they'll use the same sledgehammer--the Congressional Review      Act (CRA). It's an especially diabolical weapon.       Once the CRA is used on Planning 2.0, it will be gone      forever. It prevents future BLM rules for planning land use      from being introduced if they are ``substantially the same.''       The utterly confounding part is why this rule is being      picked on in the first place. . . .       Planning 2.0 actually mandates more local control, gives it      more often and is a smarter, more elegant solution to sharing      use of our public lands.  I couldn't say it better than that editorial. Local communities are watching. They want more sunshine. They want more input. They want a smoother process. They don't want lawsuits that take forever. They want us to work in a collaborative fashion, guaranteeing the public input of local governments, States, and our citizens in how we manage our Federal lands.

282,topic-id,783,"Mr.President, I will vote against confirming Representative Ryan Zinke as Secretary of the Interior, and I would like to take this opportunity to explain why. To put the matter succinctly, Representative Zinke--if he is confirmed--will be charged with implementing the Trump administration's ``energy independence plan,'' which includes maximizing energy production on Federal lands, including the outer continental shelf,[[Page S1512]]I oppose oil and gas drilling off the coast of Maryland and the entrance to the Chesapeake There is too little to gain and too much to lose.  Last November, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, wisely did not include any parcels in the Atlantic in the 2017 to 2022 plan to lease offshore land the Federal Government controls. In December, then-President Obama used his authority under section 12(a) of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 to withdraw unleased OCS lands from future lease sales, too.  This makes sense. According to BOEM, the entire Atlantic OCS, from Maine all the way to Florida, has 1.15 billion barrels of ``undiscovered technically recoverable'' oil and 12.80 trillion cubic feet of ``undiscovered technically recoverable'' natural gas. These sums sound large, but let's put them in context. The Gulf of Mexico OCS has more than 40 times as much oil and 10 times as much natural gas.  Meanwhile, the U.Geological Survey, USGS, recently determined that the midland basin of the Wolfcamp Shale area in the Permian Basin has 20 billion barrels of oil and the natural gas equivalent of another 1.6 billion barrels. The oilfield stretches over 118 miles from Lubbock to It is the largest ``continuous oil'' discovery in the United States, according to the USGS, three times larger than the assessment of the oil in the mammoth Bakken formation in North  It doesn't make any sense to jeopardize the marine life and the fishing and tourism industries along the Maryland coast and Chesapeake Bay when there is so much more oil and gas in other parts of the country.  Deepwater Horizon was a state-of-the-art rig, but it failed, causing the largest oil spill in U.waters. Eleven crewman were killed. An oil spill entering the Chesapeake Bay would be a disaster.  An even bigger threat to Maryland and other coastal States is climate change and rising sea levels. We need to accelerate our transition from fossil fuels, not our dependence on them. Two years ago, Oceana concluded that modest levels of offshore wind development over the next 20 years could produce about twice the amount of energy along coastal Atlantic States as offshore drillings and create more than 1.5 times the number of jobs.  There is no provision in the 1953 law that permits President Trump to reverse the Obama administration's section 12(a) OCS withdrawals, but he is determined to try. When Representative Zinke was first asked about lifting the moratoria, he responded, ``If I am confirmed, I will work to implement President-elect Trump's policy.''  That is the problem right there.  I appreciate Representative Zinke's honorable service to our country, both in uniform as a Navy SEAL and as an elected official in the Montana State Senate and the U.House of He has called himself a ``Theodore Roosevelt conservationist'' and supports a permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation  It is possible Representative Zinke will try to resist the Republicans' zeal for transferring ownership of precious public lands from the Federal Government, although he supported a House rule change at the beginning of this Congress to make it easier. Representative Zinke is an avid sportsman who appears to appreciate the unique role the Federal Government has in managing these resources for multiple uses--not just energy production--and preserving them for future generations.  While these are all positive factors, I am troubled that Representative Zinke has received a 3 percent rating from the League of Conservation He has vacillated on the issue of climate change: in 2010, he was one of nearly 1,200 State legislators who signed a letter to President Obama and Congress calling for ``comprehensive clean energy jobs and climate change legislation.'' Since then, however, he has repeatedly expressed doubt about anthropogenic climate change. In an October 2014 debate, Representative Zinke stated: ``it's not a hoax, but it's not proven science either.'' During his confirmation hearing, Representative Zinke said that humans ``influence'' climate change, but did not acknowledge the scientific consensus that human activity is a dominant cause of climate change. He also supports using the Congressional Review Act to overturn rules agencies have spent months and even years to develop.

The CEM is a high-level global forum to promote policies and programs that advance clean energy technology, to share lessons learned and best practices, and to encourage the transition to a global clean energy economy. Previous CEMs have yielded remarkable national pledges from both the United States and foreign governments to develop and deploy clean energy technologies which in the aggregate have played a significant role in improving the global market competitiveness of clean and renewable energy technologies.  DOE also serves as the linchpin of the U.pledge to Mission Innovation, a global initiative involving 20 nations aimed at doubling public clean energy research and development.  The program, spearheaded by President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande with private sector support from Bill Gates via the Breakthrough Energy The current U.Government investment portfolio of more than $5 billion spans the full range of research and development activities--from basic research to demonstration activities, RD&The U.Government investment portfolio includes programs at 11 agencies, with the largest investment at These programs address a broad suite of low carbon technologies, including end-use energy efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear energy, electric grid technologies, carbon capture and storage, advanced transportation systems, and fuels.  At DOE, these programs are implemented through a number of mechanisms including cost-shared projects with the private sector research and development activities at the National Laboratories, grants to universities, and support for collaborative research centers targeted to key energy technology frontiers. The next planned phase for Mission Innovation, as envisioned by former Energy Secretary Moniz, was developing an international clean energy consortia, based on the principle of sharing institutional and technological resources to deploy shared energy solutions across international boundaries. The goal was to bring countries of all sizes together to develop, produce, and deploy clean energy solutions, with our 17 National Research Laboratories at the center of this results-oriented partnership.  Unfortunately, all of this investment and America's ability to lead and profit from the clean energy revolution is in jeopardy. There is no credible reason to believe that former Governor Perry or President Trump appreciate the U.interest in growing clean energy research and cooperation. President Trump deliberately ignores the significant growth of solar energy in the U.Human health, the environment, and America's global competitiveness will suffer as a result of this backwards ideological outlook on U.energy research, development, and production.  There were significant investments in wind energy in west Texas while Mr.Perry was Governor, but he also tried to fast-track 11 new coal-fired power plants in the State, a plan the courts ultimately scrapped.  During Mr.Perry's two unsuccessful runs for the Republican Presidential nomination in 2012 and 2016, he consistently recited popular tropes coined by climate change denialists. For instance, in his book, ``Fed Up'' former Governor Perry called the science behind climate change a ``contrived, phony mess.'' During his 2012 campaign, former Governor Perry accused climate scientists of manipulating data in order to receive funding for their projects. While he was Governor, his administration deleted all references to climate change from a report about sea level rise in Galveston  I am also concerned that, during the Perry administration, Texas dropped from 11th down to 27th in the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy's ranking of State energy efficiency policies. Under his watch, Texas filed suit in 2012 challenging the U.Environmental Protection Agency's finding that greenhouse gases significantly endanger public health.  Under his watch, Texas sued EPA a dozen times between 2008 and 2011.  According to press reports, the Trump administration may eliminate several DOE offices, including the Office of Electricity and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable  Former Governor Perry was asked about these reports during his confirmation hearing but didn't commit to fighting for the offices or the vital programs they administer.  Former Governor Perry was also an active member of the Outer Continental Shelf Governors Coalition, While the OCSGC supports offshore wind development, its primary purpose is to promote oil and gas production on OCS lands, including the mid-Atlantic, and expand revenue sharing for interested So States to the south of Maryland may push for OCS oil and gas production and reap increased benefits from it at the expense of all taxpayers. But if there is an oil spill that hits Maryland's coastline and enters the Chesapeake Bay, it will be our fishing and tourism industries that suffer.[[Page S1560]]  For all of these reasons, I will vote against confirming former Governor Rick Perry as Secretary of  ",CREC-2017-03-02-pt1-PgS1548-3.txt,,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR--,2017.0,2.0,March
609,topic-id,4074,"Mr.President, I thank the             Russia and the President's Address to Congress  Mr.President, on Tuesday night, along with my colleagues, I listened to the President of the United States address the joint session of As the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I was particularly interested to hear what the President would be saying about American foreign policy.  I heard him say during the speech that American foreign policy would be based on the respect of the sovereign rights of nations, which is something that I strongly believe in. I then thought I would hear the President talk about one of our greatest challenges from a country that is not respecting the sovereign rights of the United States of America, that country being But the President didn't mention Russia at all in his State of the Union address, which really surprised me.  When we look at Russia's most recent conduct and know what they did in regard to their attack on the U.democratic election system, it is beyond dispute that they wanted to interfere with our free elections, they wanted to affect the credibility of our democratic election system, and they wanted to influence the outcome of the election. That is pretty clear from the evidence that we have seen to date. Yet[[Page S1565]]the President did not mention that at all--a country that had attacked us as recently as just a few months ago. There was no mention in the President's State of the Union address.  It wasn't an isolated attack by Russia on the United We knew that before that, when we saw Russia's influence in regard to Montenegro's elections and how they tried to impact their parliamentary elections to influence Montenegro's decision to join We know that Russia is attempting to influence the elections in Western  So we have a country that is trying to bring down our democratic system of government by using our democratic system of government, and the way that we conduct open elections, to compromise our system.  But that is not the only thing Russia has done that is contrary to the U.national security and our foreign policy objectives. We know that they have physically incurred into other countries. They have physically incurred into Today, Russia has annexed Crimea--something we will never recognize. Crimea is part of Russia is continuing to support the separatists in the eastern part of Ukraine, compromising Ukraine's sovereignty.  The President did not mention that in his State of the Union address.  We know that Russia is in Georgia, in Moldova, and other sovereign countries; once again, no mention of that.  And then Russia is very much engaged in the Middle We know that Russia's footprint in the Middle East is growing. They have their military presence in Syria, backing the Assad regime, facilitating Iran's participation in  We also know that the type of conduct that has been conducted under Russian support, where civilians have been targeted, humanitarian convoys have been attacked, amounts to war crimes--a situation where Russia has culpability; yet, we don't hear anything about that.  So we have a role. Congress has a role to play in making sure that we protect our national security interests.  First and foremost, we have to know what is going on. We have to know what Russia was doing. We have to know what Russia's intentions were when they compromised our cyber security and used that information to try to influence our elections. We have to know what Russia's intentions are all about regarding the contacts they have made with Americans in their effort to influence this campaign. We have to understand what Russia's intentions are as they relate to democratic countries.  We saw in General Flynn's case that a contact was made, and as a result of not coming forward with that, General Flynn has left the Trump administration. And then we find out yesterday that the Attorney General, as a U.Senator, had contact with the Russian Ambassador, and that information was not made available during the confirmation process.  The timing of that meeting in Senator Sessions' office is concerning. It is concerning because it was right at the time that Russia was the most active in trying to get information that they could use to influence our elections. So this is an important aspect for us to understand.  We need to understand why that meeting took place and what was involved in that meeting. There have been calls by Members on both sides of the aisle that we get that type of information.  But I will add one more dimension to this: Why was the Russian Ambassador interested in meeting with Senator Sessions during the campaign period? Was this part of an overall strategy by Russia to try to influence the election? We need to get the answers to that.  The only way we are going to be able to get a complete account of what has happened by Russia's attack on the United States is by setting up an independent commission. Russia may not have used MiGs to attack They may have used a mouse. But it was an attack. And when we were attacked on 9/11, Congress did right thing--they set up an independent special commission to understand what happened, how we were so vulnerable to an attack, so that we could take steps to protect ourselves from future attacks and hold those responsible accountable. That was a bipartisan effort by the Congress of the United States, setting up an independent commission, a commission where the members could devote their entire full time to the assignment, because that is how serious being attacked is. There was no limit on their jurisdiction. They could go where the facts led. They could give a report to the American people so there would be credibility that we, the policymakers, are going to have independent information in order to act to protect the national security of the people of this country. That is what that independent commission meant. That independent commission met. They made many recommendations on eliminating a lot of the stovepiping of intelligence information and combining agencies together. Congress acted on those recommendations. As a result, we are safer today than we were prior to 9/11.  We need to be safer tomorrow than we are today from the attacks of The only way we are going to be able to get that objective information with the credibility so that we can act in the best interests for the people of this Nation is to have a nonpartisan, independent commission take a look at what Russia was doing, get all the facts, find ways and recommendations to make us safer, give the credibility to the American people, and then Congress needs to act in order to protect our national security. I know we have some committees looking at this. I know the Senate Intelligence Committee is doing some very important work. I support that.  We have our responsibilities in Congress to take steps within the jurisdictions of our committees. I am for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee looking into what Russia was doing in order that we can protect the jurisdiction of our committee to do a better job in our bilateral relationship with Russia, or what Russia is doing in Europe or in other parts of the world that affects our national security under the jurisdiction of the Senate Foreign Relations We need to do that work. The Intelligence Committee needs to do their work. Armed Services needs to do their work. Judiciary needs do their work.  But we need one central investigation that includes the broad jurisdiction that can get to answer why the Russian Ambassador may have wanted to see a U.Senator who was active in one of the campaigns that close to the elections, that has an opportunity to understand why Russia was so active in their cyber attacks in America, getting so much information, so much political information, why Russia was trying to understand our election system. There is no evidence that they tried to manipulate individual votes. That didn't happen--at least we don't believe that happened--but we know they were looking into how we do that. Was that for some future use? We need to understand that to protect our democratic system of government. That is what an independent commission will allow us to be able to receive.  I urge my colleagues to respond to the national security challenge of Russia, and let's establish an independent commission.  There are other things we need to do. There are two bills I filed with my Republican colleagues to make it clear that it is not going to be business as usual with There are going to be consequences to what they have done to the United States and our national security interests.  One bill that I filed, of which Senator Graham is the principal sponsor, is to make sure that Congress carries out its responsibility of oversight in regard to our bilateral relationship with It is the Russia Review Act, which would require the President of the United States to submit to Congress for review any attempt to eliminate or modify the current sanctions against He would be required to submit that to the Congress of the United States, hopefully working with us and consulting with us before he makes decisions but giving us an opportunity to weigh in before that decision could take effect.  For my colleagues who remember the Iran nuclear agreement, it sounds very familiar. Senator Corker and I, Senator Menendez, Senator Kaine, and others worked on the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review It passed nearly unanimously in the It required a President to submit that[[Page S1566]]agreement to us before it could take effect. It made the negotiations much more transparent. As a result, I believe we had a stronger agreement, but we also had a more open process, and Congress had a chance to carry out its responsibility. In a similar vein, it is important that we pass the Russia Review Act so that we can carry out our responsibilities, preventing the President from taking unilateral action without consulting with us. This is bipartisan; we have Democrats and Republicans working on this. I hope we will be able to pass this bill in a timely way.  The third bill I want to bring to my colleagues' attention as it relates to Russia's activities in the United States is legislation that I have filed with Senator McCain and many others. We have a large number of Democrats and Republicans who have cosponsored this bill that would increase the sanctions against Russia because of their attack against us. It would expand the options for imposing sanctions to different sectors that could affect Russia's energy, that could affect the ability of Russia to finance their sovereign debt, that could affect Russia's ability to privatize their industries by making it clear that we are not going to allow Americans or companies to help finance these activities because in reality they are financing activities against our interests, such as the cyber attacks, as we saw last fall.  This legislation is comprehensive. It deals more than just with sanctions; it deals with another major problem that we have found. Through NATO and U.leadership, we have made it clear that we will defend the countries of NATO, and we have deployed troops to make it clear to Russia that they better not try to compromise the territorial integrity of the member states.  This initiative has been well received by Europe and has countered Russia's attempts to cause a fracture within the European community. We need a similar initiative on democracy, a democracy initiative, because not only is there a threat against Europe from their geographical boundaries, there is a threat against Europe in regard to their democratic institutions. We know that. We saw that here in It is being challenged in So this democratic initiative would allow us to participate in strengthening the democratic institutions in Europe so that we don't allow Russia to use the democratic institutions to try to bring down the democratic institutions.  There is another part of this legislation which I think is extremely important. We are all getting to better understand the tactics being used by Russia, this fake news--inventing news and then using the social media to make it look like it is the hottest news in town. We know they are good at that. We also know they are very good at propaganda, and they go in directions that we, prior to this election, thought we would never see in our own country. We are now seeing it more frequently. Part of this legislation is for us to develop a capacity to be able to counter this propaganda and fake news so that Russia's deployment of it will not compromise our national security.  I think all three bills will be considered shortly and favorably by this body--setting up an independent review commission; requiring the President to submit any changes in the Russian sanctions to the Congress for review before they could take effect; and strengthening our sanctions regime against Russia for its conduct, including strengthening our commitment to democratic institutions and fighting this new cycle of fake news.  I also listened to the President during the State of the Union Address when he said that our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust, and meaningful engagement with the world. That is another statement I happen to agree with. And then I thought about what I had heard a little earlier that day: that the President's budget was going to have about a 30- to 35-percent cut--it wasn't exactly clear, but it was a large number--to the State  I said: How are you going to have a robust and meaningful engagement in the world if you cut our diplomacy budget, you cut our development assistance budget? This is how we keep the world safe. This is how we get our goals accomplished globally.  We have had so many hearings in our committee where there is a much greater need. We need to do more in Africa in promoting democracy. We need to do more in the Middle East in promoting good governance and inclusive governance so we don't have to have as many wars. We need to do things in our own hemisphere. We heard today in a hearing what is happening in There is a lot of work for America to do. A 30-percent cut? Is that a more direct, robust, and meaningful engagement within the world? It didn't sound that way to me. I was concerned about that and how we are going to be able to gauge.  It was Secretary Mattis who said: If you don't give the Secretary of State the resources, you better give me more soldiers.  And they are more expensive. We have the best fighting force in the world, and we are going to support our fighting force. The way we show respect for our soldiers is to use them only as a matter of last resort. Diplomacy is critically important for America's national security.  A strong, credible Office of the President is equally important if we are going to be able to be the type of country that influences our values globally, and the President of the United States has put that at risk. That is why I am reintroducing my resolution to try to avoid a constitutional crisis. I introduced it before President Trump took the oath of office, and I am introducing it again to avoid a constitutional crisis. It deals with the emoluments clause of the Constitution of the United  Every modern President of the United States prior to President Trump, in order to avoid conflict, in order to do what is ethically right and to comply with the Constitution of the United States--the emoluments clause--has either divested their financial holdings or has set up a blind trust. Some have done both. That is the way that the ethics officers tell us you can comply with not just the Constitution but with the highest ethical standards so that there are no real conflicts and you don't have any perceived conflicts, which can be just as damaging to the credibility of a public office holder.  President Trump, by not divesting, by not setting up a blind trust, has put the Office of the Presidency, our country, in a compromising position.  Let me give some specific examples, if I might. I will mention three countries. I could mention more.  Saudi Very interesting country, Saudi In August 2015, the Trump organization filed eight separate business companies to do business in Saudi As we all know, the President's Executive order that was originally issued that excluded immigrants from seven Muslim countries from visas did not include the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia even though, as we all know, many of the participants in the 9/11 attack against the United States originated from the country of Saudi President Trump has vast business interests in Saudi  Let me quote President Trump:       Saudi Arabia, I get along with all of them. They buy      apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I      supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.  It is not a question, Mr.President, of whether they like you or they don't like you; under our Constitution, they cannot give you any favor. If they give you a business favor, that is an emolument and violates the Constitution of the United States and violates your oath of office.  In regard to Turkey, Turkey has two large-scale developments in the country that are under the Trump organization. The Trump organization has a partnership with a luxury furniture company, Dorya International, to build pieces to be sold under the Trump Home Collection brand and a multimillion-dollar branding deal with the Dogan Group-- the Dogan Group is run by one of the most politically influential families in Turkey--for a two-tower complex in According to President Trump's May 2016 financial disclosure, he received as much as $1 million in royalties from the first venture and as much as $5 million from the second venture.  Because President Trump has not properly divested himself from his business, he will presumably continue to receive royalties from both ventures, and these business arrangements are not unknown to Turkey's leadership. President Erdogan presided over the opening ceremonies of Trump Towers, Istanbul.[[Page S1567]]  Shortly after the election, President Trump held a phone call with President Erdogan in which he praised his business partners. There are substantial business interests known by the Turkish Government that Mr.Trump has in their country. Mr.Erdogan is not shy about talking about and using the Trump He has bragged about it. We have a lot of foreign policy decisionmaking that affects We need to know that when the President is making those decision, it is America's interest which is at the front and center, not the Trump Organization's interests that are affecting those decisions. That is why we have the emoluments clause, that is why we believe in avoiding conflicts, and that is why President Trump needs to divest of his interest or set up a blind trust.  I will mention one other country, if I might. That country is For a decade, the Trump organization has been trying to get a trademark of its brand in I am going to quote from Mr.Trump on February 7, 2011, when he wrote to the American Ambassador in This is what Mr.Trump said: ``I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees to secure my own name and globally recognized brand for Chinese individuals who seek to trade off my reputation.''  For 10 years he was fighting to get that trademark protection. It was granted on February 14, 2017, a few weeks after President Trump took the oath of office, shortly after President Trump stated that he would support the One China policy, something the Government of China strongly wanted him to say.  We don't know connections. We can't draw connections. We don't know that. That is why the emoluments clause is in the Constitution, so you cannot accept any favors from another country. It is against our Yet we have concerns as to whether the President is acting under that interest. That is just wrong and it needs to stop. What the President has done is established a circumstance where there is an appearance of conflict, where it looks like foreign governments are trying to influence his decisions.  He has affected America's standing to advance good governance and corruption. I want to underscore that point. He is compromising America's moral authority on the values we hold so dear. Our Western democratic values are being compromised because leaders of autocratic countries, corrupt leaders, can say: If it is all right for the President of the United States to keep his business holdings while he is President, what is wrong with me having an interest in some of our entities here? It takes away our effective ability to use diplomacy to solve problems or advance our goals. We are being compromised. The current arrangement is simply inadequate.  President Trump announced he is going to let his two adult sons handle his businesses, but he still maintains his financial interests. He gives a couple of different other things he is going to do. I will just go over one or two of them.  He says he is going to donate the profits from his foreign hotels to charities. That sounds good.  Let me just quote from Steve Carvell, a professor at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, who said:       It's a monumental task to constantly run this down. Even if      the company is trying its hardest and making its very best      effort, it will be difficult to fulfill that goal.  Let's get serious about this. The arrangements he set out will not solve the conflict. It will not comply with the Constitution of the United The Office of Government Ethics said on the President's proposal it is ``wholly inadequate.'' That is the Office of Government They go on to say: ``The plan the [President] has announced doesn't meet the standards that the best of his nominees are meeting and that every President in the last four decades has met.''  I am a lawyer but would not claim to be a constitutional expert. Let me quote, if I might, from constitutional experts. Richard Painter, Norm Eisen and Laurence Tribe have written a comprehensive study of the constitutional provisions, concluding that ``since emoluments are properly defined as including `profit' from any employment, as well as `salary,' it is clear that even remuneration fairly earned in commerce can qualify.''  Richard Painter, the chief ethics officer for President George Bush, stated it in a blunter fashion. He said:       This is a for-profit hotel. [Trump] is making profits over      dealing with foreign governments. Same with the loans from      foreign government-owned banks. Those are for a for-profit      business. That is prohibited under the Emoluments Clause of      the  Let me just conclude with this. This is not about any one person. This is about the Office of the This is about our constitutional form of government that depends upon the Office of the President being respected. It is bigger than any one person. The Framers of our Constitution went on to say: We recognize it. We know the faults of men. That is why we set up the Constitution, to protect against the frailties of individuals.  This is about the Office of the President of the United States, not about any one person who may occupy it 4 to 8 years. We need to protect the Office of the President, and that is why we need to act now to avoid this constitutional crisis of the President of the United States, who has put our Nation at risk because of his personal conflicts and because of his violation of the Constitution of the United  I call upon President Trump to live up to the values of the Give the American people the transparency they deserve and completely sever his relationship with the Trump Organization before we are embroiled in an ethical and constitutional crisis that will not serve the best interests of the President, Congress or the American people.

If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. This motion to recommit is to defend ethical conduct throughout our government.  In response to the Watergate scandal, Congress created the Office of Government Ethics to protect against unethical behavior in the executive branch. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed into law a bill to strengthen the Office of Government Ethics by removing it from the Office of Personnel Management and giving it greater independence from the White                              {time}  1800  Now Congress is attempting to undo this vision of a strong, independent Office of Government Ethics at a time when we need it more than ever. This bill would put the Office of Government Ethics right back under the control of the White House, and that is why this motion to recommit simply excludes OGE from this bill.  We appreciate the need for strong ethical guidelines most strongly when people act unethically. Every day we witness this White House struggle with honesty and credibility. We heard the promises last night, the ones we have been hearing all along.  When you promise to create family-sustaining jobs by revitalizing American infrastructure and then we find out he means to do it with tax breaks to huge corporations and none of the regular guarantees that the people actually doing the work will be treated right and paid fairly, that is when you have a credibility problem.  When you promote yourself as a man of the people but then we find out you have stuffed your Cabinet with out-of-touch billionaire friends, that is when you have a credibility problem.  When you promise to fix America's education system but then we see you appoint Betsy DeVos to head the Department of Education, someone with no education experience, someone who wants to gut public education, that is when you have a credibility problem.  When you address Congress and promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act in a way that guarantees increased access, coverage of preexisting conditions, and that costs will go down but no one in America knows how you plan to pay for that, that is when you have a credibility problem.  We don't need a White House with a credibility problem. We need these promises the President has made to come true. We need a stronger economy full of family-sustaining jobs. We need Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare to be protected. We need to have an executive branch we can trust. This is our future, and we need to be smart about it. I believe that smart people trust, but they verify.  The problem is we do seem to have a President whose relationship with the truth is, at best, a nodding acquaintance. This is why we need a strong Office of Government Ethics more than ever.  Ronald Reagan was right; it needs to be an office independent of control by the White  We need it to keep our leaders from enriching themselves in public office, to keep our leaders honest, to help us trust, but verify that our elected officials do what is best for the American people and not their own pocketbooks.  We need it to ensure that our President is acting in our best interest with nations around the world.

1005,topic-id,22,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.                       Republican Healthcare Bill  ",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgS1625-4.txt,1828,0915,2017.0,7.0,March
1006,topic-id,2512,"Mr.President, I rise today to offer a few comments about the House Republican bill that was just unveiled yesterday. Those who have been promoting it or those who have been working on this issue for a couple of weeks are claiming it is a new healthcare plan or a new comprehensive healthcare proposal--in essence, by their argument, a replacement if the Affordable Care Act were repealed. I disagree. I don't believe in any way it is a plan. It might be a bill, but I think a better description of it in terms of its impact would be that it is a scheme, not a plan. It is a scheme that will roll back coverage gains from the Affordable Care Act, which is better known by a longer name: the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Kaiser--one of the great institutions that track healthcare data and healthcare policy--told us that there are 156 million Americans with employer-sponsored coverage. Those Americans didn't have much protection before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act with regard to preexisting conditions or annual lifetime limits--a whole series of protections for people that were not there before that.  This scheme, as I am calling it, will not only roll back coverage gains in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, in the process it will also devastate the Medicaid Program, leaving many of the most vulnerable Americans behind.  Another impact of this scheme will be to increase costs for middle-class families while cutting taxes for millionaires or multimillionaires as well as big corporations. It will raise the cost of care for older Americans and substantially cut funding for hospitals in rural communities.  How did we get there, and where are we going based upon the House Republican proposal? Last night the Republicans released their bill to ``replace'' the Affordable Care Act, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee will be marking up the bill tomorrow. I guess it doesn't require much reading to get to a markup tomorrow.  Usually when you introduce a bill, the bill is reviewed by Members of There is some public debate on it. There is some back-and-forth. And then a period of time later, maybe weeks, there is a markup. The committee engages in a thorough review of the bill, and the markup means they make changes. They add amendments or try to alter the bill in one way or another. That is a serious approach when you do this work of legislating on a serious issue.  Healthcare is about as serious and difficult an issue as there is. I think it should be accorded the serious review that the complexity and the consequence of this issue demand. This is not a serious proposal. It is a scheme, but it is also not a serious process that the House seems to be focused on right now. This process means the House will mark up this bill within I guess about 48 hours of it being unveiled, maybe less than 48 hours. That means there will not be a single hearing on the bill or getting the bill scored, which is a fancy Washington word for having someone tell us what it costs. There will be no thorough review, no serious review on such a monumental issue called healthcare and what happens to hundreds of millions of  At the same time, the markup will proceed with lightning speed, and there will not be any information on the record about an analysis of the bill that is thorough and serious, and of course we will not know how to pay for it and we will not have the score that will tell us how it will be paid for and what the cost will be.  It is hard to come up with the words, but the impact of this bill would be a disaster. If you are a millionaire and up, you are doing quite well under this bill. You are going to get a bonanza from this bill. You are going to have a great payday. If you are a child or you happen to be a senior or if you are a woman or if you are an individual with a disability or a chronic disease, you are out of luck. You are in big trouble. I would hope that those Americans would have the benefit of a serious review of a serious issue. If the bill is not serious, I guess they are going to ram it through. We will see what happens in the next couple of days.  There is one analysis that should be on the record. There are some that are hot off the presses. This is a report released today that I am looking at. It is about 2\1/2\ pages. They know the vote will take place soon in the committee--two committees, maybe in the This report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is moving quickly to keep up with the fast pace at which the bill is proceeding. I won't read the whole report, and I won't enter the whole report into the Record; I am sure people can go online and look at it. Here is the title of the report: ``House GOP Medicaid Provisions Would Shift $370 billion in costs to states over a decade.'' It is written by Edwin Park, who has been writing about Medicaid for a long time. Few Americans know more about Medicaid than Edwin Park and people like him who study it. I will read the first sentence, which gives you the basics of it: ``The new House Republican health plan would shift an estimated $370 billion in Medicaid costs to states over the next ten years, effectively ending the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) Medicaid expansion for 11 million people while also harming tens of millions of additional seniors, people with disabilities, and children and parents who rely upon Medicaid today.''  That is the opening line of this proposal, which I believe is a scheme. What does that mean for Medicaid?  One of the basic debates we will have here is what happens to Medicaid itself, and we will have a lot of debates about other aspects of the implications for the Affordable Care  Here is what it means. It means that 70 million Americans who rely upon Medicaid--again, they are children in urban areas, children in rural areas, children in small towns who get their healthcare from It is a lot of individuals with disabilities, a lot of children with disabilities who benefit from It is also, of course, pregnant women, as well as seniors trying to get into nursing homes, because we know that a lot of seniors can't get into a nursing home unless they have the benefits of The idea in the bill on Medicaid that is objectionable, among other objections I have, is a so-called per capita cap. This idea limits Federal contributions to a fixed amount. If the caps are not tied to overall increases in healthcare spending, the net effect is fewer healthcare dollars over time so they can afford the tax cuts they want to have as part of this scheme.  We have heard a lot around here about flexibility, that States want more flexibility when it comes to I will tell you what they don't want. They don't want a flexibility argument to be a scheme that results in cuts to those States, where the Federal Government says: Here is a block grant that may increase or may not, but good luck, States, as you balance your budgets.  Of course, Governors and State legislators balance their budgets, and they have very difficult choices to make--sometimes choices the Federal Government never makes. That is why some Republican Governors took advantage of the Medicaid expansion and expanded healthcare to a lot of people in their That is one of the reasons they are worried about--and some will oppose this idea of so-called per capita caps or block-granting of Medicaid or the like.  If we have a proposal to cut $370 billion from the House, what does that mean for some of those groups that I just mentioned earlier? Well, we know that more than 45 percent of all the births in the United States of America are paid for by Medicaid, so that is a consequence for pregnant women and their children. One in five seniors receives Medicaid assistance by way of the benefit to someone trying to get into a nursing home. Medicaid also pays for home-based care for seniors and, of course, long-term care as well. What if you have a disability? Over one-third of the Nation's adults with disabilities who require extensive services and support are covered by  We know that in a State like mine--because we had a Republican Governor[[Page S1629]]embrace the Medicaid expansion, and then we had a Democratic Governor embrace it and really develop it and bring it to where it is today--we have expansion of Medicaid that resulted in some 700,000--that is not an exact number, but it is approaching 700,000 Pennsylvanians gaining coverage through the Medicaid expansion. And 62 percent of Americans who gained coverage through the Medicaid expansion are working. So we are talking about a lot of families and a lot of individuals who are working and getting their healthcare through That opportunity presented itself because, in the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid was expanded.  There are lots of numbers we could talk about. I will give maybe two more. Medicaid is the primary payer for mental health and substance abuse treatment. Medicaid expansion enabled 180,000 Pennsylvanians to receive these lifesaving services. If you are a Member of Congress and you have been going home and talking about the opioid crisis--and to say it is a crisis is a terrible understatement. It has devastated small towns and rural areas. It has devastated cities. It has destroyed families. We know how bad it is. Some of the numbers indicate it is getting worse, not leveling off. If you say you care about that and you supported the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act as a Member of Congress and you supported the funding that was in the 21st Century Cures Act at the end of the year, and you say you are working toward help for communities devastated by the opioid crisis, it is OK to say that, but you can't then say: But I want to support the House Republican proposal on Medicaid, when Medicaid is the primary payer for these substance abuse treatment programs.  I mentioned before adults and children with disabilities. Medicaid covers 60 percent of children with disabilities. We know the range of that--ranging from autism to Down syndrome, to traumatic brain injury, and many other disabilities or circumstances that I have not mentioned. For a lot of people, this is real life. It is not some theory that gets kicked around Washington, often by people who have good healthcare coverage as they are talking about cutting healthcare for others. We have a lot of testimony from what we might want to call the real world.  One of the most compelling pieces of correspondence I received in my time in the Senate was from a mom about her son. Her name is She is from Coatesville, That is in Southeastern Pennsylvania, within the range of suburban She wrote to tell me how important Medicaid is to her family and to tell me about her 5-year-old son She sent me a picture of Rowan with a firefighter's hat on. Of course, he is fascinated, as we all are, by the heroic work of firefighters. Her story--I will not go through her whole letter, but she got news a couple of years ago that many parents get in the course of the lives of their children. She got news in March of 2015 that her son Rowan was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. The diagnosis was made by a psychologist who worked for the Intermediate Unit--meaning the institution that works for the school districts and helps to provide special education. Rowan continued in the preschool program and daycare program before and after school, but then Pam goes on to say:       I was never able to find a daycare suitable for all of      Rowan's needs. In late January of 2016, I applied for      [Medical Assistance].  I will stop there for a moment to explain. Medical Assistance is the State share of the State end of the Medicare We call it Medical Other States have a different name for it.  Pam said she applied for Medical Assistance:       After Rowan was awarded this assistance we were able to      obtain wrap-around services, which included a Behavioral      Specialist Consultant . . . and a Therapeutic Staff Support      worker.  Pam goes on to say, and I am quoting her again:       Without Medical Assistance, I am confident that I could not      work full time to support our family. . . . [We] would be      bankrupt and my son would go without the therapies he needs.  These are the therapies I just mentioned. Then Pam goes on to say, urging me as one of her two Senators to focus on her son, focus on her family when we are casting votes and having debates about policies that relate to healthcare and Here is what Pam asked me to do as her Senator:       Please think of . . . My 9-month-old Luna, who      smiles and laughs at her brother, she will have to care for      Rowan late in her life after we are gone. We are desperately      in need of Rowan's Medical Assistance and would be devastated      if we lost these benefits.  So said Pam about her son and about the importance of the Medical Assistance Program, which is known on the national level as I would hope that those in the House, as they are quickly marking up legislation that would have a huge impact on families like Pam's and many more--I would hope they would think of Rowan, think of his little sister Luna and what her challenges might be years from now when she would likely have to care for Rowan and answer some of Pam's questions.  There are a lot of questions that we have about policy and numbers and budget impacts, and they are all appropriate. But some of the most important questions we have to answer for those who are asking them are questions that our constituents are asking. And one of those is We have to be responsive to her concerns about her son and the challenges her son faces.  I hope, in the midst of debate, in the midst of very rapid consideration of a complicated subject on a bill that has been slapped together--in my judgment, too quickly--that Pam's concerns would be an uppermost priority in the minds of those who are working on this legislation.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

140,topic-id,2549,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We are here to consider H.1009. This is a bill sponsored by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.Mitchell). It is cosponsored on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.Meadows) and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.Palmer). We are also pleased to have the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Sessions), chairman of the Committee on Rules, as well as the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.Walberg) as cosponsors.  Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of H.1009, the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability OIRA stands for the Office of Information and Regulatory It has many responsibilities. It is a little known agency, but very powerful and very important. Some of its most well-known responsibilities are governed by an executive order. Executive Order 12866 was issued by President Clinton in 1993. The order was maintained under President Bush and reaffirmed by President Obama in 2009.  The OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act puts into statute the basic structure that has existed for more than two decades. The legislation also includes some minor adjustments for increased transparency and accountability. For example, agencies are required to provide OIRA with a redline of any changes the agency chooses to make during the review process. This allows the public to better understand how centralized review can improve the quality of rulemaking.  The bill clarifies the process for extending the time for OIRA to review regulations. Currently, OIRA has 90 days to review a regulation, but at the[[Page H1431]]request of the issuing agency, OIRA can extend the review indefinitely without notice to the public. Under the Obama administration, many rules were under review for more than a year with no explanation whatsoever. H.1009 requires OIRA and the regulating agency to agree upon the extension and provide a written explanation to the public, including an estimated date of completion.  The government works for the people. You would think if they are going to miss deadlines and be late and go beyond the current rules, the people who are involved in the rulemaking would at least offer a little bit of a written explanation. The bill also requires OIRA to update the explanation and estimated completion date every 30 days after that moving forward.  Another significant difference from the executive order is H.1009 includes independent agencies in OIRA's review of significant regulations. Independent regulatory agencies already submit their regulations to OIRA for the unified agenda and the annual regulatory plans. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, independent agencies submit information collection requests, which is another way to say government forms, to OIRA for approval. For decades, experts across the political spectrum, including the Administrative Conference of the United States and the American Bar Association, have called for the inclusion of independent agencies in the significant regulation review process. Again, a good group there, the Administrative Conference of the United States, as well as the American Bar Association also asking for these independent agencies.  There is significant bipartisan agreement on including the independent agencies. In fact, President Obama's Jobs Council recommended including independent agencies in OIRA's regulatory review. Sally Katzen, OIRA administrator under President Clinton, said: ``For all practical purposes, the way executive branch agencies and independent agencies conduct rulemaking is the same, so they both should be expected to gather and use information on the costs and benefits of new regulatory proposals.'' She went on to suggest: ``Congress could adapt that approach for OIRA review of the analysis underlying independent agency rulemakings.'' And she goes on.  That is exactly what the bill does, which brings me to the last major difference between this bill and the executive order. This bill requires OIRA to report on what it reviewed and the results of that review. The Oversight Committee conducted an extensive investigation into the Waters of the United States rulemaking, also known as During the course of the investigation, it was clear OIRA was not conducting the analysis I think we should all expect. OIRA even shortchanged the interagency review process in order to meet the self-imposed arbitrary deadline.  H.1009 requires OIRA to issue a report on each significant regulation it reviews so the public can see exactly what legal requirements OIRA focused on and what OIRA found. H.1009 asks OIRA to consider: Did the agency technically comply with the requirement? Did it make solid effort to improve the regulation through the process? Or was the agency just going through the motions? These are very legitimate, easy, simple questions that we think can be answered.  Agencies are supposed to consider the public's comments, but what if the final rule is drafted before the comments are even reviewed? Perhaps the law does not explicitly prohibit that, but is it really an effective regulatory practice? The question is more than just whether agencies have simply complied. It is whether the agency is doing everything it can to limit the burden and make its regulations effective and easy to understand.  By requiring OIRA to make the results of its review of rulemakings available to the public, this bill will encourage agency accountability and improve the public's understanding of the rulemaking process. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform approved this bill, without amendment, on February 14 of this year.  I again want to thank the leadership of Congressman Mitchell for doing all that he has done to bring us to this point where we are debating this on the floor of the I also want to thank Katy Rother for her tireless work on this bill. She has done an awful lot of work, working with both sides of the aisle. Hats off to her as well. Again, I urge the passage of this bill.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

The CBO staff contact is Matthew                Sincerely,                                                       Keith              H.1009--OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability ActAs ordered reported by the House Committee on Oversight and Government                       Reform on February 14, 2017                                SUMMARY       H.1009 would codify many executive orders and practices      of the federal government related to the process of issuing      federal regulations. The legislation also would expand the      role of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs      (OIRA) in the regulatory process and authorize OIRA to review      rules proposed by certain independent federal agencies.       CBO estimates that implementing the bill would increase      administrative costs to OIRA and federal agencies by a total      of $20 million over the 2018-2022 period; such spending would      be subject to the availability of appropriated funds. CBO      estimates that enacting the bill would increase direct      spending by $3 million over the 2018-2027 period and would      reduce revenues by $2 million over the same period. Because      the bill would affect revenues and direct spending, pay-as-     you-go procedures apply.       CBO also expects that enacting H.1009 could delay the      issuance of some rules. However, because of the large number      and variety of federal rules issued each year, CBO cannot      determine whether a delay in the effective date of some rules      would have a cost or savings to the federal government.       CBO estimates that enacting H.1009 would not increase      net direct spending or on-budget deficits by more than $5      billion in one or more of the four consecutive 10-year      periods beginning in 2028.       H.1009 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or      tribal governments.                ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT       The estimated budgetary effect of H.1009 is shown in the      following table. The costs of this legislation fall within      all budget functions that include agencies that issue or      review regulations.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                  By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--                                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     2018    2019    2020    2021    2022    2023    2024    2025    2026    2027   2018-2022  2018-2027--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     INCREASES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION Estimated Authorization Level.....................       4       4       4       4       4       4       4       4       4       4        20         40Estimated Outlays.................................       4       4       4       4       4       4       4       4       4       4        20         40                                                               INCREASES IN DIRECT SPENDING Estimated Budget Authority........................       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *         2          3Estimated Outlays.................................       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *         2          3                                                                   DECREASES IN REVENUES Estimated Revenues................................       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *        -1         -2                                         NET INCREASE IN THE DEFICIT FROM CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING AND REVENUES Impact on Deficit.................................       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *         3          5--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: *= between -$500,000 and $500,000.[[Page H1432]]                             BASIS OF ESTIMATE       For this estimate, CBO assumes that H.1009 will be      enacted near the end of fiscal year 2017 and that spending      will follow historical patterns for these and similar      activities.       CBO is not aware of any comprehensive information on      current spending for regulatory activities governmentwide.      However, according to the Congressional Research Service,      federal agencies issue 3,000 to 4,000 final rules each year.      Most are promulgated by the Departments of Transportation,      Homeland Security, and Commerce, and the Environmental      Protection Agency (EPA). Agencies that issue the most major      rules (those with an estimated economic impact on the economy      of more than $100 million per year) include the Department of      Health and Human Services, the Department of Agriculture, and      the       H.1009 would codify certain regulatory policies and      practices that are currently being implemented pursuant to      several executive orders. Those instructions require agencies      in the executive branch to analyze the impacts of regulations      (including costs and benefits), to coordinate with OIRA      during the rulemaking process, and to perform other      activities and analyses related to considering the effects of      proposed rules.                   Spending Subject to Appropriation       On the basis of information from OIRA and several federal      agencies on the cost of the rulemaking process, CBO estimates      that more personnel would be needed to produce additional      analyses and to perform other administrative tasks under H.     1009. CBO estimates that spending would increase by about $4      million annually and $20 million over the 2018-2022 period to      hire and train sufficient staff. Such spending would be      subject to the availability of appropriated funds.                            Direct Spending       CBO estimates that some independent regulatory agencies      would face an increased administrative workload under H.     1009 because, under current law, most independent regulatory      agencies are not required to submit regulatory analyses to      Some of those agencies, primarily the Federal Deposit      Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Consumer Financial      Protection Bureau (CFPB), can spend funds for such activities      without further appropriation. CBO estimates that enacting      H.1009 would cost about $3 million over the 2018-2027      period for the FDIC and CFPB to prepare additional reports      and analyses of proposed regulations for                                Revenues       H.1009 would affect revenues by changing the cost of the      operations of the Federal Reserve System, which remits its      net earnings to the Treasury; those remittances are      classified as revenues in the federal budget. The legislation      would impose additional administrative expenses on the      Federal Reserve to prepare reports and analyses for      Based on the cost of similar administrative work of the      Federal Reserve, CBO estimates those additional      administrative costs would reduce remittances by the Federal      Reserve to the Treasury by $2 million over the 2018-2027      period.                      PAY-AS-YOU-GO CONSIDERATIONS       The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-     reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation      affecting direct spending or revenues. The net changes in      outlays and revenues that are subject to these pay-as-you-go      procedures are shown in the following table.

Bob Goodlatte,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     Washington,       Dear Mr.Chairman: On February 14, 2017, the Committee on      Oversight and Government Reform ordered reported without      amendment H.1009, the ``OIRA Insight, Reform, and      Accountability Act'' by a vote of 23 to 16. The bill was      referred primarily to the Committee on Oversight and      Government Reform, with an additional referral to the      Committee on the       I ask that you allow the Committee on the Judiciary to be      discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it      may be scheduled by the Majority This discharge in no      way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the      bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future      referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be      necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee      on the Judiciary represented on the conference committee.      Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any      response in the bill report filed by the Committee on      Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the      Congressional Record during floor consideration, to      memorialize our understanding.

Jason Chaffetz,     Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Chaffetz: I write with respect to H.1009,      the ``OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act.'' As a      result of your having consulted with us on provisions within      H.1009 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the      Committee on the Judiciary, I forego any further      consideration of this bill so that it may proceed      expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.       The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual      understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.1009 at      this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject      matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our      committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as      this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may      address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our      committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an      appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate      conference involving this or similar legislation and asks      that you support any such request.       I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming      this understanding with respect to H.998 and would ask      that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be      included in the Congressional Record during floor      consideration of H.1009.

145,topic-id,107,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Let me mention that the bill does not require any of these agencies to provide new analysis. And I haven't really heard an example or a reason why something would be prohibited in an agency from sharing existing cost-benefit analysis.  What could the agencies have that they should not share with OIRA?  It just seems reasonable that if they have this information, they should share it. Ultimately, we do work for the American people, and the American people should be able to see this information as it goes to  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Whether or not they think they are independent or not, they still work for the American people, and the people that are footing the bills and that have to live under these regulations should have the right to see this information and have this information provided to them through the process.  We are never going to apologize for trying to increase the transparency and the process. That is what this bill does.  I reserve the balance of my time.

154,topic-id,4490,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I just want to simply point out that the bill does extend OIRA to review independent agencies. I also would point out, as I did earlier, the Administrative Conference of the United States recommended OIRA review be extended to independent agencies back in 1988.  In fact, the American Bar Association recommended OIRA review be extended to independent agencies in 1990 and reaffirmed the need again in 2016. They said: ``We strongly urge you to bring the independent regulatory commissions within the requirements for cost-benefit analysis''--I am going to just inject my own words here in the middle.  Cost-benefit analysis, isn't that something reasonable that we should all look at? That is not asking an agency too much, especially if they already have the information.  They went on to say: ``OMB review, and retrospective review of rules currently reflected in Executive Order 12866. . . . `'  Those are not overly burdensome requests. In fact, in 2011, Sally Katzen, the OIRA Administrator under President Clinton, urged Congress to support extending OIRA review to independent agencies, when she wrote: ``Our concern is that independent agencies are not typically engaging in the analysis that has come to be expected as a form of governmental best practice for regulatory agencies.''  It seems like a reasonable expectation to employ best practices. And all that bill does is--again, it does not interfere with independent agencies' rulemaking process or their policy decision. It simply requires OIRA to review the regulations to ensure these agencies are complying with legal requirements just the same as any other agency.  That is a reasonable request. That is why we urge its passage.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR (Mr.Tipton). All time for general debate has expired.

180,topic-id,367,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment requires OIRA to maintain records on each significant regulatory action reviewed such that it is easily accessible and transferrable when responding to congressional requests.  Unfortunately, in the last Congress, Mr.Chairman, the committee asked for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA--asked Administrator Shelanski for records relating to the review of the Waters of the United States, often known as WOTUS, and that rulemaking process. The administrator repeatedly failed to take the requests seriously, which led me, as the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, to issue a subpoena in July of 2015.  Even upon issuance of a subpoena, OIRA resisted responding to the request, blowing past deadlines and being totally nonresponsive. We held multiple hearings. We conducted transcribed interviews. We had lengthy staff-to-staff conversations, but still OIRA did not seem to take the request seriously. I don't know how much money they wasted in time and effort to slow this process down and resist our being able to get the information that they said they had in order to make this decision.  It was not until the committee, myself, as the chairman, getting on the phone with the head of OMB, when I told him that I had every intention to hold Mr.Shelanski in contempt and issue a contempt report, that we actually received a full set of documents. This was well past a year since the initial request. You should not have to go through those gyrations whatsoever.  I will think the resistance was largely a political maneuvering--this is my own opinion--by the administration that did not want us to see how rushed, incomplete, and politically involved this regulatory review was. That is my own personal opinion.  But for those who are here and the future generations, it seems reasonable that they have to have their act in order if they are actually going to issue a rule. And if Congress asks for the underlying information, as Representatives of the people, that should be easily transferrable to Congress upon request.  That is what this amendment does. This is why it should pass, and that is what this amendment is intended to do.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

152,topic-id,706,"I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.[[Page H1435]]  Mr.Chair, I rise in opposition to H.1009, the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act, yet another radical bill, part of a corporate agenda designed to eviscerate public protections under the Clean Water Act and other laws designed to ensure the safety of American families.  As the ranking member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, I have several serious concerns with this measure.  First, H.1009 would eviscerate the independence of agencies that are critical to holding corporations accountable and protecting consumers, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Congress established these expert agencies with the express purpose of exercising independence from the policy whims of the White  Section 3423 of H.1009, however, would task the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA, with a governmentwide review of significant regulatory actions, effectively placing this obscure entity as the gatekeeper of the rulemaking system.  Currently, OIRA only reviews a small portion of significant regulatory actions, allowing it to effectively allocate its finite resources to review the most pressing rules. But by substantially expanding OIRA's mandate to include every significant regulatory action, this legislation would simultaneously water down agency oversight while also subjecting independent agencies to the influence of the Trump administration, facilitating political interference in the rulemaking process.  One of the overriding goals of OIRA review is to ensure that the President's policies are reflected in agency rules. Greater Presidential control over rulemaking, particularly in this administration's hands, could have devastating consequences in terms of public health and safety. It would not only provide special interests with an additional tool for regulatory capture, but it would also allow the White House to substitute its own policy preferences for those of  As Senator Ron Johnson, the Republican chair of the Senate committee with jurisdiction over administrative law, observed in a report last year: ``Limits on the President's power over independent agencies--like the Federal Communications Commission--demonstrate the importance of maintaining the agency's independence.''  Furthermore, because President Trump has made the outrageous and unprecedented choice not to divest his business holdings, I am also very concerned that H.1009 would only serve to convert the regulatory system into his own personal investment account.  Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, recently noted: ``The Nation's golfer-in-chief'' owns or brands businesses across the country that would be affected by protections promulgated under the Clean Water Increasing the White House's role in the rulemaking system will only serve to undermine what little transparency exists into the President's regulatory conflicts of interest.  The Government Accountability Office has reported in multiple studies that OIRA has not addressed transparency concerns that GAO has raised, and for this reason I offered an amendment.  I was pleased to hear my friend from Utah talk about the transparency benefits, but I offered an amendment to H.1009 that was designed to ferret out crony capitalism by requiring that OIRA reports whether a significant regulatory action would financially benefit the President or his senior advisers. That seems like a really sensible idea if you really want to get at the issue of transparency.  Very disappointingly, my Republican colleagues refused to make my amendment in order, really tacitly acknowledging their concerns with what this type of transparency might mean for the Trump administration.  Finally, while supporters of this proposal argue that it merely codifies executive orders that were issued under Democratic administrations, the reality is that H.1009 was drafted without Democratic input, contains several poison pill provisions designed to ensure its partisan and unworkable nature, and would only have been vetoed by the Obama administration.  As the Obama administration noted in the context of a veto threat of another antiregulatory bill, agencies already adhere to the robust and well-understood procedural and analytical requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional Review  Passage of antiregulatory legislation to ``replace this established framework with layers of additional procedural requirements,'' the Obama administration cautioned, ``would undermine the ability of agencies to execute their statutory mandates.'' Because H.1009 does this very thing, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.  I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

1019,topic-id,344,"Mr.President, today I wish to support the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act of 2017. I commend Senator Feinstein for her leadership on this bill and for shining a spotlight on the atrocious crimes perpetrated against young American athletes.  Sexual abuse is a heinous crime that must be eradicated in every corner of our society. I have long worked to prevent sexual assault and ensure that survivors have access to the resources and support they need. Last year, the Indianapolis Star reported on allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct made against coaches, gym owners, and other adults affiliated with USA Gymnastics over several decades. These very serious allegations included sexual abuse against young athletes. Predatory coaches were allowed to move from gym to gym, undetected by a lax system of oversight. The investigation also revealed that officials at USA Gymnastics, one of America's most prominent Olympic organizations, failed to alert police to many incidents of sexual abuse that occurred on their watch.  These crimes have hurt hundreds of victims across various sports. This Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Assault Act would require amateur athletic governing bodies, such as USA Gymnastics and other U.Olympic organizations, to promptly report every allegation of sexual abuse to the proper authorities. This legislation would help survivors receive justice and protect more people from becoming victims.  In addition, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Assault Act would require these national governing bodies to develop robust policies and procedures for mandatory reporting to law enforcement and to develop training and oversight practices to prevent abuse. This bill would also bolster Masha's Law, the law that lets minors bring civil suits against sexual predators and extends the statute of limitations for such cases.  The young athletes who train to represent our country at the top levels of competition and those at all levels who aspire to compete should not have to fear victimization by trusted coaches and sports officials. I want to again thank Senator Feinstein for her leadership on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgS1634.txt,2121,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,7.0,March

As expected, it is going through because people understand this is a commonsense bill, so I am happy to support this once again.  I know you were discussing H.375 earlier. I did want to return to the bill to designate the Federal building and courthouse in Nashville, Tennessee, to my good friend, Fred That building will now be named after him appropriately.  Fred Thompson was a larger-than-life character, a true patriot, and a great wit who believed in and lived the American Dream in starring roles on stage, screen, and national politics. He served as a Senator for 8 years, and then later he ran for Originally he was here in Congress serving as a counsel where, of course, we had that famous line: ``What did the President know, and when did he know it?'' That was a line that he was well known for.  What he was also often not given credit for was what a profoundly good lawyer he was. He had come to the attention of people in Tennessee by Lamar Alexander when Howard Baker came and asked now-Senator Lamar Alexander to take a role in the Watergate hearings, he said: No; you want to have Fred Thompson there. He asked his friend Fred Thompson to come and serve in that role.  Fred then became an actor because when they went to write a movie about a woman who had been dealing with corruption in Tennessee politics, and Fred had been her lawyer, they couldn't find someone to play Fred, and they came and asked him: Could you play yourself? He said: Well, I guess I could. That is how he became a character actor and a larger-than-life character there. Some of his famous lines there: ``Stack `em, pack `em, and rack `em.'' In ``Die Hard'' I believe that one was.  In movies, he starred with Paul Newman, Tom Cruise, Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Robert Duvall, Bruce Willis, Sissy Spacek, and so many others. After he came here to the Senate, he humorously said: ``I often long for the realism and sincerity of Hollywood.'' So this is somebody who took his job very seriously but never took himself seriously and continued to have that great wit.  My husband and I were very privileged to know him and learn from him and spend many a good day and delightful time and evening with him and his wife, Jeri, his family, his children, and his many friends and admirers. We are so grateful for and appreciate his celebrated service and justly celebrated service to our country. This building will be a great memorial in a State that still very much reveres him.  I was privileged to be able to attend his service where hundreds and hundreds of people from Tennessee came to honor him, from country singers to people who stood by the side of the road as we drove to his funeral service, saluting him and thanking him for his service. This is somebody who in today's politics is sorely missed by all of us, and certainly most by his many friends, his family, and his scores of fans.

185,topic-id,395,"Mr.Chairman, first, I would like to note I do oppose the underlying bill. This bill would require independent agencies, for the first time, to submit their rules to OIRA for review.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would increase direct spending by $3 million and reduce revenues by $2 million. CBO also estimates that the bill would cost Federal agencies an additional $20 million in administrative costs for compliance.  The reason the bill costs money is because it does not simply codify an executive order as its proponents suggest. The bill would require independent agencies, for the first time, to submit[[Page H1443]]their rules to OIRA for review. Independent agencies such as the FCC, SEC, and CFPB do not currently have to get the approval of the White House for regulations they issue.  Congress designed independent agencies to be just that--independent. This bill would enshrine in law the ability for the White House to engage in political interference with those agencies.  The Consumer Federation of America sent a letter to House Members today opposing this bill. The letter said, inter alia:       H.1009 will jeopardize independence of agencies like the      Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Securities and      Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading      Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, as well as      other independent agencies because it will give the Office of      Information and Regulatory Affairs the ability to review      significant rules. Authorizing OIRA to conduct its own      analysis would not only add pressure from the executive      branch and add time and expense to that process, but would      also give special interests seeking to quash a safety      measure, for example, yet another avenue to prevent a rule      from ever being promulgated.  Indeed, one suspects that is the intent of the bill.  A 2013 editorial in The New York Times warned of the dangers of subjecting independent agencies to OIRA review. The editorial foresaw what we are now dealing with 4 years later: ``Subjecting independent agencies to executive regulatory review would not improve the rule-making process, but it would ensure that ostensibly regulated industries are as unregulated and deregulated as possible.''  It also said: ``There is no question that making independent agencies less independent is a bad idea.''  My amendment would take care of that by repealing that portion of this bill.

321,topic-id,420,"I would like to thank my friend, the Senator from Florida, my colleague on the Foreign Relations Committee and on the Appropriations I would like to answer his question by saying, it seems clear to all of us on the Foreign Relations Committee who have had the opportunity to travel to Eastern Europe to visit with our NATO allies that Vladimir Putin has a world view and an agenda that is in sharp contrast with our own.  Vladimir Putin dreams of returning Russia to the days of the Russian Empire, to reexerting influence over a broad geographic region from the Baltic Sea and Poland and Ukraine to the Caucasus and Central He has internally used the West and NATO as a scapegoat for Russia's internal economic woes. He has, as we know, launched invasions or extended his influence through forces and supported illiberal and separatist fighters in Georgia and Ukraine and Moldavia, former Soviet republics, and has launched cyber attacks and propaganda campaigns and coordinated the use of all his tools of state power against our NATO allies in the Baltic region and Central and Western Europe.[[Page S1533]]  All of these things suggest a very different world view, a different set of values than we have in the United States and a different set of values in a way that really worries me. As my colleague from Florida has suggested, when Foreign Minister Lavrov talks about a world order defined by sovereignty, he is challenging us. He is challenging what the West really stands for, what we in America stand for.  I believe what we stand for is the universal values on which we forged the Transatlantic Alliance more than 70 years ago, a Transatlantic Alliance that has been a force for stability and good in the world, a Transatlantic Alliance that has secured peace in Western Europe, North America ever since the close of the Second World War but a Transatlantic Alliance that is rooted in values, values of freedom of speech, freedom of press, rule of law and democracy, and in opposition to authoritarianism.  We support American leadership because a stable and prosperous world makes us safer and more economically secure. So I would ask my friend from Florida what he views as the agenda or the objective of Russia and whether we can be hopeful, in any way, that Vladimir Putin's Russia has an agenda that is harmonious with ours, that can be put in the same direction as ours or whether it is fundamentally at odds.

323,topic-id,668,"We have worked together on a number of bills in this area. Let me respond to my friend the Senator by saying it is clear that Vladimir Putin's Russia has been a serial human rights violator. When we talk about human rights, we talk about things that belong to everyone, and they are necessary as a check on state power. When nations break these rules, we believe they should be held accountable.  Russia continues to engage in efforts, as my colleague said, that undermine democracy in free elections throughout We have shared concerns about the upcoming elections--the Dutch elections, French, and German elections--where there are overt actions and covert actions by Russia to influence the outcome of those elections, but part of why they are doing that, part of why they are violating these norms around Europe is because they are seeking to distract from their brutal rule at home.  The reality is, many of the critics of Putin's regime end up dead or incapacitated.  Boris Nemtsov, a Russian politician who supported the introduction of capitalism into the Russian economy and frequently criticized Vladimir Putin, was assassinated 2 years ago, on February 27, on a bridge just near the Kremlin in  Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian politician and journalist, was apparently poisoned last month, the second time in recent years. He had been actively promoting civil society and democracy in Russia.[[Page S1534]]  Back in September of 2012, Putin threw USAID out of Russia altogether, claiming that U.efforts were undermining Russian sovereignty when, in fact, we had been working in Russia since the nineties, supporting human rights, independent journalism, and promoting fair elections.  Most importantly, in my view, Russia doesn't just violate the human rights of its own citizens, it exports brutality.  Russia's support for Bashar al-Assad's murderous regime and brutal war in Syria continues. Their military has targeted hospitals, schools, and Syrian first responders. They have blocked the provision of food and medicine to starving families and children. Russia's diplomats have vetoed any efforts at the United Nations to act to stop the suffering in Also, Russia, having illegally invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea, continues to promote violence and instability in eastern Ukraine, in the Donbas region, leading to the deaths of thousands.  All of these human rights violations within Russia and in countries around its sphere of influence, in its region, suggest to us that they need to be held accountable for these violations of basic human rights.  Like the Senator from Florida, I led a codel to Eastern and Central Mine was not last week. It was last August, but with two Republican House Members and two Democratic Senate Members, the five of us went to the Czech Republic, to Ukraine, and to We heard widespread concern about this record of human rights and a disrespect for democracy in Russia and about this aggressive hybrid warfare campaign that threatens Ukraine's very stability and existence, that puts Estonia, our NATO ally, on warning, and that is putting at risk Czech independence and Czech elections all across Central and Western  We have heard from Ambassadors, experts, those who have testified in front of committees on which we serve, about a Russian campaign--a brutal campaign--to undermine human rights within Russia and to undermine democracy throughout Western Europe, with a larger strategic goal of separating the United States from our Western allies and undermining the Transatlantic Alliance that has been so essential to our peace, security, and stability for 70 years. We cannot let this stand.  There is no moral equivalence between Russia and the United If we believe in our democracy and if we believe in our commitment to human rights, we must stand up to this campaign of aggression. So I ask my colleague what he believes we might be able to do on the Foreign Relations Committee, on the Appropriations Committee, or here in the Senate, what we might do, as voices working in a bipartisan way, to stand up to these actions undermining democracy and human rights?

325,topic-id,435,"Well, briefly, if I could. Two bills that are currently gathering cosponsors--and which I hope our colleagues will review and consider joining us in cosponsoring--one is 341, the Russia Sanctions Review Act of 2017, which currently has 18 cosponsors. The other is 94, the Counteracting Russian Hostilities Act of 2017, that has 20 cosponsors--10 Republicans and 10 In both cases, we are proud to have a very broad range of both Republicans and Democrats engaged in this important legislation, which ensures that Russia pays a price for breaking the rules. It starts by taking action to support the sanctions against the Russian Government for its occupation, its illegal annexation of Crimea, for its egregious human rights violations in Syria, and for meddling in the U.election. It prevents the lifting of sanctions on Russia until the Russian Government ceases the very activities that caused these sanctions to be put in place in the first place. It supports civil society, pro-democracy, anti-corruption activists in Russia and across Europe to show that many of us are determined, as members of the Foreign Relations Committee, as members of the Appropriations Committee, as Senators--not as partisans--that we intend to fund the tools that will enable the United States and our NATO allies to push back on Russia's aggression. Most of these tools come from the international affairs budget: State Department and foreign assistance accounts.  I want to commend you, Senator, for giving a strong and impassioned speech on the floor today about the importance of our keeping all of these tools in our toolkit so that as we confront our adversaries around the world, we have the resources and the ability to partner with and strengthen our allies as well.  We have no quarrel with the Russian people, but we are here because there is nothing Vladimir Putin's regime would love more than to see his actions divide us in this Chamber and divide us in this country from our vital allies in Europe and divide the whole North Atlantic community that for seven decades has brought peace and stability to[[Page S1535]]Europe, has brought prosperity to the United States, not as an act of charity but as an investment in the best interests of security.  We are here to say with one voice that we will stand up to Russian aggression that undermines democracy and violates human rights.  I am grateful for my colleague, for the chance to join him on the floor today, and I look forward to working together with any of our colleagues who see these issues as clearly as my friend and colleague, the Senator from  ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgS1523.txt,1984,THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REPLACEMENT,2017.0,1.0,March

I have had some private conversations with colleagues on the floor, who have said to me, in essence, that this is an unusual and unconventional President but one who is clearly interested in making progress for the American people. He laid out a broad, welcoming vision of some of the things he wants to accomplish, but he did so in a way that welcomed Democrats and bipartisan support to help make that progress for the American people. I think they were somewhat surprised but gratified to hear the President make those sorts of remarks, and I congratulate President Trump for doing it.  Basically, he articulated an optimistic vision and a new direction for the country. This election, like the election back in 2008, was a change election. We have those every now and then. After one party is in power for 8 years, frequently, people say: We would like to try something different. We would like a change election.  We had a true change election in 2016.  The American people made clear that they wanted to get back in the game when they elected President Trump in November--by that I mean in terms of our American prosperity, our American strength, our American leadership in the world. President Trump talked about a new national pride and of cultivating a surge of economic security across the country. I think, at bottom, his speech was a message about confidence--confidence in the American people, confidence in our economic system, which has lifted more people out of poverty than has any other system the world has ever known, confidence that, unfortunately, had been lost during the Obama years that focused so much on self-doubt and America's role in the world--retreating from that role--unfortunately, leaving a void that has been filled, all too eagerly, by tyrants, dictators, and thugs, like Vladimir Putin, for example.  It is also true that this President was elected because, for too long, many people in this country had felt left out and felt like they just were not a part of the conversation we were having here about the great issues of the day. Many felt sidelined, even alienated, by irrelevant policy debates that had nothing to say to their quality of life in Many believed they truly didn't have a seat at the table.  President Trump's message throughout the campaign and now--about 5 weeks into his new administration--reflects, I think, the frustration and even the angst many Americans had felt and the gratification now, as they feel like they have somebody who believes in what they believe and will not leave them on the sidelines.  I believe what President Trump represents is an antidote to what many people saw as wrong with Washington, While it is true that President Trump has never held public office before--by all accounts, he is an unconventional political leader--last night, we heard he will work with all of us to actually do something about the concerns of hard-working American families. He will usher in a new era of renewed confidence in what the American people can accomplish together as we enter into, as he put it, a time of national rebuilding.  This is about restoring faith in the American dream. My parents were part of the ``greatest generation''--of those who fought in World War II, who preserved America and a great future for their children and grandchildren. It sickens me, when I read public opinion polling, that too many people today say they do not see that better life--more secure, more prosperous--for their children and grandchildren in the future. What they are saying, in essence, is that we are losing faith in the American dream. I think what President Trump talked about last night is a renewed faith and a renewed commitment to the American dream, which means some sacrifice on the part of the present generation, not just in spending money we do not have and in racking up debt we will never repay and that our children and grandchildren will be saddled with.  Just as one example, President Trump talked about taking on this tepid economic recovery he inherited and turning it into a jobs machine that grows our economy for everyone. This is an optimistic message, as many have noted--it is Reaganesque, really, in its tone--in its talking about building the American economy and reestablishing America's leadership role in the world. I know it is just one indicator.  If you want to look at some objective measure of the American people's hopefulness and optimism about the future, all you need to do is to look at the stock market, as it has gone up 10 percent since President Trump was sworn in and closed at a record high for the 12th day in a row--a record that goes back to 1987. To me, that is saying that the markets and the American people are hopeful about what might be accomplished together under this administration.  One of the things we heard last night, as well, is a reflection of what Vice President Pence has told us in private gatherings--I have heard him say it in public gatherings as well--which is that the administration is in the ``promise-keeping business.'' Keeping your promises is important. How are you going to maintain the public's confidence when people say one thing when they are campaigning, and then,[[Page S1515]]once they are sworn into office, they forget about those promises and move on? I am grateful this administration believes in the importance of keeping promises.  We have already seen the President keep his promises to help rein in overreaching regulations; his commitment to reforming the Tax Code, which he talked about last night, so that the economy can grow again and we can all benefit; and his commitment to repealing and replacing the failed experiment of All of these, he reiterated, he has begun to work on, and he has actually committed to seeing them through to completion. These just aren't talking points, these are promises he has already begun delivering on.  I am personally grateful--and I am sure the Presiding Officer is as well--that he has also reprioritized our national security. National security is just not one on a cafeteria plan that we can kind of walk into and say: I will take a little of this and a little of that. National security is the 1 priority for the Federal No one else can do that. At a time when our country faces innumerable threats from all around the world, including terrorism here at home, I appreciate the fact that the President is committed to doing what it takes to restore our national security, to protect our borders, and to restore the rule of law.  I think it is just as simple as this President is committed to getting back to the basics of governing. He is doing what he said he would do, and I find that reassuring, together with the outstanding Cabinet members he has selected to serve with him in his administration.  What America needs and what my constituents in Texas call, write, and ask me about all the time is a way forward that delivers security to our people, encourages prosperity for everyone, and instills confidence in the job creators and investors so we can enjoy a new era of prosperity for all of our people.  I am confident President Trump, in working closely with Congress, can deliver on these and many more promises he has made to the American people. It is obvious to me, from his comments last night, that he is welcoming and inviting our Democratic colleagues to stop the resistance--to stop the obstruction--and to actually come join us in helping to move the country forward. I find that refreshing and welcome, as I hope some of our colleagues will who still haven't quite gotten over the election on November 8 and the constituents they have who feel they are still in a protest mode. There is a time for competing in elections, and then there is a time for governing. That takes all of us, as adults who care deeply about our country, working together on a bipartisan basis to try to find common ground and move the American people's agenda forward.  I look forward to working with the President to make America a stronger, safer, and more economically vibrant nation. That is something we all want and something we should all work together to achieve.  As I said, as we go forward, I hope our friends on the other side of the aisle look at the bigger picture. I have been here long enough to experience when people run for election--like many will do in 2018--and have no record of accomplishment to point to. I believe the Presiding Officer knows what I am talking about. Growing our economy and protecting our homeland should be bipartisan. It should be nonpartisan. And, as the President mentioned, now is the time to come together to unify as Americans to make our country stronger.  I hope all of our colleagues will join together, including our Democratic friends, to let us get to the work of legislating, to let us get off of this extended foot-dragging timetable on confirming the President's nominees for his Cabinet, especially when we are seeing votes like we saw on Mr.Zinke and Mr.Ross--68 to 31, 72 to 27. There is no rationale for delaying those confirmations when our Democratic colleagues are voting to confirm them. We could have done this on January 20.  Mr.President, I thank my friend from Ohio for his courtesy.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgS1513-2.txt,1692,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2017.0,1.0,March

575,topic-id,2739,"Mr.President, today is Texas Independence Day--a day that inspires pride and gratitude in the hearts of all 28 million  Before I came to the floor, I asked the Presiding Officer, who hails from the great State of Alaska, to remind me--and he did--that Alaska is 2\1/2\ times the size of Texas in terms of landmass, not in terms of population. But today commemorates the signing of the Texas Declaration of Independence, when Texas declared itself a republic and independent from the Nation of  Here in the Senate, we remember the sacrifice of those who came before us and laid the foundation for our State by reading a letter written by William Barret Travis, a defender of the That tradition goes back to 1961, when then-Senator John Tower started that tradition. I am told my colleague Senator Cruz will read that letter in full later today, perhaps around 12:30, carrying on this great tradition. So today I wish to express my gratitude for these Texas patriots, many of whom would later serve in the U.Congress, including Sam Houston, whose Senate seat I am honored to now occupy.  Sam Houston came from his farm outside Huntsville, TX, in 1846. It took[[Page S1551]]him about 3 weeks to get to Washington, Of course, he didn't have a modern mode of transportation, but I always marvel at the fact that it now takes me about 3 hours to get home, where it took old Sam 3 weeks just to make a one-way trip.                           U.S.-Mexico Border  Mr.President, on another matter, last week I had the great privilege of hosting a number of my congressional colleagues at the Texas border. At a time when so many people are talking about the border of the United States and Mexico, I thought it was important to bring colleagues who were willing to come to learn and listen about the impact of trade, border security, and our relationship with Mexico on my State and on the United Of course, this border is so important on all of those issues--security, trade, the economy. It is important to see where they intersect. I am glad they had a chance to come to listen and learn last week.  We did receive a number of very important and useful briefings from Customs officials, Border Patrol agents, and other Federal partners in three major areas along the border, including the Rio Grande We were in McAllen, TX, Laredo, and Del I think what my colleagues discovered--if they didn't already know it--is how varied each part of the border is. This is not just true in It is true in San It is true in It is true in New When anybody suggests that we can attain a goal that we all share, which is border security, by just one solution, I think it is important to examine that conclusion and to test it because, frankly, I think what the Border Patrol will tell you is that what we need is infrastructure, yes. We need technology, yes. Then we need people.  That is the formula--personnel, technology, and infrastructure. In my own view, border security is a question of political will. The previous administration did not have that political will. I believe this administration does, and it has been long overdue. I welcome that.  We are going to be working with our State and local officials to make sure that they have the resources they need in order to get the job done. At the same time, I think what we were able to demonstrate to some of our friends from out of State is that we have an important trading relationship with As a matter of fact, 5 million American jobs depend on binational trade with  We went to one of the largest land ports in the country. I think, maybe, it is the largest port of the country--Laredo, TX--where some 15,000 trucks enter the United States every day. It is a huge influx of cargo and, fortunately, businesses all up and down and along the border have worked with the law enforcement agencies, with Customs and Border Protection to make sure that we can expedite the flow of legal trade into the United At the same time, we police for the entry of illegal drugs and for people illegally entering the United States without proper authority.  One reason why my State has done pretty well relative to the rest of the country in terms of our economy is because of our business-friendly attitude. We believe in lower taxes, reasonable regulation, and a welcoming attitude when it comes to people who make investments and who want to come to our State and start businesses or grow businesses.  We all know that roughly 70 percent of job growth in this country comes not from the Fortune 500 companies but from those small and medium-sized businesses. We work very hard to be a business-friendly Why? It is not just because we care about businesses but because we care about the workers who work at those employers.  As one of my former colleagues likes to say, you can't claim to be worker-friendly if you are hostile to the businesses that employ them. That is an inconsistent approach. You need to be consistent.  In addition to the issue of illegal entry into the United States by individuals who come without regard to our immigration laws, we also have a tremendous influx of illegal drugs into the United I think one of the things I was reminded of that we all should be cognizant of is that when we focus on the illegal drug activity in Mexico, Central America, or South America, we need to look in the mirror as a nation because the only way those cartels exist and make the money they make and commit the mayhem and violence they commit is because of demand in the United  I was very encouraged to hear Secretary John Kelly--former Marine John He is still a marine, always a marine, but now he has taken off the uniform and assumed the responsibility of Secretary of the Department of Homeland He previously served as the commanding general in the Southern Command, as the Presiding Officer knows, which covers the combatant command from south of Mexico down to Central America and South So he is very familiar with the region. He made the point, before his confirmation hearing, that there is one thing he would like to see the United States do--effect a major societal and cultural change to deal with the demand for illegal drugs, which fuels all of the cartels and the transnational criminal organizations which plague our security situation along the border and in our neighbors to the south.  I want to say that I am appreciative of our colleagues who joined us on the trip--Senators Tillis and Heller, Congressman Rouzer from North Carolina, and my colleagues from Texas, Congressmen John Carter and Mike  I also wanted to say how much I appreciate Speaker Ryan coming to Texas and the Rio Grande Valley last Wednesday for, unfortunately, a short period of time, but we are all grateful that he came at all--I think, at the invitation of people like Congressman Michael McCaul, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee in the House of I think it is going to take all of our efforts working together to effect and implement the President's vision of border security, a goal we all share.  I think what we all were reminded of is that it is more complex than some people assume, and it is going to take a combination of approaches, including personnel. We need to plus-up the Border Patrol because it doesn't do you any good if you identify somebody illegally bringing a shipment of drugs or illegally entering the United States if you don't have a Border Patrol agent to stop them. Also, the very useful border infrastructure--fencing and walls, for example, in the Hidalgo County area--were actually implemented as a way to improve their levee system when the Rio Grande river floods. They have actually created a dual-use structure that actually satisfies the Border Patrol's need for physical infrastructure along with levee improvements in a win-win situation.  I believe that consulting with local officials and local stakeholders, we at the Federal level can come up with more of those win-win solutions. The point is that we have learned a lot, particularly in our military, about how to use technology to keep us safe--whether it is unmanned aerial vehicles or ground sensors or radars. Actually, they have several new aerostats, or balloons, up in the sky that are basically the eyes in the sky, or radar, which do a tremendous job helping to identify people illegally entering the United States and equipping the Border Patrol and law enforcement authorities with the sort of early notice they need in order to interdict people illegally entering the country.  I will close by saying that one of the always surprising things I learn when I go to the Rio Grande Valley and talk to the Border Patrol is this. I ask them: How many different countries are represented by the people whom you detain illegally entering the United States? Obviously, the majority of them come from our neighbors to the south, not as much from Mexico as you might suspect anymore, because the Mexican economy is doing better and people are finding more opportunities there. But right now, the majority of the flow of people illegally entering the United States is from Central  Unfortunately, the tragic situation there where mothers and fathers worry about their children--whether they are going to be killed by gangs or whether they are going to be forced to join gangs--and somehow make the very painful and difficult choice of turning their children over to human smugglers to try to make their way up the backbone of Mexico and into the[[Page S1552]]United States, to be deposited on our doorstop in the United  Last week when the congressional delegation was in McAllen, we went through the processing area where some of these immigrants from Central America were being processed. I asked a young boy there, who was in the process of being processed--through my regional director, because he spoke only Spanish--how old he was, and he said he was 6 years old. He wasn't unaccompanied in that trip from Central America, but his mother and father thought it was important enough to get him out of that ravaged part of the world, where the prospects are not very good, and to turn him over to a human smuggler to make his way up into the United States, only to find himself at a Border Patrol processing unit in McAllen,  My point is that I also met a young man from India, and I asked him: How much did it cost you to get to the United States from India?  He said: About $6,000.  I said: How did you get here?  He said: I took a plane from  He went through Moscow, he said, and ended up in Central America, where he worked his way up with the help of human smugglers into the United  I mention that only to point out that we have a vulnerability there where anybody determined enough or with enough money can find their way into the United We generally assume these people are economic migrants--in other words, looking for opportunity. We all understand that. Those same vulnerabilities create potential danger for our Nation and our local communities when people with unknown motives exploit those same vulnerabilities to come into the United  The last point I will make, again, to emphasize the global nature of illegal immigration into the United States is this. We saw that the Border Patrol has several rescue beacons in Brooks County, This is about 70 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. What happens is that the human smugglers will transport people into the United States and across the river. They will put them in stash houses, really in terrible conditions. As a matter of fact, we went to one of these stash houses. They found 18 migrants in the stash house waiting to be transported up the highway into the heartland of  One of the checkpoints there is at Falfurrias, about 70 miles away from the border. What happens is that the smugglers will have people packed into a van or some vehicle, and before they get to the checkpoint, they will tell the immigrants to get out. If it is hot, they will give them a gallon jug--a milk jug--full of water and they will say: I will see you on the other side. They go around the checkpoint, out through the very difficult ranchland, and meet up on the north side, and then are transported off.  In Brooks County, TX, we went by a cemetery where a number of unknown and unnamed migrants have been buried because they have died due to exposure. Some of these immigrants coming from Central America come up through You can imagine the conditions they have been exposed to, and in the heat of the summer, they have been kicked out of a car and told ``meet us on the north side,'' with a gallon jug of water, and some of them don't make it. Of course the smugglers don't care about people. You are just a commodity. You are just a paycheck. So they will leave stragglers behind. Many of the ranchers said they found as many as 100 different dead bodies on their property over an unspecified period of time.  But there is a rescue beacon that the Border Patrol has down there that is in three languages. It is in English, Spanish, and You might ask, why in the world would you need Chinese written on a rescue beacon where somebody thinks ``OK, I am not going to make it; I need help'' and goes and presses the button on the rescue beacon--that you need English, Spanish, and Well, because they have had Chinese immigrants come through that border region, as well, like the young man from India whom I mentioned earlier. And we have had people from Cuba and from literally all around the world, including some nations that are hosts to terrorist organizations.  This is not only an economic situation. This is not only a law enforcement problem when it comes to drug interdiction. It is a humanitarian crisis, as well. But it is also a national security issue, I think all the leaders of the intelligence community will concede, given the fact that people from 60 different countries have been detained coming across the southwestern border just in the last year by the McAllen sector of the Border  We have a lot of work to do. I hope we will be able to work with the President and this administration and in a bipartisan way to come up with the tools we need in order to secure our border. We need to enforce our immigration laws. Of course, 40 percent of illegal immigration in this country occurs not from people entering the country illegally, it is from people entering legally and overstaying their visa. We may not catch up with them until they commit a serious crime and they are arrested by local law enforcement. I think this is what causes so many people to be angry at the Federal Government for not enforcing our laws. And many of our colleagues, me included, would like to do more to fix our broken immigration system generally, but until we regain the public's confidence that we are actually serious about securing our border and enforcing our laws, I don't believe we can have that conversation. I don't believe we are going to be successful, which I would like to see us be.  I think the first thing we need to do is to work with the administration in order to accomplish the goal of securing the border. Again, in the matter of political will, we know how to do it. We just need to have the desire to get it done. And then once we have regained the public's confidence that the Federal Government is once again living up to its responsibilities, then I think we can have that more expansive conversation about what our immigration system should look like.

He is best known perhaps for serving our State as Governor for a record 14 years. Before that, he served in the Air He served as a State representative in the Texas He was elected as our Agriculture commissioner, then served as Lieutenant As you can tell, the man was born to lead.  During his governorship, Texas became known throughout the country as the economic engine that could pull the train of the U.economy and could weather even the toughest national economic downturn. Under Governor Perry's leadership, the State promoted cutting-edge innovation and sensible regulation in order to foster an ``all of the above'' energy strategy that revolutionized the Texas energy landscape and the Texas economy. The State became not just an oil and gas powerhouse but the top wind-producing State in the country. We really do believe in an ``all of the above'' strategy when it comes to energy.  In short, Rick Perry created an environment where all energy producers could not just succeed but really prosper, and that continues to serve the people of our State well.  Texans still benefit from policies that continue to create more energy options for families across our Put it another way, Governor Perry has a very strong track record when it comes to promoting energy in a way that makes everybody better off. I have no doubt Governor Perry will take to the rest of the country these same principles that led to the Texas success story, opening America to a new energy renaissance.  I look forward to voting to confirm him in just a few minutes.  I yield the floor.

970,topic-id,1447,"Mr.President, yesterday the House of Representatives released a way forward to dismantle and replace ObamaCare, which will be to deliver on one of our biggest campaign promises made to the American people, not just in 2016 but in essentially every election since 2010.  We know ObamaCare has been an unmitigated disaster. Premiums on the ObamaCare exchanges are up by 25 percent. Millions of Americans have been kicked off their healthcare plans, and the economy has been saddled with billions of dollars in new regulations.  The fact is, ObamaCare has been one broken promise after another. President Obama and advocates of this law said if you wanted to keep your plan, you could keep it, but that didn't pan out. They said if you liked your doctor, you didn't have to find another one. That didn't turn out to be true either. They promised people across the country would have more coverage, more options, and better healthcare, all at a more affordable price. Well, that ended up not being true either.  The truth is, ObamaCare hasn't made healthcare more affordable for a lot of In fact, in Texas, if you have a gross income of $24,000, you can end up spending up to 30 percent of your gross income just on healthcare costs. That is not affordable healthcare. That is unaffordable healthcare.  Clearly, ObamaCare is no gold standard. It is a failed piece of legislation, one that is full of empty promises and one we have to scrap and start over again. Now we have an opportunity to do better for the people we represent, who are counting on us to deliver, to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with options that work.  I believe the plan released last night is a major step in the right direction. Patients need better tools like health savings accounts. That way they have more control over their healthcare decisions, and we can keep the bureaucracy out of it. We need to break down the barriers that restrict choice and keep Americans choosing an insurance plan that works for them and their families, and we need to empower employers, particularly small business owners, to provide their employees with the kind of affordable coverage that meets their needs.  To sum it up, we need to move healthcare decisions out of Washington and send them back to the States and back to patients and families and their doctors. That will only happen once we[[Page S1615]]repeal ObamaCare and replace it with options that work for more affordable healthcare coverage that patients choose, not that the government mandates and punishes you if you don't buy it but freedom of choice at a better cost and meeting the needs of individual patients.  I am glad our colleagues in the House and our friends in the White House fully understand why this is such a priority and why we need to keep the promise we made. As soon as we can do that and deliver on that major promise to the American people--the sooner we do that, a whole lot of American families across the country will feel relief.                              Nominations  Mr.President, this morning, the Senate Judiciary Committee considered the nominations of Rod Rosenstein and Rachel Brand as Deputy Attorney General and Associate Attorney General, respectively. Both of them are longtime, well-respected public servants. Mr.Rosenstein has spent his career serving the Justice Department and Presidents of both political parties. In fact, Mr.Rosenstein started in the George H.Bush Justice Department back in 1990, and he served every President since that time. He is a career public servant who has served in a bipartisan manner and has also been confirmed by the President Bush appointed him to be U.attorney and so did President  When the Obama administration needed a prosecutor of the utmost integrity to investigate national security leaks that looked highly political, they turned--you guessed it--to Rod Put another way, if Rod Rosenstein is not an acceptable nominee, who is?  This morning in the Senate Judiciary Committee, I heard some of our colleagues suggest that Mr.Rosenstein needed to make a pledge to appoint a special counsel if he was confirmed as Deputy Attorney We had two of our Maryland colleagues extoll his credentials, and rightly so, and call him a person of the utmost integrity and professionalism. Yet they, in essence, wanted him to fire himself once he became Deputy Attorney General and appoint a special counsel to do the job he would be confirmed and nominated to do. He wisely declined to make that judgment, certainly before he has had access to the facts and the information needed.  I believe he will make a formidable Deputy Attorney General, but instead of actually vetting the candidates on the merits of their impressive backgrounds and strong credentials, some used the hearing as an opportunity to air their various grievances on the current Attorney General, our former colleague Jeff Over the weekend, some went so far as to threaten to block Mr.Rosenstein's nomination if he wouldn't agree to appoint a special counsel.  I hope my colleagues in this Chamber don't stonewall his nomination or use it as a platform to disparage Attorney General The Attorney General made a decision to recuse himself from a further official role in looking into the allegations of Russian involvement in our election in 2016. I respect his decision. The fact is, we don't need another commission to study Russian involvement in the last election because we have a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee, chaired by Senator Richard Burr and the Vice Chair is Mark Warner--a bipartisan Senate Select Committee that is doing a deep dive into the allegations, including gaining access to classified information which would be important to consider in reaching a conclusion.  Yesterday I was out at CIA Headquarters and saw four large binders' worth of classified material, which obviously I am not going to discuss, but it demonstrates that this investigation is already well underway. Members of the committee and our staff are already working with the intelligence community to get the information we need in order to reach an impartial and bipartisan conclusion.  The fact is, our Democratic friends have a short memory when it comes to the Obama Justice Department, one of the most politicalized Justice Departments in American history. Loretta Lynch, who privately met with President Bill Clinton while her Department was investigating his wife's email scandal, never recused herself from the matter.  Then there was Attorney General To my knowledge, he was the first Attorney General ever held in contempt of Congress because he refused to cooperate with our legitimate oversight responsibilities when it came to Operation Fast and Well, he never recused himself and never appointed a special counsel, even though I believe he should have. Compare Attorney General Sessions, who did what he believed was the right thing to do. He recused himself when there was even a suggestion he might not be able to be impartial. He made that commitment from the beginning, well before he was confirmed. He stood by that promise last week. Attorney General Sessions' integrity is intact, and he did the right thing, but Loretta Lynch didn't. Eric Holder didn't.  For our colleagues now to suggest that Attorney General Sessions not only should recuse himself but he should resign is beyond outrageous. To suggest that the incoming Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, should somehow abdicate the role he has been nominated for, and to which he will be confirmed, is to ask him to prejudge the case before he has even had a chance to look at the evidence.  All I am asking for is our colleagues to have a little perspective. These nominees are the right caliber of people with the exact expertise we need to make sure our Justice Department runs effectively and impartially follows the law of the land. These are the types of leaders you want to handle the big issues facing the Department of  I hope soon our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will turn their attention to doing what the American people sent them to do; that is, to consider legislation rather than dragging their feet and blocking the Trump administration from getting the team he has chosen to work with in various Cabinet positions and sub-Cabinet positions.  Hopefully, soon they will decide not to obstruct progress and grind this Chamber's business to a halt but rather will be partners with us, working together to try to build consensus where we can and move the country forward.

760,topic-id,879,"Mr.Speaker, 7 years ago, in March of 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law after a 2-year process of hundreds of committee meetings, exhaustive markups--which I personally participated in--floor debate that went on for days, and, again, back-and-forth between the House and the  Since that date, despite the, again, bitter criticism by the Republican majority when that law went into effect, there have been 60 votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act; and up until this morning, the majority has always begged the question about: What is your replacement? Again, just last week, we heard rumors that there was a replacement, that the Speaker actually had drafted a bill.  Well, with scenes that looked like it was out of ``The Blair Witch Project,'' we had Members of Congress going around the Capitol opening doors with cameras doing live streams and live coverage, again, to empty rooms and denials that there actually was a bill that anyone could actually take a look at.  Well, as I said, this morning, we now have been told that there actually is a bill that has been filed, which tomorrow will be marked up and voted out of committee with not one single public hearing and, incredibly, with no analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, which any bill that has any impact on budget, whether it is a tax bill or a spending bill, has, as a matter of course, for decades, always been the case. There is no measure which contains more significance in terms of a Congressional Budget analysis than reforming the healthcare system of America, which constitutes about 15 to 20 percent of the American economy and affects the lives of tens of millions of  Well, from what we have seen so far, it appears there is a good reason that the folks wanted to keep the bill a secret. Again, the basic fundamentals of the Affordable Care Act is built on two pillars. There was an expansion of Medicaid, and there were subsidies based on income for Americans to be able to buy insurance through the marketplace.  In the State of Connecticut, where I come from, we have cut the uninsured rate down to 3.6 percent from approximately 9 percent when the bill was signed into law 7 years ago.  What this bill does is, again, it just basically decapitates the Medicaid expansion. So about 11 million Americans are going to have their healthcare coverage threatened. And those are not just, you know, people on entitlement programs. We are talking about working  I know a farmer in my district who almost lost his foot from a chain saw accident, who thanked me the other day that he had Medicaid to cover the costs of his hospital coverage.  Again, the subsidies which allowed people to buy plans on the insurance marketplace, well, they basically, as I said, decapitate And they also convert the subsidies from an income-based system to an age-rated one, which means that, basically, a well-to-do person gets the same tax credit that a poor person or a single parent has.  A conservative economist, Avik Roy, just a few minutes ago, issued a statement, saying:       Expanding subsidies for high earners while cutting health      coverage for the working poor sounds like a caricature of      mustache-twirling, top-hatted Republican fat cats.  Again, you cannot imagine a more Robin Hood in reverse than a plan that does what this tax credit change encompasses.  And, again, the list goes on and on in terms of some of the really just outrageous proposals that this new measure contains.  For seniors, again, the Affordable Care Act contracted the age rating from 3 to 1 from what existed before; it was about 6 to 7 to 1. In other words, a senior, an older person, could be charged seven times the same rate as a 20-year-old. Again, the Affordable Care Act reduced that span to 3 to 1.  This bill expands the span again to 5 to 1, which the American ARP has already issued a statement, saying:       It is nothing more than an age tax.

289,topic-id,512,"Mr.President, I applaud my colleagues for voting in favor of cloture on the nomination of Benjamin Carson to be the next Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban  On January 12, the Senate Banking Committee held its confirmation hearing, and Carson responded to questions and concerns thoroughly and thoughtfully. Benjamin Carson was unanimously reported out of the Senate Banking Committee on January 24.  To many Americans, Carson needs no introduction; however, his impressive resume bears repeating. Carson was raised by a single mother in an impoverished part of the city of He attended Yale University and the University of Michigan Medical School and later became a highly accomplished and respected neurosurgeon. Carson was named director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1984, at the age of 33--the youngest such director in the  He gained national fame in the 1980s by becoming the first doctor to lead an operation that separated twins who were conjoined at the head--one of many high-profile operations led by He also ran for President this past election and spent months traveling the country, listening to the American people about the problems and the issues they face with respect to housing.  During his testimony before our committee, Carson highlighted his commitment to carrying forth the[[Page S1514]]mandate of HUD and to learning more from the people who are directly affected by HUD policies. He has also received bipartisan letters of support from four former HUD Secretaries--Henry Cisneros, former Senator Mel Martinez, Alphonso Jackson, and Steven Preston--who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations.  He has said he plans to continue his conversation with the American people and do a listening tour if confirmed. This is an encouraging sign that Carson wants to hear from stakeholders and, more importantly, from the American people.  There are many HUD issues to be addressed. Once confirmed, we can begin working on several important issues under HUD's jurisdiction. Streamlining requirements for local public housing authorities, revising certain public housing programs, and strengthening financing for small and rural affordable housing developments are areas that should be addressed. Tackling homelessness, especially among our Nation's veterans, is another issue that is important to me and should be addressed.  It is critical that HUD allow local communities to craft solutions that work best for their needs. There has been bipartisan interest in several of these reforms over the years, and I am confident we can make progress once Carson is confirmed.  Carson has consistently demonstrated a commitment to improving the lives of his fellow Americans, and his intellect, leadership, and life experiences are unique, valuable assets for leading an agency like  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of Carson's nomination so we can continue the great work of improving America's housing system.

91,topic-id,204,"Mr.Chairman, I support this amendment to exempt rules under the Clean Air Act from this bill.  According to a 2011 study by the Environmental Protection Agency, the central benefits of the Clean Air Act exceed costs by a factor of more than 30 to 1, and the high benefits exceed costs by 90 times. Cleaner air provides exceptional economic benefits because it results in the improved health and productivity of Americans and reduces medical expenses for air pollution-related health problems.  The Clean Air Act will prevent thousands of early deaths; and its air quality and health benefits, including the prevention of heart attacks and the reduction of pulmonary diseases like chronic bronchitis, will grow over time.  Representative Raskin's amendment, which would exempt all rules that relate to the Clean Air Act, is based on common sense. Cleaner air benefits every man, woman, and child in the country. If the Environmental Protection Agency is prevented or delayed from promulgating new regulations relating to the Clean Water Act because of cost, the children of this country will pay a very heavy price.  I hope that all Members will understand the need for exempting rules that result in cleaner air for our children and support this amendment.

103,topic-id,451,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment would exempt from this bill any rule that protects whistleblowers or that imposes penalties on individuals who retaliate against whistleblowers. This bill would jeopardize all agency rulemakings--no matter how important--even rules that protect whistleblowers.  The Department of Energy issued a ruling in December that would authorize the department to impose civil penalties on Federal nuclear contractors who retaliate against whistleblowers who report information concerning nuclear safety. On January 31, 2017, DOE put a moratorium on that rule in response to President Trump's mandated freeze on rulemakings.  This is exactly the kind of rule that could become a casualty of this bill. We must ensure that agencies can issue rules that protect individuals who blow the whistle on waste, fraud, and abuse, as well as safety issues that can be a matter of life and death.  Mr.Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the Project on Government Oversight supporting my amendment. That letter states: ``Whistleblowers are the first and best line of defense against significant problems on federal projects and must be protected from retribution for the act of reporting wrongdoing.

This amendment will explicitly protect any      agency-promulgated regulations that protect whistleblowers or      that lay out penalties for those who retaliate against      whistleblowers from being targeted as ``unnecessarily      burdensome'' under the SCRUB       These regulations, like a Department of Energy (DOE) rule      that would have allowed the Department to impose civil      penalties against contractors who retaliate against      whistleblowers, are already being disrupted by the current      regulatory freeze.

He helped build his first home when he was 19 years old. After a few more years of honing his craft, Ty teamed up with Greg Schmidt, and they launched their own company in 2003. Ty's Montana work ethic helped him to discover, develop, and deploy his talents in a way that literally helped to build a better community. In recent years, his company's craftsmanship has been honored in the Billings Parade of Homes, selected as the ``Builder of the Year'' in Billings, and recognized by the Yellowstone Valley People's Choice Award for homebuilding. In 2013, Ty's company built the house for the Jude Dream Home Giveaway, with the proceeds of this effort going to benefit children's medical research. The following year Ty served as the president of the Home Builders Association in  Despite the positive recognition from the community and from others in his industry, Ty remains a humble man who doesn't seek the attention that comes with a job well done. Ty prefers to go about his business and do quality work, but ultimately the quality of Ty's work speaks for itself. Today is my chance to say a simple thank you to Ty for the work he has done and will continue to do to build a Montana that is a treasure to all of us.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-02-pt1-PgS1575-3.txt,2138,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,2.0,March

974,topic-id,532,"Mr.President, the people spoke loudly last fall. For too long, the Obama administration ignored the common sense of those who managed the lands and our natural resources. Now is the time for that power to be put back into the hands of the folks who know it best; that is, the people of Montana, not Washington, And the Bureau of Land Management's Planning 2.0 rule is no different.  The resolution we are debating today, H.44, would block the implementation of a rule that would fundamentally change the land planning process at the It would be for the worst.  During the Obama administration's final days in office, they put through many midnight rules costing a total of $157 billion, including this rule shift which was issued on December 12, 2016, which fundamentally changes the land planning process. The rule shifts the planning and decisionmaking away from those who know the land best, away from BLM regional field offices, and back to BLM Headquarters in Washington, That is the exact opposite direction that land management should be going, and that is why this rule must go also.  This rule limits the voice of our local and State governments, and it strengthens the voice of folks who are living far away from the lands that are impacted.  Montana farmers, Montana ranchers, Montana miners, the Montana electric co-ops, Montana conservation districts, and Montana county commissioners have all expressed a concern for this rule and have urged congressional action. And there can't be a more commonsense list of Montanans than that list I just mentioned. In fact, even the western Governors are concerned. As recently as February 10, 2017, our own Governor of Montana, Steve Bullock, and Governor Daugaard from South Dakota urged Congress to direct BLM to reexamine the rule. ``Governors are concerned that BLM's emphasis on landscape-scale planning may lead to a resulting emphasis on national objectives over state and local objectives.'' ``Collectively, these changes severely limit the deference Governors were previously afforded with respect to RMP development.'' That is what our Governors are saying. I am quoting our Governors from the  There needs to be more balance in Federal land management. For the last 8 years, we have been out of balance. Oil and natural gas development on Federal lands dropped significantly under President In fact, for natural gas, we have seen an 18-percent decrease, while oil production on private and State lands doubled, versus the same on Federal land.  Montana has nearly 2 million acres of public land that are inaccessible to the public. Our farmers and ranchers in Montana need a more balanced partnership with the Federal land managers. They deserve more input in the development of land management policies, not less. By the way, our Federal forests in Montana are in dire need of more active management.  So where do we go next? There is no disagreement that revisions need to be made. Let's take this rule back to the drawing board and do it right. Let's work with our new Secretary of the Department of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, a Montanan, and President Trump to restore more western commonsense to land management.

His speech lasted about 60 minutes, and I listened carefully, as did everyone in the Chamber, to the President's first remarks from that historic setting as he addressed a joint session of  There were some omissions, which I found very interesting. Not once--not one time--in the course of an hour did President Trump ever say the word ``Russia''--not one time--even though we have been told by 17 of our intelligence agencies that Russia made an overt effort to influence the outcome of the last Presidential campaign. That has never happened before in American history. A foreign country attacked the sovereignty of the United States in the election process for the highest office in the land. I think that is noteworthy. It is certainly historic. It would certainly be worth at least a mention when a President speaks to a joint session of Congress just a few months after that election. Instead, there was radio silence, mute button, crickets--nothing about  What do we have in terms of congressional response to the possibility that Vladimir Putin was trying to pick our next President? We have the suggestion by the Republican leaders in the Senate and the House that this matter should be taken up by the Intelligence  It sounds reasonable on its face. Having served on Intelligence Committees, I can tell you it is an awesome responsibility and assignment. I can also tell you we have some extraordinarily gifted, talented, patriotic members of those committees from both political parties in the Senate and in the House, but there is a fundamental flaw to this approach. If you went searching on Capitol Hill to find the room in which the Senate Intelligence Committee meets, you would come up empty. There is no sign on the door. It is basically kept clandestine, confidential, and secret. For 4 years, I entered that door, sat down in closed hearings, with no one from the public able to hear or even appreciate what we were doing. It is a lonely assignment--unlike any other committee on Capitol  I wonder: Is that what we want to do to explore the involvement of Vladimir Putin in our Presidential campaign--to go behind closed doors in secret and meet clandestinely? I think not.  There is an aspect of this that will require some intelligence gathering, some discussion of intelligence--and certainly that would be secret--but there is much more of it that is public in nature that will never be disclosed if we rely on the Senate Intelligence It is an invisible process, and that invisible process does not serve the needs of a democracy that wants the truth--the straight talk, the answers.  Secondly, the work of an Intelligence Committee ends up in a report that is classified, which means the public doesn't get to see it. We have seen some renditions of it--heavily redacted pages, where one or two words might escape being crossed out.  How do you move from a classified document on Putin's involvement in our Presidential campaign to a public document the people can understand? It takes declassification. Who makes the decision on whether we declassify the information from the Intelligence Committee investigation? The White  So, with the possibility--and I underline that word--with the possibility that some people in the President's campaign may or may not have been involved in this, the President has the last word as to the American people ever hearing the results of an Intelligence Committee report.  Many of us believe this is serious, and many of us believe there should be an independent, transparent commission, just like the 9/11 Let's call on people we respect, such as GEN Colin Powell, Sandra Day O'Connor, a former Supreme Court Justice, and many others just like them, who could get to the bottom of this and answer the basic questions: What were the Russians up to? We hear they had 1,000 trolls sitting in offices in Moscow dreaming up ways to hack into the computers and Internet of the United States and to disclose information to try to influence the outcome of the election. It is not a new tactic from They have done it over and over again.  The last couple of weeks I visited Poland, Lithuania, They know these tactics oh so well. Under Soviet times and since, Russia has tried to invade their space when it comes to election decisions--overtly, covertly, through propaganda, through cyber attacks. They have done it in many countries around the world. Sadly, they are good at it. Now they have decided they can do it in the United They can decide who our President will be or at least try to. Are we going to take this sitting down?  November 8, 2016, election day, was a day that will live in cyber infamy in the United The Russians invaded the U.election process. The President of the United States spoke to the American people last night and never mentioned one word--not a single word--about this.  How many Republican Senators and Congressmen have come to the floor? I don't know about in the House, but I can tell my colleagues I know about the Not one has come to the floor to even address this issue.  So when President Trump ignored it last night, refused to even mention it, I wasn't surprised, but it is not going away. It is a fact.  We currently have an investigation underway in our intelligence agencies. I just met with former Senator Dan Coats of He has been designated by the President to be the DNI--the Director of National He made a statement publicly yesterday before a hearing in Congress that he is going to cooperate with the committees and with Congress in disclosing information they have accumulated in our intelligence agencies as to this Russian involvement in our election.  We also know the Federal Bureau of Investigation is involved in this same exercise to find out exactly what happened and to disclose as much as possible and take action--prosecutorial action--if necessary.  There is a problem, though. The Federal Bureau of Investigation works for the Attorney The Department of Justice has the power to impede or stop any FBI investigation. Our former colleague Jeff Sessions was deeply and personally involved in the Trump Presidential campaign. He should recuse himself. He has an obvious conflict of interest on this issue. For the integrity of the office and for his own personal integrity, he should step aside and appoint a special prosecutor who can follow up, if necessary, with this FBI investigation.  This is a serious matter that was not addressed at all last night by the President of the United States speaking to a joint session of  The Associated Press went through some of the claims that were made by the President last night, and I want to give them credit for their homework on this. It is important for the Record that some of the things the President said be explained.  The President said:       According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current      immigration system[[Page S1524]]     costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.  The Associated Press writes:       That's not exactly what the report says. It says immigrants      ``contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add      expenditures by consuming public service.''       The report found that while first-generation immigrants are      more expensive to governments than their native-born      counterparts, primarily at the state and local level,      immigrants' children ``are among the strongest economic and      fiscal contributors in the population.'' This second      generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis,      for example, than non-immigrants in the period, 1994-2013.       The report [that the President unfortunately      mischaracterized] found that the ``long-run fiscal impact''      of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as      more positive ``if their role in sustaining labor force      growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial      activity were taken into account.''  So to argue, as the President did yesterday, that the National Academy of Sciences, as he said, stated that our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars is, at best, incomplete and misleading.  The President then went on to say during the course of his speech last night:       We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by      bringing down the price of the F-35 jet fighter.  I remember when he said that.  The Associated Press says as follows:       The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured      in full or large part before he became  He has taken credit for something he didn't do.  According to the AP:       The head of the Air Force program announced significant      price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35      fighter on December 19--after [candidate] Trump, [President-     Elect Trump] had tweeted about the cost but weeks before he      met with the company's  The AP goes on:       Pentagon managers took action even before the election to      save [this] money. . . . Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with      the aerospace consulting firm Teal Group, said there is no      evidence of any additional cost savings as a result of      President Trump's actions.  Here is another statement made by the President last night:       We will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.  I remember that one. That is something I hope we all can aspire to, but let me tell my colleagues what the Associated Press says about that claim.       Trump has provided little detail on how this would happen.      Independent analyses of his campaign tax proposals found that      most of the benefits would flow to the wealthiest families.      The richest 1 percent would see an average tax cut of nearly      $215,000 a year, while the middle one-fifth of the population      would get a tax cut of just $1,010, according to the Tax      Policy Center, a joint project with the Brookings Institution      and Urban  Here is another statement the President made last night:       Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.  The Associated Press says:       That's true, but for the vast majority of them, it's      because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes      everyone aged 16 and older who doesn't have a job and isn't      looking for one. So it includes retirees, parents who are      staying home to raise children, high school and college      students who are studying rather than working.       They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the      economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching      retirement age many of them retiring, the population of those      out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do      so, most economists forecast.       It's true that some of those out of the workforce are of      working age and have given up looking for work. But that      number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million      President Trump cited.  Another statement the President made: He said his budget plan will offer ``one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.''  I will not dwell on this other than to say that the absolute number--a $54 billion increase, or about 10 percent, is the largest single number. On a percentage basis, there have been larger increases in previous years, like 2002, 2003, and 2008.  Here is another claim made by the President last night:       Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors,      Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others      have announced they will invest billions of dollars in the      United States and will create tens of thousands of new      American jobs.  The Associated Press reports that ``many of the announcements reflect corporate decisions that predate [Trump's Presidential] election,'' making it unlikely his administration ``is the sole or even primary reason for the expected hiring. . . . In the case of Intel, construction of the Chandler, Arizona, factory referred to by Trump actually began during Barack Obama's presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel's high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth.  Another statement made by President Trump last night in his speech:       We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and      poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those      who have become so badly addicted.  The facts:       Addicts and mentally ill people who gain access to      treatment programs for the first time as a result of      ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act--are worried about repeal      that President Trump has called for. Repeal could end      coverage for 1.8 million people who have undergone addiction      or mental health treatment, cut $5.5 billion on spending on      such services according to estimates by economist Richard      Frank, a former administration official under Barack Obama,      now with the Harvard Medical  The AP goes on to say:       The key question is what will happen to Medicaid as a      result of changes Republicans are pursuing? Broadly speaking,      Republicans want to transform the health insurance program      for low-income people from an open-ended Federal entitlement      to a system that provides States with a limited amount of      financing and gives them latitude on how to spend it.  The AP goes on to say:       If Congress is too stingy with State allotments, States      would be hampered dealing with the emergencies like the      opioid epidemic.  The next statement by President Trump last night:       According to data provided by the Department of Justice,      the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-     related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our      country. We have seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San      Bernardino to the Pentagon, and yes, even the World Trade       The Associated Press responds:       It's unclear what Justice Department data the President is      citing. The most recent government information that has come      out doesn't back up his claim. Just over half the people      President Trump talks about were actually born in the United      States, according to Homeland Security Department research.      That report said of 82 people the government determined were      inspired by foreign terrorist groups to attempt to carry out      an attack on the U.S., just over half [of them] were [born in      the United States] native-born citizens.  The AP goes on to say:       Even the attacks Trump singled out weren't entirely the      work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his      Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the deadly 2015 attack in      San Bernardino, California, was born in       It's true that in the immediate aftermath of September 11,      the FBI's primary concern was with terrorists from overseas      feared to be plotting attacks in the United But      that's no longer the case.

The Justice Department has      prosecuted scores of Islamic State-related cases since 2014,      and many of the defendants are U.citizens.  Another statement by President Trump last night:       ObamaCare is collapsing . . . imploding Obamacare disaster.  The AP writes:       There are problems with the 2010 health care law, but      whether it's collapsing is hotly disputed.       One of the two major components of the Affordable Care Act      has been a spike in premiums and a drop in participation from      insurers. But the other component, equally important, seems      to be working fairly well, even if its costs are a concern.       Trump and congressional Republicans want to repeal the      whole thing, which risks leaving millions of people uninsured      if the replacement plan has shortcomings. Some critics say      GOP rhetoric itself is making things worse by creating      uncertainty about the future.       The health law offers subsidized private health insurance      along with a state option to expand Medicaid for low-income      people. Together, the two arms of the program reach more than      20 million people.       Republican governors whose states have expanded Medicaid      are trying to find a way to persuade Congress and the      administration to keep this expansion, and maybe even build      on it, while imposing limits on the long-term costs of      Medicaid.[[Page S1525]]       While the Medicaid expansion seems to be working, the      markets for subsidized health insurance are stressed in many      states. Also affected are millions of people who buy      individual policies outside the government markets, and face      the same high premiums with no financial help from the health      law. Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation      says ``implosion'' is too strong a term. An AP count found      that 12.2 million people signed up for this year, despite      the Trump administration's threats to repeal the law.  I might add, that it is despite all of the speeches made on the floor of the Senate and the House, promising that it would be repealed as well.  The last point I want to make is this. I was troubled last night by a recurring theme in the President's speech. It was a theme about immigration in the United We are a nation of immigrants. My mother was an immigrant to this country. I am proud to serve as a Senator from the State where she and her family settled. I am proud of the struggle they went through--coming to this country, not knowing the language, going through some pretty rough times, facing poverty, taking the dirtiest and toughest jobs. Because of that, the second generation of my family--the one I represent--has brought some great people to this world in our own families and perhaps even added to the benefits of the United States for others.  Last night, if you listened to the characterization of immigrants, it was negative, virtually from start to finish.  In the audience last night, I had a young lady as my guest. She is an extraordinary lady. Her name is Aaima She is Pakistani, and she was brought to the United States at the age of 3 by her parents from They settled in Chicago and eventually moved to New It turns out the family had its difficulties and the mother and father split and separated. When the father left, he left behind his paperwork--which was in place or at least in the process--of trying to legalize the presence of his family, and nothing was done.  It wasn't until she was in high school that this young lady realized that she was undocumented. That creates obstacles for any young person. In her case, a special obstacle was the cost of higher education. As an undocumented child in America, she didn't qualify for government assistance--Federal Government assistance--and limited State assistance. Yet she aspired to go on to school and to borrow the money, if necessary, at high interest rates from private sources in order to finish her education. She graduated from Rutgers University magna cum laude and then wanted to go to medical school.  There weren't many medical schools accepting undocumented students, but there was one. I am proud to tell you that it was Loyola University of Chicago, the Stritch School of There were about 65 undocumented young people in medical school in the United States, and 30 of them were at Loyola in I have met most of them. Each and every one of them is more inspiring than the next.  They opened up the competition. They didn't give them slots to fill. They said: Compete with everyone. These students were so outstanding from across the United States that they made it to  This young lady, in her third year, faces another 6 years of education before she completes her medical degree. When she is finished with those 6 years, it isn't over. In Illinois, we told her she could go to school, but it was part of a contract. She could attend school, and we would reduce the interest payments at a later part in her life if she gave us 1 year of service in an underserved community in Illinois for each year of medical school. She has 6 years of school left and 4 years of serving in a rural community or an underserved neighborhood clinic in the city of Chicago or nearby.  She signed up for it. She is an amazing young person. She is determined to get this medical degree--despite the debt, despite the obstacles. The only reason she can do this is because she is protected by something called  Let me explain. Some 16 years ago, I introduced a bill called the DREAM It said that if you were brought to the United States, like she was, under the age of 16, you had a good life, no criminal record or history of a problematic nature, and completed your education, you can stay in the United States and eventually work your way toward legalization.  President Obama took it up and created an Executive order called DACA and said to the young people in that situation: Come and apply, pay a $600 filing fee, then go through a criminal background check, and if you make it, we will give you 2 years to live in the United States without fear of deportation, with a work permit.  She signed up. That is how she can go to medical school. You need to work to go to medical school. She is going through a clinical experience where she is actually working in these hospitals. Without a work permit, she wouldn't be able to complete medical school.  The obvious question is this: What is going to happen to this program under President Trump? In fairness, the President has said positive things about DACA and I thanked him personally. I have only met him three times, but I thanked him personally twice for doing that. I hope that it means that ultimately there will be some path for the 750,000 young people, just like her, who are simply asking for a chance to be educated and be part of America's future.  I hope that, as people who listened to the speech last night think about immigrants to the United States, they will think about this young woman, as well, who has worked so hard her entire life to better herself and to be able to help others at a later point in life.  She is an extraordinary person, and there are so many more just like her. They are immigrants to this country. In this case it is Muslim immigrant to this country who someday will be an exceptional doctor, who is going to give 4 years of her life back to my home State and then is going to help others all across the United That, to me, is an image of immigrants that shouldn't be lost with the negative connotations that were raised last night.

614,topic-id,1691,"Mr.President, the highlight of the week, of course, is President Trump's speech to the joint session of Congress, the first major public speech he has given since his inauguration. The Chamber of the House of Representatives was filled with Members of both the House and Senate, the Supreme Court Justices, the Cabinet, and many other dignitaries for the speech. It went for about 60 minutes, which is reasonable under Presidential standards. Many have gone much longer, and I listened carefully to the statement by the new President to really glean his priorities, in terms of his administration and what he hopes to see happen in this country.  There were many issues that he touched on, but there was one he didn't. He didn't say a word--not one word--about the Russian intervention in our last Presidential campaign. This is not speculation. It is a reality that 17 different U.intelligence agencies have told us that Vladimir Putin and the Russian Government were attempting to subvert and undermine our Presidential election. To our knowledge, that has never happened at any time in the history of the United It is the first time a sovereign nation has tried to literally launch a cyber invasion of the United States of America to try to change the outcome of the most important electoral choice under the Constitution--the choice of President of the United It is a major issue. It is one President Trump cannot ignore.  During the course of that speech, he never once mentioned the word ``Russia.'' He never raised this issue as to whether it was worthy of investigation. He described it as a ruse. He has dismissed it and basically has paid no attention to it whatsoever and wants the rest of America to forget it as well.  That is not going to happen because the investigation about this Russian cyber invasion continues. We know the Federal Bureau of Investigation is deep into an investigation. I don't know what it will find. I don't know if they will find any complicity with anyone in the United States, anyone in the Trump campaign. It is only after we have an independent, complete, and credible investigation that we may know the facts.  We also have an investigation underway by many of our intelligence agencies, which are looking at the involvement of the Russians trying to change the outcome of our election. Those investigations are underway.  One element came up last night that has changed the conversation in Washington about this whole issue. Even before last night's news, we knew Attorney General Jeff Sessions needed to recuse himself from any Justice Department investigation into Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 election in support of the Trump campaign.  The Department of Justice standard for recusal--that is, the removal of the Attorney General from an investigation--is pretty clear. It requires recusal by someone who has ``a personal or political relationship with any person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation.''  The Department of Justice regulations define ``political relationship'' to include service as a principal adviser to a candidate or campaign organization. Well, that certainly covers Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Trump campaign. Attorney General Sessions was named in March 2016 as chairman of then-Candidate Trump's National Security Advisory Steve Bannon, formerly of Breitbart News and now a close adviser to the President, described Jeff Sessions to the Washington Post as follows: ``Throughout the campaign, Sessions has been the fiercest, most dedicated, and most loyal promoter in Congress of Trump's agenda, and has played a critical role as the clearinghouse for policy and philosophy to undergird the implementation of that agenda.''  Attorney General Sessions close relationship with the Trump campaign creates a compelling basis for his recusal from any investigation of Russian involvement in that campaign.[[Page S1570]]  So far, to this day, to this moment, Jeff Sessions has refused to recuse himself from this investigation. He refused when I asked him about it during the course of the hearing, and he has refused since he was named Attorney Now it is clear that his unwillingness to recuse himself is no longer tenable or acceptable or even explainable.  Last night, the Washington Post reported that then-Senator Jeff Sessions spoke with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice during the Presidential campaign--in July at a Heritage Foundation event near the Republican National Convention and in September in a private conversation in the Senator's office. These communications came as a great surprise because until last night, Attorney General Sessions did not disclose them.  During his hearing in January, in preparation to become Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, then Senator, was asked by Senator Al Franken of Minnesota: ``If there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what would you do?''  Jeff Sessions' answer under oath included this statement: ``I did not have communications with the Russians.''  Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont also asked Attorney General Sessions in writing: ``Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?'' Attorney General Sessions' response was ``No.''  It is hard to understand why Attorney General Sessions has not been more forthcoming and upfront with Congress and the American people about communications which we now know in fact did take place. If he thinks there was nothing wrong with these communications, why would he conceal them? It is deeply troubling.  The reality is, the Attorney General has compromised his credibility when it comes to investigating Russia's cyber invasion of America's election. His recusal is no longer an option, it is a necessity.  People say: Oh, of course, a Democratic Senator is saying that the Republican Attorney General should recuse himself. This morning, it has been reported that a number of top Republicans in Congress have called for the Attorney General's recusal, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Oversight Chairman Jason  It is imperative that career Justice Department professionals be allowed to follow the facts in this investigation to discover the truth. We may need a special counsel, but these steps alone are not sufficient. I believe we need an independent, bipartisan commission, led by Americans of unimpeachable integrity, to get to the bottom and get to the facts on this attack on our democracy.  I know the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is also conducting an investigation. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which, incidentally, is chaired by Representative Devin Nunes, who served on the executive committee of President Trump's transition team, agreed to the parameters of an investigation yesterday.  The Intelligence Committees cannot, by their very nature, provide the transparency and accountability that an independent commission would bring to this issue, and the chairmen of those two committees--House and Senate--have already raised serious questions about their own impartiality by calling on the media organizations at the behest of the White House to challenge news stories on this issue.  How could you possibly maintain objectivity if the elements of an investigation are compromised before the investigation even starts?  I am particularly concerned that Chairman Nunes has already publicly expressed views of the outcome of his committee's investigation before it has even started. That is not a professional, honest, or credible way to approach this.  We need an independent, bipartisan commission to get to the truth, and that may include taking a hard look at the Attorney General's communications with the Russians and at his refusal to disclose those communications. We also need to point out the obvious, which is that when it comes to investigating Russia's involvement in helping the Trump campaign, we have to follow the money, and that includes reviewing President Trump's tax returns, which, unlike any other Presidential candidate in modern times, he has refused to share with the American people.  Yesterday, Senators Stabenow, Wyden, and a number of my colleagues sent a letter to the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch, of Utah, urging him to allow committee members to review the President's tax returns in a closed executive session. That is something the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee has the authority to do. The letter pointed out that this oversight is essential given the media reports about Russia as well as the possible unconstitutional emoluments being accepted by President Trump's vast business empire.  I support this request from my colleagues. It is imperative that President Trump level with the American people about his business's foreign entanglements, especially those involving  This issue is not going away. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in pursuing all of the facts about last year's Russian attack on our democracy.  It was just a few weeks ago that the President's National Security Advisor, General Flynn, resigned. Do you remember why? He misrepresented to the Vice President and the American people conversations which he had had with the He ended up giving up his position as the 1 person in national security in the White  Now questions have been raised about the credibility of the Attorney General--the 1 person in the Trump administration when it comes to the administration of justice. What is the issue? It is the same issue as with General Flynn--conversations with the Russians which were not disclosed to the American public.  This is an issue that is going to continue to be in the forefront, as it should be, until we can bring the facts to the American people. The only way to reach that point is by having the Attorney General recuse himself from any investigation, appointing as a special prosecutor--or someone in that capacity--someone who is credible who can pursue this matter and then initiating an independent, bipartisan investigation by a national commission with credible chairs who have no political agenda and care enough for the United States to view this invasion by Russia as absolutely unacceptable.

Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on Appropriations exceeds or is below the statutory spending limits for fiscal year 2017. This information is used to determine points of order related to the spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the As the Federal Government is currently operating under the terms of the latest continuing resolution and temporary funding is not included in enforcement totals, this scorecard shows $543.5 billion in security and $415.2 billion in nonsecurity budget authority remain available for full-year appropriations.  Table 3 tracks compliance with the fiscal year 2017 limit for overall changes in mandatory programs, CHIMPS, in appropriations bills, established in the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution. The limit for this fiscal year is $19.1 billion. To date, there are no recorded CHIMP entries on this scorecard. Division A of the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017, P.114-254, included a qualifying CHIMP, $170 million, but the Appropriations Committee included a provision to prevent its budgetary effects from being entered onto the scorecard. This exclusion was the first of its kind since the creation of the new rule in 2015. This information is used for determining points of order under section 3103 of that resolution.  In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican staff, I am submitting tables from CBO, which I will use for enforcement of budget totals agreed to by the  CBO provided a spending and revenue report for fiscal year 2017. This information is used to enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under section 311 of the  For fiscal year 2017, CBO annualizes the temporary effects of the latest continuing resolution that provides funding through April 28, 2017. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, the Budget Committee excludes this temporary funding. As such, the committee views current-law levels as being $953 billion and $583.2 billion below budget resolution levels for budget authority and outlays, respectively. Revenues are consistent with the levels assumed in the budget resolution. Finally, Social Security outlays and revenues are at the levels assumed in 3.  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. Following passage of the budget resolution in January, I reset the Senate's PAYGO scorecard to zero. Since passage of the resolution, there have been no laws enacted that have a significant effect on the Federal Government's budget deficit over either the 6- or 11-year periods.

Mike Enzi,     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,     U.Senate, Washington,       Dear Mr.Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of      Congressional action on the fiscal year 2017 budget and is      current through February 27, 2017. This report is submitted      under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the      Congressional Budget Act, as amended.       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues      are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of      3, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for      Fiscal Year 2017.       Since our last letter dated November 16, 2016, the Congress      has cleared and the President has signed the Further      Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017      (Public Law 114-254). That act has significant effects on      budget authority and outlays in fiscal year 2017.           Sincerely,                                                       Keith         TABLE 1.--SENATE CURRENT LEVEL REPORT FOR SPENDING AND REVENUES FOR                FISCAL YEAR 2017, AS OF FEBRUARY 27, 2017                        [In billions of dollars]------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               Current                                      Budget      Current    Level  Over/                                    Resolution    Level b     Under (-)                                        a                     Resolution------------------------------------------------------------------------ON-BUDGET    Budget Authority-............    3,226.1--    3,308.0--         81.9    Outlays--....................    3,224.6--    3,254.7--         30.1    Revenues--...................    2,682.1--    2,682.1--          0.0OFF-BUDGET---    Social Security Outlays c--..      805.4--      805.4--          0.0    Social Security Revenues--...      826.0--      826.0--          0.0------------------------------------------------------------------------SOURCE: Congressional Budget Office.---a -Excludes $81,872 million in budget authority and $40,032 million in  outlays assumed in 3 for non regular discretionary  spending, including spending that qualifies for adjustments to  discretionary spending limits pursuant to section 251(b) of the  Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, that is not  yet allocated to the Senate Committee on Appropriations.b Excludes emergency funding that was not designated as an emergency  requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget  and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.c Excludes administrative expenses paid from the Federal Old-Age and  Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance  Trust Fund of the Social Security Administration, which are off-  budget, but are appropriated annually.

These amounts, which are not included in the current level totals, are as follows:                                                                     Budget                                                                  Authority-        Outlays-         Revenues----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations                 -2--             -1--                0 Act, 2017 (P.114-254)--..................................----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------c Division A of P.114-254 contains the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017, which provides funding  for those agencies within the jurisdiction of 11 of the 12 regular appropriations bills through April 28,  2017; those amounts are shown under the ``Continuing Resolution'' section of this table. Certain provisions in  Division A provide funding until or beyond the end of fiscal year 2017; those amounts are shown in the  ``Previously Enacted'' section of this table. In addition, Division B of P.114-254 contains the Security  Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017, which provides funding until or beyond the end of fiscal year 2017 for  overseas contingency operations; those amounts are shown under the ``Previously Enacted'' section of this  table.d Sections 193-195 of Division A of P.114-254 provided funding, available until expended, for innovation  projects and state responses to opioid abuse. CB0 estimates that, for fiscal year 2017:The $20 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section 193 would result in an additional $5  million in outlays for FDA innovation projects;The $352 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section 194 would result in an additional $91  million in outlays for NIH innovation projects;The $500 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section 195 would result in an additional $160  million in outlays for state response to opioid abuse.Consistent with sections 1001-1004 of P.114-255, for the purposes of estimating the discretionary budget  authority and outlays for these provisions under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974 and the  Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Act of 1985, these amounts are estimated to provide no budget authority  or outlays.e For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as  approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a  result, current level does not include these items.f Excludes $81,872 million in budget authority and $40,032 million in outlays assumed in 3 for non  regular discretionary spending, including spending that qualifies for adjustments to discretionary spending  limits pursuant to section 251(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, that is  not yet allocated to the Senate Committee on  TABLE 3.--SUMMARY OF THE SENATE PAY-AS-YOU-GO SCORECARD FOR THE 115TH                    CONGRESS, AS OF FEBRUARY 27, 2017                        [In millions of dollars]------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 2016-2021-   2016-2026------------------------------------------------------------------------Beginning Balance a-..........................          0--            0Enacted Legislation: b,c,d    Tested Ability to Leverage Exceptional               *-            *     National Talent Act of 2017 (P.115-1)-    Disapproving the rule submitted by the               *-            *     Department of the Interior known as the     Stream Protection (P.115-5)-....                                               -------------------------Current Balance-..............................           *-            *Memorandum:   -                                            2016-2021--    2016-2026    Changes to Revenues-......................           *-            *    Changes to Outlays-.......................           *-            *------------------------------------------------------------------------Source: Congressional Budget Office.Notes: n.e. = not able to estimate; P.= Public Law; FAA = Federal  Aviation Administration; *= between -$500,000 and $500,000.a Pursuant to the statement printed in the Congressional Record on  January 17, 2017, the Senate Pay-As-You-Go Scorecard was reset to  zero.b The amounts shown represent the estimated effect of the public laws on  the deficit.c Excludes off-budget amounts.d Excludes amounts designated as emergency requirements.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgS1536-2.txt,1542,BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT,2017.0,1.0,March

Whereas, in the United States' system of checks and      balances, Congress has a responsibility to hold the Executive      Branch of government to the highest standard of transparency      to ensure the public interest is placed first;       Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every      President since Gerald Ford has disclosed their tax return      information to the public;       Whereas, tax returns provide an important baseline      disclosure because they contain highly instructive      information including whether the candidate paid taxes, what      they own, what they have borrowed and from whom, whether they      have made any charitable donations, and whether they have      taken advantage of tax loopholes;       Whereas, disclosure of the President's tax returns could      help those investigating Russian influence in the 2016      election understand the President's financial ties to the      Russian Federation and Russian citizens, including debts owed      and whether he shares any partnership interests, equity      interests, joint ventures or licensing agreements with Russia      or Russians;       Whereas, the New York Times has reported that President      Trump's close senior advisers, including Carter Page, Paul      Manafort, Roger Stone, and General Michael Flynn, have been      under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation      for their ties to the Russian Federation;       Whereas, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov      told Interfax, a Russian media outlet, on November 10, 2016      that ``there were contacts'' with Donald Trump's 2016      campaign, and it has been reported that members of President      Trump's inner circle were in contact with senior Russian      officials throughout the 2016 campaign;       Whereas, according to his 2016 candidate filing with the      Federal Election Commission, the President has 564 financial      positions in companies located in the United States and      around the world;       Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the      Office of Government Ethics, the President has refused to      divest his ownership stake in his businesses;       Whereas, the director of the nonpartisan Office of      Government Ethics said that the President's plan to transfer      his business holdings to a trust managed by family members is      ``meaningless'' and ``does not meet the standards that . . .      every president in the past four decades has met'';       Whereas, the Emoluments Clause was included in the U.     Constitution for the express purpose of preventing federal      officials from accepting any ``present, Emolument, Office, or      Title . . . from any King, Prince, or foreign state'';       Whereas, according to the Washington Post, the Trump      International Hotel in Washington, D.has hired a      ``director of diplomatic sales'' to generate high-priced      business among foreign leaders and diplomatic delegations;       Whereas, according to Reuters, the Trump International      Hotel could receive up to $60,000 from the Kuwaiti government      for a party it held at the Hotel on February 22, 2017.       Whereas, according to the New York Times, the President      used a legally dubious tax maneuver in 1995 that could have      allowed him to avoid paying federal taxes for 18 years;       Whereas, the most signed petition on the White House      website calls for the release of the President's tax return      information to verify compliance with the Emoluments Clause,      with 1 million, 78 thousand signatures as of the date of this      resolution;       Whereas, the Chairmen of the Ways and Means Committee,      Joint Committee on Taxation, and Senate Finance Committee      have the authority to request the President's tax returns      under Section 6103 of the tax code;       Whereas, the Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed the tax      returns of President Richard Nixon in 1974 and made the      information public;       Whereas, the Ways and Means Committee used IRC 6103      authority in 2014 to make public the confidential tax      information of 51 taxpayers;       Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether      or not their President is operating under conflicts of      interest related to international affairs, tax reform,      government contracts, or otherwise: Now, therefore, be it:       That the House of Representatives shall--       1. Immediately request the tax return information of Donald      Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015 for review in closed      executive session by the Committee on Ways and Means, as      provided under Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, and      vote to report the information therein to the full House of            2. Support transparency in government and the longstanding      tradition of Presidents and Presidential candidates      disclosing their tax returns.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

851,topic-id,296,"Mr.Speaker, under clause 1 of rule IX, questions of the privilege of the House are ``those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.''  I believe the dignity and the integrity of the House are put at risk when this body refuses to exercise its statutory authority and constitutional obligation to operate as a check on the executive branch.  Under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, three congressional committees have jurisdiction to request tax returns: House Ways and Means, Senate Finance, and the Joint Committee on  This authority was placed in the Tax Code by Congress in 1924 to allow for full investigations of several scandals in the Harding administration, including the Teapot Dome bribery scandal. Section 6103 was the subject of considerable debate in this Chamber, but, ultimately, Congress passed it in order to provide an important investigatory check on the executive branch.  In 1974, section 6103 authority was used by the members of the Joint Committee on Taxation to publish a staff report on President Nixon's tax returns revealing that he owed nearly a half a million dollars in back taxes. Today, I worry that we are rapidly approaching a scandal of a similar magnitude to these previous events.  Since we voted on a similar resolution last week, the Attorney General and other senior administration officials have admitted that they met with Russian officials during the campaign and the transition period. This comes after the campaign and unequivocally last year saying that there was ``no communications between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaign.''  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

1018,topic-id,2037,"Mr.President, yesterday I introduced the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act, a bill to protect young athletes who participate in the U.amateur ranks from sexual abuse.  Before last summer's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, the Indianapolis Star published an investigative piece that revealed that amateur gymnasts were sexually abused in gyms all across the country. No one knew how widespread the problem was in that sport.  But throughout the investigation, the Indianapolis Star tallied--after reviewing police files and court cases across the country--368 gymnasts who alleged they were sexually abused over a 20-year time period.  Kids as young as 6 were secretly photographed in the nude by coaches. Young athletes were molested by coaches during ``therapy'' sessions. Sexual predators spent countless hours with children one-on-one and abused them for years before anything was done. These accounts were devastating. And they were just the tip of the iceberg.  After reviewing this report, I, along with my colleagues Senator Leahy, Senator Blumenthal, and Senator Donnelly, wrote to USA Gymnastics to urge the organization to do more to protect their young athletes.  Specifically, we urged the organization to update its policies and require that all members--including coaches, athletes, and others--immediately report to law enforcement when there is an incident of sexual abuse committed against an athlete.  After we sent the letter, several sexual abuse victims from California reached out to my staff. They revealed that they were abused by individuals affiliated with USA I told my staff that I had to meet them.  Six brave women, who were each abused as young gymnasts at various points in their careers, then travelled across the country to share their testimonies with me. Two athletes from another sport who were sexually abused also joined us. I will never forget their faces that day. When I walked into the room, I could sense the overwhelming devastation wrought on their lives.  One by one, they shared their hopes and dreams as young athletes. The gymnasts talked about how, while pursuing future Olympic glory, they put their complete faith in the USA Gymnastics infrastructure. They fully trusted the coaches and doctors who had the USA Gymnastics seal of approval. And it was in this environment that they were sexually exploited by those whom they trusted.  Several of the women had been abused repeatedly--over the course of months and years--by a USA Gymnastics team doctor named Larry Nassar is currently being prosecuted for a number of horrific crimes against children. One of those brave women was Jamie Dantzscher, a retired gymnast who won the bronze medal competing in the 2000 Olympics in Jamie told me how she trained as a young girl in When she was 13 years old, she was thrilled to be invited to train with the national USA Gymnastics team. It was with the national team that Nassar gained her trust. Nassar became her ``buddy,'' in the midst of an intense training environment. With USA Gymnastics backing him as a famous doctor and trainer, Jamie felt that there was absolutely no reason to believe Nassar was not trustworthy.  So when Jamie went to see Nassar for back pain, she was confused when Nassar began to touch her in inappropriate places. She was 13 and 14 years old. As she described the abuse to me in graphic detail, the other women around the room began to sob quietly. The tactics that Nassar used were too familiar to them.  And for the longest time, each of the victims believed that their horrific experiences were one-off events, that they were isolated in their own subjective memories. But the sharing of their stories--together in that room with me and the others--affirmed to them that what they had experienced was wrong.  One of the other gymnasts who bravely shared her story with me was Jeanette Antolin, who competed on the national team in the late nineties. Hailing from southern California, Jeanette shared how she was incredibly fearful of ever saying anything about the abuse committed against her because she believed she was being treated by a world-class doctor with USA Gymnastics' approval. As an aspiring Olympian, she feared that if she complained about anything, it would affect her career.  The same fears had overcome Jessica Howard, a rhythmic gymnast who was 15 years old when Nassar began abusing her. She was sent to Nassar for hip problems, and he told her that she should not wear any underwear for her treatment. At the time, she was confused and afraid to say anything to anyone. She believed she would be prevented from pursuing her dreams if she said anything.  I also met Doe Yamashiro from southern Doe was sexually abused by a 1984 Olympic Coach named Don In the mid-1980s, Coach Peters began fondling Doe and then had sex with her. Doe told me and the group of the pain and anguish she still suffers from many years later. The same pain and devastation was felt by all of the young victims who were in the room.  One of the common themes I heard from their stories was not just the predatory behavior of the perpetrators, but also how the USA Gymnastics institution failed to protect them. One of the women told me how she heard USA Gymnastics officials say at one point that it was their top priority to obtain ``medals and money'' and that a ``reputation of a coach'' should not be tarnished by an allegation raised by a victim.  This shocked me, and as I dug deeper into the USA Gymnastics institution, which is considered a ``national governing body'' under Federal law and oversees over 3,000 gymnasiums nationwide, I saw that their policies made it harder for victims, rather than easier, to report incidents of abuse. Their bylaws stated, for example, that the only way for a member athlete to ``effectively'' make a complaint about a coach was through a signed, written complaint.  Furthermore, USA Gymnastics' policy indicated that the organization ``may'' report sexual abuse to law enforcement authorities if a child's safety was at risk, but it was not mandatory. It further stated that it complied with State mandatory reporting laws, but if a State law didn't require anything more, there was no other obligation to do anything else.  It is my strong belief that these arcane policies left children vulnerable to the advances of sexual predators and failed to protect them even when incidents came to light. For example, in reviewing USA Gymnastics' history in public accounts, there were multiple instances where gymnastics coaches were convicted of heinous child sex crimes, years after USA Gymnastics had received complaints about those coaches. In other words, USA Gymnastics appears to have sat on reports of sexual abuse for years, while predators continued to prey on children.  At the end of my meeting with the survivors, I looked at each of them and told them that I would work on legislation to protect other kids and amateur athletes like them from sexual predators.  The legislation we have introduced does three main things to help child sex abuse survivors. It is a strong bipartisan bill, and I want to extend my deepest thanks to those Members who have worked with me on it, including Senators Collins, Grassley, Donnelly, Nelson, Blumenthal, Flake, McCaskill, Ernst, Klobuchar, Shaheen, Warren, Harris, Cortez-Masto, Rubio, and  The first thing the bill does is to mandate that any person affiliated with USA Gymnastics or other national governing bodies immediately report child abuse, including sexual abuse, to local or Federal law enforcement. This requirement would apply not only to USA Gymnastics, but to each of the other 47 national governing bodies that oversee various Olympic sports, including USA Taekwondo, USA Speed Skating, USA Swimming, and USA It is absolutely imperative that a bright line be drawn for all those working with national governing bodies that, once there are facts giving rise to suspect child or sex abuse, a report must be made as soon as possible to proper authorities. This bill mandates that.[[Page S1635]]  Second, this bill strengthens Masha's law, which was named after a 5-year-old Russian orphan who was adopted by an American man only to be raped and sexually abused by him for 6 years until he was finally caught by the FBI in 2003. Her adoptive father had not only abused her, but he had also produced over 200 sexually explicit images of that abuse. Masha's law allows civil suits by minors against sex abuse perpetrators who violate a variety of crimes against children, including sex trafficking, sexual exploitation, and child pornography crimes.  This law is significant for victims to obtain justice because there are times when criminal cases against perpetrators are declined due to difficulties in proving a criminal case. Therefore, for many traumatized victims, the only avenue for them to ever seek justice against their perpetrators is through Masha's law or other civil remedies.  The bill, therefore, updates Masha's law to help victims. It clarifies, for example, that victims of child sex crimes are entitled to statutory damages of $150,000 and possible punitive damages, due to the particularly severe nature of the crimes.  The bill also extends the statute of limitations for Masha's law. The statute of limitations extension is part of legislation that Senator Cornyn and I have worked on over the past couple of years, called the Extending Justice for Sex Crime Victims  Finally, the bill makes reforms to the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, which establishes ``national governing bodies'' like USA The Stevens Act specifically lists the authorities and duties of national governing bodies.  When I first wrote to USA Gymnastics about its poor handling of sexual abuse allegations, they replied that the Stevens Act limits their abilities to fully protect athletes from sexual abuse, so this bill fixes that. It requires national governing bodies like USA Gymnastics to develop for each of its members: specific policies and procedures for the mandatory reporting of sex abuse to law enforcement, policies and procedures to keep track of coaches who leave one gym due to complaints and then go to another gym and repeat cycles of abuse, policies to ensure that minors and amateur athletes are not in one-on-one situations with adults, policies to facilitate reporting of sex abuse allegations to national governing bodies and other authorities, and stronger oversight and enforcement policies so that the national governing bodies take a greater role in making sure that the policies are actually being implemented and enforced throughout the country.  These provisions give national governing bodies like USA Gymnastics absolutely no excuse to make sure that all members are subjected to the strongest training and procedures to prevent sexual abuse.  It further forces organizations like USA Gymnastics to impact the culture of their sports, through various oversight mechanisms, to make sure that all members of such organizations adhere to the strictest standards when it comes to sexual abuse prevention.  Finally, I would like to close with this. All over the country, victims of sexual abuse are coming forward to disclose how they were abused and exploited at the height of their innocence when they were children. Multiple victims from California and throughout the country have, for example, contacted my office and described with great courage their pain and anguish. Rather than list statistics, I want you to know that each of these individual stories represents an untold amount of pain and suffering that reverberates throughout generations, leaving devastation in its path. I urge my colleagues in this body to work with me and the sponsors of this bill to pass this important legislation to protect victims.  I would also like to acknowledge the support for this bill from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, National Children's Alliance, Rights4Girls, University of Utah Law Professor Paul Cassell, Child Sex Crime Victims' Lawyer James Marsh, Crime Victims Expert Steve Twist, National Crime Victims Center, Child USA, National Association of VOCA Administrators, National Organization for Victim Assistance, ToPrevail, ChampionWomen, National Children's Advocacy Center, National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, the National Association to Protect Children, and the Rape Abuse & Incest National  They are on the front lines of this work, and I greatly appreciate their support.

Unfortunately, Joseph and Sharon were also subjected to threats and abuse. Joseph was jailed repeatedly because of his involvement with the church. Sharon's family members were violently targeted, including her cousin who was murdered and her brother whose business was firebombed. When Sharon became pregnant with her first child, she was threatened by a member of a different religious organization for raising her child in a non-Muslim faith.  Joseph and Sharon came to the United States legally on visitor visas in November 1998. Due to their fears of persecution in Egypt based on their religious beliefs, they filed for asylum in the United States in May 1999.  However, Joseph, who has a speech impediment, had difficulty communicating why he was afraid to return to Egypt, and 1 year later their asylum application was denied. Considering that Sharon's brother, who also applied for asylum for similar reasons, was granted asylum in the United States, Joseph and Sharon appealed the denial of their asylum applications, to no avail.  While Sharon's brother, who is now a U.citizen, has filed a family-based immigrant petition on Sharon's behalf, it will be at least 4 years until she will even be eligible for a visa number due to visa backlogs.  If Sharon and Joseph are deported before then, they will not only be separated from their family but will be forced to return to a country where persecution of Coptic Christians continues.  Due to their fear of returning to Egypt, Joseph and Sharon have therefore tried to build a life for themselves here in the United States, working hard while building their beautiful family. With the protection of past private bills I filed on their behalf, Joseph was able to get his certified public accountant license and opened his own accounting firm, where Sharon works by his side.  Joseph and Sharon make sure that their four U.citizen children--Jessica, age 18, Rebecca, age 17, Rafael, age 16, and Veronica, age 11--all attend school in California and maintain good grades.  Joseph and Sharon carry strong support from friends, members of their local church, and other Californians who attest to their good character and community contributions.  I am concerned that the entire family would face serious and unwarranted hardships if Joseph and Sharon were forced to return to For Jessica, Rebecca, Rafael, and Veronica, the only home they know is in the United Separation of this family would be devastating and the alternative--relocating the family to Egypt--could be dire, as it is quite possible that these four American children would face discrimination or worse on account of their religion, as was the experience of many of their family members.

In 2001, Jose's sister, who has legal status, petitioned for Jose to get a green card. However, the current green card backlog for siblings from Mexico is very long, and it will be many years before Jose will be eligible to legalize his status though his sister.  In 2002, the Martinez family applied for political asylum. Their application was denied. An immigration judge denied their subsequent application for cancellation of removal.  Finally, Daniel Scherotter, the executive chef and owner of Palio D'Asti, petitioned for an employment-based green card for Jose based upon his unique skills as a chef. Jose's petition was approved by U.Citizenship and Immigration However, before he will be eligible for a green card, he must apply for a hardship waiver, which cannot be guaranteed.  The Martinez family has become an integral part of their community in They are active in their faith community. They volunteer with community-based organizations and are, in turn, supported by their community.

1036,topic-id,783,"Mr.President, today I offer private immigration relief legislation to provide lawful permanent resident status to Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola Carlos, and Cindy Jael The Arreolas are Mexican nationals living in the Fresno area of  Esidronio and Maria Elena have lived in the United States for over 20 years. Two of their five children--Nayely, age 30, and Cindy, age 28--also stand to benefit from this legislation. The other three Arreola children--Robert, age 25, Daniel, age 22, and Saray, age 20--are U.citizens. The story of the Arreola family is compelling, and I believe they merit Congress's special consideration for such an extraordinary form of relief as a private bill.  The Arreolas are facing deportation in part because of grievous errors committed by their previous counsel, who has since been disbarred. In fact, the attorney's conduct was so egregious that it compelled an immigration judge to write to the Executive Office of Immigration Review seeking the attorney's disbarment for his actions in his clients' immigration cases.  Esidronio came to the United States in 1986 and was an agricultural migrant worker in the fields of California for several years. As a migrant worker at that time, he would have been eligible for permanent residence through the Seasonal Agricultural Workers, SWA, Program, had he known about it.  Maria Elena was living in the United States at the time she became pregnant with her daughter She returned to Mexico to give birth because she wanted to avoid any immigration issues.  Because of the length of time that the Arreolas were in the United States, it is likely that they would have qualified for suspension of deportation, which would have allowed them to remain in the United States legally. However, the poor legal representation they received foreclosed this opportunity.  One of the most compelling reasons for my introduction of this private bill is the devastating impact the deportation of Esidronio and Maria Elena would have on their children--three of whom are American citizens--and the other two who have lived in the United States since they were toddlers. America is the only country the Arreola children have ever known.  Nayely, the oldest, was the first in her family to graduate from high school and the first to graduate college. She recently received her Masters in Business Administration from Fresno Pacific University, a regionally ranked university, and now works in the admissions office. Nayely is married and has a young son named Elijah Ace  At a young age, Nayely demonstrated a strong commitment to the ideals of citizenship in her adopted country. She worked hard to achieve her full potential both through her academic endeavors and community service. As the Associate Dean of Enrollment Services at Fresno Pacific University states in a letter of support, ``[T]he leaders of Fresno Pacific University saw in Nayely, a young person who will become exemplary of all that is good in the American dream.''  In high school, Nayely was a member of the Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) college preparatory program in which students commit to determining their own futures through attaining a college degree. Nayely was also President of the Key Club, a community service organization. Perhaps the greatest hardship to Nayely's U.citizen husband and child, if she were forced to return to Mexico, would be her lost opportunity to realize her dreams and contribute further to her community and to this country.  Nayely's sister, Cindy, is also married and has a 7-year-old daughter and a 5-year-old son. Neither Nayely nor Cindy is eligible to automatically adjust their status based on their marriages because of their initial unlawful entry.  The Arreolas also have other family who are U.citizens or lawful permanent residents of this country. Maria Elena has three brothers who are American citizens, and Esidronio has a sister who is an American citizen. They have no immediate family in  According to immigration authorities, this family has never had any problems with law enforcement. I am told that they have filed their taxes every year from 1990 to the present. They have always worked hard to support themselves.[[Page S1645]]  As I mentioned, Esidronio was previously employed as a farm worker but now has his own business in California repairing electronics. His business has been successful enough to enable him to purchase a home for his family. He and his wife are active in their church community and in their children's education.  It is clear to me that this family has embraced the American dream.

His children would either face separation from their father or be forced to leave the only country they know and give up the education they are pursuing in the United  Alfredo and his wife Maria have been in the United States for over 20 years. They worked for years to adjust their status through appropriate legal channels, but poor legal representation ruined their opportunities.  The Plascencias' lawyer refused to return their calls or otherwise communicate with them in any way. He also failed to forward crucial immigration documents. Because of the poor representation they received, Alfredo only became aware that they had been ordered to leave the United States 15 days prior to his scheduled deportation.  Alfredo was shocked to learn of his attorney's malfeasance, but he acted quickly to secure legitimate counsel and filed the appropriate paperwork to delay his deportation and determine if any other legal action could be taken.  Together, Alfredo and Maria have used their professional successes, with the assistance of private bills, to realize many of the goals dreamed of by all They have worked hard and saved up to buy their home.  They have good health care benefits, and they each have begun saving for retirement.

Jorge and Oliva originally came to the United States in 1990 when their son Jorge Rojas, Jr., was just 2 years old. In 1995, they left the country to attend a funeral and then reentered the United States on visitors' visas.  The family has grown to include three U.citizen children: Alexis, now 24 years old, Tanya, 22 years old, and Matias, now 7 years old. Jorge and Oliva are also the grandparents of Meena  The Rojas family first attempted to legalize their status in the United States when an unscrupulous immigration consultant, who was not an attorney, advised them to apply for asylum. Unfortunately, without proper legal guidance, the family did not realize at the time that they lacked a valid basis for asylum. Their asylum claim was denied in 2008, leaving the Rojas family with no further options to legalize their status.  Since their arrival in the United States more than 20 years ago, the Rojas family has demonstrated a robust work ethic and a strong commitment to their community in They have paid their taxes and worked hard to contribute to this country.  Jorge is a hard-working individual who has been employed by BrightView Landscaping Services, formerly known as Valley Crest Landscape Maintenance, in San Jose, CA, for the past 20 years. Currently, he works on commercial landscaping projects. Jorge is well-respected by his supervisor and his peers.  In addition to supporting his family, Jorge has volunteered his time to provide modern green landscaping and building projects at his children's school in He is active in his neighborhood association, through which he worked with his neighbors to open a library and community center in their community.  Oliva, in addition to raising her three children, has also been very active in the local community. She volunteers with the People Acting in Community Together, PACT, organization, where she works to prevent crime, gangs, and drug dealing in San Jose neighborhoods and schools.  Jorge Rojas, Jr., who entered the United States as an infant with his parents, is now the father of 6-year-old He is 28 years old and working at a job that allows him to support his daughter.

I continue to believe this family deserves Congress's special consideration for such an extraordinary form of relief as a private bill.  The Mkoian family is originally from They decided to leave Armenia for the United States in the early 1990s, following several incidents in which the family experienced harassment, vandalism and threats to their well-being.  In Armenia, Ruben worked as a police sergeant on vehicle licensing. At one point, he was offered a bribe to register stolen vehicles, which he refused and reported to his superior, the police chief. He later learned that a coworker had registered the vehicles at the request of the same chief.  After Ruben reported the bribe offer to illegally register vehicles and said he would call the police, his family store was vandalized and he received threatening phone calls telling him to keep quiet. A bottle of gasoline was thrown into his family's residence, burning it to the ground. In April 1992, several men entered the family store and assaulted Ruben, hospitalizing him for 22 days.  Ruben, Asmik, and their son Arthur, who was 3 years old at the time, left Armenia and entered the United States on visitor visas. They applied for political asylum that same year on the grounds that they would be subject to physical attacks if returned to It took 16 years for their case to be finalized, with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denying their asylum case in January 2008.

299,topic-id,1559,"Mr.President, I rise to recognize a pivotal moment in our Nation's history. On this day, 150 years ago, the Territory of Nebraska became the 37th State to enter the  Let me tell you the story of In a deep and powerful way, it is the story of America grew up in We were the first State admitted after the Civil War, but our admission was first vetoed by President Andrew It was the only time in American history that this had happened. The reason? President Johnson disagreed with a fundamental condition of Nebraska's statehood--that Black men be allowed to vote.  Fortunately, Congress overrode this veto, and on March 1, 1867, Nebraska became a I said before that Nebraska's statehood was a pivotal moment for our country. Nebraska gave America a chance to be better.  By bringing Nebraska into the Union, our country turned away from slavery forever. We turned toward the truth about humankind--that everyone is precious in Heaven's eyes. By making Nebraska a State, America reached for a future more closely aligned with that truth.  Since that new birth of freedom, our Nation has taken many more steps--some bold strides, some stumbles--but always we seek to be more fully the country we were made to be. At a crucial moment, Nebraska strengthened our commitment to do that. Nebraska renewed America's identity.  As a State, Nebraska had not only hard but also humble beginnings. They called it the Great American In the early 1800s, the famous military officer and explorer Zebulon Pike shrugged us off, saying simply: ``Not a stick of timber.'' A few years later, geologist Edwin James and MAJ Steven Long gave us this review: ``The land was uninhabitable by a people depending on agriculture.''  Today, wagon ruts can still be seen on Windlass Hill on the Oregon-California Trail, where settlers passed through. They were looking for greener pastures.  Well, last year Nebraska ranked 1 in the Nation in beef exports. The State ranked 1 in both the number of mother cows and cattle on feed. We are the beef We are Corn With both corn and cattle, we produce high quality protein products that are sought by consumers all around this globe. We are 1 in the Nation in great northern bean production, popcorn production, and irrigated acres of cropland. Nebraska agriculture is diverse and it is expansive.  We also have more miles of river than any other As we sit over the great High Plains in the Ogallala Aquifer, water flows to seven other States from Our abundant supply of groundwater makes us leaders in producing soybeans, wheat, pork, and grain sorghum.  But I am getting ahead of myself.  In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Homestead It made Americans really a simple offer: Strike out west, cultivate 160 acres of surveyed government land for 5 years, and at the end of that time, the land would be theirs. Families crossed the plains in covered wagons to take Mr.Lincoln up on that offer, and this time they stayed. In fact, the law's very first claimant was a doctor and a Civil War veteran named, fittingly enough, Daniel So powerful was his dream that Freeman filed his paperwork just a few minutes after midnight on New Year's Day, 1863, the day that law went into effect. His homestead lies just outside of Beatrice, NE, where today we find the Homestead National Monument of In this vast and ruthless land, the homesteaders made the American dream real. They tilled the earth, first to feed themselves and then to feed the world.  Nebraskans made the Great American Desert into one of the greatest agricultural exporting regions in world history. They did this in part by scientific discovery. Developments in agricultural technology, including the center pivot, pioneered in Nebraska, have allowed Nebraska ag producers to feed the world. Nebraska continues to lead the Nation in center pivot irrigation technology, and today we are home to the four largest irrigation companies in the United  Other technological breakthroughs came in transportation, especially rail. These developments helped us to connect our communities and our country. The route of the First Transcontinental Railroad runs through my Today, Bailey Yard in North Platte is the world's largest railroad classification yard. In addition, Nebraska now connects her families by 97,000 miles of public roads. Well, that is a far cry from those wagon ruts. These improvements allow us to continue that noble work which we gladly accept of feeding the world.  I would like to take a moment to reflect on something. Nebraska not only helped America find its moral compass again, but our State also shows what wonders a free and virtuous people may work, and it reveals the relationship between the two. When you seek the right thing first and you work at it hard, amazing things follow. This is true not only in our rural areas but also in our cities.  Omaha began as the ``Gateway to the West.'' Pioneers and immigrants made it a mighty city in its own right. From the former stockyards to the strong family businesses and Fortune 500 companies that you will find there today, the fingerprints of hardworking, dedicated people cover every inch of concrete.  Omaha leads in banking, insurance, telecommunications, transportation, and in medicine. Last year, the University of Nebraska Medical Center was ranked fifth in America among the best medical schools for primary care. I think Daniel Freeman, America's first homesteader, would be proud of that, but I doubt if he would be surprised. This is what happens when we work hard and let ourselves be guided by goodness.  It happened in Lincoln, our State capital, which was renamed after President Lincoln was assassinated. It happens in our Nebraska Panhandle towns and in our cities along the broad and braided Platte River, all along our I-80 corridor, and in so many rural small towns across our Nebraskans are a people who are engaged in manufacturing, technology, ag business, education, and the arts. We are strong people, and we build strong communities.  I have to say another word about doing the right thing. In 1879, Nebraska was the site of the first time that American Indians had their day in court, when Standing Bear made his famous statement: ``I am a Man.'' The U.district court eventually ruled what we all know to be absolute truth--that a person is a person. Here again, Nebraska gave America the opportunity to be better. There are many other moments.  Nebraska was the first State in which women were the two major party candidates for Governor, when Kay Orr, a Republican, defeated Helen Boosalis, a Democrat, in 1986.  I am on the Senate floor honoring the State I love on its 150th anniversary. I encourage you to come and see what the good life is about. See our cities--their industry, their creativity, their culture--where our innovators work new wonders, so much so that we are now called Silicon Feel the thrill of Memorial Stadium, which becomes our third largest city on a game day. Shout ``Go Big Red'' and cheer on the Delight in our opera and ballet. Breathe in our small towns. Stop in at a family-run bakery. Have lunch at a local cafe. Enjoy some of the national food sensations that began in Nebraska: Kool-Aid, our Reuben sandwich, and, of course, runzas.  Enjoy local favorites, like kolache, kuchen, fried tacos, and pork chili. Enjoy a Nebraska rodeo. Ride out to our rural areas, where, as Poet Laureate Ted Kooser says, the ``pickup kicks its fenders off and settles back to read the clouds.'' Be awed by the vastness of Nebraska, which gives us perspective on things great and small. Learn from Chimney Rock, our western buttes, and the Pine Ridge, how to stand tall no matter the weather or the season of life. Be soothed by the Sandhills--the largest grass-covered sand dunes in the world and God's own cattle country. Find peace in the song of the Sandhills cranes. Take in the Central Flyway, where millions of migratory birds fly, including our State bird--the western meadowlark. See our gently rolling eastern hills. Canoe our[[Page S1522]]rivers, fish our trout streams, and relax on our lakes. Follow the trails that tell the story of our history and the roads that lead to a bright future. See Nebraska at night, under a sky filled with stars. Know why people travel from all across the world simply to stargaze.  Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Willa Cather, who grew up in Nebraska, wrote of the West: ``Elsewhere, the sky is the roof of the world; but here the Earth was the floor of the sky.''  We are a people of the Great Plains, the prairie, the We remember our enduring sources of strength--faith in God, reliance on family, and a habit of hard work. These things give us a sure footing.  For America for 150 years, Nebraska has been a place to look up and begin again, a land of vast possibility, of opportunity, a place to dream and to realize dreams--a model for America and the envy of the world.

229,topic-id,855,"Mr.Speaker, for 150 years now, Nebraska has held a special place in the history of We Nebraskans rightly pride ourselves on the values of hard work, on the values of community life, on the proper value of the good stewardship of our precious resources. The mystique of the Great Plains, the nobility of the family farm, and the vibrancy of our people create the conditions for the good life.  Our story is one of strength, it is one of dignity, and I am proud to celebrate our 150th anniversary.                              {time}  2030  Mr.Speaker, a number of years ago, a gift of land donation enabled the expansion of the Homestead National Monument, which is near Beatrice, Run by the National Park Service, their personnel were kind enough to invite me to the dedication ceremony; and during that event, a young woman who was from a seventh-generation farm family--in high school at that time, as I recall--got up to speak. She gave a beautiful talk about our Nebraska values, our connectedness to the land, the deeper meaning of living on the plains, and the ideal of maintaining the continuity of family life.  Her remarks, Mr.Speaker, moved me so much that I literally tossed my own speech aside and spoke off the cuff, and I said something like this: Perhaps it was on a day just like this where that settler family came over the hill there, and they looked at the great expansion of the plains before them.  Perhaps that day they felt the warm, spring sun on their cheeks, and they heard the chirp of the western meadowlark in the air, and they watched as the beautiful bluestem prairie grass swayed in the wind. Perhaps it was then that they made their decision: We stay right here. Nebraska will be our home.  Mr.Speaker, when I finished that, I was very proud of myself, so I sat down. And then the next speaker came up, another political figure, and he had this to say: Well, my family came here because they were horse thieves. We all shared a little laugh, but really, Mr.Speaker, Nebraska's colorful history and droll wit were simultaneously captured in that moment.  Nebraska's official motto is ``Equality before the law,'' but our unofficial motto is ``Nebraska nice.'' It is true. Nebraskans are generally nice. But beneath that friendly veneer is an unmistakable, unvarnished realism.  Nebraskans have a unique ability to look at a situation and size it up accurately, if often humorously. ``Git r done'' is an often-used phrase that I think can be safely attributable to us.  Now, sometimes, Mr.Speaker, Nebraska has been pejoratively described in the popular imagination of our country, first as the ``Great American Desert'' because it was thought that nothing would grow there. Today, we have the largest amount of acreage under irrigation in the country, including the fact that we are the largest grower of popcorn in We are a leader in livestock production and multiple types of commodity production, as well as specialty crops.  We were sometimes castigated as ``flyover country.'' I hear that around here sometimes, that is, until you come to Nebraska and realize that it is a wonderful place to live and to work and to raise a family relatively free from crime, except even horse thieves, congestion, as well as pollution.  Nebraska has, routinely, the highest graduation rate in the country and the lowest unemployment rate in the country.  And, though, in true Nebraska fashion, self-effacing Cornhuskers would cringe at the term, we have had our fair share of celebrities as well, including Father Ed Flanagan, who founded Boys Town, now known as Boys Town and Girls Town; Civil Rights pioneers, Chief Standing Bear being one of the most prominent; Malcolm X; authors Mari Sandoz and Willa Cather; professional athletes Bob Gibson and Gale Sayers; and entertainers, Henry Fonda, Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, Johnny Carson, and Dick  Moreover, Mr.Speaker, our singular, unicameral legislature is a model for bipartisanship and frugality. And I would be remiss if I didn't say our run-it-up-the-gut offense with a few option twists, it may not have been flashy, but it helped the University of Nebraska's football team win five national championships.  I am proud to serve in the United States congressional seat once held by Williams Jennings Bryan, who along with Senator George Norris perhaps are the most famous, though controversial in some ways, politicians in our State's history.  As we celebrate the 150th anniversary of Nebraska's admission to the United States of America--by the way, the first State admitted after the Civil War--I recall Representative Bryan's words from over 100 years ago. It is a quote that actually is outside of our football stadium, known as Memorial Stadium, on Tom and Nancy Osborne It says this: ``Destiny is no matter of chance. It is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved.''  And perhaps, Mr.Speaker, we can add to that quote today: And that the choice to be good makes the destiny arrive well.  Happy birthday,  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1461.txt,1793,"DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THE GENERAL",2017.0,1.0,March
128,topic-id,550,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Alabama for his able testimony in regard to this resolution.  I rise today in support of this resolution because it will reverse an unlawful power grab and restore responsible worker health and safety policies.  Article I of the Constitution is clear. It is the Members of this body--the legislative branch--who write the law. Why? Because we are closest to the people and, therefore, more responsive to the needs and demands of those we serve.  It is the responsibility of the executive branch to enforce the laws--not write them. Unfortunately, the previous administration failed to abide by this founding principle. President Obama boasted about his days teaching constitutional law, yet his administration tried time and time again to rewrite the law unilaterally through executive fiat.  The Volks rule is just one example of this unprecedented overreach. Under Occupational Safety and Health Act regulations, employers are required to record injuries and illnesses and retain those records for 5 years. This information has long been used by safety inspectors and employers to identify gaps in safety and enhance protections for workers.  To ensure hazards are addressed in a timely manner, the law explicitly provides a 6-month window under which an employer can be cited for failing to keep proper records--6 months. But never one to let the law stand in the way of its partisan agenda, the Obama administration decided to unfairly target a Louisiana construction company for recordkeeping errors from nearly 5 years earlier.  That's right, 5 years. Not even remotely close to what the law passed by Congress permits. The consequences of this unlawful power grab were predictable. Employers large and small faced significant regulatory confusion and legal uncertainty. Fortunately, a Federal appeals court unanimously struck down this power grab as my colleague from Alabama has cited. Even President Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Merrick Garland, referred to OSHA's action as unreasonable.  How did the Obama administration respond to this judicial rebuke? It completely ignored the court's ruling. The agency doubled down on its abuse of power and tried to rewrite the law extending the threat of penalty from 6 months to 5 years.  Again, it is Congress that writes laws, not government agencies. That is precisely why we must support this resolution. By supporting H.83, we will provide more certainty for small businesses and uphold the rule of law. Just as importantly, we must demand a better approach to worker health and safety. To be clear, this rule does nothing--I repeat nothing--to improve the health and safety of America's workers.  Instead of shaming employers, OSHA should collaborate with employers and develop a proactive approach that will keep workers safe. That is exactly what Republicans have demanded for years, and we will continue to demand so in the years ahead no matter which party has the  As my colleague from Alabama has said, this is exactly the appropriate way to block this unlawful rule, not only because the agency has no authority to do what it did, but because it is why we have the  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to block an unlawful rule by voting in favor of H.83.

764,topic-id,573,"Mr.Speaker, for years Americans across the country have struggled under a government takeover of health care. Because of ObamaCare, insurance markets are collapsing, healthcare costs are soaring, and patients' choices are dwindling. Simply put, the flawed healthcare law is failing. It is hurting hardworking men and women across the country, and the American people deserve better.  That is why Republicans promised to deliver the healthcare solutions Americans desperately need. This week, we are making good on that promise and moving forward with an effort that will provide a better way on health care.  After a thoughtful and collaborative process, members of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee recently unveiled a legislative plan that will repeal and replace The plan, the American Health Care Act, includes a number of positive, commonsense reforms that will help create more choices, lower costs, and give control back to individuals and families.  These reforms will create a new and innovative fund giving States the flexibility they need to design programs that fit the needs of their communities. They will responsibly unwind ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion in a way that protects patients and strengthens the program for future generations.  The plan will also dismantle ObamaCare taxes and mandates--including the individual and employer mandate penalties and taxes on prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, health insurance premiums, and medical devices. It will expand health savings accounts to empower individuals and families to spend their healthcare dollars the way they want and need. It will provide tax credits to those who don't receive insurance through work or a government program, helping all Americans access high quality, affordable health care.  At the same time, we on the Education and the Workforce Committee are working to advance additional reforms that will help expand coverage, make health care more affordable, and promote a healthy workforce.  One legislative proposal will empower small businesses to band together to negotiate lower healthcare costs on behalf of their employees. Another will protect the ability of employers to self-insure, providing greater access to affordable, flexible healthcare plans for their workers. The third will give employers the legal certainty they need to offer employee wellness plans, helping to promote a healthy workforce and, again, lower healthcare costs.  These three legislative proposals reflect a few shared principles. Families should have the freedom to choose the healthcare plan that meets their needs. Americans need more affordable healthcare options, not fewer. Healthcare decisions should rest with patients and their doctors--not government bureaucrats. Instead of prescriptive mandates, we should ensure employers have the tools they need to help their employees afford health care.  These proposals--along with those in the American Health Care Act--are exactly the kind of free-market, patient-centered reforms Republicans promised, and they reflect the priorities of President Trump and his administration. They are the products of a careful process that took into account the ideas and concerns of men and women from all walks of life, and they will now be considered through an open, transparent process that provides policymakers on both sides of the aisle an opportunity to share their views and offer their ideas.  I encourage everyone--my colleagues in Congress, as well as all Americans--to join in this process. Visit readthebill.gop. See for yourself the plan we have laid out, and help us move forward with these positive solutions. Together we can help ensure all Americans have access to the high quality, affordable healthcare coverage they deserve.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgH1540.txt,1791,CALLING FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL COUNSEL,2017.0,7.0,March

723,topic-id,1376,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss the effort by my Republican colleagues, including the President, to dismantle the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive order and roll back protections for workers.  For too long, many workers in this country have been subject to dangerous working conditions, wage theft, discrimination, and harassment. While most companies follow the law and play by the rules, a few have cut corners at the expense of workers' rights and safety and have factored in paying penalties as just another cost of doing business. That is not fair for workers, and it is not fair for the businesses that play by the rules. It is time we put a stop to it.  We certainly should not be spending taxpayers' dollars to pay Federal contractors who violate--and sometimes repeatedly violate--Federal labor laws. Repeated violations by Federal contractors is a serious problem.  According to a 2013 HELP Committee staff report, 49 government contractors accounted for 1,776 Federal labor law violations. We are talking about things like an unsafe workplace, discriminating against workers, or failing to pay workers what they earned. Understand when I talk about unsafe workplaces, I am talking about fatalities. But despite these widespread violations, these companies continue to receive taxpayer-funded Federal contracts worth $81 billion a year.  My colleagues may have seen a recent Politico Magazine report on VT VT Halter is a major Navy shipbuilder, but its safety track record is deeply concerning. In 2009, two workers were killed and five others injured--some severely--when an explosion occurred at a VT Halter shipyard. A month later, they received an $87 million Federal contract. About 6 months after the explosion, VT Halter settled charges relating to the explosion, admitting that they had willfully violated at least 12 Occupational Safety and Health Administration--or OSHA--workplace safety rules to prevent incidents like this from occurring--an incident in which two workers died. They willfully violated--willfully; that is willfully violated.  That explosion wasn't VT Halter's only incident. In 2009, a worker fell to his death at another VT Halter shipyard where there were no handrails or fall protections. In 2012, the company was fined by OSHA after a worker at a VT Halter shipyard was killed when the lid on a pressurized pot exploded. They were fined again in 2014 for violating crane safety rules after two cranes tipped over, injuring five workers, including one 63-year-old worker who now has the mental capacity of a child.  It doesn't make sense to keep rewarding companies like this with lucrative contracts when they repeatedly--and, again, willfully--disregard basic safety protections.  To address this problem, in 2014 President Obama issued an Executive order that essentially says that if you have repeatedly broken our labor laws, the Federal Government will need to examine a company's compliance record on labor law violations before awarding large taxpayer-funded government contracts. Companies with poor track records will need to prove they are taking action to make sure that these types of egregious labor law violations don't happen again.  In addition to cracking down on repeat violators who bid for Federal contracts, the President's Executive order also includes two other important provisions that I support: a requirement that companies give workers a pay stub each pay period and a provision to make sure workers are able to access justice if they have been wronged.  As the Presiding Officer may know, employers are required, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, to accurately report the number of hours an employee works and their pay. But, surprisingly, employers are not always required to give this information to an employee on a pay stub each pay period. This matters. This matters because when a bad actor cheats its employees by undercounting hours or underpaying wages, it is a lot harder for an employee to recover damages if they don't get a pay stub.  It is often low-income workers who work variable shifts who are most easily exploited in these cases. For example, last year, a group of janitors in the[[Page S1599]]Twin Cities won hundreds of thousands of dollars of back pay because their employer had miscounted their hours. And because most of them weren't given pay stubs, it took them much longer to discover that they had been underpaid. One of their key demands, in addition to being paid fairly, was that they start getting pay stubs to ensure they don't get cheated again. This seems to me like a sensible thing to ask.  Let's be clear. Most employers already give their employees pay stubs, so this requirement isn't a big change for them, but it makes a big difference for the workers who are most vulnerable to wage theft. And because this provision has already been implemented, repealing it will have real and obvious consequences for working families.  The fair pay and safe workplaces rule also took an important step toward protecting workers' fundamental rights by banning the use of forced arbitration in cases of discrimination or sexual assault and harassment. As we have seen in a multitude of contexts in recent years, corporate America is increasingly preventing its employees or customers from accessing the court, relying instead on forced arbitration to avoid accountability when people seek justice for being cheated or mistreated. And some of the most egregious cases we have heard are from workers whose rights have been viciously violated and whose cases were forced into the dark.  I have made it a priority during my time in the Senate to combat the widespread and harmful use of forced arbitration. In fact, the forced arbitration regulations within the fair pay and safe workplaces rule build on an effort that I successfully championed 8 years ago.  I first became interested in the issue after learning that major Department of Defense contractors charged with performing vital national security functions were using arbitration to sweep cases of sexual assault and harassment under the rug. I heard stories of women who were assaulted or subjected to hostile working conditions while employed by a DOD contractor. And when those women sought justice for the actions--or inactions--of their employers, they were forced into secret arbitration where none of the traditional safeguards of a public court of law apply. As a result, countless other victims were left in the dark about the women's cases, and the contractors were shielded from accountability, both from the courts and from the public eye.  So in 2009, I introduced an amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act that prevented certain DOD contractors from forcing their employees to arbitrate claims of discrimination or sexual assault and harassment. The amendment passed with bipartisan support. In the years since, it continues to be passed on a bipartisan basis as a part of the Defense appropriations process each year, most recently in December of 2014.  Now, it is unclear to me what has changed in the years since we passed my amendment that would make my Republican colleagues shift course. But what is clear is that now is not the time to roll back these critical protections for our workers.  According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, at least 25 percent of American women say they have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. And recent high profile revelations about abuse--for example, former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes' abuse of his employees, as well as the allegations of sex bias at Kay and Sterling Jewelers--demonstrate that we are far from addressing this issue on a broader scale. So I urge my Republican colleagues to reconsider their support for this resolution. I urge them to not force vulnerable women who have been wronged into the dark and into forced arbitration.  Blocking the fair pay and safe workplaces rule is just wrongheaded. A vote to repeal this rule is a vote to support giving taxpayer dollars to companies that break the law, it is a vote to help employers who cheat their employees out of fair pay, and it is a vote to take away workers' fundamental rights to access to the court.  I urge a ``no'' vote, and I thank the Presiding Officer for the generous window of 10 to 15 minutes.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

876,topic-id,1194,"Mr.Speaker, I rise this evening to cover several very, very important points.  Tomorrow is International Women's Day, and I was going to talk about the role of women in our society, talk about my five daughters and what they have been doing in their life of service, and my wife, but events intervened. And yesterday, our good friends on the Republican side introduced a piece of legislation that will dramatically affect women, young and old; children. They introduced a repeal of the Affordable Care  We are still trying to figure out all of the details involved in it. It is going to be a little hard, since it was changed late in the night. But there are some things we do know. I would like to start off with what we do know about the Affordable Care Act so that when we come to debate on the floor in the days ahead the Republican repeal and replacement of the existing Affordable Care Act, we have a foundation.  If you will indulge me, I will try to lay out some facts, not alternative facts, but facts. For example, 20 million Americans have gained coverage as a result of the Affordable Care The percentage of uninsured in America is the lowest it has ever been. Mr.Speaker, 6.1 million young adults between the age of 19 and 25 have gained insurance coverage by being able to stay on their parents' insurance program--6.1 million. Of the Americans who have preexisting conditions, and that is 27 percent of us who have some sort of preexisting condition--heart issues, diabetes, broken legs, bad backs, whatever--27 percent of those Americans are guaranteed coverage even though they have a preexisting condition.  I was insurance commissioner in California for 8 years, and I must tell you the battles--well, it would take several days to talk about the battles that I had with the insurance companies who were denying coverage because of preexisting conditions. No longer the case in The Affordable Care Act said no. And by the way, the lifetime limits, they are gone, also.  California, which I have had the pleasure of being a citizen of, 3.7 million Californians are now insured under the Medi-Cal program, and 1.4 million have gained coverage through the exchange, called Covered About 1.2 million of those have received subsidies, averaging over $300 a month. Over 5 million Californians will be directly affected by a direct repeal.  And in the expansion of Medicaid, or Medi-Cal as we call it in California, if that is eliminated, that is a $16 billion hit to the State of California, and, obviously, an enormous hit to those 3.7 million Californians who have been covered under the Medi-Cal expansion.  Secondary impacts: employment. Maybe 200,000 jobs would be lost in  Individual stories: boy, they abound. Just this evening, I got a call from my wife, and she said: You really ought to talk about that young family in Woodland, California, whose 2-year-old son was diagnosed with some sort of a medical illness. They were able to get coverage before that under the covered California program. They went back a year later, and the kid had a brain tumor.  Fortunately, it was resolved because they had insurance. They were able to get the early diagnosis. And under the current law, the Affordable Care Act, they will be able to keep their coverage, even though previous to the Affordable Care Act, this young child and, quite probably, the family would be uninsurable.  It is working. The Affordable Care Act is working. Are there ways to improve it? Undoubtably, there are, and we could sit down and talk about ways to improve it.  But yesterday, our Republican colleagues introduced legislation that is going to have a profound negative impact on men and women all across this We will spend time in the days ahead to talk about the details, but we do know that, in general terms, there will be less coverage at a higher cost for literally everybody, except for a few special folks. And I would like to just put up a chart about that. Let's start with this one.  You see, in the repeal bill that was introduced, there are very serious tax cuts. We are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts over the next 2 years. Well, we all want a tax cut. But under the repeal, there are some very special people who are going to get a really big tax cut. Take a look at this.  The top 20 percent of taxpayers will receive 74.2 percent of the multihundred-billion-dollar tax cut, which is estimated to be somewhere in the range of $700 billion to maybe as much as $1 trillion, depending upon the final calculations.  By the way, the Congressional Budget Office has not had time to score, that is to tell us what the cost, what the benefits are, of the Republican proposal. But we do know from earlier studies of this, 75 percent of the multihundred-billion-dollar tax cuts go to the wealthy. And where does the money come from? It comes from the poor, it comes from the working families, the men and women who are struggling here in Maybe they are making a good living--$50,000 to $60,000 a year. They are going to see their benefit package reduced.  One more way to look at this is the famous pie chart. So who gets the tax breaks? Not the top 20 percent. Let's just focus more clearly here on the top one-tenth of 1 percent. What do they get? They are not a percentage. This is not the top 1 percent. This is the top one-tenth of a percent. What do they get? Well, they get nearly $200,000 a year in tax reductions. That is not bad. So the top 1 percent gets 57 percent of that 6-, 7-, $800-billion tax cut, and everyone else will get 43 percent.  So what we have here is a massive shift of wealth from the working men and women of America, from American families, to the very top--you know, the 1 percenters. That is who is getting the benefit in this massive tax cut that has been proposed. I don't know if that is good policy. It is not in my district. I don't think it is good policy for  We spent a lot of this last year in the Presidential campaign talking about the shift of wealth to the superwealthy and away from the great majority of But, here we go. In the very first big legislation of this year, we see the Republicans in a massive effort to increase the wealth of the superwealthy at the expense of the rest of Americans.[[Page H1578]]  There are many, many more things to talk about here. But I want to just take a deep breath, which I need, because I guess I am getting rather excited about what is happening--or maybe angry is a better word--and turn to my colleague from the great State of Virginia to carry on while I take a deep breath and cool off a bit.

You bring to this discussion a very important perspective as the ranking member of the Education and the Workforce You have that perspective of understanding the effect of this legislation on the working men and women and families of the United  I was just looking at some of the early comments that have come out about the bill, which is less than--well, it is almost 24 hours old now. Families USA said: ``The GOP healthcare proposal would be laughable if its consequences weren't so devastating. This bill will strip coverage for millions of people and drive up consumer costs.''  The Catholic Health Association of the United States said: ``This proposal would also take many backward steps in the continual effort to improve our healthcare system. . . .''  It goes on and on, and as more and more people come to understand the issues that the gentleman was discussing, I think they are going to find that, no, we will take the Affordable Care Act as it presently exists, and we will make some modifications to it to improve it.  The gentleman raised a very interesting point. It reminds me of another conversation I had earlier this week with my wife. She had gone to her hairstylist, who is about 29 years old, has run her own business for the last 7, 8 years, and she told me wife: It can't be true. They can't do it, can they? They can't kill the Affordable Care Act, the ObamaCare?  She said: For the first time in my life, I was able to get insurance; and now that I have insurance, there is this maternity benefit that is in my package, and now my husband and I, we can afford to have a child.  It was directly to the point the gentleman was making. If there is an option here on maternity coverage or any coverage for women's health, then we are going to find a situation where people will pick and choose; they will wait to get their insurance, and then the insurance pool is left with very expensive cases and the cost is not spread out.  The gentleman may have some other examples that may have come along or some other comments that he would like to make. I would be delighted to have the gentleman share those on the floor, and I will yield to the gentleman.

878,topic-id,373,"The gentleman is correct on that. I was just looking at some statistics here a moment ago about the shifting of cost.  Under the Affordable Care Act, there are many, many benefits for Leaving aside the Medicaid population for a moment, the Medicare population, available to every individual 65 and older, there have been significant improvements.  You mentioned the doughnut hole earlier, the drug benefit. If you run up heavy expenditures on your drugs, you would come to a point where you had to pay 100 percent. Medicare didn't cover it. Well, that doughnut hole is collapsing, and in another 2 years, the Medicare program will cover all of the drug costs without limitation.  Also, there is the free annual checkup that is available to everybody that is on The result of these kinds of things, where drugs are available, blood pressure drugs, diabetes and the like, has led to--together with the additional taxes that the superwealthy are paying--has increased the solvency of Medicare by 11 years.  Now, the fiddling that is going on with the proposal that our Republicans have put through, it is not clear exactly what the result would be; but we do know that one of the major tax cuts is the elimination of this Medicare tax that the superwealthy have been paying, and that is over--together with one other tax is almost $340 billion. So the support for Medicare and the solvency of Medicare becomes a question mark as a result of the proposals.  We don't have all of the answers to this, but we do know that a 60-year-old presently getting an insurance policy from the Affordable Care Act, from ObamaCare, and making somewhere around $40,000 a year--perhaps working at Walmart--they are going to see a 57 percent reduction in the tax credit that is currently available versus what the Republican bill has.  So a 60-year-old making $40,000 a year under the ACA, ObamaCare, will receive somewhere around a $9,000 tax credit to support the purchase of insurance. Under the Republican bill, they are looking at $4,000--not $9,000, but $4,000--so 57 percent reduction in the support that they receive, probably leading to them not being able to afford insurance and winding up in your emergency room example.

880,topic-id,344,"The fundamental nature of insurance is you gather a large population of healthy, not-so-healthy, and perhaps some very sick people into a large population, and the cost is spread across the entire population.  What we may be ceding here in this particular proposal is the unravelling of that fundamental insurance concept with young people, healthy, not bothering to buy insurance, staying out of the market; and then, eventually, when they become ill, they will get back into the market, leaving everybody else to pay for it.  There is another piece of this shifting of cost that did occur prior to the Affordable Care Act--significantly reduced, as a result of it--and that is the uninsured still get sick.  The gentleman mentioned the emergency room a while ago, and for the most part, in America, a person can get to an emergency room with or without insurance; but if they don't have insurance, there is still a cost associated with the visit to the emergency room and any other thing they may need. They may need to have their leg repaired, a broken leg, or maybe they need an appendectomy or whatever. That is still a cost. The question is: Who picks up that cost? That is called uncompensated care, and it was a huge problem prior to the Affordable Care  I had hospitals throughout my district and throughout California coming to me and saying: We can't afford this because we are not able to cover that uncompensated care for people that didn't have insurance that showed up at the emergency room.  Now, we know that from the early analysis done of the proposed legislation by our Republican friends that the number of uninsured is likely to increase, perhaps as much as 11 million people--maybe more, maybe somewhat less. Those people will still get sick. They may have money of their own to cover their costs, but the chances are they don't. That uncompensated cost will then be borne by the people who do buy insurance. It is a cost shift to those who have insurance.  ",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgH1577-2.txt,1973,"DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THE GENERAL",2017.0,7.0,March
881,topic-id,373,"There are so many pieces to this healthcare system.  One thing that I want to put on the table here from my experience as insurance commissioner in California is that there are two fundamental parts[[Page H1580]]to the healthcare system in the United States, and really around the world. One of those two parts is how we collect the money and then pay for the services. We call that insurance. It is also Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' programs, and the like. These are the way in which we collect money and pay for the services.                              {time}  2015  The other part of the healthcare system is the delivery of services; these are the doctors, the clinics, the hospitals, and other providers, mental health providers, and the like. We often get confused by putting these two things together.  There has been a lot of talk about what we are doing with the Affordable Care It is essentially a mechanism to pay for services. It is an insurance mechanism. Using the private insurance system, these various exchanges are set up to pool the population of people who do not have insurance from their employer, the individual people, individual coverage. It pools them so that you have that large population so that the cost is spread out across that large pool and the insurance becomes affordable. That is an insurance mechanism. That is a pooling. It has nothing to do directly with the provision of medical services.  The medical services are then provided out of that pooling arrangement by the individual doctors, maybe clinics, maybe hospitals, maybe group practices. Some of that will be capitated pay, and others will be a fee-for-service.  We haven't changed directly the way in which services are provided, that is, the delivery of services. And this is found in hospitals. In the Affordable Care Act, there was a penalty for hospitals that had readmissions for infections. What we have seen, as a result of that provision dealing directly with the way in which services are delivered in hospitals, is a dramatic decline in readmissions for hospital-acquired infections. What that means is some 60,000 people are still alive today because they didn't get a hospital-acquired infection.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.Scott).

882,topic-id,505,"Mr.Speaker, that is exactly right, and I see that in my district. I have a large rural district in And, even today, there are areas where it is difficult to find a physician to get medical services.  This is one of the things, as you so correctly pointed out, the Affordable Care Act had a part of that. One of the titles dealt with the education of medical personnel. And so what we have seen, at least in California--and I suspect across America--with the Affordable Care Act in place, we are seeing that one of the fastest growing areas for new jobs is the healthcare sector because we are adding a lot of people--we need more--and then the educational programs that you talked about, which comes under the jurisdiction, I believe, of your committee. That is an important part.  One of the things that I hope the American public comes to understand is this is not just a sound bite that was used in a political campaign. We are going to repeal the ObamaCare and we are going to replace it is a nice sound bite. But we are talking about the lives of Americans, we are talking about their health, their ability to stay healthy, their ability to get medical services.  When you start tinkering with something that is so personal--that is what people say in my district: This is about my ability to stay healthy, my ability to get medical care. That is what I hear.  They are saying they are frightened. They are concerned that the legislation and all of the discussion in the political campaigns has been so heated that they are afraid they are going to lose what they presently have.  A quick look at what has been presented to Congress just in the last 24 hours indicates that a couple of facts are clear. First of all, there is an enormous tax break for the very, very wealthy, probably to the tune of 3- to $400 billion over 10 years. That is an incredible tax break for the superwealthy and for the health insurance industry. That, we are pretty sure, is in this legislation. We don't know the exact numbers; but we do know that early indications are that there is a shift, tax breaks for the wealthy, and cost increases for everybody else. That we know.  We also know that there are certain elements of support for individuals that will be removed. As we go about debating this and understanding the full import and get the Congressional Budget Office information, I think we are going to find that Americans are going to say: Well, wait. Wait, wait, wait. You are doing what to me? What are you doing to me? You are taking away my health insurance?  I suspect that will lead to a rebellion of some sort.

We don't know for sure if it is tomorrow or the next day, but we do know that if it is this week, we will not have the Congressional Budget Office information.  The gentleman mentioned something that I probably should have jumped on immediately because of my rural district, and those are the clinics. As a result of the Affordable Care Act, there are now seven significant clinic organizations that provide services to about 23 specific sites around my district. They are providing, really for the first time in many of the communities that I represent, immediately available healthcare services to a variety of people, some of whom have had an employer-sponsored health plan and others of whom are on Medi-Cal in California.[[Page H1581]]  The apparent reduction in the Medicaid, Medi-Cal for California, support from the Federal Government that will occur over the next 2\1/2\ to 3 years will eliminate one of the principal ways in which those clinics have been able to continue to operate and, that is, the expansion of the Medicaid population in  It appears that the legislation that is proposed will shrink the Medicaid program across the Nation and severely curtail in California the support available for people who are currently on Medi-That will be devastating to these clinics in these rural areas.

884,topic-id,283,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.Scott) for joining us this evening. This is a fundamental part of American life, that is, our health care. It is about 18 percent of the total GDP, gross domestic product. It is extremely important in terms of the total well-being of our society and our economy.  Changes to the Affordable Care Act that are being proposed will have a dramatic effect. And what we do know about it is that there will be a massive shift of wealth from working men, women, and families to the superwealthy.

968,topic-id,1404,"Mr.President, I know the Presiding Officer is a fellow westerner, from a State that is impacted by decisions made by our public lands management agencies, whether that is the Bureau of Land Management or the Forest Both Colorado and Arizona, as well as Wyoming and Utah--all of our Western States--are greatly affected by decisions that are made in Washington, In a conversation I had with the Presiding Officer from Arizona, we discussed the fact that 85 percent of the State of Arizona is managed by the Federal Whether it is the State or a Tribal entity or the Federal Government, about 47 percent is being federally managed. In the State of Colorado, about half of our State is managed by a public entity. Whether that is the State or a Tribal entity or the Forest Service, BLM land, the Department of the Interior, roughly half of the State is managed by the Federal Government, the State government or others. In other words, it is not in private landownership. So that means that the decisions made by these public land management agencies have a significantly outsized impact on our States than it does on States say east of the  So today I come to the floor to talk about one of those decisions made by the Bureau of Land Management's planning 2.0 rule. The discussion we are having today is about whether we should approve a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to stop the BLM 2.0 rule from going forward.  The Bureau of Land Management has over 245 million acres of public land. Almost all of those acres are west of the Mississippi River, predominantly in 12 The final BLM 2.0 rule is an example of how little Washington bureaucrats understand about the West and how little they understand about how the Federal Government and how Federal policymaking doesn't work when you try to take something they think of in Washington and put it on the people of the  It is the promulgation of this rule that actually led to my call for relocating the headquarters of the Bureau of Land Management out of Washington, DC, and to put it in a place like Grand Junction, CO, because I believe it is important that we have public land managers and decisions about our public lands being made by those who are directly affected by that public land being in their backyard. If you live in the State of Colorado or if you are a county commissioner on the Western Slope, some of those counties have over 90 percent of their county managed by the Federal A decision made by that public land agency directly impacts them, not in a couple of weeks or months or next year but that very same day. To have somebody from Washington, DC, deciding a one-size-fits-all approach that is going to apply to a Western Slope county commissioner is just absurd. So moving the BLM headquarters to a place like Colorado or Arizona would absolutely result in better policies that work on the ground for our Governors, landowners, county commissioners, farmers, ranchers, cattlemen, energy producers, sportsmen, and recreationalists because they would be nearest to the lands that the decisions being made are affecting.  I hope we can move this country away from this ``Washington knows best'' mentality. That is why this resolution of disapproval is so important, because that is exactly what it would do, which is to remove ``Washington knows best'' by stopping the BLM planning 2.0 rule.  As it stands, I don't believe this rule should move forward. I have committed to Coloradans, to county commissioners, and to the people of my State that I will always have the goal to put more Colorado in Washington and less Washington in A county commissioner in western Colorado, from Dolores, Garfield, Grand, Gunnison, Hinsdale, Jackson, Mesa, Moffat, Montezuma, Montrose, or Rio Blanco County should have more say in decisions that are impacting their backyard on BLM lands than someone sitting behind a desk in New York They tell me that their ability to have an impact on their backyard lessens as a result of the BLM planning 2.0 rule. They believe they actually have less say under the new rule than somebody who doesn't live anywhere near their land or their State or their county or those BLM lands.  I believe that Colorado State and local leaders and local users should have a strong voice on local land management decisions. It is their backyard. Yes, it is public land, but the fact is they are the ones trying to make a living, trying to govern, trying to make decisions that are best for their constituents, and they should have a voice in those decisions.  I also firmly believe in managing our public lands under the multiple-use philosophy, which promotes recreation, grazing, and energy development with a balanced approach.  If the Congressional Review Act's resolution of disapproval on the BLM planning 2.0 rule is approved and signed into law, there will still be an opportunity to improve management and update policies at the Bureau of Land  I think that is one of the areas of misinformation that we see about resolutions of disapproval. There are some who support the BLM planning 2.0 rule, and there are some who have supported other rules that this Chamber has voted to disapprove through the Congressional Review Those people who support it sometimes get their facts wrong when they say things like: Well, if you repeal this rule, if you approve the resolution of disapproval, then there is no way that you can actually rule in this area again or make a[[Page S1614]]regulation that impacts this area of law again. That is simply not true. The truth is, when you use a resolution of disapproval, it simply says that we think this is the wrong rule that went forward through the executive branch agencies and we ought to use Congress--those people who understand the needs of their States better than a rulemaker in Washington, DC--to go forward with a new piece of legislation, a new authorization for a different rule. If we do that, then, we are going to have better policies because we have been able to account for every voice in the process, instead of leaving voices like those county commissioners, whom I talked about, out to dry.  I have told many recreationalists and sportsmen in Colorado that I am working with our Democratic colleagues and Secretary Zinke at the Department of the Interior on how we can move forward with the land management decisions and land use plans that take into account some of their concerns with this resolution of disapproval. There are updates and modifications that can be achieved, but they should all have stakeholder input. I don't believe that this planning rule 2.0 actually took into account all of the different stakeholders' views.  Working with some landowners cannot be at the expense of others. Right now, our cattlemen, farmers, ranchers, and county commissioners have severe concerns with BLM planning 2.0, and they feel as though they did not have a voice in the development of this rule.  I believe we can do better as elected officials and that we can give these local users' and landowners' interests a stronger voice in moving forward and that we can move forward together. So let's approve this resolution of disapproval that would claw back the BLM 2.0 rule. Let's make sure that local voices are given a place at the table. Let's make sure that county commissioners have influence over their area that is greater than somebody in New York City who doesn't live there. Let's make sure that we can protect the multiple-use philosophy of our public lands. Whether it is energy, recreation, or renewable energy, we have incredible opportunities on our public lands. But we can do better by working with Congress and taking into account every voice and making sure that we have a rule that is broadly supported instead of narrowly supported.  That is why I intend to support the Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval today, and I hope that my colleagues will do the same, as we truly find a bipartisan solution to give the people of our States a greater say over policies that affect their own backyard.

This lady says: ``U.Congressman Louie Gohmert: I am a 52-year-old widow. ObamaCare is a major financial problem for me. Someone needs to fix the healthcare system. One-third of the money I get from my deceased husband's retirement fund is given to health care. My deductible alone is $7,000.''  She has an exclamation point.  ``I am angry with the government deciding how I should spend what little money I have. I had to get a part-time job just to put gas in my car. So I clean tables and I mop floors. I am physically unable to work full time. I am frustrated with the fact I had to move back in with my parents just to make ends meet. Would you like that? Could or would you do something to relieve this burden?''  That is from a 52-year-old widow in my district. That is what we have done with the burden, We here in Congress decided: You know what? We are going to tell people like this widow how she has to spend what little money she has left. We are going to force this woman to go clean tables and mop floors when she is physically unable to work full time because we here in Washington have decided we know better than she does. So we have every right in Congress to force people like this dear widow to get on her hands and knees to work for the United States Pay your taxes and now, that is not enough. We are going to tell you that you are being forced to spend your money on health care that will never help you a dime because you have a $7,000 deductible.  Or how about hearing, 2 weeks ago, from a friend, one of those who was cut because of financial troubles. They had 100 employees. They can't afford the ObamaCare, so they have cut their 100 to 70, and they are continuing to work to get down to 49. Why? Because of So we have already had 30 breadwinners, men and women, lose their jobs because of one thing:  And now there are going to be 21 more who lose their jobs because of one thing: They have got to get it under 50 so they don't have to keep paying such ridiculous prices for health insurance that has such high deductibles nobody will ever benefit.  Who is benefiting? Well, it can't be all of the health insurance companies because they have dropped out. They can't make money. So it has to be the government that is making all the money from this ObamaCare program.  A single mom told me she had been working at McDonald's making ends meet, but because of ObamaCare, they cut her hours back. Now she has to work at both McDonald's and Burger King, and she was in tears because it is just too much.  And why is she having to do it? Because people right here in this House and the other body, without one Republican vote in this body, told America: Too bad. You are not working enough at McDonald's. We want to make your life miserable. We are going to make you work at two places part time just like this widow that we condemned to start scrubbing tables and floors because the Democrats in this body, without a single Republican vote, decided we know better what you need to do with your time and your money than you do.  So it is a problem of arrogance when Washington thinks it knows so much better than people across the country. And yes, I know, I represent the 26 percent that didn't vote for me. I understand that. And I have heard from them, and I don't need a townhall to know they are for keeping this albatross of a healthcare system. The ACA is not affordable, though. It is ridiculous to call it affordable care.  One of the problems is, when you have to take precious healthcare dollars that used to go to providing care in a hospital, in a clinic, for a patient, now it goes to government navigators. Why? Because there were union officials that decided: We have lost too many union members. The unions that are growing are the government unions, the very ones that Franklin Roosevelt said you should never have a union composed of government workers.  Think about it. You are working for the people of the United States of Why would you need a union to organize against the people? Sounds un-But those are the ones that are growing. And union leaders, without concern for their members, decided: Let's embrace as many aliens as we can get into the country, legally or otherwise, because they will join the union and that will grow our ranks; and we as union leaders will be better off, but our members' wages will continue to go down, our members will continue to lose jobs. But, gee, we may have more people in our union.  We know that there was supposed to be thousands of new IRS agents hired so that they could help enforce It is a travesty. The bill that has been filed is not going to do it, but, hopefully, our Republican leadership will be willing to work things out and not prevent good amendments that will make it palatable so enough of us can vote for it.  I have gotten to know President Trump a bit, and I feel like he wants the best deal he can get for If this bill were the best he could get, he would probably have to live with that, but we can do a whole lot better. Some of us are determined we are not going to vote for one that doesn't.  In the meantime, there is so much talk by President Obama and all of his minions that are still out there trying to undermine the Trump administration. We have a crisis here in Congress[[Page H1590]]that people are not talking about. I keep bringing it up. Doesn't seem to be a lot of folks who want to talk about it.  There was a time when we had mainstream media that actually did research, asked questions, dug to the bottom of things. But there are IT--information technology, mainly working with computers--employees, shared employees for several Democrats that are under investigation. Imran Awan was the company owner. Abid Awan, Jamal Awan, Hina Alvi--the wife of Imran Awan--and Natalia Sova, wife of Abid Awan, each made $160,000 a year as IT-shared employees working on computers for various Democrats in the House of  The Awan brothers are of Pakistani descent, but their immigration status is unclear. There are a lot of things that are unknown about the Awan brothers. But they worked for our former DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz--that is Imran These people are under investigation for stealing material, potentially accessing material they shouldn't have, for taking material off of Capitol Hill and stealing it, using it in other places.  We are told, oh, not to worry, they didn't access classified intelligence information in the SCIF; but other IT people tell me, once someone is in the congressional system, the calendar, email for one Member of Congress, if they are good, it is not that hard to break into lots of other Members of Congress' email and calendars.  What country that hates America--some that like America--wouldn't love to know who people are meeting, especially on the Intelligence Committee like some of the people that have employed these?  Some of them, very fine members of things like the Ethics Committee, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, Intelligence Let's see, Andre Carson, Sandy Levin, Jackie Speier--a lot of people, good people--Tim A lot of these folks, they employed these folks. They were very trusting, kind people. And these people didn't have a background check, and now they are under investigation. I heard some have been told that Imran Awan, the lead guy, went back to  Well, if this guy set up and was working on computer systems, is it possible he could have--and this is what a normal mainstream reporter, 30, 40 years ago back in the seventies would have asked: Well, did he set up the DNC computer system that got hacked, that was supposedly hacked by Russians or others, did he set that up so it could be hacked? I mean, there is a lot here going on that we don't know the answers to, and we deserve to know the answers.  There were mortgage transfers, debt evading bankruptcies. Imran Awan, Jamal Awan were known to be the ringleaders of the group, had been providing services since 2005; has convictions for driving offenses which were serious enough to become criminal misdemeanors, used an illegal radar detector, drove an unregistered vehicle; some say, after masterminding the family's finances, was running the business completely by 2010 and instructed Abid not to even speak to anyone.  The wives of Imran and Abid also began receiving paychecks from the House of They purchased two homes in Lorton in 2008, one of which was associated with all three brothers at one time. Alvi sold that home in 2016 to the younger brother Jamal for $620,000.  Imran owned a home and put it in his father's name in 2008 in Abid later claimed, in bankruptcy, that the house was his.  Jamal Awan was placed on the House payroll at age 20, making $160,000.  Imran is also a real estate agent. Despite making $160,000 in congressional salaries, debts went unpaid by the Awan brothers, including debts to the Congressional Federal Credit  $100,000 was taken from a known Hezbollah-connected fugitive, a fugitive from the FBI; and they are associated with this Hezbollah-connected agent, and there is no press out there getting to the bottom of it? What happened to the Washington press, the proud press of Washington of the 1970s? Well, they are in the bag for one party. They are not interested in getting to the bottom of the news. They are all about advocating.  God not just bless America, God help We have got to have people wake up before we do much more damage to ourselves. It is time to turn this country around, and one of the things we should start with is getting to the bottom of this investigation; find out how much damage these alleged criminals did from Pakistan to our Congress, and also start undoing the damage ObamaCare has done so people can get jobs again they have lost, so people can have health care that has deductibles they can afford. It is time to make America great again.

611,topic-id,2391,"Mr.President, in a little more than 2 weeks, the Judiciary Committee will open its hearing on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the U.Supreme This is the 14th Supreme Court confirmation process in which I have participated. Over that time, while some things have changed, others have stayed the same.  The conflict over judicial appointments, especially to the Supreme Court, remains at its core a conflict over the proper role of judges in our system of government. The two sides of this conflict want two very different kinds of judges. Some of my colleagues, joined by their liberal allies, instead want judges who owe their fidelity to a particular political agenda.  For them, the judiciary is simply a backup plan for achieving political objectives. If the legislative branch does not deliver, they go to the executive--as they often did in the previous administration. If that does not work, they figure that the courts offer a second or third bite at the political apple.  This vision is fundamentally inconsistent with the way our system of government was destined, designed, and intended to be. Instead, the Framers devised the role of the judiciary on the wisdom of Montesquieu, who posited:       Were the power of judging joined with the legislative, the      life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary      control. . . . Were it joined to the executive power, the      judge might behave [as] an oppressor.  That was Reflecting this wisdom, the Constitution endows the judge with the role of saying what the law is, rather than what he wishes the law would be.  Alexander Hamilton rightly observed: The people's liberty cannot be endangered by the judiciary ``so long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the executive.''  The stakes in this conflict over judicial power are really enormous. The choice determines whether the people or unelected judges will govern the country and define the culture. Our system of government and the liberty it makes possible allow only one answer. The confirmation process allows us to determine which kind of judge Neil Gorsuch is and which kind of Justice he will be.  The dynamics of the confirmation process often reveal what kind of judge Senators and interest groups really[[Page S1568]]seek. Those who want political judges, for example, use a variety of strategies to determine how a judicial nominee, especially to the Supreme Court, will rule on issues and cases they care about. In fact, most of the time it seems that the policy consequences of how a judge will rule is the only thing that some Senators and advocates really care about.  For example, when President Bush nominated Chief Justice John Roberts in 2005, one Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee said that the real question was this: ``Whose side is Judge Roberts really on, on the really important issues of our time?''  Another Democratic Senator said: ``Before we vote, it is important to know where Judge Roberts stands on key issues.''  Another said that she needed to know whether ``Judge Roberts will stand with us and with our families or be on the side of major special interests.''  Now, something is seriously wrong when the confirmation process for a Supreme Court nominee sounds more like an election campaign for a Senator or a Senate seat. Unfortunately, the same thing is happening again today regarding Judge If a corporation won a case before him on the Tenth Circuit, for example, those groups claim that he is a champion of corporate interests, no matter the legal grounds of the decision, the facts, or anything else.  If another decision's result does not sufficiently advance the feminist agenda, they say that he is anti-woman. This radical approach seems to say that judges are free to decide every case based on the political popularity of the result and, therefore, that the judge personally intends every outcome. These advocates do not distinguish between the commands of the law and the personal preferences of the judge.  In this view, statutes and the Constitution mean whatever judges want them to mean, making unelected, unaccountable, lifetime appointees the master of the people. Political judges take away from the people the power to govern themselves and undermine their liberty. Using political or theological litmus tests in the quest for such political judges, demanding that they take sides and insisting that they make commitments to certain policy agendas before even taking office, poses a similar threat to the independence and impartiality of the judiciary.  There is nothing mainstream about political judges and nothing mainstream in the tactics used to appoint them. In contrast, impartial judges are consistent with the principles on which our system of government is based and the independence that judges must have. When Judge Gorsuch took his seat on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in 2006, he took the oath required by title 28, section 453, of the United States He pledged to administer justice without respect to persons and to faithfully and impartially discharge his judiciary duties.  Now, I want to suggest that my colleagues try an experiment. Ask your constituents whether judges should make up their mind on a case before hearing all of the evidence and arguments. Ask whether judges should take positions on issues before those issues even come before them in court.  I know what Utahns would say. The ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, for example, twice states this principle:       A judge shall not, in connection with cases, controversies,      or issues that are likely to come before the court, make      pledges, promises, or commitments that are inconsistent with      the impartial performance of the adjudicative [functions and]      duties of judicial office.  State codes of judicial conduct include the same commonsense protection for judicial impartiality. The California code, for example, prohibits statements, whether public or not, that ``commit the judge with respect to cases, controversies, or issues that are likely to come before the courts.''  Now, this has been the consistent practice of judicial nominees before the Judiciary Elena Kagan came before the Judiciary Committee in June 2010, after being nominated by President Obama to replace Justice John Paul On June 29, 2010, she said that it would not be appropriate for her to comment on an issue that could come before the  Samuel Alito--Justice Alito--came before the committee in January 2006, after being nominated by President Bush to replace Justice Sandra Day O'On January 11, 2006, he said:       But the line I have to draw, and I think every nominee,      including Justice Ginsburg, has drawn, is to say that when it      comes to something that realistically could come before the      Court, they can't answer about how they would decide that      question. That would be a disservice to the judicial process.  Ruth Bader Justice Ginsburg appeared before the Judiciary Committee in July 1993, nominated by President Clinton to replace Justice Byron On July 20, 1993, she said this: ``A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts, no hints, for that would show not only disregard for the specifics of the particular case, it would display disdain for the entire judicial process.''  Antonin Scalia came before the committee in August 1986, after being nominated by President Reagan to replace Justice William On August 5, 1986, he said that taking positions in a hearing on issues that could come before him was not just a slippery slope but, in his words, a precipice. He said: ``I just cannot do it, and I think the only way to be sure that I am not impairing my ability to be impartial in future cases . . . is simply to respectfully decline to give an opinion.''  Let me reach even further back. Justice Abe Fortas came before the Judiciary Committee in July 1968, after being nominated by President Johnson to replace Chief Justice Earl The committee sent the nomination to the full Senate and said these words in its report:       To require a Justice to state his views on legal questions      or to discuss his past decisions before the committee would      threaten the independence of the judiciary and the integrity      of the judicial system itself. It would also impinge on the      constitutional doctrine of separation of powers among the      three branches of Government as required by the  Judge Thurgood Marshall came before the committee in July 1967, nominated by President Johnson to replace Justice Tom The committee sent the nomination to the full Senate and its report noted that the nominee had said he would ``wisely and forthrightly decline to give a judicial opinion on hypothetical questions.''  Just 2 years earlier, when the committee reported the nomination of Abe Fortas to be an Associate Justice, its report said: ``We have always felt it would be unfair to ask any nominee for any judicial office to give a legal opinion on the basis of a hypothetical question.''  I think the point is obvious. Every nominee, of either party, for decades has taken the same position, and it is the right position. It reflects a commitment to judicial independence, to impartiality, and to the integrity of the judicial branch of government.  If my Democratic colleagues and their liberal allies believe that Justices Kagan, Alito, Ginsburg, Scalia, Fortas, and Marshall were all wrong, they should say so. If they believe that judges should prejudge cases by committing to particular outcomes, then they should make that case. If they believe that the oath of judicial office and code of judicial conduct are all misguided, then, it seems to me, they should be upfront about it. I, for one, believe that judges should be impartial, that they should follow the law, and that they should stay within their designated role.  America needs impartial, not political, judges. I don't care which party you are in. If you are an attorney, you have to appreciate judges who are impartial, especially if you are an honest attorney.  We need judges who will follow, rather than lead, the law. The Constitution, after all, is the primary way that the American people set rules for government, and that includes--God bless it--the judicial branch. The Constitution cannot control judges if judges control the  Yesterday the Judiciary Committee received a letter signed by more than 30 prominent members of the Supreme Court bar. In combination, they have argued more than 500 cases before the U.Supreme Though they hold different political and legal views, they are united in strongly supporting Judge Gorsuch's nomination. They[[Page S1569]]write that he is fair-minded, principled, and ``has the unusual combination of character, dedication, and intellect that would make him an asset to our Nation's highest court.''  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  I believe the record demonstrates that Judge Neil Gorsuch is an impartial judge and will, when confirmed, be an impartial Supreme Court He will take the law as he finds it and apply it ``without respect to persons,'' just as the oath commands. With him on the bench, the law--made by the people's elected representatives--will determine winners and losers. In doing so, he will be exactly the kind of Justice America needs.  Judge Gorsuch has a tremendous reputation on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, supported by Democrats and Republicans alike. Judge Gorsuch is a brilliant lawyer and an even more brilliant judge.  He is a person of impeccable reputation and integrity. He is exactly the type of person you would want deciding your case if you had a case before the Supreme He is exactly the type of person whom other judges could emulate and follow, so he is exactly the type of person we want on the Supreme  I have heard some ugly rumors that some of my colleagues in this body might, because of political concerns and political pressure, want to vote against Judge I would caution them not to do that.  I think Judge Gorsuch will basically please almost everyone in this body over the years that he serves as a Supreme Court He is a really fine man. He is a fine family man. He is a very fine lawyer and a fantastic court of appeals judge.

623,topic-id,1192,"Mr.President, with all the division and conflict in politics today, it would take something truly compelling to unite all 100 Senators, including Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals. Well, it has happened. This week I sent to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson a letter, signed by all 100 Senators, asking that it be conveyed to Russian President Vladimir The letter supports the decades-long quest by Agudas Chasidei Chabad of the United States to recover from Russia its collection of sacred religious texts and manuscripts.  Chabad was established in the 18th century in Russia and is today the largest Hasidic Jewish organization in the world. The organization's past leaders, or rebbes, accumulated this collection of sacred texts, which includes a library and an archive and is central to Chabad's religious life. The Soviets took control of the library in 1920 and in 1927 arrested the sixth rebbe and sentenced him to death. He was allowed to leave Russia later that year but had to leave the library behind. In 1933, the sixth rebbe and the archive moved to  In 1940, after both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland, the sixth rebbe fled to the United States without the archive. It was confiscated, first by the Nazis and then by the Chabad has since worked to reclaim both the library and the archive.  It is important to place the letter we sent this week in its full context because this is only the latest in a long series of actions by all three branches of the U.Government to support Chabad's quest. Members of Congress, for example, began calling for the return of these works in the 1930s. Just weeks before the Soviet Union dissolved on Christmas Day 1991, both President Mikhail Gorbachev and a state arbitration panel ordered that the library be returned to On January 24, 1992, the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe wrote President Boris Yeltsin, urging him to carry out the court's order and return the collection.  Unfortunately, both President Gorbachev's directive and the court's order were effectively nullified when the Russian Federation replaced the Soviet Within a few months, however, the U.State Department expressed ``strong support'' for returning the full collection to On May 31, 1992, all 100 Senators signed a letter to President Boris Yeltsin urging the collection's ``quick release.''  On February 20, 2005, all 100 Senators signed a letter to President Putin, again urging that the collection be returned to The letter said this: ``The religious texts that Chabad seeks to retrieve consist of rare and irreplaceable books, archives and manuscripts on Chabad philosophy, Jewish religious law, prayer and tradition. . . . We urge you to return these sacred religious texts, archives, and manuscripts to Chabad, which would be a significant example of your government's commitment to justice, human rights, and religious freedom.''  Chabad filed suit against Russia in Federal court. During this litigation, the United States filed statements of interest reiterating its ``strong support'' for returning the collection to On July 30, 2010, the U.District Court for the District of Columbia ordered Russia to return both the library and the archive to  I am truly grateful to all of my colleagues for your support of Chabad and their effort to recover this important component of their religious life. As striking as this unity is, I hope my colleagues also see it as part of a much longer story of extraordinary faith and commitment in the face of loss and persecution. I hope and pray that such efforts will be successful and that Russia will respond favorably to Chabad's request. It would indeed be a demonstration of their commitment to justice, human rights, and religious freedom.

The religious texts that Chabad seeks to retrieve consist      of rare and irreplaceable books, archives and manuscripts on      Chabad philosophy, Jewish religious law, prayer and      tradition.

977,topic-id,271,"Mr.President, as cochairs of the Rare Disease Caucus, Senator Klobuchar and I have worked hard to bring more hope to patients and their families who are coping with rare diseases on a daily basis.  Today 1 in 20 individuals worldwide is living with one or more of the more than 7,000 rare diseases, 95 percent of which do not have an effective treatment. While the incentives provided by the Orphan Drug Act, first championed by me in 1983, has led to the approval of nearly 600 orphan drugs, much more needs to be done.  Many patients living with rare diseases rely on the FDA to evaluate and approve treatment options for their conditions. That is why it is so important for the FDA to use its authority to accelerate the evaluation and approval of drugs for treating rare diseases and for Congress to ensure that proper incentives exist for research to discover and make affordable treatments and cures available for this community.  To address this issue, Congress passed the FDA Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, which refined and strengthened the tools available to FDA to accelerate the evaluation and approval of new drugs targeting unmet medical needs for rare conditions. I have been paying close attention to how this new authority translates into advances for patients suffering from conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, Bertrand-N-glycanase deficiency, and other rare diseases.  In light of these changes over the past few years, I ask my friend from Minnesota whether the current approval process is achieving its goals of safety and efficacy without hampering the development of new therapies.

I have also contacted the FDA frequently during the past year to encourage the agency to listen to the voices of patients during the agency's evaluation process.  When the Senate considers the nominee for FDA Commissioner, I will continue to stress the importance of incorporating a balanced and flexible approach when weighing risks, benefits, and outcomes, especially when dealing with small patient populations with such rapidly progressing prognoses.  Patients with limited or no treatment options are depending on FDA to utilize the flexibility outlined in This law, which provides full and fair review of new drug therapies in a timely manner, gives hope to patients suffering from life threatening diseases and, of course, their families as well.

581,topic-id,944,"Madam President, as recently as 2006, Hawaii relied on imported fuel for 92 percent of our energy needs. This was bad for our economy and bad for our environment, and it needed to change. Today, Hawaii has the most ambitious renewable energy goals in the country, and we are working toward becoming 100 percent energy self-sufficient for electricity by 2045. In order to meet this ambitious goal, we are investing in a renewable energy future. It means cleaner air and water to enjoy, and it is driving a lot of local innovation. Let me give you a few examples.  Last Friday, I attended a blessing for a new biofuel project in Maui's central valley. Pacific Biodiesel, run by Bob and Kelly King, is repurposing 115 acres of land previously used for commercial sugar cultivation in order to test the energy potential of different sunflower varieties for biofuels. If they are successful, this project could grow to provide hundreds of jobs on the island and help Hawaii on its path to energy self-sufficiency.  Bob and Kelly got their start in repurposing used cooking oil. They have grown their company to run the Nation's first commercially viable biodiesel distillery on Hawaii Island, and they employ 80 people. Along the way, they have received support and funding through the Hawaii Military Biofuels Crop Program, which has allowed them to experiment, learn from their mistakes, and, ultimately, succeed.  Yesterday, I met with Naveen Sikka, the founder and CEO of TerViva, which is a startup that grows pongamia trees that produce an oil seed that can be used for biofuels. In working with Hawaii's Energy Excelerator, TerViva is already growing pongamia trees on 200 acres on Oahu and is looking to expand its operations across the  TerViva and Pacific Biodiesel are working together to explore how to help Hawaii achieve its renewable energy goals.  In 2015, I met with Global Algae Innovations, a company that is pioneering the production of algae for use in biofuels on Funding from the Department of Energy, or DOE, has been instrumental in its research. Support from the Department is vital in helping them and other algae biofuel companies finish scaling up commercial production at competitive prices.  These stories provide a compelling counternarrative to the President's belief that we should prioritize fossil fuel extraction over renewable energy development. These stories also demonstrate the role government can play in encouraging energy innovation.  During the Obama administration, our country made significant progress in confronting the challenge of climate change, investing in clean energy research and development, and growing our renewable energy economy. Unfortunately, by nominating Rick Perry to serve as Secretary of Energy, the President is sending a clear signal. Instead of continuing the progress we have made, he wants to take us backward.  During his confirmation hearing, Governor Perry insisted that he believed in an ``all of the above'' energy strategy. So far, it does not seem that the President shares his commitment.  During the transition, a disturbing report leaked in the media that outlined the President's plans to make dramatic funding cuts at the Department of This extreme plan included eliminating the DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, which focuses on the transition to American energy generation that is clean, affordable, and secure, not to mention sustainable. The plan would eliminate the DOE's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, which ensures the Nation's energy delivery system is secure, resilient, and reliable. This office works to strengthen the resiliency of the electric grid. The plan would also eliminate the DOE's Office of Fossil Energy, which focuses on technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  It is hard to see how it would be possible to pursue an ``all of the above'' energy strategy if so much of the Department's ``all of the above'' capabilities are eliminated.  I asked Governor Perry, during his confirmation hearing, whether he supported those proposed cuts and program eliminations within the Department that he was nominated to head. His response was telling. Governor Perry said: ``Well, Senator, maybe they'll [meaning the Trump administration] have the same experience I had and forget that they said that.''  Remember, Governor Perry had originally said that the Department of Energy should be eliminated. Governor Perry's ``oops'' answer got a laugh at the hearing, but it failed to convince me that he has the willingness and fortitude to stand up to the Trump White House on its energy policies.  I also asked Governor Perry if Hawaii could count on his support in our efforts to become energy independent and a leader in the clean energy economy. Again, Governor Perry said yes, but in the same transition memo, the Trump White House proposed eliminating the DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy entirely, as I mentioned before. It is unclear how Governor Perry could keep his commitment to the State of Hawaii and to me if the entire office that is responsible for renewable energy is eliminated.  Many of my constituents share my concerns about Governor Charlotte from Wailuku wrote to me:       Please do not confirm Rick Perry for US Secretary of      He is not a visionary leader. In Hawaii, we have      committed to being 100% carbon emission free by 2045.       Rick Perry is not the person who can help provide      innovation, funding or the tools needed to make this happen.[[Page S1557]]  I share Charlotte's concerns. We have made so much progress over the past 8 years in embracing a clean and renewable energy future, and Governor Perry and the Trump administration will work to reverse this progress and take us backward.

973,topic-id,549,"Mr.President, the Bureau of Land Management has a mission set by Congress; that is, to manage the Nation's public lands under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield, which means that public land should be open to everything, from hunting and grazing to energy development and other reasonable uses.  The BLM currently manages more than 246 million acres of land and 700 million acres of Federal and non-Federal subsurface estate. Much of these lands are in the West, where Federal acres coexist with private and State-owned land. In order to manage its resources effectively, BLM is required to provide resource management plans. This planning has typically been led by BLM's field offices, in coordination with State, local, and Tribal governments that provide local input on how best to manage the land and its unique resources. However, in the final months of the last administration, the BLM sought to apply a top-down approach, essentially a one-size-fits-all, top-down approach to this resource management process. They termed it the planning 2.0 final rule.  The rule which was finalized in December changed how this planning is done and undermined the well-established process by limiting the ability of local input, public comment, and meaningful State consultation.  The final rule also pulled decision-making away from the regional BLM field offices and centralized it at BLM's headquarters in Washington, under the concept of ``landscape-level planning,'' which lets Washington define new[[Page S1616]]areas covering multiple The rule takes important decision-making away from local officials who know the land and understand the needs of their communities.  The BLM rule sought to ignore the multiple-use requirements established by Congress and diminishes the importance of energy development. The rule tilts the balance in favor of conservation and non-development and away from responsible energy development, as well as other uses, like grazing.  In a State like North Dakota, with a distinctive patchwork of underground Federal minerals and private or State surface ownership, this creates more uncertainty for energy producers and more difficulty for our ranchers. By repealing this rule, we are preserving our longstanding tradition of allowing multiple uses on Federal lands, while protecting the livelihoods of our ranchers, energy producers, and many others. That is why this resolution is supported by the North Dakota Stockmen's Association, along with the National Association of Counties, the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the Farm Bureau, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the Public Lands Council, and the U.Chamber of Commerce, just to name a few.  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the CRA on the BLM planning 2.0 rule. I thank Chairman Murkowski, the chairman of our Energy Committee, for her leadership on this important issue.  The House passed this CRA on February 7 in a bipartisan manner. I am hopeful the Senate will do so as well and send this bill to the President's desk this week.  Today's CRA ensures that State, local, and Tribal input and expertise should guide the management of our public lands. Let's stop the BLM's planning 2.0 rule and give the people who live and work in these communities a say on what happens in their hometowns. We can do that by voting for this I urge my colleagues to do so.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgS1609.txt,2079,FRED D.

In addition, the House will consider several reform bills straight from our Better Way agenda:  First, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Further Asbestos Claim Transparency Act, sponsored by Chairman Bob Goodlatte, which ensures that only similarly injured parties can be in the same class for purposes of a class action suit, as well as requires public disclosure of reports on the receipt and disposition of claims for injuries based on exposure to asbestos.  Next, H.725, the Innocent Party Protection Act, sponsored by Representative Ken Buck, which establishes a uniform standard for determining whether a defendant has been fraudulently joined to a lawsuit.  And third, H.720, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, sponsored by Chairman Lamar Smith, which restores accountability to our legal system by penalizing lawyers for filing baseless lawsuits.  Our Federal litigation system is plagued with broken rules that unnecessarily harm American businesses and consumers. With these measures, we will follow through on our pledge to take on trial lawyers and crack down on lawsuit abuse through meaningful litigation reform.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, the House will consider the Fiscal Year 2017 Department of Defense Appropriations bill, sponsored by Chairman Rodney  ",CREC-2017-03-02-pt1-PgH1484.txt,566,NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION TRANSITION AUTHORIZATION,2017.0,2.0,March

I agree with the majority leader that subjecting the Defense Appropriations or any other appropriation is not a tenable or appropriate policy to pursue.

Can the majority leader tell me whether or not we intend to adopt and pass, in the regular order, individual bills--the Labor-Health bill, the Interior bill, the Agriculture bill, et cetera, et cetera--in a similar manner?

Very frankly, we believe that the scenario is being set up to take care of the defense bill.  I voted for the defense bill. I was one of those people. I intend to vote for the defense bill next week when it comes to the floor, if, in fact, as the gentleman represents, it is substantively the same as the bill that we have already adopted.  What I am concerned about and what Members on my side of the aisle are very concerned about is that the remaining nondefense discretionary spending bills will be substantially altered from that which we would have passed in December of last year in the 2017.  Of course, we were 4 months late doing that--or 3 months late, at least: October, November, and But I am hopeful, Mr.Leader, that those bills will, in fact, be considered discretely so that the American public can see us vote on those bills and on the priorities that are incorporated in those bills.  Mr.Leader, it appears that the majority has stalled somewhat in their efforts in a path forward on repeal of the President Trump's address on Tuesday, it seems to me, didn't offer many details. He does say, however, that everybody is going to be covered--everybody--with better health care,[[Page H1485]]cheaper. If that bill comes to the floor, I am going to vote for it, Mr.I want you to know that. Health care for everybody--quality, accessible, affordable, and cheaper.  Now, as the majority leader knows, the budget resolution that was passed this year set a deadline of January 27 for committees to report legislation repealing the law. It is now March 2, and there are reports, Mr.Leader, that Republicans have a draft bill that perhaps is located in H-157, that it is not being posted, and that Republicans have been told they can view it in H-157.  I don't know that I have the room number correct, and I am not sure that the information that I have is correct, but I will tell you that Michael Burgess, or Burgess, on your side of the aisle said this. He said it yesterday: People need to have access to this document--apparently his presumption was he did not have access to the document or he believed others should; not only Members of our side of the aisle, but also the public--and if there are problems, let's talk through them. It's been a long time in the works. Most of the pieces that are in there, people have seen in the past, but it does need to be an open process.  Mr.Leader, let me repeat that. It does need to be an open process, according to  Gus Bilirakis says: We're not having a hearing or anything. We're not having a hearing or anything. But there'll be a place for us to view it, the draft.  Paul Ryan, the Speaker, said, 3 days ago: We're going through the committee process. We're doing this step by step. We're having public hearings. We're having committee work on legislation. This is how the legislative process is supposed to be designed. We are not hatching some bill in a back room--perhaps H-157; he didn't say that, I said it--and plopping it on the American people's front door.  Mr.Leader, you and I both were here when the Affordable Care Act was passed. There was a lot of talk about the Affordable Care Act and how it was passed in the dark of night. That was baloney, of course. We had 79 bipartisan hearings and markups over the 2 years that we considered the Affordable Care House Members spent nearly 100 hours in hearings, heard from 181 witnesses from both sides of the aisle, considered 239 amendments--both Democratic and Republican--and accepted 121 amendments.  The original House bill was posted online 30 days before the first committee began their markup and more than 100 days before the committee introduced their merged bill in the House Democrats posted the House bill--that was the final process--online 72 hours before the bill was brought to the floor, consistent with our rules.  Now, to my understanding, the Ways and Means Committee has been told this bill is going to be marked up on There will not have been a single hearing, there will not have been a single witness, and Members cannot, on our side of the aisle--as I understand it--see the bill today.  I don't know where all my Tea Party friends are who demanded full consideration and that everybody read the bill. I don't see them out on the lawn. I don't see them out on the plaza. I don't see them out on the sidewalk as they were when we were considering the bill and we had those 181 witnesses, the 100 hours of hearings that they thought weren't sufficient.                              {time}  1130  I don't know whether they will think that having a markup next Wednesday when the bill has not even been made available to Democratic Members of the Apparently, Republican Members have to go to a room to see it, and the public clearly has no idea of what that bill is.  Mr.Leader, I hope you will tell me that I am wrong, that there will be hearings consistent with what Speaker Ryan said 3 days ago. I hope you will tell me, yes, we are going to honor what Speaker Ryan said, that we are going to have those hearings, we are going to have witnesses, and we are going to consider amendments.  All of us understand that this is one of the biggest issues confronting the American people. We have had hundreds of thousands of people showing up at town meetings saying how concerned they are, yet, if my information is correct, Mr.Leader, they will have no opportunity to talk to the Committee on Ways and  I am further informed, and I hope the majority leader says this is wrong, that the markup will occur before the Congressional Budget Office has the opportunity to say how much it is going to cost. All this weeping and gnashing of teeth about balanced budgets and fiscal responsibility, a bill that affects 18 percent of the gross domestic product, and the critical need for people to have access to affordable, quality health care, not one of them will have an opportunity to know how much this repeal will cost.  Again, Mr.Leader, I hope you are going to be able to tell me, no, Mr.Whip, we are going to have hearings, we understand how important this issue is, how much interest there is in this country, and we are going to give time for serious consideration, and we are going to have witnesses come before those hearings; and then after the witnesses, we are going to have a markup after substantial debate and consideration is allowed on both sides of the aisle.  I now yield to the majority leader with the hopes that he will be able to give me some degree of confidence that Paul Ryan, our Speaker, was correct, that we are going to follow regular order and make a transparent consideration of this piece of legislation.

You have been here quite some time, much longer than I agree with you, this is a very big issue. That is why, for the last 6 years, we have had hearings because all those hearings you reported, I would have wished you would have listened during those hearings. I would have wished you would have been able to do a healthcare bill that actually works. The essence of what the ACA did, it was about exchanges and the expansion of  So my dear friend here tells me that was a big success. What do you tell all those people across this country? In fact, one-third of every county in this country now only has one health insurer. Humana just announced they are pulling out. Because you love quotes so much, let me read what the CEO of Aetna says: ObamaCare is failing. It has entered a ``death spiral.''  With Humana pulling out, that gives 16 counties in Tennessee that have no one to care for them. The expansion of Medicaid--I know you are concerned about the budget, as am I--says within this 10-year window, in the tenth year, it will cost us $1 trillion. You know as well as I do that that is about the exact amount of money we spend for all discretionary spending in government today. We watched the ACA create 23 CO-They were provided more than $2 billion. Eighteen of those 23 have collapsed.  So, yes, for the last 6 years, we have been holding hearings, we have been listening to the public, and we have been working on this bill. Yes, we will go regular order. We will have a markup in committee. When the bill comes out of committee, we will take that markup, we will go to the Committee on the Budget because it is reconciliation, and we will bring that bill to the floor, just as the rules state we will do that. We have waited 6 years to do this, just as we moved one last year to the President as well, and he vetoed it.  We cannot sit and wait for this failure to continue any longer. The health of this country deserves something much better. That is why we have been spending our time, that is why we have been working on it, and that is why we have been listening.

436,topic-id,1081,"I thank the gentleman for his comment. It is, therefore, extraordinarily sad that we have spent 6 years with only one option that the majority would pursue: repeal. Not fix, not make it work better, not ensure that people can afford their care, not make sure that insurance companies had the competence to stay in the market because the market was destabilized for all of its lifetime to date by the Republicans saying all we are going to do is repeal.  The gentleman talks about the cost. The gentleman cannot tell me some 4[[Page H1486]]days before he suggests passing a piece of legislation that will affect 18 percent of our gross domestic product what it will cost. Why? Because he has no score from the He can tell me all he wants about 6 years of waiting and listening. He has no score on this bill. My judgment is he will have no score when he marks it up. By the way, he will give no access, contrary to Speaker Ryan saying that we are going to go regular order. I reject, with all due respect, Mr.Majority Leader, the fact that we had a hearing a year ago or 2 years ago or 3 years ago, that the opinion that was given at those times by various witnesses who differed on their conclusions, that we can apply that to the bill that you have introduced now.  I don't know what the bill you have introduced is. I don't know whether you have introduced it or somebody else has introduced it. I don't even know whether it exists. I told the gentleman what I am told. He has not disabused me of any of the assertions I made. He has not disabused me that it is not available publicly. He has not disabused me of the fact that we can't see it. He has not disabused me of Burgess saying it ought to be seen by everybody and considered, it should not be in a secret room someplace that people have to go to, like it is a secret document. We have to go down to the Capitol Visitor Center in the secure facilities of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to see secret documents. Surely that is not the standard that we are giving to a bill that will have such, in my view, catastrophic effect on individuals, on jobs, and on businesses.  Mr.Speaker, I want to tell the majority leader that I do not accept the proposition that a hearing over 6 years about repeal only--and I am not sure how many hearings there were. Maybe the majority leader knows. But I know for a fact that proponents of the bill were very difficult to get on the list of witnesses that we wanted to testify at some of those hearings. The American people, the Tea Party, all those people for and against who came to these town meetings should really lament. And, frankly, I think that the Speaker's representation is not being followed. The assertion that it was done last year, the year before, we have a lot of new Members in this Congress who weren't here. Frankly, when we have bills introduced in Congress, we usually have hearings on them. That is the regular order.  Now, we haven't been following regular order on all these congressional review acts, Mr.Leader, so maybe the precedent nowadays is forget about hearings because most of the bills that we have considered during this Congress have not had hearings. The ramifications of the repeal of these rules no one knows. There were no hearings on those. Frankly, we didn't have hearings on those year after year after year in the past. So, Mr.Leader, it appears that the representation you are making is we know all about this, we don't need hearings, we have been talking about this stuff forever, we are just going to act. The courage, I would suggest to my friend, the courage would be to expose these to full and fair and open debate. That would be the courage.  Now, Mr.Leader, unless you want to respond to that, I will move on to a different subject.  Mr.Well, I would only like to end with this: I was here at the same time. I know you have your history, and I have the history that I remember. I remember seeing the Speaker at that time, now your leader, say we need to pass the bill to find out what is in it. I remember being here late that night. I remember a lot of people, citizens around this building complaining. You know what? The saddest part of all that, their fears became true. They didn't get to keep the doctor or the health plan that they were promised. The premiums they were told would go down $2,500, that didn't happen. They now find that they don't have the care that they were promised. We have spent our time.  You did make a statement that there are a lot of new people in this building. I would argue that is a reason why there are a lot of new people in this building, the ACA and the way you carried it out. That is why we did not do that. You stipulated a little earlier, trying to state about a 3-day rule. That wasn't your rule. That is a rule we instituted and changed when we became the majority, Mr. So we will have regular order. We will have regular order. We will take it through committee, we will have it open for debate, and we will bring it to the floor because we promised the American people, and we will keep our promise, just as the President, as you heard just this week, talked about the reform. We will protect preexisting conditions. We will make sure those who are 26 or younger can stay on their parents' plan. The bans or lifetime limits, we will protect those like we have always said we would. We will create a healthcare bill that actually empowers the individual, not more government. We will actually lower the premiums. That is the difference between us. We can have those debates, and I welcome them, because I think history will show your hearings and our hearings. But, at the end of the day, I want the history to show who actually did a better job of providing health care to the American people at a lower cost.  ",CREC-2017-03-02-pt1-PgH1484.txt,566,FRED D.

You were referring, of course, to us Democrats who refused to listen to the American people, because your presumption was the American people was not for the proposition we were promoting.  There were two candidates for President who got major votes in this election. One was Hillary Clinton, who said: I want to keep the Affordable Care And one was Donald Trump, who said: I want to get rid of the Affordable Care Although, he has said then and now that he wants to have everybody covered at a cheaper price with assured benefits. As I said, we would support a bill like that.  Of those two candidates that were running, one got 65 million votes and one got 62 million votes. Now, the one who got 62 million votes won the election. Why? Because of the electoral college. He is the legitimate elected President of the United I do not question that at all. But it ought to give some degree of humility that he got 3 million less votes than the person that espoused policies other than those espoused by President It ought to give some pause to let the American people into the process and testify.  I will tell the gentleman that what the Republican Party is recommending in repeal of the ACA will have very substantial consequences. You may think they are positive, I may think they are negative, but I hope neither one of us think that that won't have very substantial consequences for our country.

I think the American people were at that exact same position.  You talk about consequences. The ACA has a tremendous amount of consequences on the American public, and, unfortunately, they haven't been positive. Some have, but the majority have not.

The gentleman talks about 6 years. Not once in those 6 years, not once, has the majority party offered a comprehensive replacement for the Affordable Care They have talked about it.  By the way, on the 26-year-olds and on the preexisting conditions, the repeal bills didn't say we were going to keep the preexisting conditions or the 26 age or the lifetime limits or the annual limits or the drug discounts for senior citizens. It didn't say any of that. It said repeal the  So the polling data today, Mr.Speaker, is that more people want to keep the ACA prior to the consideration and adoption of a replacement than want to repeal it. I agree with you, that is a change from 2010. And the reason it is a change is because they are now looking at it very carefully. They are figuring out what, in fact, it has done for them and their families and for their children who had preexisting conditions and for their access to affordable health care, and they are saying: We are taking a second look.  They do not now reflect that poll to which the gentleman referred that is now 7 years old and, very frankly, last year's poll. Now they look at it differently.  I yield to my friend.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, if I could just tell my friend, when I refer to a poll, I mean the main poll of election day. If I look at what happened on 2010 and I look at what took place in this last election, you are correct, one side campaigned on repealing and replacing This is only the third time since World War II that the American public entrusted that to a Republican Party who have a majority in the House, a majority in the Senate, and the  So, yes, that is the poll I was looking at; the same as what transpired in 2010. That was the cornerstone and the foundation of what people said in that last election.  We are moving forward on that our promise. We have been working on this for more than 6 years with hearings, townhalls, and listening. We are going through reconciliation, the regular order. So the committees will mark up, send it in to the Committee on Budget, where they will do a markup, and then it will come to the floor.  I thank the gentleman for his concern.

Now, Mr.Leader, two things. One is certainly less global and impactful,[[Page H1488]]but, nevertheless, important. I am sure the gentleman met with the Governors when they were in town, as I did. They met on a bipartisan basis. I met with a lot of the Republican Governors and Democratic Governors together.  They are very concerned, as you know, not only about the ACA--which we talked about, which they have great concerns of the impact on their States, Republicans and Democrats, of the repeal of the Medicaid expansion, in particular, the impact it will have on them and their people--but they also are very concerned about the Marketplace Fairness  That is simply, frankly, trying to protect small businesses so that they can compete, the local mom and pop store can compete with the online vendors so that everybody would have to pay the sales tax, whatever the State sales tax is.

Does the gentleman know whether or not that bill is going to be considered at any point in time in the near term?  I yield to my friend.  Mr.I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Yes, Mr.Speaker, we did meet with a bipartisan group of Governors, and that was one of the discussions as well. It is not scheduled at this time, but we will continue to work on that in committee.

449,topic-id,374,"Lastly, Mr.Speaker, I want to say to my friend, the majority leader, that I look forward to working with him. I see that he recently observed that the attorney general ought to recuse himself in dealing with issues of the relationship between the administration during the course of the campaign and Russia, which the intelligence community has said interfered in America's election.  All of us ought to be concerned about that--a foreign government interfering in our democracy; particularly, a government that is hostile to our interests; particularly, a government led by Mr.Putin, who has committed international crimes, who, contrary to international law, invaded Crimea, still holds Crimea inconsistent with international law, and has been sanctioned. Hopefully, those sanctions will stay in place.  I agree with the gentleman that, at the very least, the attorney general ought to recuse himself. I have asked him to step down.  But we need to have, Mr.Speaker, an independent bipartisan commission with subpoena power, similar to the 9/11 Commission, for the security of our country and, yes, for the confidence building for our President to see what, in fact, were the relationships between his campaign and Russia and to what extent Russia involved itself in trying to impact on the elections of the United  I don't have anything further to say. Unless the gentleman wants to say something, I will yield back.  I yield to my friend.  Mr.I thank the gentleman for yielding.  This is a matter for investigation by the House Intelligence For years, we have investigated Putin's hostile international actions.  Just so the gentleman does know, Mr.Speaker, this week, Chairman Nunes and Ranking Member Schiff approved the scope of their committee's inquiry into Russia's measures of targeting in the 2016 election. I support this bipartisan investigation. I have great faith that the committee will fully investigate all of the evidence and follow the facts wherever they lead.  I know the gentleman, Mr.Speaker, made comments in regards to the attorney general. Attorney General Sessions stated this morning that whenever it is appropriate, he will recuse himself. I agree with those remarks.  As far as the ongoing investigation into Russia, I would, again, direct my friend to the bipartisan effort that is underway in the House Intelligence                              {time}  1200  ",CREC-2017-03-02-pt1-PgH1484.txt,566,CALLING FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL COUNSEL,2017.0,2.0,March
450,topic-id,375,"I thank the majority leader for his comments.  Let me say that I was very disappointed to learn that Mr.Nunes, at the request of the administration, talked to members of the press before the investigations have occurred, before they have heard a single witness, to say that he really thought this was not a matter that really needed careful consideration. That is not a quote. I characterized what I read his comment to mean to the press.  In addition, I understand the Department of Homeland Security was also requested, and the FBI, to talk to the press to tamp down interest in those. The American people need to be very concerned about these issues. Every Member of this Congress, a separate and coequal branch of the Government of the United States, ought to be very concerned about that.  The Bible says that the truth will set us free. And the truth will give us confidence. And the truth should be known by the American people.  The problem I have with the Intelligence Committee is that the Intelligence Committee--most of the information they gather is not available to the public. I don't know what they will do moving forward.  But we found in the 9/11 Commission a perfect example of a commission equally divided with two extraordinarily respected co-chairs that got to the bottom and made significant recommendations, most of which--almost all of which--were adopted in a bipartisan fashion by this  So, Mr.Speaker, I would hope that we would pursue that not in lieu of the Intelligence Committee--not in lieu of the Intelligence Committee--but in addition to.  Benghazi, we had seven committees, and you thought on your side of the aisle that wasn't enough, so you spent some $4 million on an additional special committee to find exactly the same conclusion.  So, in this case I do not oppose the work of the Intelligence Committee, but I certainly believe the American people would expect and would want a similar bipartisan commission as they saw work on the 9/11 tragedy to give them the confidence that Russia is not in any way undermining the independence of our government or undermining the democracy that we hold so dear.

772,topic-id,1406,"Mr.Speaker, the Republicans released a bill last night. That bill deals with every American's welfare--every American's welfare--every child's welfare in this country. None of them were able to testify before the committee, before the committee marks it up on None of them were able to come to that committee and say how it will affect them or their families or their fellow citizens. None of them were able to testify as to the benefits of the Affordable Care Act for them, their families, their children, and their neighbors. None of them will have been able to read and digest the bill.  Mr.Speaker, last night, after locking it away in a basement for days, and just as reporters were leaving to go home, Republicans released the text of their legislation to repeal the Affordable Care The country has been waiting for 7 years for the Republican replacement, for the Republican alternative, for the Republicans to redeem their promise of a better plan, a better way to ensure the security of having health care that is affordable and available to each American and to their families and their children.  Republicans have been promising, since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, that they would repeal it entirely and enact something better. They don't repeal it entirely, and they don't offer something better, something that covers more Americans and lowers costs to consumers. For 7 years, they have said we have a better plan. Last night, they revealed the inaccuracy of that representation; the bait-and-switch, if you will, of that representation; the pretense to their conservatives who have voted some 65 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act that they were not going to offer a bill that did that, notwithstanding the fact that they said that is what they are going to do.  The legislation they introduced would repeal, of course, some parts of the Affordable Care Act and replace them with policies that will take health coverage away, take health care away from millions of Americans and make millions of others pay more for less.  President Trump, just the other day from that rostrum, promised the American people that the Republican plan would ``have insurance for everybody.'' That was not true. Neither the House Republicans nor the Senate Republicans nor President Trump have offered such a plan, and the plan that was revealed last night does not fulfill that representation.  Mr.Speaker, it should not surprise us, however, that our President says things that prove to be not accurate. He also said from that rostrum that the policies would be far less expensive and far better than they are now. This bill does not do that, and the President has offered no bill that does that.  This plan fails that representation miserably. It increases healthcare costs for middle class families in order to pay for tax breaks for the wealthiest, who don't need them to afford health care. We should not penalize people for becoming wealthy. We applaud their success. But we should not subsidize health care for those of us who can afford our health care while those who cannot are left to fend for themselves. In other words, the Republicans are once again saying you are on your own.  Their bill also raids the Medicare trust fund, threatening its long-term solvency. In fact, the affordable care added to the life expectancy of The bill that the Republicans have put forward imposes severe cuts to Medicaid as well. It forces States and healthcare providers to carry the burden of the uninsured while taking away funding for expanded  Their bill requires States to ration care by throwing those with preexisting conditions into ``sick pools,'' with higher premiums, higher deductibles, and waiting periods for coverage. And what services would be available under Medicaid?  Their plan replaces the individual responsibility requirement which, by the way, Mr.Speaker, as you may well know, was the proposal of The Heritage The Heritage Action for America, which is the political arm of the foundation, opposes the Republican bill. Not for the same reason I do, but because they believe it continues much of what ACA tried to do in protecting Americans in a plan that was initially proposed by The Heritage Foundation and adopted by Governor Romney in  Unbelievably, Mr.Speaker, Republicans won't even tell the American people how much this legislation will cost and what its impact will be on consumers' wallets and on our insurance markets. How do you do that? You have hearings, you listen to people, you listen to their experiences now, you listen to what their needs are, and you listen to those who have the greatest experience on their view of what the impact of this legislation will be. There have been no such hearings and none are planned.  Republicans know that millions of Americans will lose coverage under their legislation: those covered under Medicaid, the health insurance exchanges, and even those with employer-based insurance. That is why, Mr.Speaker, in my opinion, they are rushing to see this bill put in force before it is illuminated by the light of day and before the American people find out how they will be impacted.  Thankfully, Mr.Speaker, it will be difficult for House Republicans to enact their bill into law, not only because of the extreme opposition to those proposals by the American people, as we have seen in townhall meeting after townhall meeting after townhall meeting across this country, but also because the House and Senate Republicans are already rejecting it. It is not certain that House Republicans can even reach a majority in this House on their legislation.  The head of the Republican Study Committee, the largest group of Republicans, has said this bill is not acceptable. The gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.Meadows), the head of the Freedom Caucus, has said this bill does not repeal the Affordable Care Act, which is his objective and the objective of the Freedom Senator Cruz has said that as well. Senator Paul has said that as well. Senator Lee has said that as well.  One thing is clear, however, Mr.Speaker, House Republicans are going to have to find the votes on their own to dismantle the protections incorporated in the Affordable Care Act that the American people now have.  Is the Affordable Care Act perfect? It is not. Should we have spent the last 6[[Page H1544]]years trying to make it work as well as it possibly can? Yes, we should have. Were we able to do that? The only alternative the Republican Party offered to the American people and to this House was to repeal. Not to replace, not to repair, not to fix, not to make sure it was more affordable and more available to the American people so that we would be a healthier and stronger nation. Their only option was to repeal.                              {time}  1245  Mr.Speaker, I urge Republican leaders to withdraw this bill. Let us work together to ensure what almost every Member says they want, and that is a healthcare program in America that is affordable by all, available to all, and enjoyed by all. That is what President Trump said at that rostrum just days ago.  This bill that the Republicans are going to mark up on Wednesday does not do what they say or what President Trump said. The American people will oppose it, and we will reflect their opposition in this But we are available to our Republican colleagues in good faith to work together to ensure that what the President said--available to all, at a lower price, with everybody having access--we will support that bill, if it exists, and we will work with our Republican colleagues to pass it and give that protection and security to the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I note that there have not been many Republicans to speak this morning. I understand that one Republican spoke about this bill. I am amazed if they think this is a better way. I am amazed if they think this will do a better job than the Affordable Care I am amazed if they think they are going to bring costs down and care up, and that we don't have a lot of Republicans, Mr.Speaker, coming to this floor and claiming victory. They are not here because they can't claim that victory.  Let's reject this bill, Mr.Let's work together. We can do better. The American people expect us to do better.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgH1543-2.txt,566,SEARCHING FOR AND CUTTING REGULATIONS THAT ARE UNNECESSARILY BURDENSOME,2017.0,7.0,March

224,topic-id,4255,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague from Maryland for your tremendous work already in these 7 weeks and schooling us all on the Constitution and making sure that we continue to recognize the tremendous responsibility that we have here in this body to protect that Constitution and everything that it stands for.  Last night's State of the Union Address deserves a response for lots of reasons and, unfortunately, none of them are good.  Last night, we heard from this President a toned-down version of his campaign speeches. The speech was well delivered. He stuck to his script. It may be the first major address that he has conducted where he did stick to the script. He had a lot of diligence in that. And he even started with some very necessary recognition of the anti-Semitic acts that have been taking place across the country, and he denounced those acts.  He denounced the killing of an Indian American in I, too, am Indian American, and I know that that killing hit home hard for many of us across the country who wonder if we, too, are going to be the targets of hate. The President did say that he denounces hate, that there is no place in this Nation for hate, and that, in fact, we need to do a lot of work to make sure that we preserve this place, this country as a country that is safe for everybody.  Unfortunately, it took a while to get there, and his words belie the rhetoric that he has put out there in the past. In fact, I think that this President has not spoken out against the kind of hate and, in fact, has sometimes said things that encourage his followers to act in ways that simply do not meet the rhetoric that he had yesterday.  The first place that that was so obvious to me was in the space of immigration. Now, I have been an advocate on immigration for many, many years. I have worked across the aisle with friends and colleagues in the U.Senate, in the U.House of At that time, I was an advocate. But together, we understood the tremendous contributions of immigrants to this country, and we understood that unless you were Native American, that, willing or unwilling, everybody in this country has been an immigrant or a descendant of immigrants.  And so to come into the Chamber and yet again hear the fear-mongering and the characterization of immigrants, undocumented immigrants, as this enormous swath of people who simply all they do is commit crimes is simply a travesty and a disservice to the millions of people across this country who work every day to pick our vegetables, clean our homes, serve us in so many different capacities, as well as to all of those who have come through the legal immigration system, but with many challenges.  You know, it took me 18 years to get my citizenship. I went through visa after visa after visa. I understand the barriers. But for this President to continue to focus on a stereotype of undocumented immigrants as criminals is simply disingenuous, unfair, and, frankly, un- DREAMers and refugees and immigrants and others who have helped build this country were the guests of many of us Democrats in the We each brought incredible men and women to join us for the State of the Union; people who we feel demonstrate the resilience and the strength and the courage of immigrants across this country.  I was proud to be joined by an amazing woman, a good friend named Aneelah Afzali, who is the executive director of the American Muslim Empowerment Network, an initiative of the Muslim Association of Puget Aneelah is a Harvard-trained lawyer. She is an incredible snowboarder. She is a 12th Man She loves the Seahawks, and she is a strong advocate for a community that has been, frankly, terrorized since the passing of the President's Muslim ban. Now, of course, courts have said that that ban is unconstitutional.  The President seems to be accepting that it is unconstitutional, but we also know that he has reshaped that ban to continue to target people simply for the country from which they come, simply for the region that they come from.  The reason we invited all of those guests to be here in the Chamber with us is because we wanted to send a message to this President and to our country that we are strong as a country because of our diversity, that we are better for the perspectives and the values that people bring, and regardless of what religion you are, we all, as the President said yesterday, do bleed the same blood, and we all believe in the promise of the United States of  We wanted the President to understand and our colleagues in this body to understand, when we pass laws, when we approve of executive orders, to target people simply based on religion or place of origin, that we are doing a tremendous disservice to this country and we might be violating constitutional laws in some of these cases, but that America deserves better in terms of how we position what immigrants have done for this country.  Now, the President last night kept talking about these heinous crimes that immigrants commit. In fact, he had some people here in the Chamber, his guests, who were tragically affected by the murder of individuals in their families who were killed because of a single, undocumented immigrant. A heinous crime committed by an undocumented immigrant is simply not representative of the millions of law-abiding immigrants across our country.  This is a continuation of what the President did during the campaign: fear-mongering and otherizing people. The reality is that, just like Dylann Roof's horrific murders in South Carolina cannot be representative of all Caucasian Americans, there is no way that one undocumented immigrant or even a couple of undocumented immigrants can be representative of 11 million who have served this country, helped build our economy, helped drive our industries, and who contribute so much to our country every single day.  The President also seemed to paint this picture of immigrants as driving up crime, that when you have undocumented immigrants, then you have higher crime. In fact, the statistics show that immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than native-born Americans and that our sanctuary cities, the cities around the country that have policies that are friendly to immigrant communities, including undocumented immigrants, that those actually are safer as cities than comparable cities that are not sanctuary cities.  That was a report that came out, and it is an important one for people to understand. Why? Because, when you have trust and when you understand that the fix that we need is for a system that is broken, an immigration system that has been broken for a very long time, the way to address these issues is not to criminalize and otherize and fearmonger about people who are trying to help our country, but to actually get to work on a real fix for our immigration system.  I was initially pleased that the President talked about fixing a broken immigration system, but then he said we are going to look at a merit-based system. Now, I would not have been able to come to this country under a merit-based system because I came here by myself when I was 16 years old. My parents sent me over here. They had very little money in their bank account. They used their $5,000 to send me by myself because they felt like this was the place I was going to get the best education.[[Page H1459]]  And if you look at a merit-based system, what you do is you exclude the millions of people who have actually come to the United States seeking refuge from famine, from devastation, from drought, from persecution. You exclude all of those people. You also exclude all of the families who are trying to reunite with their loved ones when they come here and they bring their spouse or they bring their parent or their child. That whole system of family-based immigration that the United States has built so much of our country around, that, too, would be excluded.  Unfortunately, this President is still not at a place where he has said and embraced the idea of comprehensive immigration reform, an immigration reform that has been, until this point, traditionally bipartisan--68 bipartisan votes in the U.Senate in 2013 for a comprehensive immigration bill that would have brought $1.5 trillion into our economy over the next 10 years by legalizing and providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants but, perhaps equally importantly, would have provided the dignity and respect to undocumented immigrants in a very different way than what the President spoke about last night.  My colleague Mr.Raskin talked a little bit about health care and the Affordable Care Act, and during his speech, the President, unfortunately, again renewed the theme that the Affordable Care Act has been a disaster. He talked about his ideas for health care, and he said some things that maybe all of us could agree with.  He said that we deserve health care that lowers costs for people. Yes, I would like that. He said that we deserve health care that increases quality of care--absolutely.  But unfortunately, neither the President nor Republicans in this Chamber have offered us a replacement plan. So to repeal the Affordable Care Act which has provided so much benefit to people--more than 20 million Americans gained health care through the Affordable Care But if Republicans succeed in repealing it, 30 million people will lose it.  The 150 million Americans with preexisting conditions will see their protections stripped away, leaving them vulnerable to a lack of coverage. You cannot protect the most expensive and the most valuable provisions of the Affordable Care Act if you do not continue to keep the pool large enough, full of healthy people, so that those provisions actually become affordable. And you need to ensure that the pool is large enough through the individual mandate.  So we have not seen a plan that improves health care, and it is important that we recognize we have improvements to make. There are too many Americans across the country that still, today, don't have access to health care in the way that we would like them to. But the solution for that is a Medicare-for-all plan, a public plan that allows us to take profits out of the business of health care. It should not be a business. It should be about making people better. It should be about making people well and not about making corporations rich. That, I think, is a very important piece.  The President said that he would support a plan that would actually provide us with the ability to negotiate for prescription drugs for That would bring down the cost for those prescription drugs. I am all in for that plan, and that is why I hope the President supports the bill that was introduced.  Senator Cantwell introduced a bill yesterday that would allow the United States to import more affordable drugs from Canada while also allowing Medicaid to negotiate drug prices directly, and that would lower the costs for our seniors and for others who rely on those lifelong medications.  I am so proud to have sponsored that same bill in the That is the solution that we need to move to is lowering the costs of prescription drugs, lowering the cost of health care, increasing the quality of the care that we provide.  Let's talk about the environment for a minute because the President mentioned yesterday that he cares about clean water and clean air, but at the same time, the President has proposed in reports that have been published in the news that he intends to cut the Environmental Protection Agency by 25 percent, the budget of the Environmental Protection  Scott Pruitt, our new Secretary of the EPA, has talked about putting in place plans to repeal progress on climate change. The President also signed a rule to essentially roll back progress on the Clean Water Act, and we are talking about cutting agencies and staff of the EPA across the country.  The reality is that we need to be thinking about how we preserve our planet for the next generation. I have got a 20-year-old son and he says to me: Mom, this is one of the most important things you can do is preserve the planet for me and for my kids. That is what we need to do is look at the science of climate change, look at the ways in which we can strengthen our ability to protect the environment, instead of what this President has said he will do, which is to repeal so many of the rules that the Obama administration put in place to make sure that we check the notion that corporations should be able to mine our land, literally and figuratively, for profit while destroying it for the future.  Budget and taxes, this was a really interesting one. One of the most common refrains of President Trump's campaign was that he was going to drain the swamp, and last night he talked about that. He said he promised he would do it, and he is now draining the swamp. He has put a ban on lobbyists.  Unfortunately, what he didn't talk about is that, even with the ban on lobbyists, it is as if he is draining that swamp and then pumping it into another spot, which happens to be his Cabinet, that is filled with people who represent Goldman Sachs ties, the CEO of ExxonMobil, plenty of other elites who--we don't begrudge people to make some money, but these are people who have made profit off of a vast majority of Americans losing their income.                              {time}  2015  These are people, frankly, who lobbied the United States Government so that those corporations could do better and so that they, as CEOs, could do better while caring not at all for the broad interests of people across this country.  Based on these picks, it is clear that the President's priority is for the wealthiest in our country and not, as he promised over and over again, for the working people in our country.  Now, I would love to be proven wrong on this. But unfortunately, all of the tax plans, all of the proposals that we have seen so far, or, at least, the blueprints that we have seen so far would not do as he said last night. Last night, he said he wants to provide a huge tax cut or tax relief for middle class families. We would love to see that. Unfortunately, the plan looks, in fact, like it is going to provide relief to the top tier of income earners in this country and not to the middle class.  He has talked about a $54 billion cut in domestic spending, and I wanted to have people understand exactly what $54 billion amounts to because most of us don't really know. We can't really imagine that because we don't have $54 billion lying around.  If we added up the entire budget for the Environmental Protection Agency, the entire budget of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the entire budget for the National Park Service--and I should give you these numbers because they are interesting: $8 billion for the EPA, $5.85 billion for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, $3.1 billion for the National Park Service, $2.9 billion for the Department of Energy efficiency and renewable energy program, $1.6 billion for the Fish and Wildlife Service, and $1.2 billion for the U.Geological Service--you still don't get to that $54 billion. There are a whole bunch of others that are in that list. You still don't get to $54 billion, even if you remove all of those agencies.  So the work that we have to do is really to have people understand that if we are going to cut nondefense discretionary spending by the amount that he is talking about increasing our defense budget by, our military spending by, then you are going to have to cut into the very programs that help middle class families to continue their lives and have dignity, respect, pull themselves up and know that they are[[Page H1460]]going to have food on the table and a roof over their head and be able to send their kids to college and be able to retire in security. All of these programs help people to do that, to have opportunity in this country, which is why America is such a great country because we provide that kind of opportunity. But if we decimate our nondefense discretionary spending by cutting it by $54 billion, then we are taking away that opportunity from millions and millions of families. This is not how we build up our communities.  Our budget is a demonstration of our values as a country. We have to understand that this is a time of tremendous insecurity for Americans across our country. Wealth inequality is at the highest level that it has been in a very long time, and people do not see the opportunity for themselves.  They elected this President, in part, because of the promises that he made; and so if he is going to follow through, that would mean protecting those social safety net programs. It would mean investing in the environment for the future. It would mean expanding Social Security and It would mean saying that the answer to health care is actually a Medicare-for-all program, a way to make sure that every American does not have to be one healthcare crisis away from bankruptcy.  The President also talked about education last night, and he said it is the civil rights issue of our time. I couldn't agree with him more, but I do not understand how you go from that place to then saying that the answer to that is school choice.  Ninety percent of the kids in this country go through the public education system. That is what my son went through. We need to make sure that we preserve the ability for people in this country to send their kids to good public schools.  We should be investing in our public schools, investing in our teachers, making sure that we provide the tools and the resources to teachers so that in our public schools--the place where our kids are going to spend the most amount of their days--that they are getting the kind of education that allows them to earn a future, contribute back to the country, be trained for all the jobs that we need to fill right here in the United States of  We should be investing in preapprenticeship programs. We should be investing in debt-free college for all of our young people because it is ridiculous that a young person has to choose between being $45,000 in debt or not going to college, not seeking a higher education.  Higher education is what gave me everything that I have today. It was my parents' belief in me and my future and the $5,000 that they had in the bank that they used to send me here so that I could get a college degree. I was 16 years old, and now I have the tremendous honor of standing in this Chamber, the U.House of Representatives, in the greatest country in the world, going from being an immigrant to being a United States  I want every American--no matter what color you are, no matter whether you are rural or urban, no matter whether you have money or don't have money--I want you to have a great public education that you can go to. That is choice. That is real choice.  Choice is not privatizing our public education system, and then saying, hey, 10 percent of the people get to go to that, and then everybody else is going to go to schools that don't give them that opportunity.  Real choice is about having an investment in our public education system as the doorway, the gateway to a future of opportunity.  Mr.Speaker, the most important thing I think is that last night's address was a softer tone. It was a disciplined speech, and there were some good statements.  Unfortunately, the rhetoric of last night doesn't match the actions. It doesn't match the executive actions of the last 7 weeks that have thrown this country into chaos on immigration. It doesn't match the fact that we still don't have a replacement plan that will make things better for health care, not increase payments, not give giveaways to insurance companies, not decrease subsidies so that health care can be affordable.  His speech last night did not reflect specifics around how he is going to accomplish some of the good things that he said he was going to do. And it continued to put fear into people's hearts and minds about who our neighbors are, about the immigrants across this country who have done so much to build and contribute.  He is the President of the United He has a remarkable microphone. He talked about unity last night. But unity means being a President for everybody, and it means not creating stories that somehow draw pictures of an immigrant community that is full of crime, inner cities that are full of crime. That is not the inner cities that I know. If he is talking about inner cities in Chicago and other places, we should be talking about how to fix crime, but not calling everybody who lives there criminals.  We have got to understand that our country deserves a body in this Chamber, in this United States Congress that really preserves the opportunity, the dreams, and the ability for everybody in our country to know that they have got a fair shot. That is what America has been for so long for so many people across the world.  When he talks about improving the vetting of refugees to this country, let me tell you, I know a lot about this issue. There are 20 steps you have to go through if you want to be vetted into this country as a refugee. All of our multiple intelligence agencies, multiple agencies in other countries, the United Nations and others are involved in that vetting process. Our own intelligence agencies vet people.  Out of the seven countries that he put on the list for the Muslim ban, the 9/11 hijackers didn't come from any of those countries. They came from another country that is not on that list: Saudi  So if we are really going to think about how we improve our security in this country, we should be thinking about economic security that gives people the opportunity that they need in this country, the ability to fill our jobs with well-trained folks from this country, and then we continue to allow immigrants to come in as we need them. But don't allow them to come in because we are not training enough people and we are not investing in people right here in this country and then criticize those immigrants for taking these jobs.  Let's raise our wages. Let's invest in apprenticeships. That is good in rural areas, and that is good in urban areas. Let's invest in our community and technical colleges. Let's provide opportunity for people who are ready to take that opportunity.  Let's be compassionate. It is Ash Wednesday today. I am not an observing Catholic, but I think today--because I went to a Jesuit university--and I think today of what we were taught in that university about compassion.  I think it is time for us to recognize that true greatness for our country doesn't come from fear mongering. It doesn't come from otherizing. You can tap into that. You can mobilize people around that. You can enrage people around that.  Ultimately, true greatness and the greatness of this country has always come from our ability to have a vision of opportunity for everybody and to actually work to perfect this Union, to actually work to make democracy real, to actually work to engage people in a vision that says we are all better off when we are all better off. That means that my boat rising lifts your boat rising. It is not about fighting over the spoils that are too small for us anyway. It is not about whose pie we are eating.  It is about having more pie for everybody and ultimately opportunity, education, jobs, higher wages, health care, paid family leave, the ability for people to live with dignity and respect, racial justice, all of the fights that this country has been having for a very long time. Some we have won, and some we have won a little bit on, and some we have won a lot on. We still have a ways to go.  What I hope we do, as we think about the state of the Union of this country, is understand that our state of the Union is strong when our communities are strong. Our state of the Union is strong when we invest in our future.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.[[Page H1461]]  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Smucker).

409,topic-id,796,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  Simply put, Mr.Speaker, this amendment restricts the President from making public statements to promote his own business interests in the same way that the bill restricts statements by agencies on pending rules. If we intend to hold agencies accountable for their statements, we should certainly be willing to hold the President of the United States to those same standards. Donald Trump's enormous web of business interests and conflicts of interest make it clear that it is necessary to explicitly expand this restriction to the  It is deeply disturbing, Mr.Speaker, that the President has refused to release his tax returns or create a blind trust for the proceeds of his assets. Numerous U.Presidents have placed their financial holdings into a blind trust that is managed by a trustee without any input from the This allows for the President to minimize any conflicts of interest and any suggestion that the Presidency of the United States is being used for his own personal profits.  This President, however, has avoided those calls for him to sell his assets or place them into a blind trust. Instead, documents obtained through public records requests show that President Trump has moved the assets over, just in name, to his son and a longtime employee, but that Trump himself, the President of the United States, is the sole beneficiary of all of those trusts.  In other words, there is no wall erected between his businesses and his Presidency, and anyone who wants to buy influence can simply do so openly. His entire Presidency can be seen as a promotion of his business interests and be used by domestic and foreign governments to curry favor and produce benefit to his personal empire.  Trump Tower in D.is one example of this. The building, which is leased to him by the Federal Government, stipulates in its lease that ``any elected official of the Government of the United States'' may not derive any benefit from that agreement. At 12:01 p.m. on Inauguration Day, Trump was in violation of this clause. That lease should be terminated effective immediately.  Just last week, the Kuwaiti Embassy held its annual event to celebrate the country's national day at the President's D.hotel. The event was initially scheduled to take place at the Four Seasons, and, in fact, a ``save the date'' went out with the Four Seasons location. But Kuwait canceled that reservation just a few days after the election, and moved the event to the President's hotel after that happened.  These are not isolated instances. They constitute a pattern of conflicts of interest every time a foreign government holds a reception or rents a room at a Trump property, a problem so important to this country that it was put into the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution of the United States of  The American people should also be deeply concerned about conflicts of interest at the President's Mar-a-Lago resort. On January 1, 2017, just 2 months after the election of Donald Trump, the exclusive resort doubled its membership initiation fee from $100,000 to $200,000. When Trump took Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe there, it created even more free publicity for the resort as several social media posts were made throughout the weekend.  Conducting government affairs in public settings not only has serious national security concerns, but indicates that anyone who wants to be a member of the club will have access to the President of the United States, and the President will personally profit off of their membership.  Mr.Speaker, the American people have a right to know what the entire web of conflicts of interest are, but we have yet to get this information because we have not received--we have yet to get any information from this President, his tax returns, or any of the documents that help us to ensure that he is complying with the Constitution of the United States of America, that document that he swore to uphold and protect, so that we can make sure that he is not using the highest office of this land to profit.                              {time}  1100  The American people have the right to demand that this President put their interests first rather than his own business interests.  I urge all of my colleagues to pass this motion to recommitment and demand that we uphold our Constitution, protect this democracy and the duty of this President to work not for the business interests, but for we the people.

10,topic-id,593,"Mr.Speaker, we have a reality show host masquerading as President of the United States of America who came to this Chamber yesterday in a Hollywood-style production and pretended to act  But the question that we confront is one that Richard Nixon actually first raised, in November of 1973, when he said that the American people deserve to know whether or not the President is a crook. That was an observation that Richard Nixon made in the context of the Watergate scandal which began as a nickel-and-dime break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the summer of 1972, and, obviously, concluded with impeachment proceedings and the ultimate resignation of a President in disgrace.  Nixon made the observation that the American people deserve to know whether or not the President is a crook, and many people across the country are raising a similar question because 17 different intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russians, at the explicit direction of Vladimir Putin, interfered in our election for the purpose of helping Donald Yet, it is hard to get an independent investigation going in this place because my friends on the other side of the aisle continue to put party ahead of the country.  But that is just the beginning. We know that, as early as December of 2015, at least four different cronies of Donald Trump were in regular communication with Russian intelligence agents at the same time these individuals were hacking into the DNC, the DCCC, and the Clinton campaign, interfering with our democracy. These individuals were Michael Flynn, who came to become Trump's first national security adviser; Carter Page, who was his former foreign policy adviser; Paul Manafort, who was the chairman of the Trump campaign; and Roger Stone, a longtime affiliate.  If they were having these conversations at this time, we know they probably weren't talking about Russian vodka. What were they talking about? The American people deserve to know.  We also are aware that Michael Flynn had an illegal conversation, in December of 2016, with the Russian Ambassador where he discussed sanctions that were imposed on Russia because of their hacking. He then apparently lied about this conversation to the Vice President who then went out and misrepresented facts to the American people, and then Michael Flynn resigned in disgrace. But we still can't get an independent, nonpartisan investigation in this place.  But that is not all. We know that Donald Trump has not been bashful when going after our allies like Mexico or Australia or NATO or the European Union or, this past weekend, He is not bashful about being critical, but he can't say a negative word about Vladimir Putin, a brutal dictator. It appears that this President is more determined to make the Kremlin great again.  But that is not all. He refuses to release his taxes despite promising the American people that he was going to do so prior to November of last year. What exactly is he hiding in these tax documents? Yet, we still can't get an independent investigation.  We also know that the White House Chief of Staff engaged in potentially unlawful conversations with the FBI, perhaps trying to get them to obstruct justice in the public sphere in the midst of an ongoing investigation.  All we are saying is connect the dots. This should not be a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. The American people deserve to know whether or not the President is a crook.

608,topic-id,953,"Mr.President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to support H.37, a resolution disapproving of the Federal Acquisition Regulation issued by the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space  As is the case in so many of these rules and regulations, it has a really nice name. It sounds really good--the fair pay and safe workplaces rule--but the bottom line is, because of the substance of this rule, it has become commonly known as ``the blacklisting rule.'' Had it been up to me, I would have called it ``the blackmailing rule.'' Let me explain why.  It requires contractors and subcontractors submitting bids on Federal Government contracts to disclose any proven or alleged violations within the last 3 years of 14 different labor laws, plus ``equivalent State laws.''  Now, that may sound reasonable, but it is not. And it is entirely unnecessary. Any competent purchasing manager--again, I come from the private sector, and there are a lot of competent purchasing managers--could readily obtain the information required by this regulation. And, of course, any competent purchasing manager should also always be evaluating the qualifications, integrity, and the past performance record of any kind of potential suppliers.  This rule also has the very real potential of subjecting perfectly innocent contractors to blackmail and extortion tactics during union contract negotiations.  In case anyone thinks I am overstating this threat, listen carefully to the following quote from one union describing an ``ideal message'' their union president should convey to a general manager of a business negotiating a union contract:       Putting it plainly: unless you settle this strike within      the next few days, and the union withdraws its charges--  Those would be those allegations; unless the union withdraws those charges--     you are likely to be marked as a ``repeat labor law      offender,'' one of the highest categories of wrongdoing under      the President's Check this out with your hotshot legal      team.  This union message goes on:       Counting all of its divisions, this corporation has federal      contracts in the hundreds of millions. Do you really want to      jeopardize this pot of gold to save a few hundred thousand      dollars to the union contract?  This is the kind of negotiating tactic that illustrates exactly how this regulation would be used as a form of federally sanctioned blackmail. There would be no due process for contractors wrongly accused. There would be no way for them to defend themselves or avoid being blacklisted.  As if the blackmail potential of the rule isn't bad enough, the Obama administration admitted that the final rule would cost at least $398 million to comply with every single year. And except for the benefit that extortion leverage provides to unions, I can think of no financial benefit to taxpayers or our economy--and neither could the Obama administration, as they were unable to quantify any financial benefit for this rule in their regulatory filings.  In addition to the $398 million annual regulatory cost, the agencies themselves detailed the following regulatory burdens:  The rule will affect over 24,000 contractors. Industry estimates are even higher.  The rule imposes costly reporting requirements on small businesses that many simply cannot bear.  And it also reduces the availability and increases the price of much needed supplies and services, including to our military.  Others have pointed out even more problems with the rule. For example, it does not define what the ``equivalent State laws'' are that have been included in the disclosure requirement. Also, the definition of a violation that is reportable is incredibly broad. It is not limited to government contracts and includes pending and other nonfinal disputes--in other words, mere allegations of wrongdoing.  This, in particular, is a slippery slope. For example, in fiscal year 2016, the National Labor Relations Board received over 21,000 unfair labor practice charges, but more than half of those were withdrawn or dismissed, and less than 6 percent resulted in a formal complaint by the Also in fiscal year 2016, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission received over 91,000 complaints but issued a ``determination of reasonable cause'' in only 3,113--about 3.4 percent of those--and filed enforcement suits in only 114--about 0.1 percent of the 91,000 complaints that were filed.  Various studies report that it costs $2 trillion per year to comply with Federal Government regulations. That is $14,800 per family per year. Of course, no one writes a check for $14,800. Instead, those costs are realized in reduced opportunities, higher prices to consumers, and stagnated wages and benefits for hard-working  Economic growth is the primary component of a solution for many of our country's problems, yet Washington continues to stifle growth by adding layer upon layer of regulation. The blacklisting rule is just one harmful example.  Fortunately, last October, the U.District Court for the Eastern District of Texas issued a nationwide preliminary injunction the day before this rule was set to go into effect. The judge issuing the order noted there was merit to the claims that this rule violates statute, exceeds Executive authority, and is unconstitutional. The court found that letting this rule go into effect would cause ``irreparable harm.'' But the case is still pending. Until we act to decisively repeal this rule, a significant burden hangs over our country's contractors and suppliers.  Through the use of the Congressional Review Act, we have the opportunity to reduce that regulatory burden and repair a small portion of the damage done by President Obama's regulatory overreach.  We owe it to the American people and American businesses to start providing them with regulatory relief.  I urge my colleagues to vote yes to disapprove and repeal this very harmful, very costly, and completely unnecessary rule.  With that, I yield the floor.

870,topic-id,2082,"Mr.Speaker, President Trump is a master at diverting attention, even the media's. His diversions are a perfect foil from the constitutional questions that his and his family's behavior have raised since he took the oath of office.  With hotels and property developments all over America and the world, the Trump empire is dramatically expanding its domestic business, raising vital questions as to the Trumps' profiting from public service, including from foreign entanglements that violate the  Outlined in Article II of the Constitution, the clause prohibits the President from receiving, other than his salary, any compensation, gift, or other form of profit from the United States, a State government, or their instrumentalities.  Congress reserves its ability to consent to foreign emoluments but not to domestic emoluments. Our Founding Fathers were clear--no exceptions.  It has been heavily reported in the papers that the Trump sons have now signed at least 17 new letters of intent with potential developers, even listing specific cities. They don't have to tell their father about all this. The newspapers cover it in abundance. And the American people should never have to wonder whose interests the President serves.  Today those doubts abound. America, the scales of justice need tending.                [From The Washington Post, 4, 2017]  Trump Sons, Planning Expansion of Family Business, Look to Leverage                           Campaign Experience      (By Jonathan O'Connell, David Fahrenthold and Matea Gold)       New York.--Donald Trump's adult sons, who are overseeing a      nationwide expansion of the family business during their      father's presidency, are envisioning ways that their      experiences from the campaign trail can help them establish a      footing in dozens of new markets.       The idea is to move beyond a focus on luxury hotels in big      metropolises and build boutique properties in a broader mix      of cities, including some the Trump brothers came to know      well during more than a year of intensive travel, fundraising      and grass-roots networking on the road to The White       ``I got to see a lot of those markets on the campaign,''      Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son, told The      Washington Post in a recent interview from his office on the      25th floor of Trump ``I think I've probably been in      all of them over the last 18 months.''       The initial plan is tied to the Trumps' previously      announced new chain, Scion, which is being designed as a      less-corporate feeling brand of high-end hotels with a more      affordable per-room price point than the Trumps' five-star      properties.       As with many existing Trump-branded property deals, the      developers would own the hotels while the Trumps would be      paid licensing and management fees.       The company says it has signed at least 17 letters of      intent with potential developers. It is targeting an array of      cities such as Austin, Dallas, Louis, Nashville and      Seattle--and Trump said the campaign proved useful in      forging relationships with potential new connections.       ``I met people along the way that would be awesome      partners,'' he said.       The expansion plan illustrates how President Trump's      political rise has the potential to affect his business even      as he and his sons promise to adhere to a strict ethical      boundary between the company's moves and the Trump      administration. And it shows the inherent challenge in      separating the family's political work from its corporate      interests, with upsides and potential problems.       Extending the Trump business into a greater cluster of      American cities could bring political benefits for a      president who has vowed to bring jobs and economic prosperity      to struggling communities. But it also comes as Trump has      faced criticism from Democrats and ethics officials for his      decision to retain his ownership stake in the company, a      decision that means he stands to personally benefit from its      growth.       Building new hotels, for example, could create issues--tax      disputes, allegations of labor violations or environmental      violations--that require federal departments to consider      cases that could directly impact the president's finances.      And while the Trumps have vowed to sign no new foreign deals,      pursuing a raft of new domestic contracts from coast to coast      means the Trumps are likely to engage in negotiations with      private developers, banks and investors who see additional      benefits in doing business with the president's company.       ``It's just going to add fuel to the fire that is already      burning . . . with him having still a foot in both the      boardroom and one in the Oval Office,'' said Scott Amey, the      general counsel of the nonpartisan watchdog group Project on      Government       The White House did not respond to a request for comment.      The president in January added a team of ethics lawyers to      the White[[Page H1576]]     House Counsel's Office, while the company hired a longtime      Republican attorney tasked with ensuring the Trump      Organization minimizes conflicts of interest.       In interviews, the Trump sons waved off the idea that their      plans created any potential ethical problems.       ``There are lines that we would never cross, and that's      mixing business with anything government,'' Eric Trump said.       Donald Trump said that since the inauguration, he has      spoken with his father twice on the phone and once in      person--when he and his brother attended the announcement of      their father's Supreme Court nominee, Neil Eric      Trump said he may ask his father how things are in the White      House but would never discuss government or business affairs.       ``Will we ever talk about tax policy? Will I ever ask for      anything that could otherwise benefit the business?      Absolutely, emphatically not,'' Eric Trump said. ``He has no      need to know what we're doing, and I certainly don't need to      know what they're doing, and I don't want to.''       The Trumps' point man on the expansion is Eric Danziger, an      experienced executive who was hired in 2015 after previously      overseeing expansions at Carlson Hotels Worldwide, Starwood      Hotels and the former Wyndham       One of the first Scion projects is slated to open in      Dallas, where a Turkish-born developer aims to open a sleek      glass six-story hotel as part of a $50 million mixed-use      downtown development. The Austin, Cincinnati, Denver,      Detroit, Nashville, Seattle and Louis areas are also      possible targets, according to reports by Bloomberg News and      business trade publications.       The Trumps declined to say what other cities they were      exploring for projects but said they were actively seeking      contracts in many places. Danziger, speaking last month to      Skift, an industry publication, called Scion a ``four-star      lifestyle brand'' with wide geographic appeal.       ``That kind of brand can be in every city--tertiary,      secondary,'' he said. ``So, how many is that? The opportunity      is for hundreds.''       Because of the prohibition on foreign deals, Danziger said      the company is ``going to have full focus--instead of some      focus--on growth domestically of both Trump and Scion.''       The expansion will not be easy, according to analysts. The      Trumps will be entering a crowded marketplace of new hotel      lines from Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt designed to appeal to a      broad cross-section of customers, said Michael Bellisario,      a senior research analyst with the firm Robert Baird &       ``There are so many more competitors out there today,''      Bellisario said.       For the Trumps to distinguish their projects from their      competitors, they will need to be choosy about locations,      Bellisario said. ``You've got to be on the right street comer      in the right market. You can't open these hotels in Topeka,      Kansas,'' he said. ``So when you think about that, how big      can the new line get?''       The plan is a big test for the younger       Just as Donald Trump stepped out from his father's shadow      in the 1970s to build the family real estate business into      today's worldwide collection of golf courses, hotels, condo      towers, branded merchandise and other commercial holdings,      now Donald Trump Jr., 39, and Eric Trump, 33, have a      chance to make their mark.       Along with their sister, Ivanka, who departed the company      when their father entered office, the brothers have long      served as executive vice presidents.       Before their father ran for president, the three siblings      helped expand the firm from focusing on New York to including      the management of luxury hotels in top U.cities and seven      countries, plus more than a dozen golf courses.       The fruits of that work are still coming, as last month the      company opened a new golf club in Dubai and, last week held a      grand opening for a new hotel-condominium tower in Vancouver,      B.      A major transition for the sons is taking over a company in      which the force behind every Trump company offering--whether      it was selling hotel rooms, office buildings, golf outings,      ties or raw steaks--was Donald Trump himself.       In interviews, Trump and Eric Trump said they consider      themselves protectors of the Trump brand, an effort they said      is sometimes misunderstood. Critics viewed the announcement      of Scion during the campaign as a move away from the Trump      name. The family's intent was the opposite; since they view      the name Trump has a standard for luxury that ought to be      insulated, they will use other brands for less pricey      products.       ``We would never want to dilute the real estate brand by      going into tertiary markets that can't sustain the [luxury]      properties as we build them,'' Eric Trump said, ``A lot of      hotel companies have gotten this wrong.''       Both sons worked for their father starting at young ages,      doing landscaping and other labor on his projects.       A University of Pennsylvania graduate, Trump Jr.'s first      assignment at the company was to work with executives at New      York City real estate projects.       Eric Trump joined after graduating from Georgetown in 2006.      He has overseen the Trump Winery near Charlottesville and      worked on the Trump hotel in Las Vegas, where he developed a      reputation as a hands-on executive.       ``If there's a property tax issue or any litigation, he      flies into Las Vegas and takes care of it,'' said Phil      Ruffin, a casino mogul who is the Trumps' partner in the Las      Vegas project. ``He hires the lawyer. If there are any      capital improvements, he approves them. He is very energetic      like his father--he will just work night and day.''       With their father in charge, there was an informal division      of labor among his three eldest children, governing which      projects each swooped in to help.       Ivanka Trump created her own brands of shoes, jewelry,      handbags and coats. She took the lead on some of the Trump      Organization's mast prominent recent projects, such as the      $212 million D.hotel, which had its soft opening in            ``I'm probably the most obviously like [Trump Sr.],''      Ivanka Trump said in a 2011 company video titled ``Trump: The      Next Generation.''       ``In certain ways,'' she added, ``Eric is very similar to      him in terms of his love of construction and building. And      Don has his sense of humor.''       The Trumps' planned corporate expansion comes as the      president has faced intense criticism from Democrats and      ethics experts for his continued ownership interest.       A liberal watchdog organization, Citizens for      Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), has sued      Trump, arguing that his hotel operations violate a      constitutional provision barring the president from accepting      gifts or payments from a foreign government. Some Democrats      have argued that Trump's international trademarks, including      one long-sought registration granted in February by China,      also violate the Constitution's emoluments clause.       Trump has called the CREW lawsuit ``totally without      merit.''       Amey, of the Project on Government Oversight, said there      were ways for the Trumps to avoid potential domestic      conflicts related to the hotel expansion. He said they could      put the hotel business under another corporate structure,      which does not involve a trust directly owned by the      president himself.       ``There are solutions to solving this, [hut] there doesn't      seem to be a will and a desire to do that within the White      House,'' Amey said.       The Trump brothers say they are taking ethics concerns      seriously and are doing everything necessary to avoid      distracting from their father's work as president.       ``Have I used him as a sounding board in the past? One      hundred percent,'' Trump said. ``Have I learned a lot      from him? Couldn't have had a better mentor. But he's got      real stuff he's got to deal with. These are real people's      lives . . . . So this notion that he is still running the      business from the White House is just insane.''       Trump scoffed at the idea that his father might have      somehow viewed running for president--spending millions of      dollars of his own money to run against more than a dozen      Republican challengers and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton      when few pundits gave him a chance to win--as a moneymaking      endeavor.       ``That's not a get-rich-quick scheme,'' he said. ``That      doesn't make any sense whatsoever.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgH1575-3.txt,616,DISAPPROVING THE RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RELATING TO,2017.0,7.0,March

Mr.Speaker, after weeks of empty promises that he had a secret plan to insure every American at lower costs with higher quality care, President Trump is now standing behind a House GOP repeal plan that was introduced last night that fails every single one of those promises. Based on estimates that we have seen so far, millions of Americans stand to lose coverage, out-of-pocket costs will skyrocket, and the quality of care will plummet.  But today, hours after that bill was introduced, Mr.Speaker, our President referenced a to-be-announced second and third phase of his healthcare rollout that Secretary Price referred to as ``a work in progress,'' once again injecting our healthcare system with crippling uncertainty that is hurting our patients, hospitals, behavioral health providers, and local economies.

313,topic-id,1143,"Mr.President, I rise to oppose S.13, which is a Congressional Review Act resolution to undo the regulations which protect title X health centers. I believe this resolution, although well meaning, will have the opposite effect of its intention.  I particularly want to discuss the organization known as Planned Parenthood, but, more generally, these women's health centers, these title X health centers, 1, provide many healthcare services to women, particularly low-income women. They are the choice of those women. They are a place they have chosen to go to receive their healthcare treatment.  I do think that one of the problems with this whole debate is the use of the term ``funding'' of Planned What we are talking about here is not funding, as in a budget line or a budget provision that says: Planned Parenthood gets $58 million or $100 million or $10, whatever it is. That is not the way it works. What we are talking about is reimbursement for women's healthcare services provided on an individual, case-by-case basis, and this does not include abortion. It does not include abortion.  These organizations in Maine--Planned Parenthood, for example, serves 10,000 people. Ten thousand women choose to get their healthcare services from Planned  The other piece of this debate I have never understood is why those who are opposed to abortion would be so opposed to organizations that allow women to make choices about pregnancies and provide contraception and contraception advice, which statistically we know reduces abortion.  In Maine, because of the access to organizations like Planned Parenthood and other women's healthcare clinics, we have seen our teen pregnancy rate drop 58 percent in the last 20 years or so--58 percent. That is a significant reduction, and it is attributable, at least in some significant part, to the availability of the services provided by these organizations.  It has always struck me as ironic, in the extreme, that someone who says they are against abortion should be against an agency that provides contraception and family planning services that prevent pregnancy and therefore prevent abortion.  I subscribe to President Clinton's formulation that abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. It should not be something that is chosen just casually--and of course it isn't. This is a terribly difficult decision for a women, but that is not the subject today. The subject today is curtailing the reimbursement for women's healthcare services to an organization or organizations that may also provide abortion services.  It is contrary to the very idea of trying to prevent abortion, but it is also denying healthcare services of choice to thousands of women in Maine and millions across the country.  I have sat in this body for 4 years and heard people talking about how consumers and patients should be able to choose their physicians, they should be able to choose their healthcare options. This was a basic principle. It is one of the arguments we have heard as we have been discussing other healthcare[[Page S1529]]issues in this body. This Congressional Review Act provision would take away that choice. I think that is a great disservice to those citizens, many of whom are low income, many of whom are covered by Medicaid, many of whom do not have private health insurance. To take this step that this resolution would entail would be very shortsighted, and I believe it is a violation of the rights of those people to choose their healthcare providers.  It also does not achieve the ends that the sponsors want to achieve. That is why I believe that this resolution--although it may be denominated as something to do with being anti-abortion, I think it is just the opposite. If this resolution passes and these healthcare centers under Title X, including Planned Parenthood, are unable to deliver these services, there will be more unwanted pregnancies and more abortions. I think that is a sad and unfortunate outcome to be perpetrated by people who say they are trying to oppose abortion.  Planned Parenthood provides women's healthcare services. It provides contraceptive services. I know the people in Maine who work for this agency, and I know this is a terribly controversial issue, but I believe that if what we want to do is minimize the number of abortions, then it makes no sense whatsoever to somehow indiscriminately strike out at the funding of the agencies that provide healthcare services.  Nobody in this body is talking about Federal funds for abortion. That is not what the issue is. If that were the issue, this would be an entirely different debate. The issue is taking reimbursement away from the Planned Parenthood clinic or Title X clinic for mammograms, cervical exams, or other women's healthcare services. Why would we want to do that in the name of achieving some other goal that won't even be achieved? In fact, it will be made a more widespread issue.  I hope the Senate will realize that whatever the motivation behind this provision is, it just makes no sense. It makes no sense from the point of view of preventing abortion. It makes no sense in terms of the taxpayers. Preventive services, contraceptive services, cost about $200 a patient; a Medicaid birth costs about $10,000. If it is a Medicaid patient, those are taxpayer dollars. We are talking about saving taxpayers money.  This goes to the healthcare system in general: Why would we want to undo prevention, whether prevention of unwanted pregnancies or prevention of a disease? Prevention is part of the solution to the healthcare crisis in this country because of the excessive cost.  Here is a specific case. Again, we are not talking about funding abortions. We are not talking about funding Planned We are not talking about funding these Title X health centers. We are talking about protecting them in terms of their reimbursement for women's health services delivered. That is what this vote is about. If you vote for this, you are voting to take away reimbursement for health services that are necessary to protect the health and well-being of women across this country.  I hope my colleagues will vote no on this resolution, and I believe it will serve the public and it will even serve those people who are concerned most deeply--and I understand--about abortion. If you want fewer abortions, fund Planned It seems to me that is a fairly clear correlation, and it is one we should respect. But we also should respect the rights, needs, and choices of those millions of women who rely on these clinics for their healthcare needs aside from the issue of reproductive rights, just straight healthcare needs. That is what this vote is all about.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

Our Constitution was set up to guarantee that our democracy would be free of influence from foreign powers. For months, U.intelligence agencies have said that Russia used covert cyber attacks, espionage, and propaganda to try to undermine our democracy. Reports show it, and the facts prove it. As I learned from my trip at the end of the year with Senator McCain and Senator Graham to the Baltics, Georgia, and Ukraine, this is not unique to our country and our elections and our democracy. This is something that has gone on for years--where Russia shut down the internet in the little country of Estonia simply because they had the audacity to move a bronze statue to a public square in Lithuania where they invited members of the Ukrainian Parliament who were in exile from Crimea in Kiev and invited them to Lithuania to celebrate their 25th anniversary of independence from Russia, and then they attempted to hack into the computers of the members of the Parliament in  As Senator Marco Rubio noted, this is not just about one party or one candidate or even about one country; this is an assault on democracies across the world. Last month, we learned that the very day President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia, with unprecedented attacks on our democracy, General Flynn, a member of the Trump transition team, spoke to a senior Russian official regarding those sanctions. The National Security Adviser, the person charged with the most sensitive matters of U.national security, then misled the Vice President of the United States and then, in turn, the American people. He resigned, as did the former chairman of the Trump campaign; he resigned.  Now we have learned that Attorney General Sessions met with the Russian Fine, Members meet with Ambassadors; we know that happens. But in fact, he met with the Russian Ambassador only 3 days after then-President Obama was at the G20 He was at the G20 Summit, and he met with Vladimir Putin himself. He told him to stop the cyber attacks, but he also told him that America was not going to back down from the sanctions. In fact, President Obama told the whole world that day in a press conference that we were not going to roll over and back down on the sanctions imposed against Russia because of their illegal invasion of  What happened 3 days later? Then-Senator Sessions, now our Attorney General, in fact, met with the Russian  Senator Sessions was then asked about contacts with the Russians from Trump officials during his hearing. I was there. I serve on the Judiciary Senator Franken posed some of those questions, in addition to Senator Leahy, who has noted that, at best, the answer was misleading.  That is why I feel so strongly that a press conference today is not enough and that Senator Sessions must come before the Judiciary Committee and answer under oath the questions that we now have.  What are those questions?  What was actually said at the meeting? Were sanctions discussed? Remember, 3 days--this meeting occurred 3 days after President Obama had said he would not roll back the sanctions. Were the sanctions discussed? Why did the Russian Ambassador, by the way, not meet with many other Members that day? We may not have a full accounting, but it appears that many of the Armed Services Committee members did not meet with the Russian Ambassador that day.  2, what were the discussions with the Trump administration, then-campaign officials back in September, before that meeting occurred between Senator Sessions and the Russian Ambassador? What were the discussions leading into it? What were the discussions after the meeting? Those are things we truly need to know.  For weeks, Senator Sessions could have corrected the record--for weeks, during the time in which this Russian issue and the contact with the Trump administration were discussed thoroughly. For weeks, I have been calling on Senator Sessions, now Attorney General Sessions, to recuse himself from any investigation into  There are clear Department of Justice guidelines about conflicts of interest, and, as I have said for weeks, when you read those rules, there is a clear conflict of interest. Today, Attorney General Sessions agreed to a partial recusal. He recused himself on the part of the investigation that relates to the Presidential campaign. Well, the American people deserve a full recusal.  Think about it. The meeting between General Flynn and the Russian Ambassador took place after the campaign ended. The meeting that we just learned about today between the President's son-in-law and Russian officials happened after the campaign ended. We need a full recusal and an independent counsel to manage the investigation of contacts between the Russian Government, the Trump campaign, and the Trump administration.  I believe, as I have noted earlier, that Attorney General Sessions must come before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath and answer these questions:  Were sanctions discussed? What were his discussions leading into that meeting with the Russian Ambassador? What were the discussions afterwards? And I am sure my other colleagues on the Judiciary Committee have many, many other questions.  I know when I asked about Russia at Senator Sessions' nomination hearing, I asked him very specifically if he had any reason to doubt the evidence put forward by our 17 intelligence agencies that there had, in fact, been an attempt by a foreign government, the country of Russia, to influence our election. He said he had no reason to doubt those findings. He had no reason to doubt those findings, so he clearly understood when you read that report how important this is--the $200 million spent in propaganda by Russian TV, as well as the hacking, as well as the attempts to influence the election.  So we have these facts. We know that meeting took place just 3 days after the President, our then-President Obama, met with Vladimir Putin at the G20 We know that is a time when Putin was told by the President of the United States to stop undermining the U.election system with cyber attacks. This was back in September before the election even occurred. We saw Paul Manafort resign from the campaign over We saw General Flynn step down over his contacts with the Russian Ambassador, and then we have that meeting. To me this seems like a pattern, and I want to not only see the facts through the investigations that are ongoing but also hear from the Attorney General himself.  That is why I am calling for the Department of Justice inspector general to investigate the actions of the Attorney General and whether the ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign and administration contacts with the Russian Government has been compromised in any way.  We know that Russia attempted to interfere with our election. Russia tries to undermine our democracy. This is not fake news. This is as real as it gets.  Aides and surrogates of this administration during the campaign and the transition were in contact with officials from a foreign government that was actively working to bring our democracy down. They were actively working to influence our elections. As Senator Rubio has noted, one time it is one candidate and one political party, and the next time it will be the other candidate and the other political party, unless we all come together in a bipartisan fashion to get to the bottom of the facts.  So how do we do that beyond the recusal and the independent counsel and having Senator Sessions come back before the Judiciary Committee to thoroughly answer my questions and the questions of my colleagues? Well,[[Page S1587]]the other way we do it is by having an independent commission. That is why I introduced, along with Senators Cardin, Leahy, Feinstein, and Carper, the bill that was announced by Senator Cardin and me, with Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings, that would create an independent, nonpartisan commission to uncover all the facts and make sure that future elections and political campaigns are safeguarded from foreign interference. Remember that this commission can go alongside the Intelligence Committee investigation--not to replace it but to be in addition to it--because this committee and experts appointed by this Congress from both sides of the aisle, just like the 9/11 Commission so successfully did, could actually not just uncover some facts that aren't known publicly, but, most importantly, they can make recommendations to make sure this doesn't happen again.  By the way, there are upcoming elections in Germany and in France, and getting that information out there doesn't just help our democracy, it also helps democracies in other parts of the world. We also need--and I touched on this earlier--an independent counsel, special prosecutor to look into all the contacts between the Trump administration and the campaign and have a full recusal.  What else can Congress do besides the independent commission? We have to make sure that the Intelligence Committee proceeds with its investigation. I am pleased that Senator Burr and Senator Warner have come together and announced that they are going to do a full and thorough investigation. They will also be looking into the contacts with the campaign--incredibly important.  Now we have the issue of the sanctions. As I mentioned, the day that the Obama administration was imposing additional sanctions on Russia--and the Trump campaign, through General Flynn, was actually meeting during this transition day with the Russian Ambassador to perhaps undermine those sanctions--I was with Senators McCain and Graham in Eastern As I noted, when we were in the Baltics, we heard and met with leaders--Prime Ministers and Presidents of these countries in Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia, who have seen this movie before. We went to We went to We heard from Ukraine--6,500 attempts to hack into their country's computer system alone, shutting down access in Trolls, in a building in Moscow--nearly 1,000 people--who are now working and have been working to undermine democracies all around the world.  So this isn't just about defending our own democracy; it is about defending the world's democracies. It is about saying to a country that thinks they can just get us to roll over and say: Hey, you can influence our election. No, that is not right. That is why we worked for expanded sanctions; that is why we introduced on a bipartisan basis with Senator McCain and Senator Graham--and I was one of the original sponsors with Senator Cardin and others--the Countering Russian Hostilities Act that would impose more sanctions on It would address cyber attacks, human rights violations, and its illegal annexation of land in Ukraine and  Just this weekend, on Sunday afternoon, I met with my Ukrainian community. Hundreds of people showed up on a Sunday afternoon in Minnesota because they are so concerned about their friends and relatives and they so believe in our democracy. Right down the road from the Ukrainian Center, where we held our meeting and where I listened and answered questions from my constituents, is a deli called Kramarczuk's. It is owned by a Ukrainian immigrant family whose parents came over to our country having fled oppression, and they came over to our country and bought this deli. They put this beautiful mural across an entire wall, and it is a beautiful photo of our Statue of Liberty, that beacon of democracy. Because of the Kramarczuks--they believe in our country. They believe in They believe in a country that is going to stand up for freedom of the press, that is going to stand up for freedom of religion, and that is going to stand up for them and their rights as immigrants to be citizens in this country. They believe in it because they have seen the worst of it. They have seen dictatorships, they have seen oppression, and they came to our country. They expect our country, as they serve their Ukrainian food to the people all over Minnesota in front of the big mural of the Statue of Liberty--they believe that our country is going to stand up for democracy.  That was the message that Senator McCain, Senator Graham, and I brought to the people of We not only, of course, met with the President and their official leaders, but we also went right to the frontline. On New Year's Eve, we were in Eastern Ukraine on the sea--cold, snow coming down--with hundreds and hundreds of Ukrainian troops, hearing the stories of a mother who was so young, who had just lost her son a week before to a Russian separatist sniper. We heard the stories of the 10,000 people killed just as this conflict began, standing up for democracy, just as we have stood up for our democracy.  So when all of these discussions go on about recusals and about who should resign and what should happen, let's remember what this is all about. This is about saving our democracy and making our democracy strong so we can continue to be the beacon that those Ukrainians put on their wall in their deli because they believe in this country so much. This isn't about partisan divides. This is simply about being a democracy and getting to the bottom of it. When something goes on and a foreign country is trying to influence things, you have to put your party aside. You have to say: You know what, I want to know what happened here. If I am a Democrat or Republican, I want to know what happened so it doesn't happen again. I want to be able to protect our citizens and our election system and our democracy. That is what this is about.

I think there must be improvements that are made. I[[Page S1617]]continue to be inspired by the families across my State, your State, and our country who work so hard to make it easier for kids to have access to drugs to treat their illnesses. Unfortunately, we haven't yet achieved all we can do for these families, and I have heard time and again about the emotional roller coaster that many of them have experienced when they interact with the Federal Government on new approaches for these rare disease conditions. Too often they are unaware when drugs are under review or confused about why experts or patients are not even consulted. The individuals suffering from these conditions and their families need greater clarity about the process for evaluating and approving these drugs, and they ought to be included and informed every step of the way.  It is critical that treatments that do exist for those with rare conditions be accessible and affordable. We must continue to protect the individuals from discrimination in insurance coverage and work to bring down costs. We have to ensure that incentives designed to spur the development and accessibility of treatments that the rare disease community desperately needs are not abused.  I ask Senator Hatch, as one with longstanding leadership on the bill that you passed that has helped so many people and saved lives, how can we focus on sharing this message with our colleagues and our constituents?

980,topic-id,286,"Well, that is going to be very important and really an opportunity to make sure that this works for patients with rare diseases and their families. We know that affordability and accessibility remain paramount. We should also think about the burden that these conditions play and the critical role of the voice of the patient.  As you stated, Senator Hatch, more than 7,000 rare diseases exist, and the vast majority have no treatment. This is an extraordinary burden borne every day by Americans in every single State across the country. As we seek to continue making progress, including monitoring implementation of the advances in the bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act, we must ensure that rare disease treatments receive sufficient attention.  We also must encourage Federal agencies to better incorporate the patient's voice in their decisionmaking process. As I mentioned earlier, all too often as we rightly focus on evidence-based medicine, we can lose sight of the human experience of these and different therapies. What may seem simple in a lab may be overwhelming or difficult when applied to patients in real life situations--all the more so when children are involved. The FDA and all agencies should ensure that they have appropriate processes to seek and incorporate this vital input. The user fee agreement will be an opportunity for us to make this case.  I would like to thank Senator Hatch again for his time to discuss these issues that are very important to both of us. We look forward to engaging with our colleagues on these issues as we move forward to the implementation of the Cures Act, as well as the work on the Orphan Drugs Act, and as well as the user fee agreement.

I have the honor of serving as the Republican chair of the House of Representatives Rare Disease I consider it one of the greatest responsibilities of my service to work for innovative treatment and new technologies and to build an atmosphere of appreciation and understanding in Congress for the hard work of all of the patient advocates. Their passion is often driven by the care of loved ones, and their personal stories are profiles in courage.  Hearing from thousands of advocates, many of whom are here in Washington this week, gives the members of the caucus renewed energy and purpose. Events held during Rare Disease Week here on Capitol Hill and at the NIH in Bethesda highlight what has been accomplished and what still needs to be done.  One of those champions joined us in the House Chamber just last evening. I was very proud that President Trump invited New Jersey resident Megan Crowley to his joint session address. Megan's story of combating a terrible rare disease is a testament to the American spirit. Megan is now a student at Notre I salute her, her parents, and her family for their courage.  Passage of the 21st Century Cures Act was a major accomplishment in the last Congress--indeed, in my opinion, it was the most important piece of legislation passed during the 114th We worked in a bicameral, bipartisan way. We worked with the White House and with the Department of Health and Human It passed overwhelmingly in the House and in the Senate, and now it is the law of the land.  I am encouraged that the Trump administration will carefully implement its provisions to our healthcare system, improving the healthcare system and to help spur the next great medical innovations.

Patients with degenerative conditions, cancers, and rare diseases await the genius of these new solutions. We need to do everything we can to help find these cures.  I have met with many rare disease patients, advocates, and their loved ones. Their work is inspiring, and it gives our caucus a mission and a purpose.

562,topic-id,456,"Mr.President, the Department of Housing and Urban Development plays a vital role ensuring that all Americans have access to safe affordable housing. Affordable housing should not be a political issue; it is a moral issue. Programs like Section 8 and the Community Development Block Grant, CDBG, Program keep families in their homes and support and maintain affordable housing. That is not up for debate.  I am disappointed that President Trump did not look to our knowledgeable housing advocates across the country to identify a qualified, experienced nominee to serve as Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and instead nominated Ben Carson to this important position. In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Dr, Carson, like many nominees, said the right things. He made the right promises. I want to believe that he will fulfill those commitments.  Programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development keep shelter over the heads of our Nation's struggling and low-income families. They combat homelessness among adults and children alike by building and maintaining affordable housing and helping families buy their first homes. I am proud of the progress we have made in Vermont and across the Nation through programs implemented by the Department of Housing and Urban During his confirmation hearing, Carson testified to the crucial role of rental assistance programs. He pledged to be an advocate for funding for housing assistance programs. He turned away from his previous call for a 10-percent across-the-board cut to housing programs. I hope that Carson will fulfill these commitments.  I continue to have concerns regarding Carson's seeming animosity toward the affirmatively furthering fair housing, AFFH rule, which he called a ``failed socialist experiment'' in an op-ed in the Washington While Carson tried to minimize those comments in his hearing, I remain concerned that Carson doesn't understand the AFFH rule. This rule asks cities and towns receiving Federal dollars to look at their housing patterns to identify racial bias and to take action to rectify any bias they find. Carson has called it social engineering. I call it social justice and support the examination of policies to promote equality and eliminate discrimination. During his confirmation hearing, he pledged to enforce our fair housing laws. I believe this includes upholding the  I am concerned that Carson lacks the necessary experience to successfully serve as our Secretary of Housing and Urban He will be confirmed, of that there is no doubt.

572,topic-id,1094,"Every day we learn more about the troubling connections between the Russian Government and both President Trump's administration and his campaign, but last night kind of topped everything--a revelation that Attorney General Sessions met with Russian officials during the height of the Presidential campaign, which raises a new level of alarm.  One of the reasons is, we now know the Attorney General, under oath, misled the Senate Judiciary Committee in response to my direct question about his contacts with Russian officials. I asked then-Senator Sessions if he had[[Page S1549]]been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian Government about the 2016 election. His answer was unequivocal. He said no. He provided a similarly misleading response to Senator Franken, saying that he was ``not aware'' of any connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian  Especially those of us who are lawyers, and who have had a chance to serve as attorney general or as prosecutors in our States, know it is an egregious breach of public trust that Attorney General Sessions has not recused himself from this investigation. I think everybody would agree he has to recuse himself. Of course, as this goes on, the question now arises: Has he perjured himself?  In response to these reports, the Attorney General claims that he ``never met Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign.'' That is a wholly inadequate response. The Attorney General was a top adviser to the Trump campaign. He took a private, undisclosed meeting with the Russian Ambassador during the height of concerns about Russian involvement in our election. Think about it. There are reports everywhere about concerns about Russian involvement in the election of the United States, and he has an undisclosed meeting with the Russian  He also met with the Russian Ambassador during an event at the Republican National One would think, at the Republican National Convention, it is possible that politics might be discussed. Now, if the Attorney General thinks his explanation is sufficient after he misled Congress about these contacts, of course, he is mistaken. I don't say that as a I think everybody would agree to that. What I worry about is that the Attorney General is only the latest Trump administration official who has attempted to mask his contacts with the  The President's first National Security Advisor lied to the Vice President about his communications with the Russian He only resigned after the media reported how he had lied to Vice President Pence, and even that was weeks after the President had been informed. He had to leave only when it became public. The President's Chief of Staff attempted to use the FBI--which, of course, would be in violation of Justice Department policies--to suppress news reports about Russian contacts. I have been here through seven previous Presidents--Republicans and You would assume they would play by the rules. This administration seems to want to make up the rules.  My concern is not just what the administration might be doing; my concern is about We are, I believe strongly, the greatest democracy history has known. We are the longest existing democracy in history, and now we have Russia meddling and trying to undermine our democracy. Every American should worry about that. Every American should be frightened, not just concerned but frightened. It is an attack on our democracy. This is one of the most disturbing national security challenges facing our country. Russian President Putin ordered a multifaceted campaign that was aimed at helping Donald Trump win and undermining public faith in our election. That should alarm and outrage everybody no matter what party one belongs to.  We didn't hear a word about it in the President's speech on Tuesday during the joint session of In fact, the President's only reaction has been to disparage American investigators, to disparage the intelligence community, to cast journalists who report on this as ``enemies of the American people.'' Journalists are not enemies of the American people. Russia is the enemy of the American people. Putin is the enemy of the American people. Do not cast our journalists, do not cast our investigators, do not cast our intelligence people, do not cast those who dare speak out as being enemies of Point to the real enemies--Vladimir Putin and those he controls.  It is about time we take this seriously. I have been here 42 years. I have never seen such a perfidious threat to our democracy than what we are seeing in Vladimir Putin, and my concern is the administration does not call it out for what it is. We Americans deserve to know the facts. We deserve a full and fair investigation. We deserve one that is free from any political influence.  I have repeatedly called on Attorney General Sessions, who was one of President Trump's top advisers during the campaign, to recuse himself and appoint a special counsel to conduct the investigation. Earlier this week, he said: ``I would recuse myself on anything that I should recuse myself on.'' This morning, he said he would recuse himself ``whenever it's appropriate.'' This would be a ludicrous response from a law clerk at the Department of From the Attorney General, it is dissembling.  Recusal is not optional here. It is required by very clear Justice Department regulations. It is required to maintain at least a semblance of integrity in this investigation. The Attorney General has to recuse himself because, as stated clearly in Department rules, he is obviously ``closely identified'' with the President due to his ``service as a principal adviser.'' That is the rule, and that is the rule whether it is a Republican or a Democratic administration. It describes his relationship with the  The investigation has to be led by someone who, in reality and in appearance, is impartial and removed from politics. That does not describe someone who was in the trenches of a political campaign with the subjects of the investigation while they were allegedly engaged in the very activity under investigation.

The Secretary and the Department of Interior are tasked with using sound science to manage and sustain America's lands, water, wildlife, and energy resources, while honoring our Nation's vital obligations and responsibilities to tribal nations. The Secretary of Interior also coordinates Federal assistance to the Freely Associated States of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau under the Compacts of Free There are few Cabinet positions with such a wide range of management and organization.  Any nominee for this position should be selected for their commitment to protecting our precious resources, as well as their dedication to uphold and enforce our environmental laws.  After reviewing Mr.Zinke's record, there is little doubt that he is dedicated to public service and that he has a strong connection to the outdoors. However, the Secretary of the Interior has a great responsibility as the leading steward of our majestic public lands, the champion of our great tribal nations, and the manager and defender of our diverse wildlife. I fear that Mr.Zinke may not be fully prepared to set aside some of his personal views on the management of our resources and consider the views of all Americans as we debate critical natural resources issues.  I enjoyed learning that Mr.Zinke is an admirer of President Teddy Roosevelt, a point that has been repeated countless times, and I was pleased that he agrees that, yes, President Roosevelt did get it right when he placed millions of acres of lands under Federal protection. However, I hope that Mr.Zinke will not only study the work that President Roosevelt did to instill a conservation ethic in this country, but will look more broadly at other individuals whose steadfast commitment and dedication to conservation and historic preservation have left their mark in Vermont and across the country.  For instance, Laurance Rockefeller made significant contributions to the American conservation movement that had a lasting impact on the American landscape. The Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park in Woodstock, VT, honors not only Rockefeller's dedication to conservation, but is also the first national park to tell the story of conservation history and the evolving nature of land stewardship in Conservation of the environment and recreational development was a passion to which he dedicated his life. In addition to his work in Vermont, he was instrumental in the creation and development of the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming and the Virgin Islands National Park on the island of These three national parks could not be more different, but they are each spectacular pieces of our natural heritage. This heritage that would not exist today and be available for the public to enjoy, had it not been for the vital work of Laurance Rockefeller and the Federal investments that have been made in these important public lands.  I hope Mr.Zinke will also study and hopefully visit the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, which carves its way not only through Vermont, but 13 other States as well. This trail is an amazing footpath for the people that traverses over 2,100 miles through wild forests, towns, valleys, and mountaintops, and connects a myriad of through-hikers and day hikers to our scenic landscape. All of them are able to enjoy the important Federal investments in this trail, which is maintained by the countless hours of work done every year by devoted volunteers like the Green Mountain Club in  Work to build and maintain the Appalachian Trail is not static, nor is it complete. There continue to be important investments needed through the Land and Water Conservation Fund, LWCF, to acquire land and conservation easements to safeguard the trail. There is much needed trail maintenance that should be included as part of any infrastructure bill the Senate considers. This work is shovel-ready and will have a considerable impact in supporting our outdoor economy on which Vermont is so dependent.  Mr.Zinke should also seek out expertise and guidance from the past Secretaries of the Interior who have dedicated their lives to this work. I hope he will study the exit memo that Secretary Jewell prepared on the Department's Record of Progress and the moral imperative the Department has to positively impact our American economy, our rural communities and cities, and ultimately, the well-being of our planet.  As Secretary of Interior, Mr.Zinke will oversee a number of ongoing debates concerning our fragile public lands, the protection of endangered species, and how we respond to climate change. I know that there is no single solution that can answer the different land management issues facing each region of our country. Many stakeholders are constantly engaging the Interior Department and the Senate with a wide variety of views on how we should protect, access, and use our natural resources. In Vermont, we are deeply concerned about the pressure being placed on our natural resources from rapid growth and climate change.  I heard from hundreds of Vermonters concerned about Mr.Zinke's nomination and worried that our environmental standards and laws will not be enforced for our lands, air, water, and threatened species under his leadership. His record has shown an opposition to policies that protect valuable rivers and streams from polluting coal runoff and a willingness to weaken historic laws such as President Teddy Roosevelt's Antiquities He even authored a bill that sought to obstruct efforts by the Department of the Interior to review and modernize management of our Federal energy resources and ensure that taxpayers are fairly compensated for their sale. Taxpayers deserve a Secretary of the Interior who will work to support the protection of our shared Federal resources 100 percent of the time, not one who will actively work to weaken or dismantle the powers of protection invested in this  Based on that record, I voted against his nomination. Nonetheless, now that Mr.Zinke is the Secretary, I want him to know that I am committed to working closely with him on a variety of issues that are important to Vermonters and all I will work with him to foster consensus not only in New England, but throughout the country. As the Vice Chairman of the Appropriations Committee and a member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, I am committed to working with him to ensure that we protect our Federal lands and continue the important conservation ethic of Teddy Roosevelt to permanently protect our beautiful and fragile natural resources, while also addressing new challenges posed by climate change.  Madam President, with respect to the nomination of Rick Perry to be the Secretary of the Department of Energy, hundreds of Vermonters have written to me in opposition. They were concerned that under his leadership we will halt the forward progress we have made towards a responsible energy strategy for the future of our country. Not only did Governor Perry make headlines for famously proposing to abolish the Department of Energy, he lacks a background or any true experience on the complex scientific and technical issues in the Department of Energy's portfolio. This agency must be focused on addressing our energy and environmental challenges through transformative science and technology solutions; yet Mr.Perry expedited the permitting of coal-fired electric generating plants and filed suit challenging[[Page S1558]]the Environmental Protection Agency's finding that greenhouse gases significantly endanger public health. How can we trust him to lead the Energy Department?  I was pleased that, during his confirmation hearing, Governor Perry apologized for suggesting that the entire Department of Energy should be abolished. However, he has yet to say that he will fight to maintain important offices within the Department, such as the Office of Electricity and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable I find it hard to see how we can pursue an ``all-of-the-above'' energy strategy called for by the administration if so much of the Department's capabilities are targeted for elimination. By supporting research around wind, solar, and efficiency, offering loan guarantees for innovative demonstration projects, and providing expertise and support to the private sector in commercializing new research we can create American jobs and grow the national economy. Conversely, if we turn our back on the future, we are ceding these important and fast growing fields of research and production of renewable energy technologies to China, the European Union, and other countries at a critical time. That would be a monumental mistake to haunt our economy for many years.  Earlier today, I had the chance to talk to a Vermont company that is closely watching the work of the Energy Dpartment to advance America's clean energy revolution. Northern Power Systems in Barre, VT, has been designing and developing wind turbines for almost 40 years and offers support services for energy generation needs around the world. Last year, they received an award for their increase in exports, but rather than selling to an international market they would rather see their sales here in the U.take off so that they can create more American jobs to manufacture American-made wind turbines. Turbines that should be installed here to utilize this reliable, abundant, and free resource to lower energy costs for  It is troubling that Mr.Perry has taken such an aggressive stance against the Department of Energy and dismissed large parts of its mission. I hope that he will devote himself to learning everything he can about the diverse work of the Department and surround himself with some of the best public servants and technical experts he can find.  The last Secretary of Energy, Ernest Moniz, prepared two documents that I am hopeful Mr.Perry will study closely. First, the Quadrennial Energy Review provides a broad review of federal energy policy in the context of economic, environmental, occupational, security, and health and safety priorities. The Department also prepared an extensive suite of analyses to accompany the Quadrennial Energy Review that I know would serve Mr.Perry well as he tries to understand the wide array of issues that will come before him at the  I would also recommend that he review the exit memo Secretary Moniz prepared, which highlights the responsibilities and opportunities for the Department's enduring service to the Nation as our leading science, technology, and innovation agency. The Department has an extraordinary span of responsibilities from energy and the environment, to cyber security, science and national security, and it must collaborate with other agencies like the Defense Department and our intelligence community.  I remain committed to supporting and protecting the essential mission of the Department of Energy in order to move us forward with 2lst century jobs and make needed investments in our electricity grid, clean energy, and energy efficiency that will save American consumers and businesses money.

The founders of our country recognized the power of the purse as one of the most important tools Congress has to ensure our system of checks and balance and to conduct oversight of the Executive and Judicial branch, but it is much more than that. The Appropriations Committee is also where we translate the priorities of a nation into the realities of the people.  Our country is not a business, where we allocate resources only according to the bottom line. We do not invest in order to make a profit, or a one-for-one dollar in return. We invest in those areas where it is uniquely right for government to take the lead. We invest in the areas that make a difference in the everyday lives of Americans and that help build the foundations of our country and our economy--infrastructure, national security, our environment, education, health care. The Appropriations Committee is where we fund nutrition programs to ensure that children do not have to sit through class hungry and remain healthy so they can develop and grow. It is where we allocate the resources to clean our lakes and our streams and make investments in growing our communities and promoting jobs. It is where we invest in research to cure cancer. It is where we can define who we are as country.  I have been a member of this Committee for almost my entire tenure in the Senate, and just a few short months ago, I became vice chair. I am proud to serve on this committee, and I feel honored to join in the ranks of its leaders.

1032,topic-id,771,"Mr.President, today, I have reintroduced legislation to protect Americans from being stripped of their legal rights by little known clauses that are now hidden in an alarming number of contracts. When we enter into agreements to obtain cell phone service, rent an apartment, or accept a new job, most are not made aware of the forced arbitration clauses that are tucked away in the legal fine print. But these dangerous provision force us to abandon our constitutional right to protect ourselves in court and instead send hard-working Americans to face wealthy corporations behind closed doors in private arbitration. This must change.  When Congress passed the Federal Arbitration Act in 1925, it was intended to help businesses resolve legal disputes with each other. But over the past two decades, private arbitration has been abused by large companies to push Americans out of court. In doing so, these companies have effectively opted out of critical labor, consumer, and civil rights laws that give Americans the ability to assert their claims before our independent judiciary.  Forced arbitration clauses now appear in nearly every contract we sign. Unfortunately, examples of the injustice caused by these clauses are equally ubiquitous and can be found all across the country. They affect consumers, workers, seniors, veterans, and families in Vermont and every other State, and the cases are heart-wrenching.  Just last week, the Washington Post reported that hundreds of current and former employees of Sterling Jewelers--a company that earns $6 billion in annual revenue--have for years alleged that the company is engaged in pervasive gender discrimination and has fostered a culture that condones sexual harassment. The stories now being reported are shocking and date back to the early 1990s. Yet, despite the fact that women at the company have been alleging misconduct for decades, no one knew about it. That is because their claims were hidden behind closed doors because of private arbitration. To this day, we still do not know the full details.  The press has helped to bring attention to other instances of forced arbitration in recent years. In 2015, the Los Angeles Times revealed that Wells Fargo used arbitration clauses to deny customers whose names were used to open fraudulent accounts an opportunity to seek justice in court. In fact, Wells Fargo asked a Federal court in Utah to move a number of sham account allegations to arbitration. The New York Times dedicated a three-part investigative series to highlighting the impact on consumers and workers of forced arbitration clauses. And becoming the story herself, television journalist Gretchen Carlson was barred from speaking publicly about her allegations of sexual harassment against former FOX News chairman Roger  I have long raised concerns about the practice of forced arbitration, and as chairman led hearings of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2013. This should not be a partisan issue. Both Republican and Democratic attorneys general have repeatedly spoken out against the Federal Arbitration Act's intrusion on State sovereignty and a State's compelling interest in protecting the health and welfare of its citizens. In Vermont, lawmakers enacted commonsense legislation to limit the abuse of forced arbitration clauses and raise consumer awareness, but but this law was invalidated because it conflicted with Federal law. Companies have effectively created a ``get out of jail free'' card that guts our laws and shields bad actors from any type of public accountability. This is an unconscionable situation, and Congress must act.  The Restoring Statutory Rights Act that I am reintroducing today/will protect Americans' right to seek justice in our courts. It will ensure that our Federal laws will actually be effective by ensuring that Americans cannot be stripped of their ability to enforce their rights before our independent court system. This bill also ensures that when States act to address forced arbitration, as my home State of Vermont has, they are not preempted by an overbroad reading of our Federal arbitration laws.  This effort is supported by the Leadership Conference for Civil and Human Rights, the National Employment Lawyers' Association, and consumer groups such as National Association of Consumer Advocates, Consumers Union, Public Citizen, the National Consumer Law Center, and Consumers for Auto Reliability and For years, these groups and many others have worked tirelessly to highlight the injustice of forced arbitration and the full scope of the number of people it affects.  All Senators should care about ensuring that corporations cannot unilaterally circumvent the statutes that this body writes, debates, and enacts into law. Senators should also care about the ability of the States to protect consumers from unconscionable contracts. I urge Members to support this bill.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgS1641.txt,1383,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,7.0,March
1011,topic-id,1518,"Mr.President, I am truly saddened that I must address what I fear is a growing threat to our Republic--the silencing of political debate by totalitarian mob violence on college campuses.  I was not in Burlington, VT, last Thursday to witness what happened at Middlebury College, but I would like to read from accounts that have been provided by two people who were, in fact, there and who saw these things unfold. They were the targets of the mob's violence. Their names are Allison Stanger, professor of political science at Middlebury College, and Charles Murray, the author of several groundbreaking books, including the work ``The Bell Curve'' and a scholar at the American Enterprise America deserves and needs to hear their stories.  On Saturday, 2 days after the incident, Professor Stanger wrote on her Facebook page as follows:       I agreed to participate in the event with Charles Murray      because several of my students asked me to do so. They are      smart and good people--all of them--and this was their big      event of the year.       I, actually, welcomed the opportunity to be involved      because, while my students may know I am a Democrat, all of      my courses are nonpartisan, and this was a chance to      demonstrate publicly my commitment to a free and fair      exchange of views in my classroom.       As the campus uproar about his visit built, I was genuinely      surprised and troubled to learn that some of my faculty      colleagues had rendered judgment on Murray's work and      character while openly admitting that they had not read      anything he had written. With the best of intentions, they      offered their leadership to enraged students, and we all know      what the results were.       I want you to know what it feels like to look out at a sea      of students yelling obscenities at other members of my      beloved community. . . . I saw some of my faculty colleagues,      who had publicly acknowledged that they had not read anything      Murray had written, join the effort to shut down the      lecture. All of this was deeply unsettling to me.       What alarmed me most, however, was what I saw in student      eyes from up on that stage. Those who wanted the event to      take place made eye contact with me. Those intent on      disrupting it steadfastly refused to do so. It was clear to      me that they had effectively dehumanized me. They couldn't      look me in the eye because, if they had, they would have seen      another human being. There is a lot to be angry about in      America today, but nothing good ever comes from demonizing      our brothers and sisters.       When the event ended and it was time to leave the building,      I breathed a sigh of relief. We had made it. I was ready for      dinner and conversation with faculty and students in a      tranquil setting. What transpired instead felt like a scene      from [the TV show] ``Homeland'' rather than an evening at an      institution of higher learning. We confronted an angry mob as      we tried to exit the building.       Most of the hatred was focused on Murray, but when I      took his right arm both to shield him from the attack and to      make sure we stayed together so I could reach the car, too,      that's when the hatred turned on me.       One thug grabbed me by the hair, and another shoved me in a      different direction. I noticed signs with expletives and my      name on them. . . . For those of you who marched in      Washington the day after the inauguration, imagine being in a      crowd like that, only being surrounded by hatred rather than      love. I feared for my life.[[Page S1633]]  The next day, on Sunday, the American Enterprise Institute's website published this account from Charles  Murray wrote:       If it hadn't been for Allison and Bill Burger [Middlebury's      Vice President for Communications] keeping hold of me and the      security guards pulling people off me, I would have been      pushed to the ground. That much is sure. What would have      happened after that I don't know, but I do recall thinking      that being on the ground was a really bad idea, and I should      try really hard to avoid that. Unlike Allison, I wasn't      actually hurt at     all. . . .       In the 23 years since ``The Bell Curve'' was published, I      have had considerable experience with campus protests. Until      last Thursday, all of the ones involving me have been as      carefully scripted as kabuki: The college administration      meets with the organizers of the protest, and ground rules      are agreed upon. The protesters have so many minutes to do      such and such. It is agreed that, after the allotted time,      they will leave or desist. These negotiated agreements have      always worked. At least a couple of dozen times, I have been      able to give my lecture to an attentive or, at least, quiet      audience despite an organized protest.       Middlebury tried to negotiate such an agreement with the      protesters, but for the first time in my experience, the      protesters would not accept any time limits. If this becomes      the new normal, the number of colleges willing to let      themselves in for an experience like Middlebury's will plunge      to near zero. Academia is already largely sequestered in an      ideological bubble, but at least it's translucent. That      bubble will become opaque.       Worse yet, the intellectual thugs will take over many      campuses. In the mid-1990s, I could count on students who had      wanted to listen to start yelling at the protesters after a      certain point, ``Sit down and shut up. We want to hear what      he has to say.'' That kind of pushback had an effect. It      reminded the protesters that they were a minority.       I am assured [he continues] by people at Middlebury that      their protesters are a minority as well, but they are a      minority that has intimidated the majority. The people in the      audience who wanted to hear me speak were completely cowed.      That cannot be allowed to stand. A campus where a majority of      students are fearful to speak openly because they know a      minority will jump on them is no longer an intellectually      free campus in any meaningful sense.  I suspect that most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle may not necessarily be fans of Charles There is nothing wrong with that, but I am confident they at least would be honest enough and self-respecting enough not to condemn any scholar's work without ever having read it, like many of Middlebury's faculty members apparently did. More importantly, I am confident my Democratic colleagues would join me in denouncing the violence of the Middlebury campus protesters who sought to silence On countless occasions, I have heard my Democratic colleagues come to the Senate floor to condemn violence in all of its forms. Why would this time be any different?  We do not agree on everything, but I am confident that if Murray were invited to testify here on Capitol Hill--perhaps at a committee of the United States Senate--my Democratic colleagues would eagerly join in an open and respectful debate that would ensue as a result of that visit. I am confident they would reject any effort to silence or to do harm to those with whom they might disagree. In fact, I am confident that if any outburst like that happened, whoever was chairing that committee and the ranking personnel associated with that committee would immediately bring the disruption to a close so an open, honest, respectful discussion could occur within that meeting.  I know tensions are high in America today, and I know what it is like to be on the losing side of a bitterly fought Presidential election as we, as Republicans, found ourselves in just a few years ago in the wake of the 2012 election cycle and in the wake of the previous Presidential election cycle before that in 2008, but that does not and cannot give anyone the license to shout down a fellow American, let alone to physically assault him just because he holds a different opinion.  Democracy and freedom--the republican form of government--depend on open, tolerant, and civil political discourse, and sustaining our democratic freedoms is, perhaps, the sole reason the government subsidizes institutions of higher education in this country.  It is embarrassing that teachers and students at an elite college like Middlebury should need reminding, but speech is not violence, and violence is not speech. Totalitarians who fail to recognize this core fact of decency and tolerance are goose-stepping into some of the darkest corners of the human heart.  If there is anything that should unite us in these polarized times, it is that the kind of violence we saw on Middlebury's campus last week must not be tolerated. That is why I commend the 44 Middlebury College professors who have signed a ``Statement of Principles'' on ``Free Inquiry on Campus.'' I hope more Middlebury professors will join them. In any event, I hope all Americans will join them in standing up for free, open, honest, respectful debate.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgS1625-4.txt,1501,"OIRA INSIGHT, REFORM, AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT",2017.0,7.0,March

It was not done by taxpayers' dollars. It was done by the coal they mined. For every ton of coal, there would be so much set aside. Then we had the bankruptcy laws happen in the 1980s, which basically destroyed a lot of companies for paying into it. Then we had the crash of 2008, which took it further down.

Everybody who has joined me in this journey understands that we are all fighting for the working people, which is what we were sent here to do, from your wonderful State of South Carolina to my beautiful State of West They depend on us. The retired miners are walking our halls. Maybe you have seen them. If not, I am sure they will come by and say hi to you. They are very appreciative of the consideration we are all giving them. They are hoping we finally get this done.  I am doing it for them and for their families and what they have done for our country. The 4-month extension is not even humane. I have said that. My reason for saying that is that these people can't comprehend it. I can assure you that, when I go back to my office after I leave the floor, I will get phone calls: Joe, they are going to take my healthcare again. What am I going to do?  I keep saying: Ma'am, please, trust us; hold tight.  We could have had this fixed before. We kicked the can down the road 4 months. Now I have been told--and we all seem to accept it--that they are going to do a permanent healthcare fix. I am appreciative of that. The bottom line is that we have pensions out there hanging, which is going to be a bigger albatross around us if we don't something, and we have a chance to fix it all and put that aside.  I spoke to President Trump, and I am hopeful that he will speak out on this, and he has spoken out. He has told me that he supports it.  I said: Please, Mr.President, speak to our friends on the other side--our leadership--and let them know how much you support this, and let us put this behind us because we can fix it once and for all.  We were told to get a legislative hearing, and we did that. We were told to go through regular order. We went to the Finance Committee, and it was passed out--bipartisan, overwhelmingly bipartisan.  I know we have the 60 votes. I was told we have to reintroduce it again. So here we are. I reintroduced it, and we have bipartisan support again. We are ready to go.  Why do we put these people through this type of agony? I don't know. We have so many other challenges, and we have to come together. This is one we have already agreed we are together on and can't move it.  I know you have always been a dear friend and supportive, and you know the hard work our people have done, and I appreciate that. However, it is time to act. It is time to get this done. If we wait until April, that is exactly when our continuing resolution is coming up, and, basically, we have no budget to work off of. So we have to do another extension until we can get something more permanent. They could get caught up in that CR again. We are going to say: We are sorry; we couldn't get it done, but we will give you another 2, 3, or 4 months.  I can't go home and continue to tell these wonderful people who have been so good and so patient that I am sorry, but we just have to wait another few months.  When is enough enough? When are those few months going to be up and we do the right thing? I am asking all of you; I am asking all of my colleagues: Please, this is one time when we can do something and feel good about it and go home over the weekend and go back to our constituents and tell them that this one is finished, that we fixed this.  I am asking for that vote. I would encourage all of my colleagues to do the same, to speak to the leaderships to make sure that we can move the miners protection and make sure the miners get the healthcare and the pension benefits they were guaranteed and they have been promised and which has been kept until now, and that we are not going to let them down.  With that, Mr.President, I thank you, and I thank all of my colleagues for the support we have been receiving. I am asking the majority leader to please let us have this vote and put it on the floor. Let's go from there and see what happens. I am willing to do that.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

I can tell you that there is no one who has a greater definitive desire to make sure that we hold our government accountable and certainly accountable to the American people.  So, it is with that goal in mind that I rise to ask my colleagues to support an amendment that we are offering that would actually just keep a log of any of the pre-review consultations with agencies that OIRA actually has and conducts, and to publish that list upon completion of review.  Dating back to some 2003, the Government Accountability Office had made the recommendation about increasing this transparency at the Office of Information and Regulatory GAO actually made one recommendation targeted at what they call informal review, Mr.Chairman, that OIRA conducts before an agency actually formally submits a rule for review.  Indeed, the GAO recommended that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget should define a transparency requirement that would be applicable to agencies and OIRA, in Section 6 of Executive Order 12866, in such a way that would not include not only the formal review, but it would also include the informal review period when OIRA says that it has sometimes, considering some of the most important facts as it relates to new rules.  This recommendation remains unimplemented today, and I can tell you, Mr.Chairman, we have had a number of hearings where we have had this particular group in. I know my colleagues, the gentleman opposite from Virginia, and I believe that OIRA plays a critical role. And yet, at the same time, some of these meetings were going on without the knowledge, and even after the fact, when they went into effect, and we had really no understanding of some of the deliberation that went on.

397,topic-id,367,"Mr.Chair, my amendment is simple.  It would require an executive agency to report any new rule or regulatory action that would duplicate or otherwise overlap with existing agency rules and regulations.  So much of government's excess is created by unelected officials who wield enormous influence over our everyday lives.  Last year, Federal agencies issued 18 rules and regulations for every one law that passed  That is a grand total of 3,853 regulations in 2016 alone. In 2015, Federal regulations cost the American economy nearly $1.9 trillion --T, trillion dollars--in lost growth and productivity.  Think about that for a second. A $1.9 trillion tax, a government burden on the American people. That means lost jobs, stagnant wages, and decreasing benefits for workers.  When the House passed the REINS Act in January, I offered an amendment to require at least 1 rule be overturned for every new rule finalized by the executive branch.  President Trump recently took that one step further by issuing an executive order which required at least 2 rules be overturned for every new rule.  My amendment builds on those initiatives by requiring any agency issuing a duplicative regulation to indicate as much when making the online disclosure required by the underlying bill.  The truth is, the federal government is all too often a fountain of unnecessary regulations.  And while some may debate the merits of any given regulation, few would agree the federal government should issue identical iterations of the same regulation multiple times over.  Mr.Speaker, it is past time we stop bureaucratic abuse and shift the balance of power from government back to the people, where it belongs.  That can start today by passing the Regulatory Integrity Act and putting our government on a path to reduce the amount of red tape that our businesses and the American people deal with every day.

143,topic-id,588,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Utah for yielding.  Last night, President Trump stood feet from here and spoke about the need and his commitment to regulatory reform.  I would like to echo those comments. One of the chief reasons the voters sent most of us here is because they know that Federal regulation is killing our economy and placing a heavy burden on families. I am proud to deliver on a promise I made during the campaign, and to have done so in the first 100 days. The OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act codifies the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, known as OIRA serves as the regulatory gatekeeper, a safety valve, providing a process and review to hold back the floodgates of unnecessary burdensome and duplicative regulations.  OIRA is a bipartisan office within the executive branch that was originally created during the Reagan administration and further outlined by President Clinton in an executive order. President Clinton put it well when he said:  ``The American people deserve a regulatory system that works for them, not against them: a regulatory system that protects and improves their health, safety, environment, and well-being and improves the performance of the economy without imposing unacceptable or unreasonable costs on society; regulatory policies that recognize that the private sector and private markets are the best engine for economic growth; regulatory approaches that respect the role of State, local, and tribal governments; and regulations that are effective, consistent, sensible, and understandable.''  I agree with President Clinton's words in 1993. This is about making sure government solves problems, rather than creates them. And create them, it has.  In recent years, the regulatory state has grown to impressive levels. Between 2006 and 2015, agencies published over 36,000 final rules, of which 555 were considered economically significant. That is, they anticipated an economic effect of $100 million or more.  Many of these regulations have been imposed without thorough cost-benefit analysis, placing huge burdens on families and businesses. What is worse, Americans have had little, if any, influence on regulations that impact their lives as unelected bureaucrats regularly have exceeded their authority while imposing regulations that negatively impact them. It is our responsibility as the people's representatives to protect them from this ever-expanding regulatory state.  This bill is simple and plain. The bill locks into place existing transparency requirements like the unified agenda and the annual regulatory plan.  The bill also requires OIRA to tell us more about what they are currently doing.  After OIRA conducts a review of significant regulations, H.1009 requires OIRA to give us a readout. Imagine that, we want them to tell us what they are doing. How did the agency do? Is the regulation well drafted? Did the agency meet the requirements of the law? That is a novel approach. Did the agency pick the best way to regulate? OIRA is already required to conduct this review under Executive Order 12886.  The bill asks OIRA to tell us the results. I am surprised and disappointed that even on this bill we have seen significant opposition.  My minority counterparts have made complaints based on strained legal arguments, but they haven't offered an amendment to fix the alleged problem. Why? Because they don't like the basic concepts of the bill. These are not partisan concepts. We have heard their concerns in committee. We obviously disagree at this point. And as the chairman said, this is passed by committee without amendment. We look forward to support, and I ask my colleagues to support the bill.

156,topic-id,431,"Mr.Chair, this amendment makes technical changes to H.1009 to ensure consistency in dates and terms, require OIRA to review significant guidance, and prohibit authorization of additional funds. It allows OIRA 4 weeks to review the Unified Agenda submissions, requires a mutual agreement to extend the regulatory review beyond 90 days, and requires a written explanation of each 30 days of the extension.  That is critical. They must explain to us, to the people, any extension.  It clarifies the timing of the post-review disclosure to occur as soon as the agency makes the proposed final rule public, clarifies that disclosure of interagency communication is limited to exchanges with senior-level OIRA staff, requires a written explanation[[Page H1439]]for any exempt regulations, and expands OIRA to review the guidance document per a Bush-era executive order.                              {time}  1645  This amendment primarily makes technical changes to the bill that were developed in consultation with OIRA staff. We took their concerns and suggestions into account, and we incorporated most of those in this amendment. For example, this amendment clarifies the review extension process that has been the subject of some conversation here.  Our minority counterparts have claimed that OIRA has 90 days, plus a 30-day extension to review under current executive order. That is clearly not true under the executive order or in practice. Under the Obama administration, OIRA review, at times, exceeded 2 years without explanation. This limitless extension is permissible under the governing executive order, which allows an automatic 30-day extension at the request of OIRA and a limitless extension at the request of the agency.  We have heard that when OIRA needs that additional time, they simply call up an agency and ask for an extension. So this bill requires transparency in the review process, puts limits on that, and requires the disclosure of that.  OIRA has suggested the term is a mutual agreement between the agencies so that, in fact, we could put limits on the review and extension process.  Another important addition to this amendment is that we are extending OIRA's review to guidance documents. This is not a new practice. In 2007, President Bush issued Executive Order 13422, which extended OIRA's review to guidance documents.  While President Obama rescinded that executive order, OIRA Administrator Shelanski affirmed to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee in the past Congress that OIRA should continue the practice of reviewing significant guidance documents.  These guidance documents will only rise to the level of OIRA review if they meet the significant standard.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

373,topic-id,811,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.1004 is sponsored by Representative Tim Walberg, my colleague from Cosponsors include Representative Farenthold, Representative Meadows, Representative Gosar, and myself.  I rise today in support of H.1004, the Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017.  Every year, agencies promulgate thousands of new regulations and impose billions of dollars in regulatory costs on the American public. Those rules are conceived of, developed, written, and imposed by unelected agency officials--bureaucrats.  In return for the authority to issue regulations, Congress and the American people require two simple things from agencies. First, agencies must inform the public about their intended regulatory actions--early and accurately--to provide ample time for thoughtful feedback and consideration from the public. Second, we want the agencies to listen to what the public has to say about the proposed regulatory action.  Making sure the public has an opportunity to participate in this process is key. The public comment period is an essential part of upholding our democratic values. It ensures Americans have a voice heard in the Federal Government's regulatory process.  H.1004 helps preserve and strengthen the integrity of the public comment process in several ways. First, the bill defines the parameters of how an agency should communicate when asking for and offering a proposal and asking for public feedback. H.1004 requires the agency to identify itself in communications on the proposal. Imagine that. We ask them to identify themselves. The agency must clearly state whether it is accepting comments or considering alternatives.  Most importantly, agency communications during this process must use a neutral, unbiased tone. This bill requires agencies to do only what you would expect them to do if the request for feedback was genuine and sincere. This bill will uphold the purpose and value of the notice and comment process enshrined in the Administrative Procedures  When issuing new regulations, agencies must provide notice of the regulation and accept comments from the public before finalizing the regulation. Often, regulated entities, small businesses, and subject-matter experts can provide new insights and perspectives agency officials simply do not have and do not understand. The notice and comment period allows the public to provide valuable insight to the agencies to help them make better regulations, more effective regulations, and minimize the adverse impacts.  However, not every agency takes this opportunity to really listen to the public. Often, agencies develop a proposed regulation and assume it is the end of the story. In effect, agencies reduce the notice and comment process to checking the box.  A perfect example, unfortunately, is when EPA developed the waters of the United States rule, known as WOTUS, EPA's behavior during the notice and comment period indicated that the EPA had little interest in listening to the public. Quite the contrary.  EPA used Thunderclap, an online social media platform, to disseminate government-sourced messages through unaffiliated individuals to encourage the public to provide positive comments. They did not identify themselves and used a third party to source comments that would support their[[Page H1470]]perspective. The goal was clearly to pad the administrative record with positive feedback rather than soliciting genuine input in an effort to measure the rule's effect on the public.  In fact, the Government Accountability Office found the EPA undertook a covert propaganda campaign by soliciting social media comments in support of their proposed rule. Let me say that again: a covert propaganda campaign.  GAO also told EPA to report this violation to the President and Congress because the agency's appropriations were not available for those prohibited purposes. They spent taxpayer money--our money--on something that was prohibited.  H.1004, the Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017, seeks to shine a light on how agencies are communicating about pending regulatory actions. This bill simply tells agencies they need to keep to the facts and avoid soliciting support when they ought to be soliciting comments.  H.1004 also establishes transparency requirements for the agency in how it communicates to the public. The bill requires agencies to post on their website some basic information about each communication about a pending regulatory action. For each communication, the public will be able to see a copy of the communication, the intended audience, the method of communication, and the date it was issued--simple transparency expectations. Additionally, H.1004 requires agencies to post information online about each of their regulatory actions.  Mr.Chairman, the Regulatory Integrity Act will bring integrity back to the rulemaking process with transparency and simple guidelines for effective and appropriate communication.  The Regulatory Integrity Act is a good, bipartisan bill. This bill received support in the previous Congress, and the House of Representatives passed the bill last  On February 14, 2017, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform approved this bill without amendment.  I thank Congressman Walberg for his leadership on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

379,topic-id,363,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, one thing is clear to me, even as a freshman: we need to correct the record here.  My colleague from the minority suggests that somehow, magically, the GAO just determined they were the police officer, they cried foul, they stopped them.  Let's be clear about this. First, the GAO intervened because they were asked to do so by Chairman They investigated after the chairman asked them to look into it because of the concerns; not in advance, not because they found it independently, but because it was such a significant and egregious action that the chairman of the committee said: We need to look at this. And they did so.  Second, it was after the fact. What they found was that it was so extraordinarily egregious, they actually cited them for inappropriately spending taxpayer money.  Now, let's talk about what they did. We talk about chilling communication. Knowingly, why would you put out something on a social media site such as Thunderclap sourcing messages, not identifying yourself, if for any other purpose but to create propaganda? Why would you do that?  H.1004 simply requires--and I will repeat them, because the minority seems to have a problem understanding this--the agency identified itself in its communication on a proposal: hello, this is the We are talking about this problem.  They make clear they are accepting public comments for and against: What do you think about it; what are the problems; will this work? Imagine that concept.  They require that agencies provide feedback on the comments that is genuine and sincere and not have already written the final bill--as my colleagues says, the perfunctory process.  That is what it requires. I have a difficult time understanding how that chills input from the public. And to be absolutely blunt with you, if it chills a few bureaucrats from deciding what they think is best rather than what this body believes is best, or, frankly, what the courts believe is best, then we have achieved our objective here today.

96,topic-id,460,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment is very simple. It just says that the provisions of the SCRUB Act will not apply to any rule or set of rules relating to any obligation of the Federal Government with respect to tribal government or supporting tribal sovereignty and self-determination.  Mr.Chair, the United States has a unique legal and political relationship with Indian tribal governments, as outlined in the Constitution, treaties, statutes, executive orders, and judicial decisions. However, too often they have been overlooked when it comes to Federal policies that will have a direct impact on that relationship and that sovereignty.  My concern is that, without explicit language, H.998 would simply continue this mistake, which has had devastating consequences for our Native American brothers and sisters. It has been a decades-long policy of the Federal Government to engage Native American tribes in a government-to-government relationship that respects their right to self-government and self-determination, and my amendment seeks to ensure that nothing in this bill will undermine those efforts.  My amendment would exempt rules that will have an impact on this government-to-government relationship from the bill's requirements. This will, of course, require agencies and this commission to examine the impact on this special relationship in each rule that they bring to the chopping block. It makes clear that protecting the sovereignty and promoting the economic, political, and social self-determination for the Native American community remains a pressing priority.  Now, just 2 days ago, Mr.Chairman, the House considered and passed a bill, H.228, the Indian Employment, Training and Related Services Consolidation Act, to make permanent a program that allows tribes to combine up to 13 different Federal, employment, childcare, and job training funding sources.  Of course, the sponsor of this legislation, Representative Don Young, a true champion for Native Americans, described it well. He said: ``This program is what tribal self-determination is all about. Tribes understand their members best and know how to use these tools for creating expanding job opportunities in their communities.''  The same thing with NAHASDA, which has a lot of innovations, and I have worked with Congressman Steve Pearce and Representative Cole and others. Once NAHASDA reauthorization becomes law, it, too, might fall short because of this particular bill. I fear that the SCRUB Act's reckless rush to repeal rules based primarily only on one consideration, cost to the economy, will adversely affect Native  How will members of this commission be experts on the sovereignty and government-to-government relationship with tribes? There is no appointee for Native American communities on this commission, on the needs of native communities, on efforts by Congress to promote self-determination.

573,topic-id,1539,"Mr.President, the matter pending before the Senate this morning is the nomination of Rick Perry to be Secretary of Energy, and I have come to the floor to speak to that nomination.  As with Representative Zinke, whom we confirmed to be Secretary of the Interior just yesterday, I am equally proud to support Governor Perry's nomination. I know colleagues from both sides of the aisle will be joining me as we make statements in support of this individual to our new President's  Before that though, here's a little bit on Governor Perry's background. He is one who has devoted his life--literally decades of his life--to public service. After graduating from Texas A&M, he joined the U.Air He piloted C-130 tactical airlift aircraft in Europe as well as in the Middle He has served as a State representative, agriculture commissioner, Lieutenant Governor, and of course Governor of  During his time as Governor, Rick Perry showed that economic growth and environmental stewardship cannot only survive and coexist, but that they can really thrive. Over the course of 14 years, Texas added 2.2 million jobs, saw its population grow by more than 6 million people, and at the same time he had this robust growth within his State's population, the State reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by 17 percent, reduced its sulfur dioxide emissions by 56 percent, and reduced its nitrous oxide emissions by 66 percent. So in most States where you have a considerable plus-up in your population and a growing economy, you also see growing levels of impact, growing levels of emission. However Governor Perry dealt with this head-on, and we saw the results over the course of 14 years in the State of  He led an effort to decommission older and dirtier power plants. He prioritized the development of emerging and innovative technologies, including carbon sequestration and capture. As a result of his leadership in the State of Texas, that State now leads our Nation in producing more wind energy than all but five other countries.[[Page S1550]]  Coming from the State of Alaska, as the Presiding Officer and I do, we recognize that we are labeled as an oil Well, Texas certainly has been labeled as an oil-producing Yet under Governor Perry's leadership, we have seen Texas lead the Nation in producing more wind energy than all but five other countries. For those who may come to the floor and suggest that, somehow or another, Governor Perry is anti-environment or bring up the issue of climate change and suggest that he does not support care for our environment, that is simply not the case, and clearly in his case, actions speak louder than words.  As Texas's longest serving Governor, Rick Perry guided a large, diverse and very complex State government to economic success. Again, when we are talking about States, Alaska is always out there bragging about our size, but if Texas were its own country, it would be the 12th largest economy in the world. So it is one thing to talk about size just by way of geography, but I think it is important--when we are talking about economic contribution, the size of Texas as the 12th largest economy in the world is pretty significant.  What happened in the State of Texas? Not only did the people of Texas give their endorsement to Governor Perry to ask him to serve again as Governor, they gave him their endorsement for his work by reelecting him to office not once but twice--14 years. Governor Perry is a principled leader, and that will serve him well as he takes the helm at the Department of  DOE has a very important mission, ranging from the maintenance of our nuclear weapons stockpile to the research and development of new energy technologies. At the same time it is also a department, a bureaucracy, something that I think we recognize. It is large. It is cumbersome, with tens of thousands of employees and contractors. I think the example Governor Perry showed as the State leader of Texas is an example that will do well at the Department of Energy--capable of really setting a good direction for the  It has been suggested that he is not one of them in the sense that he is not an award-winning scientist, but, as I mentioned at his hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, you do not necessarily need to have a scientist to lead other scientists; you need to have somebody who is a good, strong, competent, capable manager. That is what Governor Perry has demonstrated, and that is what the Department of Energy needs. He will hold his employees and contractors accountable. We know he will be a responsible steward of taxpayer dollars.  I think he will work to continue to break down the research silos that have frustrated the Department and work to find ways where there can be greater collaboration, greater working together.  I am also confident that he will pursue policies that will ultimately provide us with more energy, more stable sources of energy for us where--unfortunately, we have great sources of energy, but it is high cost. We need to be working with the Department of We need collaboration there to do what we can to reduce the cost of energy, as well as reduce the amount of energy we consume. By supporting basic research, encouraging scientific exploration, and fostering innovation, the Department will increase access to energy, make it more affordable, and continue to improve its environmental performance.  We have 17 National We are very proud of them. These National Labs are at the heart of those efforts. I have had good conversations with Governor He reaffirmed in our committee hearing that he clearly recognizes and values the work done by the men and women at our National  One area, which we do not cover within our Committee on Energy and Natural Resources but which is a big part of DOE's mission, is the maintenance and the protection of America's nuclear weapons. Governor Perry recognizes the importance of that mission, and he is committed to working with experts at the NNSA to maintain a proper stockpile stewardship program.  I believe Governor Perry will also put his management experience to work on a challenge that has really vexed the Department and affected States for a long period of time. He recognizes that we must clean up the legacy wastes that have been left behind by our nuclear weapons programs, particularly at the largest of these sites in Washington My hope is that, through his leadership, the Office of Environmental Management can finally move off of GAO's high-risk list. I know these conversations have been had with many members on the committee. It has been pressed as a priority. But, again, ensuring that we deal with these legacy waste sites has to be a priority.  I will reiterate that my hope is that Governor Perry will help address the crisis of rural energy prices in Alaska, as well as in other parts of the country where unfortunately we face high energy costs.  The Department must do a better job of partnering with institutions. In our State of Alaska, we have the opportunity to work with DOE collaboratively. We have been the incubators of good ideas, whether it is in energy microgrids or in some of the other pioneering way, we have done it because of necessity. We have no other options. We look to our institutions to find these good ideas, build on them, and work to bring down the costs and transition our many remote communities that are still relying on diesel power. Far too many of our communities are still dependent on diesel and that is just not right.  So working with Alaska--allow us to be that proving ground for the Department of Allow us to be that place where we can first deploy some of these new ideas, these innovative ideas, these projects to help lower the costs and really make a difference in people's lives.  Again, I am proud to be here to support Governor Perry's nomination. I believe he has the management experience we need in the Department of Energy right now to help pursue scientific discovery and to promote innovation, to maintain and safeguard our nuclear weapons stockpile, to make progress on the cleanup of legacy waste, and to partner with States like Alaska that suffer from high energy costs.  I think we recognize that he has his work cut out for him, but we are counting on him to fulfill those responsibilities and to keep the Department of Energy as one that we look to for true leadership not only here in the United States but around the world.

As I mentioned earlier, Governor Perry has devoted his life to public service. During his 14 years as Governor of Texas, he championed an ``all of the above'' energy strategy, and led his State to tremendous economic growth. He was a good steward of the environment as he worked to find ways to grow the economy and worked toward achieving major reductions in emission levels in the State of  As I said this morning, Governor Perry is a principled leader.

He will help us build the infrastructure we need to become a global energy superpower and partner with States, like my State of Alaska, that suffer from very high energy costs.  He has a strong record. Governor Perry gets results. He is a competent manager and I think a proven leader. I am pleased to be able to support his confirmation.

963,topic-id,2314,"Mr.President, I am pleased the Senate is at the point we are this morning. Last night, we agreed to proceed to consideration of H.44, which will overturn the Bureau of Land Management's Planning 2.0 The House has considered this already. They passed this resolution on a strong bipartisan basis. It was a 48-vote margin. They did this just before the February recess, and so it is now in front of the  As the sponsor of the Senate version, I have come to the floor now to explain to colleagues why this BLM Planning 2.0 Rule is such a bad rule and to urge its nullification.  There are probably a lot of folks that are asking the question: BLM Planning 2.0, what is it? It is not just folks that are listening, it is colleagues here. What exactly is Planning 2.0 and what exactly does Planning 2.0 do? A lot of people are saying: I never heard of this one. Where did it come from? Based on that, I think a lot of context is in order as we begin this debate.  The Bureau of Land Management is a Federal agency that manages 245 million acres of land in 12 Western States, along with 700 million acres of Federal and non-Federal subsurface estate.  Congress has directed the BLM to manage those lands according to the Federal Land Policy and Management That is too long to say. So we just refer to it as It serves as the agency's organic act. It mandates a multiple-use mission for BLM lands. I think it is important to always remember that. BLM is required to manage under the concept of multiple use. It lays out a planning process for its mission. It establishes a special status relationship between the Federal Government and the States and the local governments that are affected by the agency's resource management plans.  I think it is important, as we are focusing on the BLM right now, that we remember that BLM lands are not national parks or wildlife refuges. They are not wild and scenic rivers or wilderness. BLM lands are working lands. They are valuable--not because they might contain a Mount Denali, like up north, or the Grand Canyon--but rather because these lands contain energy and minerals and they can be used. Again, this is the multiple-use concept. They can be used for grazing. They can be used for recreation and many other purposes.  They are valuable in this way and as such are a leading source of good jobs for families and communities all across the BLM's management of western lands has never been without controversy. That is part of the reason that the last administration decided to overhaul the regulations that guide the planning process. The stated goals from the administration were to create a better process that would increase transparency, increase public involvement, and reduce the amount of time it takes to develop a resource management plan.  So those clearly all sound like good ideas, good goals. Unfortunately, the reason we are here today seeking to overturn this planning 2.0 rule is that[[Page S1610]]the BLM absolutely failed to achieve any of those three goals. Instead of greater transparency, BLM delivered a new process that ensures less transparency. Instead of expanding public participation, Western States are looking at fewer and weaker opportunities to influence the management of local lands.  Planning 2.0 also turns the relationship between federal, state, and the local governments on its head. It just really turns it upside down. What actually happens then is that it has effectively subverted FLPMA, shattering the special status arrangement that the West is supposed to have under the Federal law.  As a Senator for the State of Alaska when this rule came out, I looked critically at it and I have problems with many aspects of the rule. I know I am joined by nearly all of my western colleagues and many who are not from the West but who have taken the time to understand how our land management laws are supposed to work and who have looked critically at this rule.  The more my staff and I have unpacked the Planning 2.0 Rule, the less we like it and the greater is our conviction that this rule should be overturned through the Congressional Review That is why we are here. I could go on for quite some time, but for purposes of this statement, I will list this morning my four main criticisms, all of which compound each other and show why this rule must be repealed.  First of all, Planning 2.0 seeks to transition to a landscape-level approach for land management planning. It is not a bad concept on its own, really. I don't have any problem with BLM determining, for instance, where our solar resources are located, but to make that a defining measure and to make that a defining feature of a resource management plan is a bad idea.  It all but assures that new and revised plans will not have the level of detail or specificity that is needed to properly manage our local resources. It allows for planning areas to cross State lines without regard to the competing priorities of neighboring It does not ensure that existing State and local plans will be consistent. It is very obvious that BLM will deploy it as a mechanism to reduce or perhaps to eliminate many reasonable uses of Federal land that provide jobs and support communities all across the  The second criticism I have is that Planning 2.0 allows BLM officials to remove the decisionmaking authority from our field offices and our State directors, and it tends to centralize that power at BLM headquarters. So for those of us in the West, we are looking at a situation where effectively the management decisions of our land are being taken from those who are on the ground, people who really understand the conditions and are those who are most impacted by it. It shifts it back East to be decided by those who don't have that same local understanding, who might not really have any understanding as to the areas and why this is so important.  So centralizing power at BLM headquarters, in my view, is never the right direction. I am not suggesting that this is going to happen every time with every decision. However it could happen at any time, whenever a future administration decides that a decision needs to be made at the headquarters level rather than locally. So now, at a moment's notice--perhaps without even any notice at all--decisionmaking authority can be taken away from a Western State with expertise and effectively siloed here in Washington, That is not the direction to be taken.  The third area of concern I have is that Planning 2.0 reduces the ability of western stakeholders to provide input into the land management process, as well as their stature within it. So, again, it compounds the fact that you are shifting decisionmaking authority back here to the By further limiting stakeholders' input, that is very problematic.  Now, the agency has talked a good game about public participation. But if you read the rule, what it effectively does is just kind of front-load public input while cutting later opportunities for feedback. If left in place, Planning 2.0 would ensure BLM would be able to maximize its decisionmaking power while at the same time effectively sidelining input from Western  We previously were in a situation where western stakeholders had a seat on the stage before this rule, but under it they are really demoted. They are effectively demoted to a middle row in the mezzanine as part of a bigger crowd, but with no special status. I think it is important to keep that in context.  The fourth area of concern is that BLM 2.0 weakens and eliminates the requirements in FLPMA that require BLM to coordinate planning and resource uses with our States and local governments. Under this rule, BLM shifts the burden for making sure that resource management plans are consistent with State and local governments plans away from itself and onto the States and onto the local governments. That is not right.  The agency is also limiting the opportunities that those government have to identify and remedy deficiencies within and across plans wherever they may be found.  So here are a couple of examples this morning for the Senate, just to illustrate why so many of us are concerned about this and are opposed to Planning 2.0. You have to ask yourself: Is it fair and is it really what Congress intended, for a western stakeholder to have the same voice and influence over the management of their local lands as any other member of the general public from anywhere else, with no connection, no relationship to these areas?  To be more specific, should a small placer miner in Chicken, Alaska, or a cattle grazer in Nevada be relegated to the same status as a lawyer in, say, Vermont who has never visited either Chicken, Alaska, or rural Nevada? My answer to this is pretty easy. It is a simple no. But that is what awaits us under Planning 2.0.  So here is a real world example of what Planning 2.0 will mean on the ground. Last year, the BLM finalized a resource management plan for 6.5 million acres of eastern Interior Much of that plan was developed in accordance with the principles of Planning 2.0. So what does it actually look like for us up there in Alaska, in the eastern Interior area?  The plan closes nearly three-quarters of the 40-mile district, where the only economic activity, really, is placer mining--small placer mining. They closed it to mineral entry. More than 1 million acres are withdrawn into what they call ``areas of critical environmental concern''. This is a land management tool that BLM has used more and more in recent years to sidestep Congress's sole authority to designate Federal wilderness.  So the agency sought public comment, but it was limited public comment. Then it effectively ignored the comments that it did receive. Ultimately, very few Alaskans were able to participate in the development of the plan, and even fewer Alaskans are happy with the final outcome of the plan. As we expected and as we feared, the Planning 2.0 process was used to shut down a reasonable use of Federal land that the last administration just did not like. This was done even though it enjoys overwhelming support among local residents who really depend on it for their livelihood.  The Planning 2.0 process was also used to close off Federal lands to the public in violation of the ``no more'' clauses within ANILCA, or the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, even though there was no imminent threat or reason to do so. So, as colleagues are considering how they will cast their vote on this resolution of disapproval, I am sure, again, that many had not really focused on this Planning 2.0 before. Most of them would never be able to find Chicken, Alaska, on a map, and they are thinking: This is not going to impact me. I am not from the  But for those of us in the West, if you live in one of the 12 Western States that have BLM land, believe me, you are impacted. I would suggest that what we are seeing, starting in Alaska, is something that simply won't stay up there. If this rule is allowed to remain in place, you will see that move through all of our Western  BLM maintains and periodically revises dozens of resource management plans in its 12 Western states. So if Planning 2.0 stays on the books, I think what it will do is it will harm our Nation's energy producers. I think it will harm our mineral developers. I think it will harm those who rely on[[Page S1611]]Federal lands for grazing. It will most certainly cost us jobs. It will cost us economic opportunity, and it will hurt the communities and the people of our Western  I would ask that you don't just take my word for this. Six counties from six different States have challenged this rule as impairing the informational and coordination rights of local governments. They believe that it violates FLPMA and that BLM has failed to properly evaluate the impact that it will have. I think they have a very strong case. This is a fatally flawed rule. Our best option is to overturn it while we have the ability to do so under the Congressional Review Act and to hold BLM accountable to the underlying statute and its multiple-use mission. If we can agree to do that today, we can then work with our new Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, to make genuine improvements to the BLM land management planning process. I know that Secretary Zinke cares about our public lands. He understands these issues, and I think he is dedicated to ensuring that we get this right.  I would like to close by thanking the roughly 80 stakeholder groups that are supporting our disapproval resolution. I also thank the 17 Senators who are cosponsoring the Senate version of it. I thank the new administration, which has released a statement of policy in support of it. I also acknowledge and thank Representative Cheney and Chairman Bishop in the House, who led the resolution through the House with good bipartisan support a couple of weeks back.  It is now the Senate's turn to act on this. It is our turn to recognize why this rule deserves to be overturned. For the good of our Western States, let's send this disapproval resolution to the President's desk.  With that, I again urge the Senate to support House Joint Resolution 44.  I yield the floor.

990,topic-id,896,"Mr.President, we are coming to the end of debate on the disapproval resolution for the BLM Planning 2.0 I would like to take just a few minutes to highlight the very broad support it has drawn here on Capitol Hill but really across the country.  Here in the Senate, I mentioned earlier that there is a total of 17 Members who have joined me in sponsoring our version of this resolution. That is nearly one-fifth of this It includes every Republican from a Western State with BLM lands within its borders. These are Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Nebraska, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, Nevada, Montana, even Kentucky, and the State of the occupant of the Chair, North Dakota, and Oklahoma, so a very strong contingent of Members who are in support of this disapproval resolution.  Across the Capitol, the House of Representatives passed this resolution with bipartisan support a couple of weeks ago through the leadership of Representative Cheney of This resolution wound up with 234 votes in the That is a pretty strong vote.  The reason why so many Members of the House and the Senate want to overturn BLM's planning 2.0 Rule is pretty simple. We know what it means for our Western We don't like the impacts that it will have and neither do a wide variety of elected officials and stakeholders back home.  In my State of Alaska, I have heard from the Alaska Municipal League, the Alaska Farm Bureau, and the Associated General Contractors of The Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce wrote to ask us to overturn the rule. The Alaska Chamber wrote in support of our resolution because they said BLM's planning process ``has grown to be substantially lengthier, more confusing, and burdensome for stakeholders to engage in.''  We have heard from our leaders in the Alaska State Legislature, State Senators Pete Kelly and John Coghill, who have asked for this rule to be nullified, as have several of our Alaska Native corporations, including CIRI, Olgoonik, and Calista The Alaska chapter of the Safari Club opposes it because its landscape-level approach to land management planning has the potential to withdraw and lock up even more land in  Alaska's energy, mineral, and timber producers are united in their opposition to this rule and in their support of our disapproval resolution. We have heard from the Resource Development Council, the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, the Alaska Forest Association, the Council of Alaska Producers, the Alaska Support Industry Alliance, the Fortymile Mining District, and the Alaska Miners Association, and they all oppose BLM's planning 2.0 Rule because it reduces economic opportunities for Alaskans--those who actually live near these BLM lands, who know[[Page S1624]]the most about them, and who depend on them to provide for their families.  It is the same story in many other Western States, from Arizona and New Mexico to Washington and Oregon, to Montana and South This rule affects all 12 BLM States, and those States just are not happy about it.

The National Association of Counties, the voice of county governments all across the country, sent a letter outlining their support for the disapproval resolution. Another group, the National Association of Conservation Districts, wrote that planning 2.0 should be repealed because it ``skirts the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and reduces the ability of local government involvement'' while seeming ``forced and blind to the many issues raised in the public comment period.''  Again, this disapproval resolution has drawn strong support from a wide range of stakeholder groups--energy, mining, and grazing, America's farmers and ranchers, State officials, local counties, and conservation districts. Everything from the Alaska Trucking Association to the Public Lands Council and the U.Chamber of Commerce have all weighed in. At last count, more than 80 groups had asked us to repeal BLM's planning 2.0 Rule, and I am sure there are many others that are not included in that count.

317,topic-id,2581,"Mr.President, last night, President Trump began his speech with an appropriate reference to the anti-Semitic attacks that have occurred all over the country. Two bomb threats were called into a Jewish community center in the New Haven area in I visited that center and the staff and the kids of that center, who are now being housed in a nearby synagogue. He also condemned, in strong terms, the murder of a young man in Kansas City, the victim of an apparent hate crime, targeted for simply being a foreigner or being of a different religion. We can't know exactly what the reason was, but it was an attack based on hate.  I want to tell my colleagues a little bit about that young man, to begin with, as a means of, once again, coming to the floor of the Senate to tell my colleagues about the victims of gun violence in this country--the 86 or so[[Page S1531]]people every day who are taken by guns, suicides, and murders and accidental shootings; the 2,600 people a month whose lives are taken through gun violence, and the 31,000 a year. By the way, that number is just the number of people who are killed. Those are the lives that are eliminated. There are another 75,000 every year who are injured by gun fire, whose lives are irrevocably altered by that act of violence.  Srinivas Kuchibhotla was a 32-year-old engineer. He was working for He was just hanging out at a bar. It was Austin's Bar and Grill, and he was enjoying the company of friends. Witnesses saw a man enter the bar. He was agitated, and he was drunk. He was a patron of the bar. He had left and he reentered, and he began shooting at Srinivas and his friend. Witnesses say that the shooter told Srinivas to ``get out of my country'' before killing him and then critically injuring his friend and an unbelievably brave bystander who tried to stop the shooter.  Hundreds of grief-stricken family members and friends gathered in his hometown in India for this young man's funeral. In accordance with Hindu tradition, his body was carried on a carriage and his ashes were laid to rest. Friends said that his mother was absolutely wailing as the carriage went by.  His mother had wondered whether America was a safe place for her son. Months before the shooting, she asked him to return to India if he was feeling insecure, but he told her he was safe, that he was fine. His wife also wondered how safe it would be to stay in the United States, but she said that Srinivas always assured her that only good things could happen to good people.  He undoubtedly was a good person. His family members remember him as the kindest person you would meet. He was, in their words, ``full of love, care and compassion for everyone. He never uttered a word of hatred, simple gossip, or a careless comment.''  His friends and family members remember him as ``brilliant, well-mannered and simply an outstanding human being.''  He was ``a very sharp, top-of-his-class kind of guy,'' said one of his classmates at the University of Texas at El Paso where Srinivas earned a master's degree in electrical and electronic engineering. He was also an avid cricket player and a big fan of cricket as well.  He was 32 years old. He was sitting at a bar, enjoying time with his friends when a man who was at the bar, who probably saw Srinivas, thought that he looked different from him and, filled with hate, walked back into the bar and shot and killed him.  That is only one story from that day. On average, there are 85 other stories across the country in which people lose their lives to gunfire. What made me so mad last night was that after that moment--that appropriate moment in which President Trump talked about this horrible shooting--moments later, he referenced the daily slaughter that happens in our cities. He spoke in front of the joint session for, it seemed, nearly an hour and a half and offered absolutely no solutions to do anything about the cascading gun violence that is enveloping our  Irony of all ironies, the same week that he is lamenting, eulogizing Srinivas's death in Kansas City, he is signing a law passed by this body that would allow for more people with serious mental illness to get their hands on guns.  We don't know the full story of Adam Purinton yet, but you have to imagine that this was someone who was deeply disturbed. Maybe he was just drunk, but in order to decide to pull out a gun in a bar and shoot someone just because they look different than you do probably means that there is something going on--more than a few beers. Mr.Purinton probably had some stuff going on. He might have been mentally ill.  When I got here, I thought that one of the few things we agreed upon--Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives--was that if you were seriously mentally ill, you probably shouldn't be able to buy a weapon, not because people with a mental illness are inherently dangerous--that is not true at all--but because erring on the side of caution when it comes to someone who is seriously ill would probably be the safe thing to do. That used to be a bipartisan commitment.  A few weeks ago, this body passed a law to allow tens of thousands of people who have serious mental illness, who have been judged by a government agency to be so sick that they can't manage their own financial affairs, they literally can't cash a check, their Social Security check has to be sent to someone else because they can't manage their affairs--we passed a law to allow those people to buy guns.  Spare me your concern for the victims of gun violence if you are not willing to do anything about it and, in fact, you are going to take steps to make gun violence more likely rather than less likely in this country. So 31,000 people a year, 2,600 a month, 86 a day--there is no other country in the world in which this happens. There is no other country in the world in which these numbers of people are dying from guns. It is our fault because week after week, month after month, year after year, we do nothing about it, and now we are making it worse.  In the 4 years after Sandy Hook happened, I went back to tell people that we had done nothing. That was embarrassing enough. Now I have to go back to the families of Sandy Hook and tell people that when Congress thinks about gun violence, we think about making changes in the law to make gun violence more likely, to put more guns into the hands of dangerous people. We are going backward now.  Teresa Robertson owned a floral shop in a beauty shop in Fairfax, Fairfax is a really small town, a really tight-knit community. It is still on edge because about a week ago, Teresa's estranged husband walked into the store, started shooting at Teresa, and then barricaded himself inside city hall, firing shots at the local police, who returned fire, fatally killing Teresa's husband.  She had filed a protective order against her husband about 2 weeks before because she feared for her life. She filed for divorce a week later, and a week following that, he shot her.  Laws can protect against something like that, right? We have the power to stop that. In Connecticut, if you file a protective order against a spouse who you believe is going to harm you, the police have the ability to take those weapons away for the period of time in which you were adjudicating that protective order.  If that law had been in effect in Oklahoma, maybe Teresa Robertson would still be alive today and maybe her husband would still be alive and maybe their two kids--ages 13 and 16--wouldn't be without both of their parents.  The fact is, every single day, domestic partners--women primarily--are killed or are shot by boyfriends or estranged husbands. It often plays out just like this: protective order, divorce filing, murder. That is on us.  We have the ability to protect women from their estranged husbands. There are laws. We can't stop every shooting, but it certainly can cut down on these numbers.  Two days later, emergency responders found 26-year-old Michael ``Shane'' Watkins bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound to the head on Berkshire Avenue in Bridgeport, He died shortly after arriving at the hospital. The police are still investigating the shooting, but they believe that Shane was an innocent victim of a robbery that went bad.  His friends said that Shane was someone who was always laughing, who was always smiling, who had a good heart, was a caring person. A neighbor said that Shane was ``always upbeat, always joking, always smiling.'' This was a good kid.  He was a dedicated family man. He was a long time employee of the local Stop & He was 26 years old. This was a robbery gone bad. Shane Watkins was one of those 86.  Twelve-year-old Kanari Gentry Bowers was playing basketball with friends in Chicago, IL, at Henderson Elementary A stray bullet hit her on February 11. For 4 awful, agonizing days, Kanari sat lying unconscious in the hospital with a bullet lodged in her 12-year-old spine before she died on February 15.  Her family released a statement that said: ``Please keep your children close and do whatever it takes to protect them from the senseless gun violence in our city.''[[Page S1532]]  That doesn't sound exceptional, does it? ``Please keep your children close and do whatever it takes to protect them.'' Think about that idea. Think about the idea that you can't let your children get far away from you in Chicago today because they are not at risk of getting lost; they are at risk of being shot.  The little girl had dreams of becoming a judge. That is not something that a lot of 12-year-old girls are thinking about, but Kanari wanted to be a judge. She was described as a vivacious young girl.  I hear President Trump talk about Chicago all the time. He talks about Chicago as though he cares, but he doesn't propose anything that would reduce the trajectory of gun violence, the horror of living in neighborhoods that you can't let your child stray more than a few feet from you without fearing for their lives. He has proposed nothing to do with making that city safer.  People say Chicago has some of the toughest gun laws in the Nation, yet it is one of the most violent places. Exactly, exactly: Chicago has some of the toughest gun laws in the New York City has some of the toughest gun laws in the They are still violent places. Why? Because the vast majority of guns in those cities, the illegal guns that spread throughout the city like poison ivy come from outside of They come from In New York, they come from South They come from North They come from places in which it is easy to buy a gun without a background check at a gun show or on the internet. They flow into these cities and become used in murder after murder.  If you don't have a Federal requirement that background checks have to be conducted wherever you buy a gun, no matter how strong the laws of Chicago are, they can't be protected; 12-year-old girls can't be protected.  This was all in February, by the way. This was all in the last 3 weeks.  On February 20, some friends got together at a local church in Pomona, CA, and all of a sudden, gunshots started firing through the windows and the walls of this church--a drive-by shooting.  You know who was dead at the end of that? An 8-year-old little boy named He was adopted from an orphanage in He had been in the United States for only 3 years. His adoptive parents and his friends--you should read what they say about this kid: ``He had an infectious smile and loved everyone and everything.''  He was still learning English, but with his playful demeanor, he had adapted almost immediately to life in the United He loved wrestling with his adoptive dad, running, laughing. He loved superheroes. He was always injuring himself jumping off of something. He loved living in this country.  He was a 5-year-old in an orphanage in Taiwan, and then he was in the United States with a dad and with superhero action figures, and now he is dead because somebody fired bullets randomly into a church in Pomona,  Why don't we do anything about this? We are not so coldhearted as to be unable to understand what life is like for a mom and a dad who lose an 8-year-old child. We are not so brain-dead as to not be able to comprehend the fact that every time someone is shot, there are at least 20 people whose lives are permanently altered.  The post-traumatic stress involved in one shooting has enormous ripple effects. I have talked at length on this floor about the constant grief that envelopes my town of Sandy Hook because of what happened there. It will never end.  Now, instead of defending the status quo, we are talking about making it easier for deeply mentally ill people to get guns. A bill was just introduced on the floor of the Senate this week that would allow for someone to carry a concealed weapon anywhere in the Nation, regardless of what that local State jurisdiction wanted. If you had a concealed weapon permit in Texas, you would be able to walk into Manhattan without any way for the local police to check you out. There is even an effort to make silencers legal.  Mr.President, 31,000 a year, 2,600 a month, 86 a day. I have come down to the floor I don't know how many times--certainly not as many as Senator Whitehouse but many times to tell the stories of the victims. I told a few more this afternoon because if the data doesn't move you--again, only in this country; in no other country in the world does this happen--then maybe the stories of these victims will move you. Maybe being able to put yourself in the shoes of a mom who lost a child, of a husband who lost a wife way before their time, will move you to action.  This is only controversial here. Ninety percent of the American public wants us to move forward with the universal background checks. The majority of Americans think these super-powerful military weapons should stay in the hands of the military and law enforcement. Everybody out there wants to give law enforcement the tools and the funding necessary to carry out the existing law. It is not controversial out in the American public; it is only controversial here.  It is about time that we do something about this epic level of carnage that continues to plague our Nation and have some response to these voices of victims that seem endless.  I yield the floor.

987,topic-id,2318,"Mr.President, TrumpCare is here, and you are going to hate it. This replacement for the Affordable Care Act has been 7 years in the making. On a cursory overview, it appears that when you ask the question as to who gets hurt under the replacement plan, the answer is everyone, with the exception of insurance companies, drug companies, and the very wealthy.  I hope we are able to step back and take our time to analyze what this replacement plan is going to do to Americans who badly need healthcare, who believed Republicans when they told them that they were going to repeal the bill and replace it with something better, and who believed President Trump when he said that he was going to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something that was wonderful, that insured everybody who was insured under the Affordable Care Act and did it at lower costs.  I know that my colleagues who are well meaning in this Chamber cannot read this replacement plan and understand it to do anything but strip coverage away from millions of Americans and to drive up costs for millions of There is no credible way to look at this replacement plan without seeing the devastation that will be wrought.  I want to spend just a few minutes, now that we have had this plan to look at for 24 hours, talking about how dangerous it is and pleading with my Republican colleagues to take their time and, hopefully, decide instead to work with Democrats to try to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, fix what is not working as well, but preserve the parts that are working.  Here is what I mean when I say that everyone, with the exception of insurance companies, drug companies, and the superrich, is hurt by the GOP replacement plan. First, this idea that we are going to end the Medicaid expansion--that is what this replacement plan does. It says that in 2 years, effectively 2020, the Medicaid expansion will go away. That means in my State, 200,000 people will lose healthcare. Millions across the country will lose healthcare. They are, by and large, the poor and the lower middle class--largely women and children who can't get insurance other than through the Medicaid expansion--who will no longer be able to get it. Medicaid has been expanded in Democratic States, Republican States, blue States, red Letting Medicaid expansion hang around for 2 years is no solace to people who will jam into those years as much healthcare as they can get, but then be without it afterwards.  Even more insidious is the part of the GOP healthcare replacement plan that would turn Medicaid into a block grant after 2020. This has been talked about in conservative circles for a long time, but has been resisted, again, by Democrats and Republicans who understand what that means. It means Medicaid will eventually wither on the vine and will become a State responsibility. No longer will the Federal Government help States pick up the costs for insuring the most vulnerable citizens.  Remember who Medicaid covers. Medicaid covers 60 percent of children with disabilities in this country. Of the tens of millions of kids living with disabilities, 6 out of 10 of them get their insurance from If Medicaid is turned into a block grant, let me just tell you, let me guarantee you that healthcare will end for millions of those kids. If it does not end, it will be dramatically scaled back because States cannot afford to pick up 60, 70, 80 percent eventually of the cost.  Thirty percent of non-elderly adults with disabilities are covered by Sixty-four percent of nursing home residents are covered by Two out of every three of our senior citizens who are living in nursing homes are covered by If you block-grant Medicaid, all of a sudden States will not be able to pick up those costs and will not be able to deliver healthcare to people in nursing homes. That is just the truth.  The Republican bill effectively ends coverage for 11 million people all across this country who are covered by the Medicaid expansion after 2 years, and then it jeopardizes care for tens of millions more by dramatically cutting the Medicaid Program and the Medicaid reimbursement to This is not a game; this is 11 million people.  Remember, it is not a guess because in 2020 you will be reverting back to the rules before the Affordable Care Before the Affordable Care Act, 11 million fewer people were covered under Even if States maybe hang around and decide to front the billions of dollars necessary to cover a few million of those, you are still talking about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 million people who will lose insurance--again, people who can't buy it anywhere else. This is people's lives we are playing with--as I mentioned, 200,000 in Connecticut alone.  Do you know who else gets hurt by this replacement plan? Older It seems that older Americans are really targeted in this plan because although the underlying Affordable Care Act says that you can't charge older Americans more than three times that of younger Americans, this replacement plan changes the rules. It allows insurance companies to jack up prices on older So a 60-year-old would have their premium go up by about one-quarter. That is roughly $3,000, according to an AARP study. I don't know about the Presiding Officer, but a lot of adults getting ready to qualify for Medicare in Connecticut don't have $3,000 sitting around.  But it gets worse. Because the premium support is so skimpy, under this plan, that same 60-year-old in Connecticut would have their premium support--their tax credit--cut in half, from $8,000 down to $4,000. Do the math. That is a $9,000 increase in healthcare costs for a 60-year-old resident in That is unaffordable. There is just no way for anybody to say that for that 60-year-old living in Connecticut or living in Nebraska or living in California, that is better healthcare. Nine thousand more dollars out of pocket for a 60-year-old is not better healthcare.  The claim is that this bill will cover people with preexisting conditions, but because there is no minimum benefit requirement, the plans don't have to cover anything that you need for your preexisting condition. So, yes, they can't technically charge someone with cancer more, but they don't have to cover chemotherapy. The Affordable Care Act says insurance has to be insurance. There has to be some minimum, basic level of benefits so that everybody knows that when they buy an insurance plan, they are basically getting coverage for maternity care, for cancer treatment, for mental illness. Because this legislation strips away any requirement that insurance be insurance, maybe you get insurance if you have cancer, but it may not cover anything you have.  Of course the cruelest piece of this bill says that if you lose insurance, you then get charged more. Republicans are right that in the Affordable Care Act as it exists today, there is a penalty if you don't buy insurance. Republicans just do their penalty differently. What this replacement plan says is that if you lose insurance and you try to get it later on, you will pay 30 percent more. I admit that there is a penalty in the underlying Affordable Care Act and there is a penalty in the Republican bill, but the problem is that under the existing Affordable Care Act, the help you get to buy insurance allows you to buy insurance. That is why 20 million people have insurance today. But because the tax credits are basically cut in half under this proposal, it will render healthcare unaffordable; thus, more people will have gaps in coverage; thus, more people will pay the penalty.  So in the end, this bill really does not provide protection for people with preexisting conditions because they are not going to be able to buy insurance in the first place. They are going to fall into that gap, and then they are going to have to pay more. Even if they do have insurance, it may not even cover what they need.  All of this is made harder to understand because it seems to be one big excuse to deliver a giant tax cut to the wealthy. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that this bill would cut taxes by $600 billion for the wealthiest The Affordable Care Act was financed in part by a tax on unearned income for people making over $250,000 a year. I live in a pretty wealthy State--Connecticut--but people who are making $250,000 and a whole lot of unearned income are not amongst the most needy in our society. The average tax cut under this bill[[Page S1623]]would be $200,000. Why? Because we are taxing so few people who are making such big amounts of money, the average tax cut would be $200,000.  It is so hard to understand because when you do the sum total of parts that are moving under this replacement plan, it seems as if the biggest parts that are moving are care away from millions of poor people and the elderly and money going to the wealthiest 1 percent of That is not hyperbole; that is just how this bill works out.  The biggest net result of this bill from the status quo is that millions of people who are on Medicaid today in a few years won't have it--those are kids; those are the disabled; those are the elderly--and a handful of very wealthy Americans will make out with enormous tax cuts under this legislation.  I guess it is no secret that this bill was crafted behind closed doors. Seven years in the making, and this bill was hidden from public view until yesterday. Now House Republicans are saying they are going to give the American public 1 week to look at this. No estimate of the cost--they are going to ram it through as quickly as they can.  I held half a dozen townhalls in the summer of 2009, when the tea party tempest was at its highest, where people really wanted to talk to me about how upset they were with the way the healthcare debate was going. One of the refrains that I heard in those townhalls was that Democrats were ramming through the Affordable Care Everybody heard it. Ramming through the Affordable Care It was on FOX News every night. It was part of our townhalls regularly.  Well, let me tell you what happened in 2009. The House process spanned three committees: the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, and the Education and Labor The House had 79 bipartisan hearings and markups on the health reform bill--79 bipartisan hearings and markups. House Members spent nearly 100 hours in hearings, heard from 181 witnesses, and considered 239 amendments and accepted 121. The HELP Committee had 14 bipartisan roundtables, 13 bipartisan hearings, and 20 bipartisan walkthroughs on health reform. The HELP Committee considered nearly 300 amendments and accepted 160 Republican amendments. The Finance Committee held a similar process. When the bill came to the floor, the Senate spent 25 consecutive days in session on health reform--the second longest consecutive session in history.  So don't tell me that the Affordable Care Act was rushed through when during that time the HELP Committee considered 300 amendments, held dozens of hearings, and in 2017 there are going to be no committee meetings, no committee markups, no committee amendments, and barely a week for the public, for think tanks, for hospitals, for doctors, for patients to be able to consider the chaos that will be wrought if this healthcare plan goes through.  So I am on the floor today to plead with my Republican colleagues to step back from this potential debacle. This seems like it was written on the back of a napkin in order to rush something out into the public so that Republicans can claim they are fulfilling the promise they made, without thinking through the consequences.  Over and over again, I heard my Republican friends and President Trump say they are going to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something better. I heard the new Secretary of Health and Human Services say that no one was going to lose insurance, that costs were not going to go up, and that the insurance protections were going to be preserved. None of that will be true under the current plan under consideration. Everybody knows it, which is why it is being hidden from public view.  Politicians love praise. We love good press. So if Republicans thought this was a praiseworthy plan, they would not be hiding it. They would not be trying to rush it through. They would be celebrating an achievement they have been crowing about for years--replacing the Affordable Care Act with something that is better.  This is worse for everyone except for insurance companies, drug companies, and the superrich. The superrich get a big tax cut, and all of the fees that were levied on the insurance companies and drug companies that were used to pay for additional expansion go away.  Tucked inside here, there is even a very specific tax cut for insurance company I mean, think about that. Tucked into this bill is a specific tax cut for a select group of individuals--insurance company I represent a lot of those CEOs, but it does not make it right.  I hope we will find a way to work together to try to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and fix what is wrong. The plan that was unveiled yesterday--I understand not by the Senate but by the House--hurts everybody except for a select few. I think most of my colleagues know we can do better.

310,topic-id,633,"Mr.President, thank you, and thank you to some of my colleagues who are going to be joining me on the floor this afternoon.  The day after President Trump was inaugurated was one of the most inspiring I have ever gotten a chance to be part of. Millions of people, men and women, marched in Seattle, in Washington, DC, and in cities and towns in between. They carried signs, they chanted, and they made it absolutely undeniably clear that when it comes to women's rights and healthcare, people across the country do not want to go backward. Since then, they have continued to speak up and stand up.  But we are here today because Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress simply are not getting the message. I want to discuss one crucial example in particular--the possibility that in a matter of days, Senate Republicans could roll back a rule protecting family planning providers from being discriminated against and denied Federal funding.  Let me start by explaining a bit about what family planning providers mean to our community. These providers--part of the Title X program, which has bipartisan history--deliver critical healthcare services nationwide but are especially needed in rural and frontier areas. In 2015 alone, Title X provided basic primary and preventive healthcare services, such as Pap tests, breast exams, birth control, and HIV testing, to more than 4 million low-income women and men at nearly 4,000 health centers. In my home State of Washington, tens of thousands of patients are able to receive care at these centers each year. They often have nowhere else to turn for healthcare. In fact, 4 out of 10 woman who receive care at health centers funded by Title X consider it to be their only source of healthcare.  Taking resources away from these providers would be cruel. It would have the greatest impact on women and families who are most in need. But that is exactly what the law passed in the House, which is now on its way to the Senate, would mean. It would undo a valuable effort by the Obama administration to ensure that healthcare providers are evaluated for Federal funding based on their ability to provide the services in question, not ideology. In doing so, the bill would make it even easier for States, led by extreme politicians, to deny family planning providers Federal funding, not because of the quality of the care they provide or the value to the communities they serve but based on whether the politicians in charge agree that women should be able to exercise their constitutionally protected rights to safe, legal abortion.[[Page S1527]]  It is the 21st century. It is time for politicians to stop telling women what they can and can't do with their own bodies. That is what the women and men who have been marching and speaking up all over our country believe. That is what I believe. It is what Democrats believe.  If Leader McConnell thinks he can rush this harmful legislative effort through without a fight, we are here to say he is wrong. He can expect Democrats and maybe even some Republicans who are concerned about losing healthcare providers in their own States to fight back. So today I am calling on the leader to commit right now to drop this effort and agree not to bring this bill to the floor. It is well past time that extreme Republicans end their damaging political attacks on women. I think the opportunity to start that is right this minute. So we urge him to take this action and not bring this to the floor. We want him to know that we are going to fight back every step of the way if he does.  I yield the floor.

579,topic-id,774,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Washington State, who has made a really important case. I want to be here today to add my opinion, as well, because over the past 2 months we have heard a lot about President Trump's plan to drain the swamp, which is to reject special interests and the corporate elite and, instead, fight for workers across our country.  There are a whole lot of claims, a whole lot of promises--all great. Fighting for workers is what this Congress should be doing, but the President's actions speak a lot louder than his words. I find it telling that we are here again debating yet another Cabinet nominee sent over from the White House--this time Rick Perry--whose interests have been more closely aligned with those of Big Oil and corporations rather than advancing our country's energy challenges or fighting for the working families we represent.  So let me be clear. If confirmed to head up the Department of Energy, Governor Perry would join the ranks of other unqualified candidates chosen by this President to lead critically important agencies with very specific and complex functions. It is a big job. I believe that getting the top spot at the Department of Energy--or anywhere else in the President's Cabinet--should not simply be a prize for demonstrating loyalty during an election.  Getting the job should be borne of a solid understanding of the agency, a respect for the tens of thousands of workers they would lead, and, most importantly, a commitment to putting families across the country first. So as a voice from my home State of Washington, where DOE's presence is extremely important, I will vote no on Governor Perry's nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Washington State is home to the Hanford nuclear reservation near the Tri-Nearly 75 years ago, this region underwent a dramatic transformation, practically overnight and under top-secret conditions, to help the United States win World War II and later the Cold  Families and workers in this region of our State sacrificed immensely for the good of our country and the safety of our world. To this day, there is a massive environmental impact in the Tri-Cities created by decades of nuclear weapons production. Now this cleanup effort is vital, not only to the health and safety of families and workers and the economy in Central Washington but also for communities along the Colombia  As I have told anyone elected as President, whether Democrat or Republican, it is the Federal Government's moral and legal obligation and responsibility to clean up I know that is not an easy feat, but it is essential. It requires a very deep understanding of a very large and complex cleanup project and a great deal of respect for the workers who show up each day to make progress on this massive project. I remain deeply concerned that Governor Perry and this administration fail to grasp what is at stake.  I am also concerned that they don't get the importance of another national asset not far from Hanford, the Pacific Northwest National For more than 50 years, the men and women at PNNL have been on the forefront of scientific discovery. It was originally created to support research and development at Hanford, but PNNL has become DOE's premiere chemistry, environmental sciences, and data analytics national lab, tackling some of our Nation's most complex and urgent challenges.  PNNL is a leader in atmospheric research, nuclear detection and nonproliferation, and the Nation's electric grid. Its researchers have taken on everything from high-performance computing to advanced biofuels to analyzing lunar samples from These are critically important functions that advance our  I have worked hard with the entire Washington State congressional delegation, not to mention a whole host of leaders at the local and State level, to support this vital research and development hub and its incredible workforce. Just like the workers at Hanford, they also deserve leaders in this administration who respect and value their work. So, if President Trump were truly looking out for workers across our country, he would take this nomination to the Energy Department very seriously.  I understand Governor Perry gave his word during his confirmation hearing that he would work with us and even come to Washington State to visit Hanford and If he is confirmed by the Senate, you can bet I will hold him to that because one I thing I have learned in the short 40-plus days of this administration is that we do get a lot of words.

Slamming the door shut on refugees and immigrants, no questions asked, is un-Just like we saw in January, people across this country are already standing up and saying once again this is wrong, and we will not tolerate broad orders that target some of the most vulnerable people in the world.  I urge the President, if you truly want to keep our country safe, work with us, but we will not sit idly by as you continue to push a hateful agenda that betrays our American values.  Mr.President, I want to turn to the vote that is going to occur shortly here on the floor. I thank all of my colleagues who will be joining me this evening. When President Trump was running for office, he claimed he was going to be a President who fought for the middle class. He made a promise that he wasn't going to do what most Republicans have done in recent years and simply work for millionaires and billionaires. He was going to be different. He would be someone workers could count on.  We are just over a month into this Presidency, and it couldn't be clearer; President Trump is breaking that promise, whether it is his Cabinet picks or billionaires and Wall Street bankers and corporate CEOs or his rush to destroy our healthcare system and create chaos for families across our country or what Republicans have chosen to bring to the floor tonight: another effort that would hurt our workers, hurt the middle class, and hurt our economy.  Here is what I think we should be doing in We should be working on ways to boost economic security for more working families, and we should be helping our economy grow in the way that we know is strongest: from the middle out, not from the top down.  We have made some important progress over the last several years, but I think all of us on either side of the aisle agree there is a lot of work left to be done. That is certainly what has been clear to me as I have traveled across my home State of Washington, listening and meeting with workers and their families. Families are working hard. They are meeting their responsibilities, but far too many are still unable to get ahead.  Again, that is the topic we should be discussing tonight: how to support and empower more workers. Instead, we are here today because President Trump and my Republican colleagues either simply are not getting that message or they are too busy focusing on what is best for the folks already at the top, because today Republicans are poised to roll back a rule which helps protect our workers from wage theft, from discrimination, from unsafe workplaces, and more.  I want to take just a few minutes to make very clear what is at stake for millions of working families if Republicans roll back this rule. Each year, far too many workers are deprived of overtime wages or they are denied basic workplace protections. They have endured illegal discrimination, and they face unwarranted health or safety risks. That is unacceptable, and it has to come to an end.  Last year, Democrats, working with the previous administration, pushed to finalize what is now known as the fair pay and safe workplaces rule. For far too long, the government has awarded billions of taxpayer dollars to companies that rob workers of their paychecks and fail to maintain safe working conditions. This rule helps to right that wrong. Under this rule, when a company applies for a Federal contract, they will need to be upfront about their safety, health, and labor violations over the past 3 years. That way, government agencies can consider an employer's record of providing workers with a safe workplace and paying workers what they have earned before they grant or renew a Federal contract. To be clear, this does not prevent companies from winning Federal contracts. It does not single out companies. It does not deny companies the right to be heard. It simply improves transparency and coordination so government agencies are aware of companies' violations and can work with them to make sure they come into compliance with essential labor laws.  Again, the emphasis on this is not punishment but on helping bring more and more companies into compliance with the law and zeroing in on violations that are, and I quote from the rule: ``Serious, repeated, willful, or pervasive.'' Not only are these measures common sense, but they would have major benefits for our workers, our businesses and, by the way, our taxpayers. It would help hold the worst violators accountable.  American taxpayers should have the basic guarantee that their dollars are going to responsible contractors that will not steal from their workers or expose their workers to safety hazards. It would protect basic worker rights, and that, in turn, will help expand economic security for all working families, and it will level the playing field for businesses that do follow the law.  I think we can all agree that businesses shouldn't have to compete with bad actors that cut corners and put their workers' safety at risk or cheat their workers on their paychecks.  All of this, frankly, is pretty simple. When workers arrive on the job, they deserve to know they will be treated fairly, that they will be provided with a safe and healthy workplace, that their right to collective bargaining will be respected, and they will be paid all the wages they earned. Businesses that contract with the government should set an example when it comes to each of these concerns, and taxpayer dollars should only go to businesses that respect these fundamental worker protections.  As I said, time and again, families nationwide are sending a very clear message at marches, with phone calls and letters, online, and in their communities. They expect and are demanding that their representatives are truly committed to working for them. I, for one, am committed to standing with them. I know my colleagues are committed, and we are prepared to fight back.  Let's be clear, in rolling back these protections, President Trump and his party are yet again breaking their campaign promise to put our workers first. Workers will be hurt, wages will go down, rights will be undermined, lives will be put at risk.

969,topic-id,542,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to take a few minutes to address the deeply harmful bill House Republicans announced yesterday to be put in place, Since the election, I have had constituent after constituent come up to me with tears in their eyes wondering what the future holds for their healthcare. They are worried about losing coverage, wondering how they are going to make ends meet if their premiums spike, and they are worried that without protections laid out in the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies will once again have more power to decide what kinds of care are and are not covered.  My constituents and people across the country were listening when President Trump said he would provide ``insurance for everybody'' that would be higher quality and lower cost. They heard Senate Republicans say it is important any new healthcare plan ``do no harm.'' They even saw House Republicans reassure them that they wouldn't ``pull the rug out'' from under anyone on  This legislation that has now been rolled out represents a broken promise to patients and families. It will leave them sicker, more vulnerable to the chaos Republicans are creating within our healthcare system, and less financially secure. Millions of people who only just gained Medicaid coverage will lose it. Premiums could increase as much as 30 percent for people who lose coverage because they are too sick to work or become unemployed. People struggling with mental illness and substance abuse disorders, including opioid addiction, which is ravaging States nationwide, may find their insurance no longer has to cover the treatment they need. Key public health programs that families across the country rely on would be slashed.  TrumpCare would be a disaster for our workers and our families, but let's be clear about whom it does work for: those at the top. TrumpCare not only harms the same workers and families Republicans promised to help, it does so in order to reduce the tax burden for the wealthiest and for the insurance companies. In fact, this bill even includes a payout for insurance company executives. This is the definition of taking our healthcare system backward.  I also want to make it clear what TrumpCare will mean specifically for women. As someone who has fought time after time to protect women's ability to make their own healthcare decisions, I can tell you, this bill is a wish list by and for the extreme politicians who insist on telling women what to do with their own bodies. It will defund Planned It will undermine key protections for women's healthcare that were included in the Affordable Care By slashing Medicaid, this bill will take coverage away from low-income women and women of color who disproportionately rely on Medicaid to get the care they need.  I cannot oppose this bill more strongly, and I am going to be doing everything I can to fight back against it. I know Senate Democrats are ready to do so as well, and I urge any Republican who is truly concerned about their constituent's health, their well-being, and their financial security, rather than just partisan politics, to do the right thing and join us.

1004,topic-id,1203,"Mr.President, I come to the floor actually on behalf of students across the country, and for those who are so passionate about their education that they want to dedicate themselves to teaching, and to urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution and support strong and accountable teacher preparation in America today.  While this rule may not be the rule that any of us would have written on our own, it is important.  Let me say at the outset that there are many great teacher prep programs that exist around our country, and they are doing a great job preparing our teachers to succeed in the classroom, but there are also teacher preparation programs out there that are struggling and need support to help make sure they produce great teachers for our schools.  Now, as a former preschool teacher and as a mom, I know how important it is to have great teachers in our classrooms, and I understand how a good education, with an amazing teacher, can change a child's life. I am sure all of our colleagues think back on that one special teacher they had who shaped their mind and changed their life. They teach us not only how to read and write and do arithmetic, but good teachers teach us how to think critically, how to be creative, how to form an argument. I know I am not alone in saying that I owe much of what I have to the quality of the public education I received growing up, and I have spent my career fighting to make sure every child in America has the same opportunity I did.  Unfortunately, too many teaching students today are forced to take out huge amounts of student loans to afford continuing their education so they can realize their dream. They are willing to make this sacrifice. They don't complain. The very least we can do for those who want to become teachers is to make sure they are actually getting their money's worth when they make an investment in themselves.  That is what this rule does. It helps make sure students can make informed decisions about the quality and preparedness of their education.  Here are a few of the ways this rule does that--and I am hoping my colleagues will see that this shouldn't be controversial. This rule strengthens and streamlines reporting requirements of teacher prep programs to focus on employment placement and retention of graduates. It provides information from employers to future teacher candidates so they can make an informed decision about their education by choosing a school that improves the likelihood they will find employment after graduation. It makes sure that prospective teachers can access this information they need before they take out massive amounts of student debt.  When teacher programs are struggling, this rule helps States identify at-risk and low-performing programs so States can provide them the support they need to adapt or adjust their programs and help their teaching students succeed.  There is one more reason I would urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution today. Simply put, it would put more power into the hands of Secretary DeVos, and many of us don't yet have the trust that she would use that power to promote the best interests of students in higher education. Secretary DeVos does not come from a higher education background. We don't know whether she supports providing information on teacher placement rates and retention rates before prospective teachers take out student loans. We have no idea what she would do if this rule went away, and I believe it would be too risky to find out.  By investing in our teachers, we are investing in our future generations. Our future teachers have the right to know whether they are receiving a quality education, and they deserve to know that before they take out massive amounts of student debt.  It helps to improve teacher prep program accountability and gives prospective teachers the information they need to make an accurate decision on which program is most likely to make them a successful teacher in the classroom.  It ensures that Secretary DeVos does not have more power to implement unknown policies that could hurt students and reduce the number of qualified great teachers in our public schools.  Without this rule and the information that it ensures, students will have a hard time finding a quality teacher prep program that will help them get a job after they graduate. I think that is simply wrong. We should be working to make sure teaching students have full access to information and options. This rule would give them less.  For all the future teachers out there, I urge my fellow Senators to vote against this CRA because every young adult deserves to know that the program they enroll in is actually preparing them to be a successful teacher in the classroom, and every student deserves to have an amazing teacher in every classroom.                      Every Student Succeeds Bill  Finally, Mr.President, I wish to bring up one more thing that is very important to me--the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act--and a potential serious threat to it. It seems that Republicans are thinking about bringing to the floor another CRA that would eliminate the rule that provides States with flexibility and guidelines to create their State plans. I want to be very clear. I hope Republicans reconsider that approach.  The Every Student Succeeds Act is a critical part of our bipartisan education law. It is an important part of the civil rights protections it offers, as well as the assurances it made that every student would have an opportunity to succeed, no matter where they live or how they learn or how much money parents make. Jamming through that resolution would weaken it, and it would be a major step toward turning our bipartisan law into another partisan fight.  Rolling back the Every Student Succeeds Act rule less than a month before States have to submit their plans to the Department of Education will cause chaos and confusion in the States, and it will hurt our students, our teachers, and our schools. It will also give Secretary DeVos greater control over that bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act and give her the tools to implement her anti-public education agenda.  Secretary DeVos's lack of experience and expertise, as well as her damaging track record on school privatization, leaves her unqualified to implement this bipartisan law that governs public education and public schools without the important guardrails that rule ensures. Given her record and her comments, she would almost certainly push for measures that disregard key civil rights protections in the Every Student Succeeds Act and could allow unequal, unfair, and unreliable accountability for schools across the country.  The Every Student Succeeds Act rule is supported by Democrats and Republicans, by teachers and businesses, and by parents and communities. We should not go backward.  I urge my colleagues to reconsider moving forward with that resolution, which I understand they want to bring up later this week, and work with us to continue building on that bipartisan progress that we all worked toward for our students.

Doug Coe, a disciple of a fellow named Abraham Vereide, over a half century ago came from Oregon to minister the Gospel to the Government of the United He has been doing that for over a half a century.  Doug, well-known to us in the Congress for so many years, always was bringing other people to the fore, and he always stood in the back. He encouraged so many of us to have fellowship together, to meet with each other, especially to have a meal together, to enjoy each other, and to do this in the Spirit of the Lord, and particularly the Spirit of Because of that, he made so many friends all over the world.  This was a man whose religion brought people together across religions, not dividing us, as is so often the case. In Doug's spirituality, he could bring people of all faiths together in unity and understanding through the teachings of Jesus of  I have just come from the cemetery where Doug has been laid to rest. He is so well-known around here in the spirit of President Eisenhower's suddenly calling up a couple of his friends in the Senate and saying: Please come down here and visit with me; this is the loneliest house in That started the annual Prayer Breakfast, and, of course, that Prayer Breakfast has been held ever since, once a year, with the President, the Congress, the President's Cabinet, the Vice President, the Joint Chiefs, the diplomatic corps.

Well, that is the unique unity of all of these Prayer Breakfasts that are handled and held all over the world.  The Abrahamic faiths coming from the original single God, from which the seed of Abraham had not only the Jewish religion, the Muslim religion, and the Christian religion--in that, Doug Coe found unity. So all of these years he spent organizing the National Prayer  Doug lived through this last one. He wasn't able to attend, but he was holding court over in Northern Virginia as so many of the international guests came to Washington for that annual celebration.  We just laid Doug to rest today. Tomorrow, there will be a memorial service for him at a huge megachurch to try to accommodate the size of the audience that will be there out in Northern  When this Senator first came to Congress many, many years ago, Doug Coe was the one who came to me and said: What I want you to do is I want you to get two Democrats and two Republicans, and I want you all to come together each week--breakfast or lunch--meet faithfully, read the Scriptures, enjoy each other's company, and then pray together.  We did that faithfully for 10 of the 12 years I was in the One of our Members was elected to the Senate at the time, and therefore he arranged for us to have one of the hideaways.

55,topic-id,582,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to thank my good friend from Texas (Mr.Sessions), the chairman of the Committee on Rules, for yielding me this time.  I am certainly in favor of the Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017, which I think will provide necessary transparency in the regulatory process by requiring agencies to post all public comments issued during a proposed rulemaking, which sounds simple enough. I cosponsored this legislation because I strongly believe, and I firmly believe, the public comment process is critical to ensure Federal regulations are drafted to protect the American people and not to punish them.  Unfortunately, far too often, agencies either ignore or fail to incorporate the public's input and suggestions when proposing and finalizing these important rules. Many regulatory actions impose billions of dollars in compliance and other costs on industries, on consumers, on small businesses, on farmers, and on families while bureaucrats ignore the meaningful input, suggested improvements, and the real concerns being voiced by the very people that will be most affected by their actions.  Mr.Speaker, this measure requires more transparency and accountability of Federal agency communications about proposed and pending regulations. Agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency have continually violated Federal laws and appropriations restrictions that prohibit the use of Federal funds for lobbying, advocacy, and propaganda efforts.  I know many are aware of the EPA's unlawful social media campaign advocating for the waters of the United States rule, the WOTUS rule; however, an even more egregious example recently occurred in my own home State of The EPA-funded What's Upstream campaign used grant awards to fund a website, radio ads, and billboards depicting dead fish and polluted water, alleging that farmers and the agriculture industry were responsible. The website helped visitors email their State legislators to advocate for 100-foot stream buffer zones around farms and other agricultural operations, despite prohibitions against such advocacy.  As a lifelong farmer, I have got to tell you, Mr.Speaker, I was insulted by the blatant lies this campaign had spread about farmers; and as a Member of Congress, I am outraged that the EPA continues to award grant funding to the entities responsible for this, I think, despicable and deceitful antifarmer campaign. I believe Congress must ensure Federal agencies follow the law to prevent future libelous campaigns like What's Upstream from ever receiving another cent of taxpayer dollars.  H.1004 prohibits lobbying in support of proposed rules and requires agencies to track the details of all public communications about pending regulatory actions, while establishing clear standards for prohibited activities. This will guarantee that both the public and Congress understand how Federal agencies communicate with the public about pending regulations, and these reasonable restrictions will support transparency and accountability across the Federal  Mr.Speaker, agencies should consider comments from the public and incorporate reasonable changes so that proposed Federal regulations can be revised and refined using that valuable public feedback before they are finalized. However, too often, Federal bureaucrats simply go through the motions and end up ignoring the public's input while they happily flout Federal law and create campaigns designed to garner support for their preferred proposals. Federal agencies must not treat their proposed regulations as final. By doing so, they are ignoring the voice and the will of the American people.  I urge my colleagues to support this important rule and the underlying bill; then, together, we can return transparency, we can return accountability, and we can return public input to the Federal rulemaking process once and for all.                              {time}  1300  ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1403-5.txt,2275,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,1.0,March

This afternoon I want to discuss why the residents of this city would want to become a I find that Members of Congress are almost entirely ignorant of the status of the District of Columbia, and, frankly, I cannot really blame them.  Members of Congress have no reason to be concerned about the District and its 670,000 residents. That is my concern. Candidly, I wish Members of Congress would not be concerned at all. There are a number of ways in which the Congress could leave the city alone.  Statehood is, of course, the ultimate reason and way; and it is the only way that the residents of this city can become equal to the residents represented by my colleagues.

Imagine that. In the United States of America, the Congress of the United States, unaccountable to the residents of the city of Washington, D.C., on local matters can overturn a bill. They have done so in committee on an admittedly controversial bill.  I don't expect every State and city to agree with the District of Columbia on matters affecting our city. The DC Death with Dignity bill would allow people to take their own lives with a drug in their possession administered by themselves. In order to do so, two doctors have to have found that the resident does not have more than six months to live, among other requirements.  A third of those who choose this option in the United States never use the drug.  How do I know that?  Because six States already have death with dignity laws. That means 24 Republican Members of this House represent States that have death with dignity laws yet the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform under Chairman Chaffetz just voted to keep the District from doing what six States already allow.

I want to just say, once again, how faithful and true to his own principles Senator Carper has been in supporting D.statehood and stepping out front to introduce the bill.  You might ask: What chance, with a Republican House, Senate, and President, do you have of getting D.statehood? Why would you bother?

All we need to do now is use the existing social media, and I think we can change this shameful situation.  I am very encouraged by what has happened. Yesterday, 60 Democrats joined me as original cosponsors. An original cosponsor is a Member who stands with the sponsor on equal footing to introduce the bill. That already beats the record we set for last year when we had 93 original cosponsors in the 114th By the end of that Congress, 72 percent of House Democrats were cosponsors of the bill, and we could have gotten many more than that but for the logistics and the timing involved.  Our goal is to improve our chances for statehood every year; one way to do that is to get more cosponsors every year, and we are meeting that goal.  Why are we pursuing statehood? It is not out of hubris. It is not that we want to be like Delaware and New It is because it is the only way to become full and equal citizens of the United States, and because we have tried everything else.

We also have tried, short of statehood, to get budget autonomy.  Imagine bringing our budget, raised in the District of Columbia, $7 billion, and asking Members who don't know anything about it to vote on it. That is what the residents of the District of Columbia have to do.  I pay tribute to the former Republican chairman of the House committee of jurisdiction, Oversight and Government Reform, Darrell Issa, who held a hearing when he chaired the committee on D.C.'s local matters, including its local budget.  Upon hearing the testimony about this district's financial conditions, its reserves, its growth among the best of the Nation, upon hearing in testimony from the Mayor, the city council, the chief financial officer, despite meeting those marks, then-Chairman Darrell Issa supported budget autonomy for the District of Columbia, and worked tirelessly for this goal during his chairmanship of the Oversight and Government Reform  So I am not here to say that there is no sense of a necessity to have something done, as you see that in former Chairman Darrell Issa's actions.  For that matter, Chairman Jason Chaffetz, last week, called for the District of Columbia to be made a part of Maryland in order that it would get Senators and He wasn't joking. He wasn't making fun of us.  There has long been a small group of Republicans who acknowledge the shame of having almost 700,000 Americans without representation in the House and the And one of the easier ways to get it, they think, is to retrocede, that is the word, because the District was created out of Maryland and Virginia itself cast off, the District of Columbia because it was afraid Congress would abolish slavery.

We have asked for legislative autonomy.  Why should our legislation have to lay over here for 30 days, or 60 days? They must be legislative days, so that often means 6 months, 9 months, to give the Congress time to see whether the Congress wants to overturn legislation it had nothing to do with and knows nothing about.  The fact is that the legislative autonomy provision is virtually never used. Instead, the Congress tries to add amendments to the District's budget, a sneaky, easy way, they think, to overturn a law. So they keep legislative autonomy on the books inconveniencing the District and never use it.  They fear budget autonomy because they wouldn't have anything to attach matters to like overturning our gun laws. They regularly try to do that on appropriations.  So what you have is a kind of invitation for Members to interfere with somebody else's district, my district, instead of attending to your own business. People did not send my colleagues here to attend to the business of the District of Columbia, and we intend to call them out every time they interfere.

I remember coming to the floor on those occasions where we have voted whether or not to go to war, and on each of those occasions, residents of the District of Columbia have gone. I remember the purple fingers in Iraq and Afghanistan that signified that our country had given them the vote, while the very members of the armed services from the District of Columbia who had served came back to the District of Columbia without a vote themselves.

In fact, today, it is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the United States, a city that people are flocking to for residence.  Everything about the District of Columbia has changed except its status and the status of its residents as second class citizens in their own country. We are sick and tired of being voyeurs of democracy. That is why the District of Columbia gave itself budget autonomy, although the Congress did appropriate a budget. Thank you for nothing. That is why the city voted 85 percent for statehood for itself. The citizens of the District are simply not going to sit still with the status quo.

822,topic-id,861,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my good friend from Georgia for yielding. I certainly thank him for being a cosponsor of my bill.  I should start, however, by thanking Chairman Shuster, and Ranking Member DeFazio, who have moved this bill so quickly.  The bill is called the Fairness for Breastfeeding Mothers Act of 2017. This is a real motherhood bill. Mr.DeFazio, Mr.Johnson, and Barbara Comstock have all joined me as cosponsors.  H.1174 requires locations that are either federally owned or leased to provide designated private and hygenic lactation space for nursing mothers. As I will indicate, no new space in buildings or expenditures is contemplated.  Last Congress, I offered this bill as an amendment to the Public Buildings Reform and Savings Act of 2016, and I was pleased to have it pass the  Space for lactating women is already required for Federal employees. We are really not talking about a new kind of benefit. Certainly, there is no new money. The reason that this is not new is because Federal employees already have lactating space under the Affordable Care  So I have to ask my good friends on the other side: As you try to repeal the Affordable Care Act, do you propose to erase this motherhood provision as well? Will you preserve it?                              {time}  1745  My bill extends the lactating space requirement to include not just employees, but visitors and guests of Federal facilities across the H.1174 also does not require additional Federal funds or space to be mandated at all. Since Federal employees already have this space, I look forward to visitors to Federal buildings also making use of this space. In our country, new mothers often come to visit Federal buildings, not only those who work in Federal buildings.  The reason this is such an important bill is that the benefits of breast milk are so well documented: antibodies and hormones that boost babies' immune systems, lower risks of asthma, diabetes, respiratory infections, and other diseases among breastfed babies.  There are benefits also for nursing mothers. Research has shown that there are lower risks of diabetes and even cancer as a result of breastfeeding. Speaking of motherhood, the Republican healthcare plan would even make maternity care significantly more expensive.  Now, this, of course, is a bill that is very easy to support, but when we think of its links to other important legislation, I ask that there be sincere consideration given to whether or not at this moment in time my good friends across the aisle want their legacy to be: We actually repealed your health care.  I don't think they are going to be able to do it.  My Republican friends have no experience with structural reform. If you look at all the structural reform in our country, beginning with the New Deal, none of it was done by Whether you are talking about the administrative agencies that are so important to all that we do in this country, Medicare, Medicaid, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, whatever you have in mind, these are structural reforms that Republicans[[Page H1551]]have, if anything, opposed, as they opposed Social Security, for example.  So here what they are trying to do is to unravel, take away health care, and then put something in its place. They have no experience doing anything like it. Anybody who has looked closely at it has to doubt, as I do, that they can do it.  Look what they will be doing. In my own district, the District of Columbia, we have cut in half the rate of uninsured.  Are Republicans going to give me a guarantee that that cut will remain if they replace the bill with the markup that is going on as we speak?  Ninety-six percent of District of Columbia residents have health coverage today. That is comparable to other advanced countries in the world. As we know, most countries in the world already afford this kind of coverage. That makes the District, according to whoever is doing the counting, number one, number two, or number three in the Nation in health care provided to our residents. I am very proud of that. I am going to fight like mad to keep it.  Mr.Speaker, many of us had healthcare townhalls over the recess. We saw what happened at the townhalls on affordable care that my good friends on the other side also had. They met a revolution from their own constituents. We didn't have that problem in our townhalls. Some of the stories that residents brought forward are truly heartbreaking, so I want to leave you with one.  A woman who came to testify at my healthcare townhall, her name is Markita's grandmother was a D.Public Schools cafeteria worker for most of her career. She retired early. She retired before she had Social Security or She was suffering from diabetes and a stroke, but she was so prideful that she never let anyone know that she had to slice her pills in half just to get by. Now she is under the protection of the Affordable Care Markita's grandmother is healthier and can afford her medication. She is no longer splitting her pills in half.

Quality of care has improved through preventative care, without cost sharing for consumers. Overall costs have been lowered.  Republicans have had 7 years to come up with an alternative healthcare plan that preserves the progress we have made under the Affordable Care Act--one that would not take us back to a time when many without employer-sponsored insurance or a clean bill of health could get coverage.  But after all this time, they have come up with a plan that will cost older Americans up to five times more than younger enrollees; will charge the uninsured 30 percent more to buy coverage; and it will defund, not defend, Planned Parenthood; cut Medicaid significantly; and still has no price tag.  We owe it to Americans to have an open debate on this proposal, and I expect my Republican colleagues not to forget the millions of Americans for whom the Affordable Care Act has been a lifesaver.  In January, I asked my constituents to share their Affordable Care Act stories. Within a few days, more than a thousand stories were submitted. Some shared their ongoing challenges. I agree there are opportunities to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and make it affordable, but the overwhelming number of people shared compelling stories of how the Affordable Care Act has improved their lives.

The Republican plan puts these preventive services at risk.  Matthew from Brunswick, Maine, said:  ``Five years ago, I left a comfortable job with good benefits to start my own business. Those first years were tough on my family. My wife and I were able to put our children on Maine's Dirigo Health, but we had to do without. . . . Today, through God's grace, hard work, and the support of my wife; my business is prospering. Food assistance is a thing of the past and we're actually contributing more in taxes now than we ever did before. We still have to watch what we spend but we're breathing a lot easier. Each year that I've made more money our subsidy has gone down, and that's just as it should be. That subsidy still matters though. If the ACA were eliminated today and I had to buy health insurance on the open market I'd be paying an extra $4,800 a year. That's real money.''  Under the Republican plan, small-business owners like Matthew may not be able to afford care for their family.  Ret, a 9/11 first responder from Rockland, Maine, said:  `` . . .

141,topic-id,663,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I oppose this bill. My colleagues on the other side have portrayed this bill as simply a codification of an executive order President Clinton issued. That simply is not the case. This bill makes significant changes to the regulatory process. The bill would require independent agencies to submit rules to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA, for review. Independent agencies do not currently have to get the approval of the White House for regulations they issue. Congress designed independent agencies to be just that, independent. This bill would change that.  In February of 2015, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz sent four letters to the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission alleging that the White House had ``an improper influence'' on the FCC's net neutrality plan and that the FCC ``failed to establish the appearance that this rulemaking is independent, fair, and transparent.''  The bill we are considering would enshrine in law that very allegation my esteemed colleague Chairman[[Page H1433]]Chaffetz had concerns about, political interference by the White House with the FCC and other independent agencies. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this bill would increase direct spending by $3 million and reduce revenues by $2 million. These direct spending and revenue effects are caused by the fact that the bill covers independent agencies. CBO has also estimated that the bill would cost Federal agencies an additional $20 million in administrative costs. I am fighting to keep the budget down in this matter.  The bill does not include offsets for any additional spending. The bill also omits critical phrases from Executive Order 12866 that ensures that OIRA reviews do not contradict existing law. For example, the executive order requires agencies to provide the cost and benefits of alternatives to a proposed rule ``unless prohibited by law.'' The bill does not include this exception, and my colleagues on the other side have still not explained why it does not include this language.                              {time}  1615  It is unclear how the bill would impact laws that prohibit agencies from considering costs when setting public health standards.  The Coalition for Sensible Safeguards--an alliance over 150 labor, scientific, good government, health, and environmental groups--sent a letter to the House Members yesterday opposing this bill. That letter said in part:  ``Particularly concerning, H.1009 would in effect rewrite dozens of public interest laws containing congressional mandates that require agencies to prioritize public health and safety and the preservation of the environment, clean air, and clean water over concerns for industry profits. This consequence flows from another key difference between H.1009 and the Executive Orders it purports codify: Whereas the Orders impose their requirements only to the extent consistent with applicable laws, H.1009 recognizes no such limitations.''  Mr.Chairman, this bill would also give OIRA the ability to hold up rulemaking indefinitely.  Under Executive Order 12866, the administrator over OIRA has 90 days to review a rule, and that period can be extended one time for 30 days. This bill would allow OIRA to extend its review ``for any number of additional 30-day periods upon written request by the administrator or the head of the agency.''  The bill also gives the rulemaking agencies the ability to object to an extension of OIRA review period, but it is not realistic to think that an agency would refuse a request for an extension from the White  The Union of Concerned Scientists also sent a letter to House Members opposing this bill. That letter said:       Of particular concern is the fact that H.1009 aims to      codify some of the most burdensome requirements of previous      executive orders while gutting the much-needed flexibility      that the orders provide to Federal agencies in charge of      ensuring science-based protections for the public. Congress      should increase protections for our constituents rather than      preventing agencies from issuing science-based protections.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.

144,topic-id,535,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We are opposed to the bill because we have received letters and concerns from a cross section of Americans, a cross section of organizations, who recognize that this is not really a codification of an executive order, but this is overreach on the part of the majority of Congress at this time. They feel that they are able to do it, and so they are going to ram this through.  H.1009 would add another layer of bureaucracy to an already slow rulemaking process. The Consumer Federation of America says:       The bill creates a regulatory working group to provide      input to agencies about how to improve their regulatory      process, including an evaluation of risk assessment      techniques.  It appears like this is what we are going to be doing throughout Oversight and Government Reform, is creating new task forces and new groups to review rulemaking and review regulations at the cost of the taxpayer.  H.1009 would jeopardize the independence of agencies like the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, as well as other independent agencies because it will give the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA, the ability to[[Page H1434]]review significant rules which are outside of their scope now. That is why these agencies are called independent, because Congress wanted them to be independent. We are now giving OIRA overreach into independent agencies.  The Consumer Federation of America goes on to say:       Authorizing OIRA to conduct its own analysis would not only      add pressure from the executive branch and add time and      expense to the already slow regulatory process, but would      also give the special interests seeking to quash a safety      measure yet another avenue to prevent a rule from being      promulgated.  Significantly, independent agencies were created by Congress to prioritize public health and safety, ensure a fair financial marketplace, and consumer privacy. This bill would undermine the authorizing statutes and the missions of these independent agencies by allowing those agencies to be in some way touched by the White  Again, we have the Natural Resources Defense Their letter to all of the Members said:       The bill would also revive legislative language that      Congress repealed elsewhere because it made it impossible to      protect the public.  Specifically, in H.1009, OIRA was charged with ensuring that the regulation imposes the least burden on society. Congress removed such language when it updated TSCA because the phrase had made it impossible for chemical safety regulations to pass judicial muster, even when the chemical was asbestos, well known to be a potential carcinogen.  No one wants to impose unnecessary burdens on society, but the phrase ``least burdensome'' has been interpreted to put an agency in an impossible position of providing that there is no other conceivable way to accomplish its goal of having to cost out every theoretical option.  The reason we are opposed to this bill is because it makes it more difficult for independent agencies to remain independent and not be moved by the White House by political machinations that this Congress is now trying to impose on them.

158,topic-id,363,"Mr.Chair, this manager's amendment does not fix the flaws in the bill we are considering.  One of the major flaws in the bill is the authority it gives to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to hold up rules indefinitely. This amendment attempts to address that concern by requiring that any extension be agreed to by both the White House and the agency issuing the rule.  It is just not realistic to believe that an agency whose top official is appointed by the President would tell the White House it cannot have an extension if the White House asks. This amendment also does nothing to address the concern that the bill could interfere with other laws.  The Natural Resources Defense Council sent a letter to House Members opposing H.1009. That letter states:  ``The bill would also revive legislative language that Congress repealed elsewhere because it made it impossible to protect the public.

Congress removed such language when it updated the Toxic Substances Control Act because the phase had made it impossible for chemical safety regulations to pass judicial muster, even when the chemical was asbestos, well known to be a potent carcinogen.''  This amendment also includes language that says that no funds shall be authorized to carry out the bill. This does not change the fact that the CBO estimates that the bill will result in $3 million in direct spending. That is money that Congress has not appropriated that independent agencies like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would have to spend.  CBO also estimates that the bill would change the operations of the Federal Reserve, which would result in $2 million in reduced revenues.  CBO also estimates that agencies would have to spend $4 million in appropriated funds each year to comply with the requirements of this bill. Making agencies comply with additional requirements without giving them more money means that agencies will have to choose between which requirements they comply with and which they ignore.

53,topic-id,1611,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, today I rise in opposition to the rule and both underlying bills, H.1009, the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act; and H.1004, the Regulatory Integrity  These two bills that would be debated under this rule were both reported out of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform without a single Democratic vote. So these are not bipartisan bills. They were reported out of committee only by The bills threaten transparency, undermine the independent authority of government agencies, and weaken the separation of powers between our three branches of government at a time in our history when we need it the most.  I sat in this Chamber last night as President Trump spoke about fixing healthcare and immigration systems, but we haven't seen those plans yet. Instead, all we have seen are these kinds of not-bipartisan bills that don't accomplish a lot.  Now, these two bills claim to offer accountability and integrity in the rulemaking process, but when you look past their title, you see what they really are is just another backdoor attack on American workers, an attack on our environment and protecting our public health.  First with regard to H.1009, much has been said since the start of this Congress about the importance of our checks and balances in our system. We have a new President who isn't shy about blurring the lines of separation between the executive, legislative, and even the judicial branches of government. He publicly condemned a judge based on his ethnicity in a private case. He also attacked a judge who struck down his order on immigration. I find it troubling to be debating a bill that would make government agencies even more dependent on the judgment of the White House when many of us question the judgment of the gentleman currently occupying the Oval  Under current law, independent agencies, like the Environmental Protection Agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, and many others don't need approval from the administration to move forward with a new rule or regulation. Misleadingly characterized as simplifying the existing executive order, what this bill would actually do is require all rules made by independent government agencies to be sent to the White House, centralizing the power of the White House and the power of the                              {time}  1245  This bill effectively mandates improper influence by the White  In addition, the bill repeals language that exempts rules considered to be lifesaving from having to undergo a full review process.  If those reasons weren't enough to dissuade my colleagues from voting in favor of this rule, let me briefly discuss the unlimited review window this bill would create to derail and delay important rules. Frankly, important provisions like this are the reasons why the American people, often rightfully, accuse the government of waste, fraud, and abuse.  By giving the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs unlimited time to review rules, Congress would effectively allow the White House to bury rules in red tape and paperwork, the very red tape and paperwork and bureaucracy that the American people are frustrated with. This bill is a recipe to make government less efficient rather than more efficient. It would grind the rulemaking process to a halt by burying the very limited staff of the White House under a whole array of rules from independent agencies that, with no timeline, would simply sit in the White House either going nowhere or being studied by committee after committee after committee. Perhaps, after several years, they will see the light of day after even more bureaucrats have had the chance, at your taxpayer expense, to read those rules.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that this bill makes the[[Page H1406]]Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs somehow more accountable by Congress by authorizing the statute, but that is not the case. This bill, like many other bills we have seen in this Congress, frankly, is a solution in search of a problem.  I don't disagree that the rulemaking process should be simplified, but there is a collaborative, bipartisan way to do that. This bill does not represent that idea. If passed, H.1009 would reduce the ability of independent government agencies to work effectively, create additional paperwork and bureaucracy, and transfer significant power and authority to the White House and the  Frankly, this bill is a serious threat on our checks and balances at a time we need it the most. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take that into account when voting on the rule and the bill today.  The second bill under this rule is H.1004, the so-called Regulatory Integrity It is another example of Republican attacks on health and safety protections.  The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017 requires executive agencies to provide extensive and, often, gratuitous information on their websites related to any pending regulatory action they are seeking to make. Again, it is difficult to find a Member of this body who doesn't believe that we want more transparency, more accountability, and more streamlining of regulations. Of course, those are priorities for the country. This bill does not do that.  I don't believe an outright attack on our rulemaking process meant to protect our health, meant to protect people from fraud and abuse, and giving yet more hoops for agency officials to jump through in doing the job that Congress has asked them to do, in no way is that the correct way to go about increasing transparency in government. This bill makes it more difficult for all of the agencies that we have set up, that we have directed, to do their job: to protect the American public.  The new reporting requirements that are included in this bill will distract agencies from their core missions of keeping Americans safe and, again, bury them under mounds and mounds of additional paperwork requirements. Many of these agencies have seen their budgets cut by the Republicans, and the reporting requirements will take up even more of their very limited capacity that they have under the budget constraints they operate at.  As many of us know, this bill was born out of a 2015 GAO study that determined that the Environmental Protection Agency had violated certain restrictions during the rulemaking process for waters of the U.To me, the fact that that determination was made by an independent government agency is proof that our oversight process works. If there is a bipartisan bill we can do to implement best practices, I think that we could have strong Democratic support for that. This bill does not do that.  Republicans are ignoring the fact that the GAO also concluded that ``the agency complied with the applicable requirements,'' and were so concerned with providing the public with opportunities to comment that the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers conducted over 400 meetings across the country. If this bill passes the House, the ability of agencies to do those kinds of outreach efforts and stakeholder involvement efforts would be limited. It would be limited by vast and unnecessary additional work, red tape, and bureaucratic reporting requirements that would be mandated under this bill with the same limited resources they have today. I think that it would be better use of their limited resources to do those kinds of field opportunities across the country, giving American stakeholders and people involved the opportunity to testify about how those rules affect them.  The most immediate and certain effect of this bill would be to virtually prohibit agencies from disclosing to the public any benefits that agency actions would have in protecting the American people. If an agency is no longer allowed to explain how the rulemaking process would benefit and protect the American people, the public, of course, would view this as some sort of burdensome regulation. Perhaps that is the goal of this bill from a propaganda perspective.  Finally, this bill will ban agencies from soliciting support for their regulations, seemingly forgetting that current law already does this. If there is need to clarify it again, we can certainly do so in a bipartisan way.  This unsettling trend of trying to, in fact, regulate regulations actually leads to additional bureaucracy and paperwork. It is a disservice to American workers and families, to our environment, and to many Americans who don't know if they can make their rent or have health insurance at the end of the month. It is a disservice to the thousands of military and civilian workers no longer able to seek employment in the Federal Government and a disservice to so many American children and adults.  The fact that we are even considering these bills illustrates that the priorities in Congress are not in line with the priorities of the people that we represent. I have not heard an outcry from my constituents on any of these issues. I hear about health care. I hear about immigration reform, improving our schools, making college more affordable, not that we need more administrative hurdles to the rulemaking process. I haven't heard it once from a single constituent at 51 townhalls I had last session.  The passage of this bill will put a significant administrative burden on government agencies that issue rules to protect It would limit the ability of the agencies that we set up under our authorizing statutes to do their job: to protect the health and safety of the American people.  I urge my colleagues to reject this rule and reject these bills.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1403-5.txt,1910,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2017.0,1.0,March

Mr.Speaker, we are all deeply concerned over the reports from our intelligence community regarding foreign interference in our most recent election. When we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up bipartisan legislation, H.356, the Protecting Our Democracy Act, which would create an independent commission to investigate the foreign interference in our 2016 election.  This is not a partisan matter. Both Democrats and Republicans have called for this investigation and a full accounting for the American people. Frankly, the American people deserve to know what happened, and Congress has the responsibility to get to the bottom of it.

I did have people ask if we can have a full accounting of foreign interference with our more recent election, and, if we defeat the previous question, that will give us an opportunity to do that.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the previous question. I will also urge them to vote ``no'' on the rule, and ``no'' on the underlying bills.  Just so no one is here under any illusions, Republicans do currently control the House, and the Senate, and the White Frankly, they have the ability to set the agenda, and they could use that agenda to advance real reforms like infrastructure, or tax reform, or fixing our broken immigration system, repairing broken roads and bridges. Today, instead, we are debating something so obscure that I don't think the American people know what OIRA does or how to pronounce it; another bill that has to deal with whether regulations are seen and signed off on by the staffers in the White House; and two bills that don't do anything but undermine the separation of powers, undermine the authority of this institution, the United States Congress, and make it harder for public agencies to do the job that we have instructed them to do to keep the American people safe.  For these reasons, Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so we can bring up H.356, the Protecting Our Democracy Act, and oppose the underlying legislation.

73,topic-id,195,"Mr.Chair, I rise in strong support of Congresswoman Bonamici's amendment.  Today, our country owes over $1.3 trillion in student debt. In Colorado, the average student loan borrower owes $26,000.  Why would we want to risk abolishing consumer protections for our borrowers?  These are very personal numbers. The stories I hear, the burden of student loan debt affects people's ability to own a home or buy a car.  A recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that the number of student loan borrowers over the age of 60 has quadrupled. People haven't even paid off their loans as they enter retirement age.  Now, the Obama administration did take important steps to protect and support student loan borrowers. They made it easier for them to pay back their loans and ensured they were treated fairly by student loan services. Rolling back these protections would have far-reaching negative effects for our borrowers.  I strongly support Congresswoman Bonamici's amendment, exempting Federal protections that support consumer protections for student loan borrowers from the SCRUB The last thing we need to scrub away is protections for people to take out student loans.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''  ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1408.txt,1910,0915,2017.0,1.0,March

When ESEA, or the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, was first passed in 1965, it truly was a landmark and important piece of civil rights legislation. It is written with the intent that every student--no matter their race, their economic background, their ZIP Code--deserves a great education in our country.  Title I of ESEA gets at the heart of the civil rights spirit for providing additional funding for schools with significant populations of high-needs and at-risk students. Now, title I also provides important performance and equity parameters for States and districts and gives some direction about how States can comply with these requirements to support our most struggling schools.  Of course, the text of the law doesn't do everything, which is why we rely on the protections that have been put in place through rule.  The SCRUB Act would allow an unelected panel to carelessly do away with important civil rights protections and transparency, the opposite of the legislative intent in the  The Department of Education regularly goes through an extensive process for finalizing regulations, and to do away with these protections on a whim by an unelected, all-powerful panel may somehow score political points, but it is at the expense of students across our country.

716,topic-id,3418,"Madam President, this is the 32nd time I have come to the[[Page S1594]]floor in the last year to talk about an issue that unfortunately is getting worse--not better--and that is the epidemic of opioids; that would be heroin, prescription drugs, and now, more recently, synthetic heroin, also known as fentanyl or U-4 or carfentanil.  Every single day we are now losing 144 Americans to drug overdoses. Think about that, every single day, 144 people. By the way, that means, during the time it takes to give these remarks, which will be about 12 minutes, on average, we are losing another American to this opioid epidemic.  It is an issue that is now so serious that it has overtaken car accidents or even homicides from gun violence as the 1 accidental cause of death in our country.  It is easy to get discouraged because we see these statistics. We hear about the overdoses. We hear about the deaths. We hear about the difficulty for people to get out of the grips of this addiction. The relapse rate is high. It is an issue that is affecting every single community in this By the way, it is affecting our inner cities, it is affecting our suburbs, it is affecting our rural areas and every group of Americans out there. No one is immune from this, and it knows no ZIP  Yet today I want to talk a little about some of the reasons for hope and some of the models of success out there because this Congress, to its credit in the last year, has actually gotten much more serious about this issue. We passed two pieces of legislation to help; particularly, to provide better prevention and education to keep people from getting into the funnel of addiction and then, second, to help in terms of providing the resources: the treatment, the recovery. The longer term recovery, in particular, it is the first time Congress has stepped up on that.  We also need to do a better job ensuring that our law enforcement and our other first responders have what they need to save lives and to be able to reverse the effects of overdoses through this miracle drug called naloxone or It is part of the legislation that has not just been passed but is beginning to be implemented.  Fortunately, in my own State of Ohio--although we have one of the worst addiction problems in the country--we also have a lot of really compassionate people who have stepped forward and are taking advantage of these resources, including not only resources from Washington now but also from State and local governments and from so many nonprofits out there. They are taking advantage of that to provide better treatment, better recovery, and better prevention. As a result, they are saving lives.  On Saturday, I visited a group called Clean Acres in Wilmington, It is a farm that provides recovery housing for men. These are men who are struggling with addiction. They work on the farm. They provide each other support, and it has been very successful for a lot of them.  I met a guy named Dan, who told me how Clean Acres is helping him get his life back. For over a decade, he was a heroin addict. He shot up every morning until one day, he was actually at work, and he passed out. He was digging a ditch, and he passed out.  He was rushed to the hospital. The doctors discovered he had a very serious infection related to his intravenous drug use. He required emergency, lifesaving surgery right then.  The doctors told him he might not wake up. He did wake up after that surgery, and there before him were his three kids. He hadn't seen them in 5 years because--in so many cases you hear this and as Dan said this--the drugs became everything. He said, not his family, not his relationships, not his friends, not his work--the drugs became everything. These three kids had come to his bedside because they thought it might have been his deathbed, he said.  He saw these three kids, whom he hadn't seen in 5 years. He said that even after having experienced this near-death operation and having his three kids there, the first thought that came to his mind was: Where can I get another hit? Where can I get another hit? But then, in the situation he was in, he prayed, and he said his prayer was: ``Lord, help me get out of here.'' ``Help me get out of here,'' meaning, ``help me get out of this situation.''  He made a decision. He was going to try treatment again. He had tried treatment before. So many recovering addicts and addicts I talk to around my State have been in and out of treatment programs, detox treatment. It hasn't worked.  He decided this time he was not just going to get into treatment, but he was going to try something different, which was not to go back to the old neighborhood, not to go back to his old friends, but instead to try longer term recovery. That is how he ended up at Clean That is this farm where he and other men live together. They work, but they support each other to try to keep their lives on track after their treatment is over. It doesn't provide the treatment, but it does provide them with the meetings they need to be able to have that support around them in order to keep clean.  As one of the men at Clean Acres told me, it is hard to go through treatment. It is much harder to stay clean after treatment.  So Dan is healing himself. He is working at the farm. He plans to go into construction. He has big plans now. That is the hope. That is the opportunity for people to get their lives back on track whom I see every day when I talk to the people in my home State of  Last week, I was also at Racing for Recovery, outside of Toledo, I met with Todd He has been in recovery from addiction for about 20 years. He is now giving back in a huge way.  I met with parents who had lost children to addiction. They come to Todd's organization, Racing for They find support there, and they help other parents to work through this.  I met law enforcement officers there who are working with this recovery facility to try to ensure that the people whom they are locking up aren't going to just get right back into the revolving door again, back in and out of prison, back committing crimes. The 1 cause of crime in the State of Ohio is this addiction; people who, again, put the drug first ahead of everything, including their own sense and their own conscience, their own sense of what is moral and right, and instead they are committing burglaries and fraud and shoplifting--anything they can do to get the funds they need to continue their addiction.  I met Jessica at Racing for She has been clean for 9 months. Before she sought help, she overdosed for 3 days in a row. She said her life was saved by the police; specifically, a program by the Lucas County Police Department called the Drug Abuse Response Team, I am really impressed with DART and what they are doing. It is now being copied in other communities around Ohio and around the country. DART is being proactive. They got her engaged in treatment and recovery. She is now in sober housing. Todd, Jessica, and others there told me this: Look, you have to have this longer term recovery because that is what works.  A couple of weeks ago, during the State work period, I held a roundtable discussion in Fremont, OH, where I met Matt Matt is an amazing guy--a charismatic, young guy. He said that for him the gateway drug was marijuana and alcohol in high school. He ended up overdosing on heroin three times. He was convicted of 13 felonies, and he went to detox 28 times. Now he is clean and preventing new addictions from taking place by working nonstop to raise public awareness about the dangers of drug use. He goes around to the schools, and he doesn't just talk to kids who are juniors and seniors. He talks to middle schoolers because he knows he has to go younger and younger to get kids to think about their own futures, about the fact that addiction can happen in one use sometimes, and it is something that can ruin their lives. Thank God for Todd and thank God for Matt, because guys like that are out there every day giving back and they are saving lives.  So I want to thank all these compassionate people I have met--Clean Acres, Racing for Recovery, the Lucas County DART team, and Team They are doing the hard work. They are in the trenches trying to actually turn the tide on this growing addiction problem we have. Again, I want to tell them that help is on the way.  Last year Congress did pass the 21st Century Cures Act and authorized[[Page S1595]]funding for States--$500 million this year and $500 million for next year--to fight this epidemic. Another step we took, which I think was probably the biggest step we have taken in a couple of decades in this area, was the passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or the CARA Those who know about CARA know that it is a new approach on treatment, recovery, and prevention. If you don't know about it, look it up and check it out. Be sure that the groups in your town, wherever you live, know about the fact that they can apply for grant money to be able to help on these recovery services that I am talking about, many of which do not have the funding to be able to be successful without the increases in rehab. Be sure they know about the fact that if you have a fire department in your community that is strapped for cash and cannot afford the Narcan to provide the Narcan treatments, there is an opportunity to apply for grants there, too, to be able to save lives from overdoses. Narcan is not the answer. The answer is to get into treatment. But Narcan is saving lives, and, therefore, it is necessary today. So let people know that is around and is available now.  Sadly, the situation is not getting better, even with these new efforts that are finally being implemented by the new administration. They started at the end of the Obama administration with a couple of programs, and now we have a couple more programs coming on line. Within the next few months, we expect the rest of the programs to be fully implemented. They are absolutely necessary, but they are pushing up against something new, which is, I hate to say, even more dangerous than heroin, and that is this synthetic heroin that is coming into our communities. It is like a poison coming into our communities by the U.mail system, if you can believe it.  The experts tell us that most of this fentanyl or carfentanil is being made in laboratories overseas, mostly in China, and it has been coming through the mail system. Why? Because the traffickers don't want to use other private carriers--UPS or FedEx or others--because they require that there be advanced digital information on where the package is from, what is in it, and where it is going. Guess what. We don't require that in the mail system. So the bad guys choose to send it through the mail system instead. That certainly is something the Federal Government should address.  So we have introduced legislation called the STOP It is very simple. It says that if you want to send something to the United States of America, it has to say where it is from--what place in China--what is in the package, where it is going, and it can only go to the place they say it is going. That gives our law enforcement a new tool they are desperate to have because they are not able to look at millions of packages. But they can look at hundreds and this helps them to ferret out those packages that look most suspicious.  By the way, this new stuff, fentanyl and carfentanil, is incredibly powerful and incredibly dangerous. It is believed to be 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin. Think about that. I was in Dayton, OH, a week before last and was meeting with the law enforcement task force there. They told me the sad story about a little girl, 14 years old, who was told by her friends: You ought to snort this stuff; it is called heroin. She did. It was fentanyl, and she dropped dead. She overdosed and died immediately because it was so powerful. Even a few flakes of it, they say, can kill you.  According to the Cleveland medical examiner of Cleveland, OH, this past month of February, which is the shortest month in the year, was also the deadliest month in Northeast Ohio for fentanyl and heroin. In other words, what they are seeing is not just more overdoses but more deaths because of fentanyl being mixed with heroin or sometimes fentanyl in its pure form. In just 28 days this February, 60 Clevelanders died from overdoses in one month. This is one city in There are another seven cases that are undergoing tests, but they are suspected to be the result of heroin and fentanyl overdoses.  What is driving the growth of this epidemic is the increasing use of fentanyl. Drug traffickers are lacing other drugs with it. I was told by the DART task force in Toledo that they are actually putting fentanyl in marijuana now, and people are showing up in the emergency room and overdosing on marijuana because it is sprinkled with fentanyl. It is more addictive. So the traffickers like it. It is more deadly. So we need to fight back. The Drug Enforcement Administration says it takes 2 milligrams of fentanyl to kill you. That is about the same as a pinch of salt. Many heroin users don't realize that the heroin they buy on the street may contain these new incredibly powerful synthetic drugs. So part of the message has to be what one father told me, which is: You are playing Russian roulette every time you use these drugs because you don't know what is in it. If there is fentanyl in it, there is a good chance you won't just overdose, but you will end up as one of these statistics we talked about earlier.  In Lorain, OH, last Monday, a 29-year-old man drove off the road and nearly hit a tree. When police arrived they found him unconscious from an overdose, with a baby in the backseat--a baby in the backseat. It took several doses of this Narcan and naloxone to reverse the effects of the overdose. Ordinarily, it would take only one dose, but with fentanyl-laced heroin it takes more. When police went to his home, a child answered the door and said: Mommy is sleeping, and we can't wake her up. Again, this is the guy that overdosed in the car. They take the kid home and another kid says: Mommy won't wake up. They find out the mother is also unconscious from a heroin overdose that she had in front of her four children. According to police, the couple thought they were using heroin, but tests confirm that it was laced with fentanyl.  This is an opportunity for us in the Congress to pass legislation that will help to be able to stop some of this poison from coming into our communities. At a minimum, it will raise the price, because some of this fentanyl, I am told, is less expensive than even the things that are less powerful, like heroin.  Fentanyl took the life of Erin Jarvis of Troy, Erin was a prom queen. Erin was very popular. She was active in student government. She was captain of her soccer team. She got good grades. She got into Ohio University, a great school.  She had multiple knee injuries from playing soccer, which required surgery. She was prescribed She became addicted. At Ohio University, her friend introduced her to a drug that was stronger and cheaper and easier to get. Of course, that was heroin. This story I have heard so many times. There is the overprescribing, sometimes because of an accident and an injury, and, then, somebody becomes addicted and turns to heroin because it is cheaper and easier to get. Erin began disappearing for days at a time, stealing from her family. Her mom Kelly started missing jewelry, credit cards, and even a TV set. When her sister got her wisdom teeth taken out, she stole her sister's By the way, she never should have gotten Percocet for her wisdom teeth, in my view.  Erin finally got help. She went to rehab. She decided she wanted to become a nurse and help others struggling with addiction. After receiving treatment, she moved back in with her mom. But she relapsed, and she died. She died at the age of 24 with this promising life ahead of her. Her last words to her mom were these: I love you. The next day Kelly watched her daughter get taken out of their home in a body bag.  Tests showed that Erin died of an overdose of heroin laced with fentanyl. According to the coroner, she hadn't used the full injection. There was a lot left in the needle. He said: I suspect that what was in that syringe was not what she thought it was--exactly.  Families who have loved ones struggling with addiction are worried about the poison pouring into the streets, and you can see why. As deadly as heroin is, this stuff is even worse.  To keep this poison off the streets, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Rubio, Senator Hassan, and I have introduced bipartisan legislation, the Synthetic Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act, or the STOP Act, which would require the Postal Service to require this simple information that would give our law enforcement the ability to target these packages of fentanyl.[[Page S1596]]  Based on expert testimony in hearings we have had hearings before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, it would make it easier for them to detect those packages. That is what law enforcement is asking for. We should provide it to them. There is a bill in the House that is identical to ours, introduced by Congressman Pat Tiberi of Ohio and Congressman Richard Neal of  This is not the silver bullet, as I said. It is not the solution. No one has that silver bullet, but it would take away a key tool of drug traffickers and restrict the supply of these drugs, raising their price and making it harder to get. With the threat of this synthetic heroin and this poison coming into our communities every day, we need to act and act now.  So I would urge my colleagues to let their constituents know about the help that is on the way. Tell them about what is going on with the Cures Act and CARA legislation. Put it on your website so they know they can get help with treatment and recovery that was not previously out there. Our law enforcement, first responders, and firefighters can get the help they need to be able to get the training and have the funds for Narcan to save lives. We can do much better in terms of prevention and education. Some of this grant money is directed toward letting people know the connection between prescription drugs and heroin and between fentanyl and heroin.  Finally, to my colleagues, please join us in pushing back against these new poisons coming into our communities by cosponsoring the STOP Act and by requiring that this basic information be provided. With more cosponsors, I think our leadership will be much more likely to take this to the floor. Once it gets to the floor, it can be passed because people know that in their communities all over this country this epidemic must be stopped.

797,topic-id,576,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.1362, a bill to name the Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa, the Faleomavaega Eni Fa'aua'a Hunkin VA  I have sponsored this bill in order to honor my predecessor and a true public servant, the Honorable Faleomavaega Eni Fa'aua'a  Born on August 15, 1943, in Vailoatai Village, American Samoa, Mr.Faleomavaega graduated from Brigham Young University in 1966 and subsequently joined the United States Army and served in  However, his career in the Army was just the beginning of his public service. Mr.Faleomavaega served as a staff member to A.Fuimaono, American Samoa's first Delegate at-large to Washington, D.C., from 1973 to 1975.  Having earned his law degree from the University of Houston, he next served as staff counsel to the Committee on the Interior and Insular  In 1981, Mr.Faleomavaega returned to American Samoa to serve as our deputy attorney general until 1984, then as our lieutenant governor until 1989. During this period, Mr.Faleomavaega reentered military service in the U.Army Reserve from 1982 to 1989.  In 1989, Mr.Faleomavaega began his tenure as the congressional Delegate from American He went on to win 13 consecutive terms, making him the longest serving Delegate to date from American  While in Congress, he diligently served the interests of his constituents as a member of both the House Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Natural  Sadly, my friend Eni Faleomavaega passed away on February 22. He is survived by his wife, 5 children, and 10 grandchildren.  I would now like to say a few personal words about the man whom I came to call a true friend.  Given that I challenged him for his seat from 1994 until 2014, when I won my first term, Eni and I had a long and complicated relationship. Though we were often at odds politically, we always treated one another with the utmost respect and grace, allowing us to form a shared bond that I am very thankful for and will never forget.  Ours was a true friendship that demonstrated that, despite whatever political differences we may have, we can all come together for the good of those we serve. While we may have had disagreements on national issues, we were very much in sync when it came to Federal policy and funding for American  As a veteran whose long-term health suffered due to his service in Vietnam, Eni dedicated his life to improving conditions for veterans in American Samoa and took great pride in securing funds to build the local VA clinic which has served our veterans well.  Therefore, I can think of no better way to memorialize his dedication to the people of American Samoa and his service to our country in uniform than having the local VA clinic in Pago Pago, which he worked so hard for, named in his honor.  I want to encourage my colleagues in the House and Senate to salute my predecessor by supporting this measure so that we may honor this good man for his lifelong service and dedication to the people of American Samoa and to veterans everywhere.  This legislation satisfies all of the committee's naming criteria and is supported by the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post Number 3391.

87,topic-id,709,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment would protect all rules relating to the enforcement of the Clean Air Act, which are in danger now under H.998, the SCRUB Act, which seeks to authorize a brand new $30 million Presidential commission of unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats to wipe out agency rules across the whole field of government.  Mr.Chairman, last night in this Chamber, the President of the United States came and articulated policy areas where he said his administration ``wants to work with Members of both parties.'' One of these was to promote clean air and clean water. I was happy to hear it because earlier in the day he signed an executive order to clear the way for weakening safe drinking water standards through redefinition of which small bodies of water are covered under the Clean Water  Now, the amendment I propose provides a chance for all of us to start fresh in demonstrating our seriousness about this new bipartisan commitment to protect the water we drink and the air that we breathe.  The SCRUB Act proposes to create a commission to do what Federal agencies and commissions already do, which is to review and update their rules. That is why a lot of us are deeply skeptical about spending $30 million to create a new roving commission to hack away at rules protecting the public interest.  This commission would be made up of five members appointed directly by the President at his discretion and four members by the President from congressional nomination, too, from each party.  The advocates for this legislation say it is not about dismantling the rules that protect the water that our children drink or the air that our children and our grandparents breathe or the food that all of us eat. It is just about getting rid of unnecessary and obsolete and profligate regulations. And I take them at their word that that is what it is about.                              {time}  1330  So let's all agree that the new supercommission that you seek to establish under the SCRUB Act will not touch, in any way, the rules adopted under the Clean Air If that is not the purpose of this legislation, to undermine the Clean Air Act regime, as its advocates repeatedly insist, then there should be no problem having us formalize this commitment on a bipartisan basis.  Right now, the SCRUB Act does not explicitly protect clean air--or clean water, for that matter--from the prospects of a roving bureaucratic attack. Thus, it exposes all of us to unnecessary harm, threatening to scrub away the rules that protect the air we breathe.  What will that mean for 17 million Americans with asthma, for the millions of people with lung cancer and other respiratory diseases, for more than 30,000 people struggling with cystic fibrosis? All of these people are potentially in danger simply because of an overblown ideological attack on regulations, which are just the rules that we adopt as a constitutional democracy to protect ourselves from harm.  In answer to objections about the bill, the majority says that Congress will still have its say; but if you read it carefully, you see that congressional authority has actually been placed in a straitjacket. The bill requires an up-or-down vote on the commission's recommendations as a complete omnibus package rather than voting on each proposal individually.  So if you agreed with loosening some regulations, for example, in the Title X Family Planning program, which has a lot of rules, but you don't want to eviscerate the regulatory infrastructure under the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, you would have to vote on the entire package at once. This makes Congress into an embarrassing rubber stamp for a nine-person body effectively controlled by the executive branch.  Dear colleagues, let's not play games with the health and safety of our constituents. If this bill passes as is, rules that govern the very air we breathe would be subject to the SCRUB Act's unelected, unaccountable, and unbounded practitioners. My amendment closes a gaping and dangerous hole in the legislation. I ask my colleagues to think about public health and safety first, and not the magical thinking and scientifically ungrounded cost-benefit analysis promised by the SCRUB  I reserve the balance of my time.

113,topic-id,1218,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to the committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  The purpose of this amendment is simply to carve out from the provisions of the legislation any rules that we have adopted in order to prevent conflicts of interest and in order to promote financial transparency and disclosure by executive branch employees.  Mr.Speaker, since I became a Member of the House in January and joined the Judiciary Committee, we have been subjected to an onslaught of bills seeking to free corporate polluters, lead paint and asbestos manufacturers, and other abusers of the rights of consumers and citizens from having to face the people they injure in court and having to comply with the rules that have been worked out over the decades to protect our air, our water, our land, our people, our health, and our workplaces.  In most cases, we don't even get hearings on these bills. In the Judiciary Committee, I have not seen a victim of toxic torts or lead poisoning or medical malpractice testify, but their rights are being flattened every single day by the legislative bulldozer that is running amuck.  These bills are flying at us with lightning speed--no hearings, no real debate, no time to study the measures, no time to do the proper information gathering for our constituents.  Now the SCRUB Act would establish an unelected roving commission with unlimited subpoena power. It would be controlled by the President who gets to appoint a clean majority--five members at his own discretion; and four more, two Republicans and two So when they say it is bipartisan, remember what that means: Seven spots for majority appointees and two spots for minority appointees. More importantly, this roving commission can be lobbied behind closed doors by the special interests that want to splice and dice the regulations that we have worked out over the decades to protect the public against harm.  In all of the rules that our democracy has put in place--not just old rules, not just obsolete rules, not just silly rules--all of them are going to be in the crosshairs of this roving commission--no exceptions, no firewalls, no protections for rules governing public health and safety--like the Clean Water Act or like the Clean Air They just rejected the amendment to carve that out. There are no protections, significantly, and this is what the amendment is about, for rules guaranteeing transparency in government and integrity in government.  My motion to recommit, Mr.Speaker, would incorporate into the underlying legislation an amendment that I advanced in committee that goes to the heart of the crisis of confidence in Washington, in America today. I think every Member of this body can support it without betraying any of their principles or their party. On the contrary, I think it strengthens all of our principles and it strengthens our parties by building public confidence in the political system as a whole. It makes sure we can keep draining the swamp, as the President of the United States said in this Chamber last night.  My amendment states very simply that the Commission may not target for destruction any rules relating to any law governing a potential conflict of interest of an employee or officer of the executive branch, or any law governing the financial disclosures of executive branch employees, and bribery.  Right now, we know there is a dangerous crisis in popular confidence in the national government. This administration has brought to Washington a web of complicated conflicts of interest, real or potential, attendant to a global business empire that engages in business with foreign governments, foreign and domestic corporations, and a huge host of regulated entities.  Just a mile from where we sit today, for example, the Trump Hotel is renting out guest rooms, ballrooms, meeting rooms, and whole floors to foreign governments, embassies, and large corporations in flagrant violation of the Emoluments Clause, article 1, section 9, which requires the President to come ask us--Congress--for permission to receive payments from foreign governments.                              {time}  1445  They even have a director of diplomatic sales now. Furthermore, the standard lease that the Trump Hotel has with the General Services Administration forbids any elected official of the United States Government or the District of Columbia from deriving any profit or value from the lease. Clearly, there is a breach in this lease right now. The problem is that the President is not only the tenant, he is, for all intents and purposes, the landlord too because he controls the GSA and appoints its director. So President-landlord Donald Trump would have to go to court to sue tenant businessman Donald Trump for breaching the lease by collecting money under it as a public official. This just scratches the surface of a welter of ethical conflicts.  Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.  Since I became a member of this House in January, my Freshman colleagues and I have been engaged in two activities. First, we've been sitting in hearings and trying to make sense of bills that fundamentally change the legal and regulatory structure of America--and we've done so without hearing from witnesses, without time to study measures, and without time to do the proper information gathering that I believe is necessary to serve our various constituencies. Second, we've come to the floor at the end of each day to cast votes on deregulation. This house has been in the business of loosening rules on everything. We've[[Page H1418]]made it easier to pollute, easier to harm consumers--all in the name of cutting regulatory costs. And so it's no surprise that a bill like this sailed through the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to the floor.  This bill would establish an unelected commission with unlimited subpoena power and partisan majority to chop through the Federal Register with a chain saw. There are no exceptions, no firewalls, no protections for rules and regulations governing health and safety and there are no protections for rules guaranteeing transparency in government.  My motion to recommit would incorporate into the underlying legislation, an amendment I offered in committee. It's straightforward and unburdensome. In fact, when I offered it in committee one of my colleagues on the other side indicated that the priority of this bill is ``major rules with massive costs.''  If passed, this MTR would make certain that no provision of the SCRUB Act could be used to eliminate rules relating to laws that govern conflicts of interest of executive branch officers or employees. That's it--it reinforces existing law and clarifies provisions of this bill.  Surely, we can agree that rules designed to help maintain the public trust in those representing them in the Executive Branch are sacred enough to be explicitly protected. And if anyone should ask why it's so important, we don't have to look too far. This administration is a walking, talking billboard for the need to protect laws that protect the public trust.  I urge my colleagues to support this common sense measure.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

223,topic-id,1958,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congresswoman She has been a sensational leader within the Democratic Caucus and within the Congressional Progressive Caucus, especially on the issues of immigration and the rights of refugees. It is such an honor to be able to serve with her. I appreciate being able to spend some moments just reflecting on what took place in our Chamber last night with the President's speech.  We should start by giving credit where credit is due. This speech was not ``American Carnage II.'' It was a vast improvement, I would say, over all of the violent and apocalyptic imagery and rhetoric that we saw in the inaugural address. So hats off to the President's new speech writer, whoever that may be.  However, having said that, I think it is simply old wine in a new bottle. The same basic extremist Steve Bannon infrastructure governed that address despite the fact that the manners had improved considerably.                              {time}  1945  When I thought about President Trump's speech in this Chamber last night, I thought about George Not because of 1984, although I admit that my well-thumbed copy of this great dystopian novel is sitting on my desk right now and the words ``war is peace'' and ``ignorance is strength'' have been running through my mind over the last several weeks. No, I thought of Orwell not because of 1984, but because of a great essay he once wrote called ``Notes on Nationalism.''  In this essay, George Orwell contrasted patriotism and nationalism--two concepts that often get conflated. But at least, in his view, they represented two very different things. Patriotism, he argued, was a positive emotion, a passionate belief in one's own community--its people, its institutions, its values, its history, its culture.  An American patriot today, I would argue, believes in our magnificent constitutional democracy--our Constitution; our Bill of Rights; our judiciary and our judges; our States and our communities; our poets like Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman and Langston Hughes and Merrill Leffler; our philosophers like John Dewey and Ralph Waldo Emerson; our extraordinary dynamic culture which invites and absorbs new waves of people from all over the world, our artists, our musicians like Bruce Springsteen, the Neville Brothers, and Dar All of these people and things are what we love about America, and they evoke the positive emotion of patriotism.  Patriotism is all about uplifting people; drawing on what is best in our history; finding what is best in our culture; invoking our Founders, Madison,[[Page H1457]]Jefferson, Franklin, and Tom Paine; invoking the people who founded the country once again through the Civil War and the reconstruction amendments, Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass; the people who transformed America in the women's suffrage movement, like Susan Anthony; the people who remade America once again in the civil rights movement, like Martin Luther King, Bob Moses, and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee; the people who blew the doors off of discrimination and oppression against other groups, like the LGBT community, like Harvey  All of these people stand for a progressive dynamic and inclusive concept of America, and patriots want to draw on this culture in history in order to continue to make great progress for our people today. A patriot wants to improve the health of our people, the education of our people, the critical thinking skills of our people, the well-being of  Now, nationalism is different. If you look at it historically as Orwell did, nationalism has been not about building people up and improving their lives, it has been about militarizing society and getting everyone to sync their individuality, their creative personality into a large corporatist and authoritarian state, one that is destined to exploit people's goodwill by mobilizing them for groupthink and endless hostility in war, the kind that Orwell dramatized so frightfully in 1984 and in ``Animal Farm.''  Well, I am sorry to say that I didn't see a lot of patriotism in Orwell's terms in the speech last night. Ninety percent of our kids go to public schools, but 90 percent of this President's energy and administration's energy seems to go into maligning and defunding public education and diverting public money away from public schools into private education. That is the Betsy DeVos agenda.  Or take health care. The Affordable Care Act represents a magnificent national investment in health care of our own people. More than 22 million of our fellow citizens, previously uninsured, got health care because of the Thirty million if you include the expansion of Medicaid that took place under the  If you decide to go to a town hall, yours or someone else's, you will meet people who will tell you that their lives were saved because of the Affordable Care Act--victims of breast cancer and colon cancer and heart attacks and strokes and on and on. These things are just in the nature of life. We are all subject to medical misfortune. If you learn you have cancer or if you have a heart attack, that is a misfortune. It happens to people every day. But if you have cancer or leukemia or you have a heart attack and you can't get health coverage because you lost your job or because you are too poor, that is not just a misfortune, that is an injustice because we can do something about that. Because that has to do with how we have organized our own affairs as a society.  But what did we hear from the President last night about the health care and well-being of our people? Repeal and replace the Affordable Care They voted more than 50 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act and never once to replace it. They have got no plan. The President did not offer a plan.  The President restated the values of the Affordable Care Act itself. And understand, the Affordable Care Act was the compromise because the logical thing to have done, as President Obama said, if we were starting from scratch, would be to adopt a single payor plan. But because we were along a certain path, he felt we couldn't do that.  So he took the plan that was adopted at The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank, the one that was put in in Massachusetts by Governor Romney--That is the Affordable Care But they couldn't tolerate that because they cared more about scoring political points against the President than they did about actually making health care available to as many Americans as possible.  So the President showed up empty-handed again. No plan whatsoever. If there were a plan, we would be debating it. If they had something to offer, we would be talking about it. But they don't have it. They just want to repeal and consign everybody back to medical oblivion. Millions of people going back to not having it. Making everybody else's insurance premiums skyrocket and just turning our backs on the families that now depend on the Affordable Care  Now, I will say the President mentioned in passing something that he made a big deal of during the campaign, and I was happy he did. He went back to saying that we needed to give the government the authority to negotiate with the large drug companies, the prescription drug companies, for lower prices.  And I was happy to hear my colleagues from the other side of the aisle in talking about the pharmacist just now, also talking about the extraordinary power of the pharmaceutical companies and their predatory practices.  Well, what the President has said makes perfect sense on this point, which is there was some special interest legislation that came out several years ago saying that the government could not negotiate for lower prices with the drug companies when it comes to We do it with Medicaid, we do it with VA drug benefits, but we can't do it for Medicare drug benefits because some lobbyist was able to get somebody to stick that into the bill, and the GOP majority stands by it now.  And so I appeal to the President, if you are serious about it, I will work day and night to get every Democratic vote I can to side with you in giving the government the authority to negotiate for lower drug prices. That is a common ground agenda. Let's do that.  But as to the general picture of health care in the country, the President gave us nothing last night. We also got no jobs plan. We got no plan to confront the shameful inequality in our society.  When the President and his Cabinet entered the Chamber last night, the net worth of this room went up by $9.6 billion. This is the richest Cabinet in American history. These 17 people in the Cabinet have more wealth than 43 million American households combined. That is one-third of American households. When you look at the Trump Cabinet, you can see the net worth of one-third of American families together.  And the President, who campaigned like a crusading populist, like William Jennings Bryan, for working people, creates a Cabinet of billionaires and CEOs, people who profited like mad from NAFTA and all the trade deals that the President now denounces. He closed his campaign by railing against Goldman But Goldman Sachs may as well be the nickname of this From Secretary Tillerson to Steve Bannon and many others, Goldman Sachs is all over this administration.  And last night, we also got more immigrant bashing. And I know my friend and colleague, Congresswoman Jayapal, will discuss this.  How patriotic is immigrant bashing? I would say not very. Tom Paine said America would be a haven of refuge for people fleeing political and religious repression all over the world. Madison said it would be a sanctuary for religious and political refugees. America would come to be symbolized by the Statue of ``Give us your poor, your tired, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,'' that is the spirit of  We are a nation of immigrants. Other than Native Americans, we were here before everybody else got here. And the slaves were brought here against their will. But everybody else, we are immigrants or we are the descendants of immigrants. So if you attack immigrants, you are really attacking the dynamic and inclusive culture of America, a community of communities.  And then there is the big proposal we got to slash $56 billion in domestic spending and put it into a great big, new military buildup. And here we see the fingerprints, of course, of Steve We could destroy the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institutes of Health, the State Department, the Peace Corps, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Election Commission, the CFPB, and on[[Page H1458]]and on, and still not come close to the $56 billion that they want to rip out of the domestic priorities of the American people and simply give to the And for what? Why? No one has told us why. What is all of that money going to buy? Who is going to get rich off of all of that money?

374,topic-id,1005,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I am delighted to be with my distinguished colleague from Michigan on this legislation, which is part of a package of bills brought forward by the majority, which we believe undermine the ability of Federal agencies to effectively promote the public interest.  To begin with, it is quite clear that this legislation is unnecessary. Current law already bans the use of agency funds for ``publicity or propaganda purposes.'' Current law also currently bars agency employees from grassroots lobbying campaign designed to pressure Members of Congress to support or to oppose agency proposals.  So, at the very least, all of this is duplicative, which wouldn't be so bad just to add another level of red tape and legislation, except for this: If you look at the legislation, under Restriction, part 2, it says:  ``Any public communication issued by an Executive agency that refers to a pending agency regulatory action, other than an impartial communication that requests comment on or provides information regarding the pending agency regulatory action, may not--  ``(A) directly advocate, in support of or against the pending agency regulatory action, for the submission of information to form part of the record of review for the pending agency regulatory action. . . .''  So let's parse that for a moment. What they are saying is that the agency may not directly advocate to the public: Please tell us whether you are for or against this regulation and why.  They are not trying to prevent a viewpoint-specific propaganda intervention by the agency. This would actually stifle the ability of the agency to solicit anybody's point of view to go out on Facebook and ask, ``What is your position about this,'' and to use social media to solicit the public's input.  So although the legislation masquerades as an attempt to promote government transparency, it actually radically undercuts government transparency and the ability of the agencies to solicit the widest possible input.  It also says that the agency may not appeal to the public or solicit a third party to undertake advocacy in support of or against the pending agency regulatory action.  Now, I would have no problem if what they were trying to do is simply restate the current ban on one-sided propaganda inquiries by an agency to get one side to come out and support or oppose an agency rulemaking, but that is already against the law.  What they are trying to do is to cut off the ability of the agency to solicit any public input on all sides of the issue.  Why would we place that kind of duct tape over the Administrative Procedure Act?  Well, one thought, if you look at this proposal in the context of everything else they have brought forward this week, they want to try to reduce everything to a cost-benefit analysis. That is, what would the cost to polluters be? What would the cost to the violators of the public interest be?  They never look at what the benefit to the public is of the regulations, and they want to do it behind closed doors and then prevent the agencies from going out and aggressively soliciting the input of the public on all sides of the issue.  So we don't see what the need for this proposal is. We believe that it will have a severely chilling effect on the ability of agencies to do their job. They continually talk about one case, the WOTUS case, the waters of the United States case, where I cheerfully and readily admit that the agency went too far in terms of campaigning for its proposal. But they were called on that. The GAO already determined that they ran afoul of the prohibitions.  So they have one case which was dealt with completely legitimately within the law, and they have not cited another case.  I would gladly yield my time to my distinguished colleague from Michigan if he can invoke one other case where there was a problem or explain why the resolution of this problem was not sufficient in this case, because I think everybody understood that the agency had gone too far. It was dealt with. The problem is over.  So now we have a so-called cure, which is far worse than the underlying disease because the so-called cure is going to stifle and chill the ability of every Federal agency in the United States Government to go out and aggressively solicit public input. That is what we want in the agency process.  Now, yesterday, they just voted to create a new roving supercommission that would pore through the rules of all the different Federal agencies and bring back a package and then ask us to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down so they can just more readily dismantle public regulation.  Let's be very clear about it. We're talking about regulation that protects clean air. They rejected an amendment that would carve out the Clean Air Act from that bill. We're talking about regulation that protects clean water. We're talking about regulation that protects the purity of our food and our drugs. We're talking about regulations that advance our interests in a clean environment and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.  So it seems like they want to put the whole Federal regulatory process into a straitjacket, prevent the public from being involved, and prevent the agencies from going out and soliciting public input. That doesn't sound like giving government back to the people. That sounds like giving government over to billionaires, special interests, and big corporate powers that have all the lobbyists in Washington and know how to get things done behind closed doors.  Mr.Chair, I invite my distinguished colleague from Michigan to address any of the questions I have if there are any examples that he can provide of problems that would yield the need for such a dramatic shutdown on the ability of agencies to solicit public input.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-02-pt1-PgH1469-2.txt,99999999999999,"OIRA INSIGHT, REFORM, AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT",2017.0,2.0,March
378,topic-id,757,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Again, the advocates for the legislation returned to this one single case, which we all agree about. The GAO ruled that the EPA ran afoul of the prohibition on propaganda and on campaigning.  So the law worked there. The GAO blew the whistle on that. They shouldn't be coming out on one side of an issue and running a propaganda campaign. The government should not be engaged in propaganda. We all agree to that.  This legislation does something completely different. This legislation, rather than just saying a good day's work to the GAO for blowing the whistle, it says: Now we are going to tell all the Federal agencies and departments that have been out soliciting public input on all sides of issues, saying there is a regulation that has come up about clean air, about clean water, about food, about drugs, about the disposal of nuclear waste, about radioactive materials, and it tells them you can't do that anymore. You can't go out and solicit public input.  It places a complete chill on the ability of the government to go out and invite public participation in our government. Why? They keep returning to one case where the GAO blew the whistle where everybody agrees they were out of bounds.  A flag was thrown on the play, but now they want to use that in order to essentially impose a gag rule on Federal agencies across the land who are doing our work. The much reviled regulation that the agencies are engaged in is an attempt to flesh out the laws that we pass in this body because we don't want to be setting all of the particular rules about exactly how many pollutants can be in this water, in this[[Page H1472]]stream, in this river, in this creek, and so on, because we are not scientific experts on how many pollutants can be put into the air here and there. So it is delegated to government agencies.  But when they go through the Administrative Procedure Act and they have a rule and comment process, they should be able to go out and invite the public to participate.  Again, I invite my distinguished and thoughtful colleagues on the other side to cite one other case. Can they cite one case where the GAO did not blow the whistle? Can they cite some other litany of examples where there has been a real problem with government agencies being overzealous where it has not been corrected by the GAO?  The silence is deafening.  They have used the example of one problem that was caught, that was corrected, in order to try to demolish the ability of Federal agencies to go out and solicit the public's input.  To me, that is a familiar experience now, because I have been in the House of Representatives for just 2 months, and, in the committees I serve on, we continue to vote on bills where we have not had a single public hearing. We are not hearing from any of the groups.  I have a letter here objecting to this legislation that has been signed by the AFL-CIO, AFSCME, American Association for Justice, American Association of University Women, Americans for Financial Reform, Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization, Autistic Self Advocacy Network, BlueGreen Alliance, Center for Biological Diversity, Clean Water Action, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, Demand Progress, Earthjustice, Economic Policy Institute, Environment America, Environmental Working Group, Food & Water Watch, Greenpeace, Homeowners Against Deficient Dwellings, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, International Union of United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers, League of Conservation Voters, National Association of Consumer Advocates, and on and on and on.  I would like to have heard from these people in this process, but it seems like all we are getting from the other side is an attempt to have a curtain of darkness fall over all public process. We would like to have hearings. We want groups to be involved. But these people were not invited to testify. They didn't have a chance to opine on this.  Mr.Chair, in general, the problem here is that, rather than making government more transparent, we are making government more opaque. Rather than making government more open, we are making government more closed. Rather than reaching out to the public and inviting it into the rulemaking process, we are shutting the door and closing the blinds on it.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

380,topic-id,337,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I think we are finally having some light here on the subject.  My distinguished colleague and fellow freshman from Michigan is most concerned about what did take place in the Waters of the United States case. He praises the GAO for responding to Senator Inhofe's inquiry.  We all agree that the GAO determined that the EPA ran afoul of existing prohibitions in law on propaganda, on taking a side in an issue. A flag was called on the play and the problem was dealt with.  If you find a kid shoplifting a candy bar, and you catch him, you remove him from the store, you tell him not to do it again. You don't then go pass a law saying that anybody under 18 cannot enter any commercial establishment in the country. The law worked in that specific case.  But, you see, they have taken a sledgehammer to a mosquito, and the mosquito was already killed. So now what they are busting up is the ability of agencies across the country simply to use the social media to go out and to solicit and invite public input into the rulemaking process. What are we afraid of?  Justice Brandeis said that sunshine is the great disinfectant. We want the public involved. We want the public's engagement.  So, again, I invite my thoughtful colleagues on the other side to cite one case of an agency doing this that was not dealt with by the I can cite you countless examples of cases where Federal agencies have gone online to invite public input in a completely objective and neutral way. Now we are creating a chill over that process because of this ban on soliciting advocacy from the public on either side of the issue.  So I simply don't get it, and I am puzzled why they continually talk about one case which was happily resolved under existing law.

382,topic-id,1730,"Mr.Chairman, I include in the Record several letters opposing the bill.                                                      Coaltion for                                          Sensible Safeguards,                                                February 28, 2017.     Re House floor vote of H.1004, the Regulatory Integrity                Dear Representative: The Coalition for Sensible Safeguards      (CSS), an alliance of over 150 labor, scientific, research,      good government, faith, community, health, environmental, and      public interest groups, strongly oppose H.1004, the      Regulatory Integrity       The bill is a brazen attack on the public's right to know      by micro-managing the type of information that agencies are      allowed to communicate to all of us when taking actions to      protect the public, our economy, and the environment. An open      government that prioritizes democratic public participation      requires agencies to be able to effectively convey      information to the public and make agency policy positions      clear to the public. This bill will make our government less      open and less democratic and should therefore be rejected.       H.1004 will significantly inhibit federal agencies'      ability to engage and inform the public in a meaningful and      transparent way regarding its work on important science-based      rulemakings that will greatly benefit the public. As a      result, the bill will lead to[[Page H1473]]     decreased public awareness and participation in the      rulemaking process in direct contradiction of the      Administrative Procedure Act and agencies' authorizing      statutes, which specifically provide for broad stakeholder      engagement.       Substantial ambiguities in the bill threaten to create      uncertainty and confusion among agencies about what public      communications are permissible, and thus risks discouraging      them from keeping the public apprised of the important work      that they do on its behalf. In an era when agencies should be      increasingly embracing innovative 21st century communications      technologies needed to reach the public, including social      media, H.1004 sends exactly the wrong message.       The legislation strictly prohibits agencies from issuing      ``public communications'' that ``emphasize the importance''      of a particular agency action unless the communication has      the ``clear purpose of informing the public of the substance      or status'' of the particular action. The legislation applies      to a wide swath of regulatory actions including rulemakings,      guidance, policy statements, directives and adjudications.       While H.1004 assumes that the distinction between      informing the public of an agency action and emphasizing the      importance of that action is self-evident, in practice the      distinction is anything but clear. As a result, agencies are      likely to avoid any public communications that risk running      afoul of this ambiguous prohibition, no matter how      informative the communication might be for the public.       For example, various executive orders and statutes compel      agencies to conduct cost-benefit analysis on their pending      rulemakings, and thus to determine whether the rule's      benefits outweigh its costs. As currently written, the      Regulatory Integrity Act could potentially prohibit an agency      from communicating the results of such an analysis when it      concludes that a particular rule generates net benefits.      After all, that conclusion is tantamount to declaring that      the rule makes society better off on balance. Instead, the      agency would likely be forced to simply share the basic      information that they had conducted a cost-benefit analysis      of the regulation without being able to share the further      crucial information that the regulation's benefits exceeded      the costs. Given that many of the bill's sponsors      enthusiastically endorse the expanded use of cost-benefit      analysis in the rulemaking process, these kinds of arbitrary      prohibitions on communications concerning cost-benefit      analysis seem especially peculiar.       Agencies would encounter this problematic scenario when      deciding to share vital information, such as:       How many lives would be saved by a regulation;       How much property damage would be averted;       How much money consumers would save; and       Any of the other myriad public benefits that regulations      are designed to provide.       The stark absence of any clear bright-lines in the      legislation delineating what is and what is not prohibited      public communications is sure to have a chilling effect on      agencies, with the predictable result that agencies will be      less willing to share crucial information with the public and      that the public will be less informed about government      activities.       H.1004 also will severely impede, rather than enable,      agency use of new communication technologies, most notably      social media platforms, to reach the public. Regulatory      experts and scholars agree that agencies should be using      social media forums and platforms.       Agencies will find it difficult, if not impossible, to      communicate with the public through social media under H.     1004 since the bill prevents any usage of social media that      both conveys information about a regulatory action but also      promotes the importance of that action.       For example, the U.Department of Interior operates a      Twitter and Instagram account that is very popular with the      public because it regularly features photos of beautiful      landscapes and wildlife from national parks across the United      Under the Regulatory Integrity Act, the Department      might be prohibited from posting such photos on Twitter and      Instagram because they are not solely informational in nature      and could be interpreted as promoting the importance of the      department's work in environmental and wildlife preservation.       Enactment of H.1004 will lead to less transparency in      the government, make it more difficult for agencies to use      new communication technologies popular with the public, and      generally chill agency communications with the public on      important matters due to the lack of any bright-line      standards for agencies to follow.       We strongly urge you to oppose H.1004, the Regulatory      Integrity           Sincerely,                                              Robert Weissman,                                                        President,     Public Citizen                                  ____                                League of Conservation Voters,                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2017.

House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members,      the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) works to turn      environmental values into national, state, and local      priorities. Each year, LCV publishes the National      Environmental Scorecard, which details the voting records of      members of Congress on environmental legislation. The      Scorecard is distributed to LCV members, concerned voters      nationwide, and the media.       LCV urges you to vote NO on H.998, the SCRUB Act, H.     1004, the Regulatory Integrity Act, and H.1009, the OIRA      Insight, Reform, And Accountability LCV joins our      partners in the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards--an      alliance of consumer, public health, labor, good government,      environmental, and scientific groups--in strongly opposing      this trio of extreme bills that have far-reaching and      damaging consequences for vital public health and      environmental safeguards.       H.998, the SCRUB Act, would jeopardize critical      environmental safeguards that have been in place for decades      and would make it extremely difficult to develop new      standards in response to threats to public health and the      environment. This legislation creates a regulatory review      commission that would disregard the public benefits of      environmental safeguards and only consider the costs to      industries. By creating a misguided ``cut-go'' system for      safeguards, this bill would result in key public health      protections being eliminated.       H.1004, the Regulatory Integrity Act, would      significantly hinder communications between federal agencies      and the public and would discourage agencies from using      social media platforms. This legislation would reduce      government transparency and would leave the public less      informed about government activities. The vague guidelines      about what public communications are allowed would result in      agencies being less willing to share key information with the      public.       H.1009, the OIRA Insight, Reform, And Accountability      Act, would endanger clean air and clean water protections by      opening them up to more litigation. The bill would      effectively rewrite dozens of laws in which Congress mandated      that agencies prioritize public health, safety and the      preservation of clean air and water over concerns about      industry profits.       LCV urges you to REJECT H.998, 1004, & 1009 and will      strongly consider including votes on these bills in the 2017                Sincerely,                                                   Gene Karpinski,                                      ____       Good Morning Everyone: I am writing to express the      opposition of the American Association for Justice (AAJ) to      the three anti regulation bills that will be voted on on the      House floor this week. The Searching for and Cutting      Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act of 2017      (SCRUB Act); The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017; and the      OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act all impede the      ability of federal agencies to appropriately protect the      health, safety and well-being of the American public. As a      result, we urge your boss to vote NO on all three bills. See      below and attached for additional information on each bill.      Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

In addition, the bill      provides for a blanket percentage reduction in the cumulative      regulatory cost to industry without adequately considering      the benefits bestowed upon the public by these same      regulations. Under the severe SCRUB Act regulatory cost      considerations, targeted regulations could be repealed even      when the benefits of these rules are significant, appreciated      by the public, and far outweigh the costs.       The SCRUB Act also contains entirely ineffective cut-go      provisions. Under the bill's cut-go provisions, an agency      would be required to remove an existing regulation of equal      or greater cost from its cut-go list before it can issue a      new regulation. As a result of these provisions, agencies      will be unable to respond to any emerging hazard with any new      public regulatory protections or guidance.            H.1004, The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017       The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017 significantly limits      the types of communications federal agencies can have with      the public regarding pending regulatory actions and prohibits      agencies from soliciting support for its regulatory actions.      These inappropriately restrictive provisions have two goals:      stymieing important public protections and preventing the      public from knowing about the positive impact pending      regulations may provide.      H.1009, The OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act       Lastly, the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act      creates yet another duplicative and unnecessary commission to      provide for the repeal of regulations, while also providing      for numerous additional hurdles in the regulatory review      process. It would codify the numerous burdensome regulatory      review requirements and make them subject to judicial review      which would provide for extensive challenge and delay of      important protections. More concerning, this bill would[[Page H1474]]     severely damage the impact of dozens of Congressionally      passed public interest laws that require agencies to      prioritize public health and safety and protecting the      environment and instead focus on cost to industry. It also      would make federal agency science much more vulnerable to      judicial review. Lastly, the bill would effectively undermine      Congressionally chartered independent agencies by putting      them under the influence of the Office of the  ",CREC-2017-03-02-pt1-PgH1469-2.txt,99999999999999,0915,2017.0,2.0,March

Executive Order 13563, which was issued by President Obama, requires each agency to ``periodically review existing significant regulations to determine whether any such regulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed, so as to make the agency's regulatory program more effective or less burdensome in achieving the regulatory objectives.''  Because there is little doubt that this executive order covers the review and elimination of duplicative and overlapping regulatory actions, there is no need for the additional reporting requirements that this amendment would redundantly impose. More importantly, this amendment simply fails to address the profound flaws in the underlying bill. It fails to provide the bright lines for what an agency can communicate to the public safely within the stringent new guidelines. It fails to eliminate the unnecessarily burdensome and onerous requirements in the bill that seem to have no purpose but to reduce the amount of information agencies would be able to release to the public and invite from the public.                              {time}  1000  The amendment fails to eliminate the prohibition against agencies making public communications that directly advocate for or oppose the submission of public comments or expert analysis of a pending rule.

Most importantly, the amendment does nothing to cure the serious chilling effect that the bill would have on agency communications and the negative effects that this imposition would have on the ability of agencies to educate millions of Americans about the costs and benefits of a particular regulation and to invite their input into the rulemaking process.

My distinguished opponents have mobilized all of one case to demonstrate the necessity of this legislation, and it was a case which was properly resolved by the GAO, and everybody agrees to it.

The law works as it was. We don't need another law.

583,topic-id,1006,"Madam President, I am strongly opposed to the nomination of Rick Perry to be the Secretary of  While Governor Perry has a long record of public service, he is the wrong choice to lead the Department of He does not possess the technical expertise or necessary qualifications. Moreover, his past statements calling for the elimination of the Department and questioning the science behind climate change, coupled with his reported lack a understanding about the scope of the Department's responsibilities, call into question his ability to lead an agency that is so critical to our national and economic security.  What Governor Perry learned during this confirmation process is that the Secretary of Energy not only oversees our country's energy initiatives and strategies, but is also the steward of our nation's nuclear weapons stockpile. The National Nuclear Security Administration, or NNSA, a part of the Department of Energy, ensures the safety, security, and effectiveness of our nuclear weapons. The NNSA brings together exceptionally dedicated men and women from our Armed Forces to work alongside some of our best scientists and engineers to provide expert advice in nuclear nonproliferation and counterterrorism. The Secretary of Energy must understand their work and advise the President on our nuclear arsenal capabilities and national security issues. Governor Perry has no experience in these areas and is not qualified to lead the agency tasked with maintaining our nuclear deterrent.  The Department of Energy also protects our Nation's security by strengthening the electrical grid's resilience in the face of natural disaster and cyber attacks. Its Office of Electricity works with other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and utilities to protect the electrical grid; yet the Trump administration has reportedly proposed eliminating this office, something which Governor Perry has not sought to dispel.  The Department of Energy leads the country and the world in renewable energy generation and energy efficiency. For my home State of Rhode Island, renewable energy from the wind, sun, and ocean is not just a path to local energy production, but also a source of well-paying jobs ranging from steelworkers to scientists. Last year, Rhode Island became the first State to build an offshore wind farm, off the coast of Block Island, proving that offshore wind can be a viable renewable energy source for the United  This technological feat could not have been accomplished without the science, engineering, and policy research supported by the Office of Renewable Energy and Energy This office drives the research in wind, solar, geothermal, and ocean energy that has made affordable renewable energy a reality. However, Governor Perry, in his written responses, refused to comment on reports that the administration would cut funding, or even worse, eliminate this vital department. Failure to invest in this department and its research risks our future as an energy-producing nation.  We need a Secretary of Energy who also can effectively manage the Office of Science and the National Laboratories, programs that have made the United States a global leader in scientific advancement since the Manhattan project. The National Laboratory system hosts equipment far beyond the capabilities of most universities or companies--such as massive particle accelerators, powerful supercomputers, and high-temperature laser ignition facilities--that are vital to expanding our knowledge base and technological advancement.  The future of many of these energy science programs in the new administration is of great concern to the scientific community. The same budget recommendations that would eliminate the Office of Electricity also showed plans to cut supercomputing research, even as China is making large investments to become the world leader in this area. Advanced computing is vital to national defense and economic competitiveness. Shortsighted budget cuts here, or in any of our basic research programs, threaten our Nation's future security and prosperity. Governor Perry has not pledged to protect or prioritize anfof these programs.  The Department of Energy's leadership in atmospheric science and climate change is also threatened. The Trump administration has gone beyond merely ignoring the threat of climate change; it has proposed cutting off funding to the critical programs that monitor our planet. It has also cast doubt that climate data will be accessible and available to the public and other researchers. We have already seen an unprecedented attempt by the Trump transition team to collect the names of scientists who study the consequences of carbon dioxide emissions. It appears that, for the first time in[[Page S1559]]the history of the agency, its scientists are worried that honestly reporting their findings may be a career-ending decision.  This is an alarming assault on the integrity of American science. The Secretary of Energy must be someone who understands science and will protect the government scientists who work in the national interest. The Secretary must understand and be able to present to the President the overwhelming scientific consensus that the climate is changing and that human activities are responsible. All Governor Perry committed to do in this and other areas is to learn more about the science.  This is not sufficient.  We have been fortunate that recent occupants of this post were not learning basic science on the job. Both Presidents Bush and Obama filled this post with experts possessing a deep understanding of science and technological issues. President Bush appointed Samuel Bodman, who served as a member of MIT's faculty before moving into business and government. President Obama appointed a Nobel prize winner in physics, Steven Chu, and a MIT physicist, Ernest The result is that, for the past 12 years, the Department of Energy has been well equipped to respond to challenges in national security, energy, and science.  We need a Secretary of Energy who can build on that legacy. We need a Secretary of Energy who has the technical expertise to oversee our Nation's nuclear stockpile, the integrity to protect basic science from political attacks, and the willingness to fight for a secure grid and renewable energy technology. I am not convinced that Governor Perry has those qualifications.  For these reasons, I cannot support his nomination. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no.

1031,topic-id,776,"Mr.President, today I am reintroducing the Cybersecurity Disclosure Act of 2017 along with two members of the Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator Collins, and the ranking member, Senator In response to data breaches of various companies that exposed the personal information of millions of customers, our legislation asks each publicly traded company to include--in Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, disclosures to investors--information on whether any member of the board of directors is a cybersecurity expert, and if why having this expertise on the board of directors is not necessary because of other cyber security steps taken by the publicly traded company. To be clear, the legislation does not require companies to take any actions other than to provide this disclosure to its investors.  Many investors may be surprised to learn that board directors who participated in the National Association of Corporate Directors, NACD, roundtable discussions on cyber security late in 2013 admitted that ``the lack of adequate knowledge of information technology risk has made it challenging for them to `effectively oversee management's cybersecurity activities.' '' More recently, in Deloitte's 10th Global Risk Management Survey of Financial Services Institutions, published this month, 42 percent of respondents considered their institution to be less effective in managing cybersecurity. And according to the 2016-2017 NACD Public Company Governance Survey, ``fifty-nine percent of respondents reported that they find it challenging to oversee cyber risk, and only 19 percent of respondents said that their boards possess a high level of knowledge about cybersecurity.'' Indeed, Yahoo in its most recent annual report, which was filed with the SEC last week, disclosed that ``the Independent Committee found that failures in communication, management, inquiry and internal reporting contributed to the lack of proper comprehension and handling of the 2014 Security The Independent Committee also found that the Audit and Finance Committee and the full board were not adequately informed of the full severity, risks, and potential impacts of the 2014 Security Incident and related matters.'' The 2014 Security Incident here refers to the fact that ``a copy of certain user account information for approximately 500 million user accounts was stolen from Yahoo's network in late 2014.'' This is particularly troubling given that data breaches are on the rise. Indeed, 2016 was a recordbreaking year for data breaches, which increased 40 percent from the prior year to 1,093 breaches according to the Identity Theft Resource  Investors and customers deserve a clear understanding of whether publicly traded companies are prioritizing cyber security and have the capacity to protect investors and customers from cyber-related attacks. Our legislation aims to provide a better understanding of these issues through improved SEC disclosure.  While this legislation is a matter for consideration by the Banking Committee, of which I am a member, this bill is also informed by my service on the Armed Services Committee and the Select Committee on It is through this Banking-Armed Services-Intelligence perspective that I see that our economic security is indeed a matter of our national security, and this is particularly the case as our economy becomes increasingly reliant on technology and the  For example, when he was Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, appeared before the Armed Services Committee in 2015 and testified that ``cyber threats to the U.national and economic security are increasing in frequency, scale, sophistication and severity of impact.'' He further said that ``[b]ecause of our heavy dependence on the Internet, nearly all information communication technologies and I.networks and systems will be perpetually at risk.''  Indeed, retired Army GEN Keith Alexander, who is the former commander of the United States Cyber Command and former Director of the National Security Agency, appeared before the Armed Services Committee this month and stated that ``while the primary responsibility of government is to defend the nation, the private sector also shares responsibility in creating the partnership necessary to make the defense of our nation possible. Neither the government nor the private sector can capably protect their systems and networks without extensive and close cooperation.''  With mounting cyber threats and concerns over the capabilities of corporate directors, we all need to be more proactive in ensuring our Nation's cyber security before there are additional serious breaches. This legislation seeks to take one step toward that[[Page S1642]]goal by encouraging publicly traded companies to be more transparent to their investors and customers on whether and how their boards of directors are prioritizing cyber security.  I thank Harvard Law School professor John Coates, MIT professor Simon Johnson, Columbia Law School professor John Coffee, and the Consumer Federation of America for their support, and I urge my colleagues to join Senator Collins, Senator Warner, and me in supporting this legislation.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgS1641.txt,1982,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR--,2017.0,7.0,March

Not all consumer protection regulations are created equal. If the regulation is important, effective and still relevant, then let it stand.

ESEA provides financial assistance to local educational agencies and schools with high numbers or high percentages of children from low-income families to help ensure that all children meet challenging State academic standards.  No regulation should be exempt from the review process, especially those regulations that impact low-income students across the country. It is imperative that we have smart, targeted, cost-effective regulations that actually help the people that need the help.  Imposing ineffective regulations on schools and educational agencies cost taxpayers money--this must be given the opportunity for oversight, as is given under the SCRUB Act--and overburden our already exhausted educators, and can cause more harm rather than good.  Why not take a look at these regulations and just consider whether they are working? And, if they are, then let's leave them alone. But if not, then, let's change them there.  There is no reason why we should create, again, a special carve-out from the commission's consideration. For those reasons, Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.

Regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act need to be examined and updated just as much as any other regulations. Reviewing and revisiting regulations promulgated decades ago allows the opportunity to improve upon existing standards.  According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Environmental Protection Agency regulations cost the public $353 billion a year. Given the high costs associated with EPA regulations, excluding these regulations from this review process just doesn't make any sense. $353 billion--more than one-third of a trillion dollars--needs review.  Importantly, this bill has several significant procedural hurdles to pass before any regulation would be repealed: the commission must determine the regulation is no longer necessary; the commission must recommend repealing the regulation; and, most significantly, Congress would need to vote to get rid of the regulation.

Look, the GAO found numerous challenges, including poor conditions at schools, inadequate healthcare oversight, and mismanagement of energy resources that limit the ability of tribes to create economic benefits and improve the well-being of their communities.  Clearly, the Federal Government is not getting this right, and we need to exercise our oversight. We need more attention to this issue, not less.

But I must disagree with him in regard to this amendment.  No one regulation is the perfect and ideal regulation that will last into perpetuity. All regulations need to be reviewed, and that is what this rule does. The commission focuses on rules and regulations that are out of date, no longer useful, and are otherwise unnecessary or obsolete.  Regulations that were promulgated with the original intent of protecting whistleblowers need updating and consideration as much as any other regulation does. Reviewing and revisiting regulations promulgated decades ago creates the opportunity to improve upon existing standards.  Excluding whistleblower regulations from this exercise means that whistleblowers would lose out on the chance to streamline regulations and reduce burdens that might be harming whistleblowers. In fact, this process could actually help protect whistleblowers in its oversight and transparency.  Importantly, this bill has several significant procedural hurdles to pass before any regulation would be repealed. The commission must determine that the regulation is no longer necessary; the commission would then recommend repealing the regulation; and, again, most significantly, Congress would need to vote on the regulation in order to get rid of it.

And if it be the focus of Congress to do just that, then we must, irrespective of the SCRUB Act, focus on strengthening those laws that protect our whistleblowers to make our government run more transparently, more effectively, and more efficiently.

I wanted to begin by commending the Vice President and Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Homeland Security and Secretary of State for the strong message of support for That includes the President last night and their strong support, by the way, for the Transatlantic Alliance that these individuals outlined during their respective visits to the Munich Security Conference and meetings with allies in  At that Munich Security Conference on February 18, the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, said: ``I hope [he means the world] will choose a democratic world order, a post-West one, in which each country is defined by its sovereignty.'' I think that based on recent history, it is clear that when a Russian leader says ``post-West,'' we should interpret that as a phrase to mean post- So I would ask the Senator with regard to this, what are his views with regard to Vladimir Putin's desire to establish spheres of influence in Europe and the Middle East, create divisions with our allies. How should we view the Russian world view as it compares to the national interests of the United States?  ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgS1523.txt,2084,"OIRA INSIGHT, REFORM, AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT",2017.0,1.0,March
322,topic-id,983,"To answer that question, I would begin by reminding everyone that when we are talking about Russia, we are not talking about the Russian people. We are talking about Vladimir Putin and the cronies who surround him and their goals for the future. We have no quarrel with the Russian people, who I actually believe would very much want to have a better relationship with the United States and certainly live in a world in which their country was more like ours than the way their government now runs theirs.  The second thing I would point to is, it is important to understand history. At the end of the Second World War, Nazism had been conquered, and the Japanese Empire and its designs had also been ended, fascism defeated. The United States and the world entered this period of a Cold War, a battle between communism and the free world. The United States and our allies stood for that freedom. At the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Soviet bloc, the fall of communism, the world we all hoped had entered into this new era, where every nation had a different system--maybe some had a parliamentary system, maybe some had a republic, such as ours--but in the end, more people than ever would have access to a government responsive to their needs.  That was the growing trend around the world, up until about 7, 8, 10 years ago. We now see the opposite. We see a rising arc of the totalitarianism, and within that context is where I believe Vladimir Putin's world view is constructed. He views the values we stand for, which some may call Western values, and perhaps that is the right terminology, but I really believe in universal values: the idea that people should have a role to play in choosing their leader, that people should have a freedom to worship as they see fit, that people should be able to express their opinions and ideas freely without fear of retribution or punishment by the government.  These are the values I think we have stood for and that our allies have stood for and that we had hoped Russia would stand for in this new era, but Vladimir Putin viewed that as a threat. In particular, over the last number of years, he has decided the best way for him to secure his place in Russian politics is through an aggressive foreign policy in which he views it as a zero-sum game.  That is not the way we view it. We actually view the world as a place where we can help rebuild Japan; we can help rebuild They are stronger, and we are stronger. It isn't one or the other.  He does not see it that way. He views the world as a place where in order for Russia to be greater, America has to be less; in order for him to be more powerful, we have to be less powerful, and it is a world in which he has to undermine democratic principles and try to expose them as fraudulent.  That is why you saw the Russian intelligence services meddle in our elections in 2016. One of the main designs they had was to create doubt and instability about our system of government and to not just discredit it here at home but to discredit it around the world.  I just returned from Europe a week ago. Germany and France, which both have upcoming elections of their own, are seeing an unprecedented wave of active measures on the part of Russian intelligence to try to influence their elections. In the Netherlands, we have seen some of the same. So this is very concerning.  Our European allies are very concerned about the weaponization of cyber technology to strategically place information in the public domain for purposes of undermining candidates, steering elections, and undermining policymaking.  I want everybody to understand this is not just about elections. The exact same tools they used in the 2016 Presidential election, they could use to try to influence the debate in the Senate by attacking individual Senators or individual viewpoints and using their control over propaganda to begin to spread that.  I will give you just one example, and that is in May of 2015, the German intelligence agencies reported an attack on the German Parliament, on energy companies, on universities. They attribute that to Russian hackers.  In Montenegro, the Prime Minister has sought membership in NATO, an action we have supported in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which both of us serve on, but Russian intelligence has plotted at a very aggressive level to disrupt their elections late last year.  Moscow has used TV and Internet outlets like Russia Today, or RT, and Sputnik to launch propaganda campaigns to galvanize anti-EU extremists ahead of the Dutch elections. The list goes on and on. There is no shortage of them.  The point is, we are in the midst of the most aggressive, active measures ever undertaken by a foreign government to not just meddle in American policy debates and American elections but in those throughout the free world, and it is deeply concerning.  I think another matter that I would love to hear the Senator's opinion on is on the issue of human rights violations because, on top of being a totalitarian state, what goes hand in hand with totalitarianism are human rights violations. In fact, totalitarianism is, in and of itself, a human rights violation; that there can be no dictatorship, no repressive regime, no totalitarian leader who can maintain themselves in power without violating the human rights of their people.  So I would ask the Senator--I would love to have his comment on whether or not, indeed, Vladimir Putin is a serial human rights violator and what our policy should be in terms of outlining that to the world.

So shining a light on the reality and understanding, as I always tell my colleagues--I said this last October, that this is not a partisan issue.  I am telling you that--to my Republican colleagues who might be uncomfortable about discussing Russian interference--this is not about the outcome of the election; this is about the conduct and what happened throughout it. And what they did last year, in the fall, in the Presidential race, they can do against any Member here. If they don't like what you are saying, if they think you are getting too far on policy, you could find yourself the target of Russian propaganda in the hopes of undermining you, perhaps even having you eliminated from the debate because they understand our political process quite well.  The second is to do no harm. There is this notion out there--and I think on paper it sounds great, right--why don't we just partner up with the Russians to defeat ISIS and take on radicalism around the world.  The problem is this: 1, that is what Russia claims they are already doing. Vladimir Putin claims he is already doing that. So if he is already doing it, why would we have to partner with him? He is already doing it. Obviously, the answer is because he hasn't. This has been about propping up  Here is the other problem. When you partner up with someone, you have to take responsibility for everything they do and all the actions they undertake.  Senator Coons just outlined a moment ago, he said: Well, we talked about the bombing in  Think about it. If we had partnered with Russia in Syria and they were bombing Aleppo and they were hitting hospitals and they were killing civilians and they were our partners, we have to answer for that as well. We would be roped into that.  The third is to understand their strategic goal is not to defeat radical elements in the Middle East; their strategic goal is to have inordinate influence in Syria, with Iran, potentially in other countries at the expense of the United  We have had two Presidents--a Republican and a Democrat--previous to the current President who thought they could do such a deal with Vladimir Both of them fell on their face because they did not understand what they were dealing with. It is my sincerest hope that our current President doesn't make the same mistakes.  In addition to that, I know there are a number of legislative approaches that we have worked on together, as members of both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, and I would ask the Senator from Delaware if he could highlight some of those legislative matters that we have been talking about: resolutions, laws, and public policy that we have been advocating.

326,topic-id,847,"I thank the Senator for joining me in this endeavor here today. It is important that we speak out about this.  In a moment, the majority leader will be here with some procedural matters that will, I guess, take the Senate to a different posture.  Before that happens, I wanted to close by not just thanking him for being a part of this but by making a couple more points.  The first is, I want you to imagine for a moment, if you are sitting at the Kremlin and you are watching on satellite television the debate going on in American politics today, you are probably feeling pretty good about yourself. You have one group arguing that maybe the elections weren't legitimate because the Russians interfered. In essence, there have been news reports about a tension between the President and the Intelligence You have these reports every single day back and forth. You are looking at all this chaos, and you are saying to yourself: We did a pretty good job. If what we wanted to do was to divide the American people against each other, have them at each other's throats, arguing about things, and sowing chaos and instability into their political process, I think you look at the developments of the last 6 weeks and 6 months, and if you are in the Kremlin, you say: Well, our efforts have been pretty successful with that. I think that is the first thing we need to understand.  The second thing is, this should all be about partisanship. I am a member of the Senate Intelligence It is probably known that we are undertaking an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections. I want everyone to know--I speak for myself and I believe almost all of my colleagues when I say, on the one hand, I am not interested in being a part of a witch hunt; on the other hand, I will not be part of a coverup. We are going to get to the truth. We want to get to the truth. We want to be able to deliver to this body and to the American people a document with truth and facts, wherever they may lead us, because this is above political party. Our system of government and this extraordinary Republic has been around for over two centuries. It is unique and it is special, and with all of its blemishes and flaws, I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.  I want people to think about that. The next time you wonder and say to yourself that things are so tough in America and things are going so poorly, well, with whom would you trade places? I am not saying we don't have problems, because we do, but I ask, in what country would you rather be? I promise you that you won't say China if you know anything about I promise you that you won't say Russia if you know anything about There is no nation on Earth we would trade places with, and there is no process of government I would trade for ours. It is not perfect.  One of the strengths of our system is our ability to stand up here in places like the Senate and discuss our differences and our problems and make continuous progress forward even if the pace is slower and more frustrating than we wish. That is what is at stake in this process and what is at stake in this debate. That is what none of us can allow to see erode because of interference by a foreign government, especially one that is a thug and war criminal in every sense of the word.  So our quarrel is not with the Russian people and it is not with I have extraordinary admiration for the Russian people. I have extraordinary admiration for the sacrifices and contributions they have made throughout history to our culture and to the world. But, unfortunately, today their government is run by an individual who has no respect for his own people and no respect for the freedom and liberty of others, and it is important for our policymakers on both sides of the aisle to be clear-eyed and clear-voiced in what we do moving forward.  I thank the Senator for being with us today and allowing us to engage in this discussion. I hope we will see more of that in the weeks and months to come so we can speak clearly and firmly in one voice that on issues involving America and our sovereignty and our system of government and decisions we must make, we will speak with one voice as one Nation, as one people, as one country.

It is fitting that it now be named after him.  Eni was someone I looked to as a leader. He was the dean of the Territories Caucus when I first came to Congress in 2009. He had served here for some 20 years by that point; but his experience was even more longstanding, having worked on the staff of Representative Philip Burton, a champion of the territories and all of the people in America who are often overlooked and forgotten.  There were two things in particular I saw in First, he had absolutely no hesitation in representing the people of American Samoa and providing glimpses of the culture with the rest of us. He relished the opportunity to wear his lavalava, one of the traditional pieces of clothing. He took pride in his traditional tattooing. He never hesitated to[[Page H1547]]sing the songs of his people 8,000 miles away.  Though a Delegate in this House, Eni Faleomavaega never presented himself as anything less than a Member of In doing so, he never diminished the standing of his constituents and their right, like all Americans, to have their voice heard here in the people's  The second lesson I learned from our departed friend was that the responsibilities of a Member of Congress go beyond the parochial concerns of our district. Of course, we are here to be sure that the people and place we represent are treated fairly and that our special circumstances are taken well into account in the formulation of Federal law and policy; but beyond that local responsibility, we all have a larger responsibility to act and speak on behalf of our Nation as a whole.  Eni certainly demonstrated that larger role we must all accept by his advocacy for Native Americans and by taking leadership in the foreign affairs of our Nation, especially in Asia and the island nations of the South A good Member of Congress takes care of their own people, just as Eni did. A great Member of Congress understands that their people can only thrive when the Nation as a whole is a place of justice and peace.

A proud daughter of northwest Indiana--Gary--and the industrial working class, Kim grew up witnessing firsthand the destruction of the industrial Midwest as corporate greed destroyed the steel industry and manufacturing jobs and decimated good-paying union jobs that built the middle class. Daughter of a union factory worker, Kim attended Purdue University, where she met the love of her life, Will Kohr.[[Page S1576]]  Upon graduation, Kim began her long career in the labor movement, moving to California in 1986 to work as a journalist and an organizer with Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers Union,  Kim and Will moved to Upper Jay, NY, where their daughter Emma was born and raised. Six, often seven days a week, Kim, an International Representative for the fiercely independent and democratic United Radio, Electrical and Machine Workers of America, UE, would drive hours in every direction from her family's cabin in Upper Jay, NY, to help workers, often against great odds, form their own unions and bargain contracts.  For two decades, Kim has done the hardest and some of the most important work anyone can do. Because of her, thousands of people have gained the courage to stand up and speak for themselves and for what is right. Because of her, many, many thousands of people, in Vermont and across the country, live measurably better lives.  Kim Lawson led the effort to successfully organize workers at workplaces in Vermont, including U.Citizenship and Immigration Services, Counseling Services of Addison County, Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity, NHVAC, Berlin Health and Rehabilitation Center, Hunger Mountain Co-op, City Market Co-op, Northeast Kingdom Community Action, and the University of Vermont; and in New Hampshire, Grafton County New Hampshire Nursing Home and Public Employees, and the National Visa Center; and in New York, Adirondack Community Action At a time when the wages and living standards of most people were under attack, Kim helped people organize collectively for a better life.  Kim was also a founder of the Vermont Workers Center and for years staffed the Workers Rights Hotline which, free of charge, has helped many thousands of workers learn and protect their rights under the law. She has trained, mentored, and led countless young organizers and workers who, inspired by her quiet, steadfast and relentless example, carry on her pursuit of justice.  In whatever task she set for herself, Kim worked with her whole heart and a deep sense of solidarity for her fellow humanity.

My kids--I have one of them with me almost every week in We commute, and I bring somebody with me. Another two of them are almost surely going to be exploring along the Platte River later this afternoon, as happens almost every day. As for the comments about the 1986 campaign between Kay Orr and Helen Boosalis, it was the first time in America that two women had run for Governor of any I worked for Kay, the Republican Governor; it was the first campaign I had ever worked on as a 14-year-old. And then, most fundamentally, were her great words about the Homestead Act and the settling of I am a fifth generation Nebraskan and descended from homesteaders in the exact counties that the Senator was talking about engaged in Jefferson  Our State on its 150th anniversary, looks back on a history built by grit from homesteaders, as Senator Fischer mentioned, to a football team at Memorial Stadium in Today, we celebrate all of those things that make Nebraska special: hard work, resolve, and love and care for our neighbors.  Millions of men and women settled Nebraska when our State was still known as the Great American The Homestead Act made land ownership accessible to anyone--to widows, to former slaves, to immigrants. People of totally different backgrounds could legally own 160 acres of American land, and as long as they worked and lived on that land for 5 years, they would get the deed. Your care of the land is what mattered, not your background, not your status, not your family name, but your willingness to work and to contribute and to feed the world as our State still does today.  Today, Nebraska is the breadbasket of the world, exporting more than $6 billion a year of agricultural products. We have cared about the land for this last century and a half, but we care even more about our neighbors. Two towns tell that story well.  During World War II, North Platte launched a hospitality initiative that reached 6 million American troops as they would head for Pacific and European theaters in World War Folks in the town saw trains stop in North Platte every day and decided that they would cheer those servicemen who were on their way to the war to fight for our freedom.  On Christmas Day in 1941, a young woman named Rae Wilson, a 26-year-old saleswoman, founded the North Platte For 4 years, volunteers would meet each train--full of troops and passing through North Platte--with candy, with fruit, with smiles, with hugs, and with encouragement, thanking those men for how they were going to fight to defend the freedoms that made places like Nebraska and the rest of this Nation great. Some soldiers would go on to become POWs, including the first train of men that went through North Platte on Christmas Day in 1941. They had been sent off by these women of North Platte with food and with encouragement for their fight. Some never returned home. Who knows how much the kindness of those women meant to people from all of the States as they passed through Nebraska on the way to their deployments.  In recent years, that same generosity has shown up in Pilger, In June of 2014, twin tornadoes ripped through this small Nebraska town, killing two and leveling the entire town--destroying 78 buildings. Only in the two corners of the town were structures left standing. Some people might not consider a town of 352 people a top priority, but those folks are not from From all across our State, thousands of volunteers just began driving to this town where tornadoes had destroyed people's livelihoods and their homes, bringing meals and sorting through rubble with people who had been strangers until the volunteers arrived and became family.  Young and old, Nebraskans from all across our State pitched in 2\1/2\ summers ago. One retired teacher would drive 180 miles every day round trip to serve in this community, helping people dig out of the rubble. One little girl sent $70 in from her lemonade stand. Pilger became the town known as the town too tough to die.  When we are not coming together to help our neighbors, we are usually coming together to celebrate Husker football. Our team represents something much bigger than just a typical collegiate sports team. It is about toughness, and it is about community. The Bugeaters, as the Nebraska Cornhuskers were first known in the 1890s, started with a volunteer coach and now boast many Heisman Trophy winners, five national titles, and a sellout streak that dates to October of 1962.  For those of you who think there are football teams in your States--and I say this with all due respect to the Presiding Officer, who comes from a State that has passable football--and for those of you who think you are from States where football is taken seriously, there has not been a seat available to a game in Nebraska since October of 1962. Nebraska has had, by far, the biggest winning streak--the winningest team--over the course of the last half century in American college football.  Nebraskans know and love this team, not just because of the prowess on the field but because Nebraska football is the undisputed champion of Academic All-Americans in the country, having a 43-award lead over the second closest team in the history of Academic All-American Awards and American life.  That is Penn State, not North Carolina, that is in second place, I say to the Presiding  We live, we breathe, and we love our football team. After each Husker win, church attendance goes up, and crime goes down. Literally, for generations, half of the boys in Nebraska grew up wanting to play quarterback for Tom Osborne in the option offense. Why only half, you ask? It is because the other half wanted to play Blackshirts defensive football to smack the snot out of whoever was going to line up against the Huskers on a given  Success on the field is great, but the real reason Nebraskans are so proud of this team is that the Cornhuskers embody the hard work, resolve, teamwork, passion, and sportsmanship of the Nebraska people. While these are the trademarks and hallmarks of our football, they are really the hallmarks of our community associations--of Nebraska's pioneers, of our farmers, our ranchers, our teachers, our small business men and women, our churches, and our Rotary clubs.

1003,topic-id,1776,"Mr.President, I rise in support of S.26, a resolution to disapprove the Obama administration Department of Education's regulation on teacher preparation issues. This resolution is simple. It overturns the last administration's overreach into scores of States and territories, into thousands of college and university teacher preparation programs, and into millions of American classrooms.  Last night, I drafted a fairly detailed statement on some of the problems deep inside this regulation, but I have decided to skip past most of that. Why? Because the problem with this regulation is actually much more basic than all of the substantive problems in the regulation. This regulation actually makes the assumption that bureaucrats in Washington, DC, are competent to micromanage teacher training programs in That is what this regulation ultimately does, and that is absurd.[[Page S1626]]  So I would like to ask three questions of folks who plan to vote to defend this regulation. First, do you really think that bureaucrats in this city know better how to run teacher training programs than people who have spent most of their lives inside actual classrooms with actual future teachers and with students? How many of you have ever run a teacher training program? Has anyone in this body ever run a teacher training program? Because I have--almost. I have spent a lot of my life around these programs. As a kid, with my dad, who was a lifelong public schoolteacher and coach, and I have been in many of these classrooms with him when he was getting master's and continuing education programs; then with my wife who is also a public high school teacher; and then I was a college president at a university that had multiple teacher training programs. I know Keith Rohwer, and I know the other deans of education that have been at Midland University and at many other colleges and universities across Yet, even though I have been around a lot of these programs in some detail, I wouldn't possibly think I am ready to decree all the details inside those programs from thousands and thousands of miles away.  Question 2, has anyone actually read this regulation that folks are going to say they want to defend on this floor? Because I have been reading in it. I will not claim I have read it, but I have read in it. This is the 695 pages of the regulation itself. There is actually a lot of guidance material as well, but I didn't bring that because I didn't want to have both of my hands occupied. This is the 695 pages of the regulation we are talking about today, and it is actually really silly. If you read inside it, it is filled with enough specificity that if you tried to explain it to thoughtful, generally educated Americans, I submit to you that you would blush. There is a level of detail and a level of specificity in this that we are not possibly competent to defend at the micro level.  Question 3, can the folks who think this is what Washington, DC, ought to be doing right now--please show me somewhere in this document, the Senate version of the Constitution--show me somewhere in this document where we are given the specific authority to micromanage local programs like this from here. Because, honestly--I mean this sincerely to my colleagues who plan to vote to defend this rule--I don't see how you can defend this document and think that this is conceivably our job from here. We are not competent to do this.  Now, a couple of qualifications are in order. Am I suggesting that all teacher training programs in America work well? Heavens, no. There are some that are fairly strong, and there are actually a lot that are really, really poor and weak, but having a good intention to make them better is not the same as actually having accomplished something that will make them better. Good intentions are not enough. For us in this body to act because we have compulsory governmental powers, we would need not merely good intentions, we would also need competence and authority. We have neither of those about teacher training programs.  Everyone in this body agrees that education is darn near the center of the future of our country. We all want and we need good teachers. Most of us can remember specific teachers who stood out because of her or his creative presentation, because of their unexpected humor, because of their charm and their compassion, because of their tireless drive, because of their inspired mentorship. None of us in this Chamber who has the privilege of serving our fellow country men and women regret or are unaware of the fact that the skills and the guidance and the abilities that we have are the function of the mentorship and the pedagogy of life-changing teachers early in our lives. We have benefited from and we need good, prepared teachers.  If we all agree teachers are critically important to our future, and since we all agree teacher training programs are important and we also agree that some of them aren't very good, the question would be, What would we do about that? What kind of debate should we have about why much education in America isn't good enough? Does anyone in this body sincerely believe that the big, pressing problem in American education is that there aren't enough rules like this coming out of bureaucracies in Washington, DC?  Because if you believe that, I would humbly suggest that you should go and meet with some of the ed school faculties back in your State and ask them if you can read them these 695 pages so you can tell them that we have the answers. Read it to them, and then please come back and tell us in this body that they agree with you, that what we really need is more 700-page regulations from Washington, DC, micromanaging things as specific and local as teacher preparation programs.  Oh, and one more thing, which is actually kind of big. This regulation explicitly violates the plain language and the congressional intent of the Federal education law that was passed in this body last year. You will all recall that the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was passed in this Chamber with overwhelming bipartisan support last year. I think it got 83 votes. The act prohibits the Secretary of Education from prescribing ``any aspect or parameter of a teacher, a principal, or other school leader evaluation system within a State or local education agency'' or ``indicators or specific measures of teacher, principal, or other school leader effectiveness or quality.'' There is nothing ambiguous about this language.  In addition, the Higher Education Act is clear that the levels of performance used by a State to assess teacher training programs ``shall be determined solely by the State.''  This rule overrides State authority over literally tens of thousands of discipline-specific teacher preparation programs across the Nation, burdening States with a federally defined and expensive mandate. Under this regulation, States would be required to create elaborate new data systems that would link K-12 teacher data to data on evaluations of teachers and administrators in particular schools and then on to the data back into the teacher preparation programs. This regulation's goal would be to measure the success of teacher preparation based largely on teachers' students' subsequent test scores, and it would all need to be backlinked in the data. This is data that is not currently gathered.  Rube Goldberg is smiling somewhere because this sounds like a bureaucrat's dream, a paperwork trail monitoring all the strengths and weaknesses of some vast machine spitting out layers and layers of new data over which Washington's experts could then postulate and tinker. Again, I have no doubt the bureaucrats who wrote these 700 eye-glazing pages--pages about rules, about data to be gathered that States are not currently gathering--I have no doubt the people who wrote this mean well. I also have no doubt the people who are going to defend this rule as somehow commonsensical--then why is it 700 pages--also mean well, but those good intentions don't change the fact that what they have actually done in this rule--what they have actually done--is build a much larger requirement set of paper trails, demanding further burdens on our teachers, on our principals, and on the professors who are teaching teachers, and then require all of them to report back through new or expanded bureaucracies at the State level, though the States have not chosen to gather this data, and then pass this data on to a bureaucracy a couple of blocks from here.  These Rubik's Cubes of rules and data collection are not being done today, and supposedly we are going to make teacher preparation programs better by all of the specificity that comes from this rule.  The fact that these regulations will likely cost States millions of dollars to implement simply adds insult to injury. Let's be honest. Education is not some vast complex machine that just needs a little bit more tinkering from Washington-level intervention before it will be at utopia. It isn't true, and this rule is not an effective way to actually help the teachers who care so much that they are investing their lives in our kids.  Nebraska's parents and educators and locally elected school boards are better equipped and better positioned to tackle the most important educational challenges. They are better equipped and they are better intentioned, even than the smartest, the[[Page S1627]]nicest, and the most well-meaning experts in Washington, If you disagree, again, I humbly challenge you to go and try and read this rule to elementary and secondary school teachers in your State and to those who are running the programs that train them. Read the 695 pages to them and then report back to us that they actually share your view that the really big problem in American education is not enough 700-page rules from educational bureaucrats from  Good intentions are not enough. Federal intervention and reforms should never make problems worse, and that is what this rule would do.  I urge my colleagues to reject this rule and to rededicate ourselves to the duties that really and fundamentally are ours, to the duties the Federal Government is exclusively and monopolistically empowered to carry out because it isn't this.

829,topic-id,278,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Last Thursday, I was wandering the Capitol searching for the Republican's secret repeal bill. We went from room to room, and it wasn't there. But now that I have seen it, I understand why they would want to hide it.  Even if we can all agree that we need to make health care more affordable and more accessible, this bill is not the solution. In fact, this bill will only make things worse.  The Republican repeal bill gives tax breaks to the rich. We are talking about over $600 billion overall, while taking away health coverage from millions of The Republican repeal bill will drastically increase the cost of health insurance for millions of Americans, with the biggest increase for seniors and for working families.  It would radically change the Medicaid program, slashing funding, and covering fewer people.  The Republican repeal bill will force Governors and State legislators to ration care. My Republican Governor weighed in now and said that it would be trouble for Illinois if Medicaid is cut back.  Who do they want to cut out? Children, the elderly, people with disabilities. Thousands of hardworking individuals in Illinois will lose access to health coverage. As I said, in fact, Republican Governor Bruce Rauner said that our State ``won't do very well'' if the Republican repeal bill becomes law.  The Republican repeal bill breaks the promise made by President Trump to cover more Americans at lower cost.  I oppose this bill. I am going to fight tooth and nail to protect our care. And, frankly, I think this bill, as my mother would say, is deader than a door nail.  ",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgH1550.txt,1588,FALEOMAVAEGA ENI FA'AUA'A HUNKIN VA CLINIC,2017.0,7.0,March
719,topic-id,630,"Mr.President, yesterday the New York Times published a story about the nearly 100 Federal protections this administration has attacked. The article highlighted a few of the outcomes of these attacks. For example, telecommunication companies are no longer required to take reasonable measures to protect the Social Security numbers of their customers, and people with severe, disabling mental health issues are now able to buy guns--but do not worry because refugees from war-torn countries like Sudan won't be coming into our country anytime soon. Today, in about an hour, Republicans are going after yet another protection. This time, it is one that protects Americans who work for Federal contractors.  Up until a few years ago, companies that cut corners and saved money by treating their employees badly held a competitive advantage over law-abiding companies in competing for Federal contracts, so President Obama put a policy in place to take away that advantage. In 2015, he put a new protection in place so that the companies that had histories of unsafe working conditions would have to report those histories when they applied for Federal contracts. The idea here is pretty simple: If you want to work for the Federal Government, you need to follow the law, and if you do not, the government has a right to know so that the companies that cut corners do not have a competitive advantage by being able to bid more cheaply over those who play by the rules.  Republicans often claim to be in favor of leveling the playing field for businesses. After all, that was the rationale that was used last month when they voted so that coal companies were no longer responsible for cleaning up their own messes and oil companies could hide payments to foreign governments. Both of those actions were taken in the supposed spirit of caring about the ability of companies to compete. Business competition was placed above the rights of communities to clean air and clean water or the right of American consumers to know they are not supporting a dictator when they fill up at the fuel tank.  But now, when it comes to safe workplaces and pay discrimination, suddenly, having companies compete on a level playing field is not the priority. This just does not make sense to me. This policy was good for workers, good for taxpayers, and good for companies that play by the rules. We should all agree that companies that have good safety and wage records should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage, but the Republicans are giving Federal contractors a green light for pay discrimination and unsafe working conditions. That is the only signal we send by taking away this policy from the previous administration. This is yet another example of the empty words of an administration that claims to care about empowering women in the workplace.  Last week, the President signed two Executive orders that were designed to appear to promote women in the workplace, but when you look beyond the photo-op and the actual orders, they do not do a thing for women in the workplace. They do not put one Federal dollar toward advancing gender equality and gender equity. Now the Republicans are putting a bill on the floor and eventually on the President's desk that will make it easier for companies that discriminate against women in the workplace to get Federal dollars.  If this administration and if this Congress really care about making sure women do not face bias and discrimination, if they really care about businesses being able to compete on a level playing field, then why attack this protection?  I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and vote to keep the fair pay and safe workplaces protection in place.  I yield the floor.

985,topic-id,1342,"Mr.President, last night the Republicans in the House revealed their plan to scrap the ACA and replace it with something much worse--There are so many things that are wrong with this bill. A lot of us are still going through the 184 pages and all of its implications, so it is impossible to encapsulate all the difficulties in this legislation in one speech.  I am going to highlight eight problems with this bill to start. First of all, this bill is a complicated and rushed mess. Despite the fact that they had 7 years to work on their own plan, the Republicans cobbled together a bill that makes no sense. In an effort to make everyone in their caucus happy, they have made no one in their caucus happy. That is why we have seen conservative groups--from AEI to AFP, the Heritage Foundation, the Koch brothers--come out and express opposition to the legislation.  Second, this bill cuts They are going to use a phrase called block grants, but I want everyone to understand that is cutting That is a euphemism for cutting the resources for This cuts a program that helps more than 70 million Americans across the country get the healthcare they need. It means less care for pregnant moms, less care for families with loved ones in nursing homes. Nursing home benefits will be totally trashed, and all of these changes will reduce Medicaid to a level not seen before.  By the way, Medicare doesn't escape the ax. It is also in trouble if we enact the House legislation. TrumpCare will actually move up the date of insolvency of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years, to the year 2025. That is not 20, 30 years from now when they talk about the Social Security trust fund. That is quite soon to have Medicare be insolvent, and they are accelerating the date in which Medicare becomes insolvent.  Third, this bill hits the elderly with an age tax. Here is how the law currently works. It is basically a cap on the amount that an insurance company can charge a senior for healthcare. It says you cannot charge more than three times the amount you charge a young person for a senior citizen.  It is capped at three times what you charge for young people. This would increase the cap to five times the cost. If a young person's health insurance costs $250, the maximum under the current law is $750. Now you are talking five times $250--$1,250 per month.  This is an age tax. If there is any doubt about how difficult this is going to be for senior citizens, ask the They are a bipartisan, well-respected organization that works in every Seniors across the country need to understand what this age tax is. You will pay more for health insurance if the law passes as it is.  Fourth, and this is a very important point. This is basically not a healthcare bill because if it were a healthcare bill, everybody knows it would require 60 votes. It would be enacting new legislation. This is a budget bill. All they can do, really, is cut taxes related to healthcare. This is a bill that cuts taxes for rich people.  How does it finance it? First of all, it finances--probably a lot of it by borrowing. The other portion of it is by cuts to Medicare and TrumpCare has special tax cuts that only benefit the highest earning households and another one that will go to insurance company executives who make more than half a million dollars a year.  You cannot make this stuff up. They are cutting taxes for insurance company executives who make more than half a million dollars each year, and they are financing it by cutting healthcare for the people we all represent.  Fifth, this bill will blow up the debt and the deficit. The crazy thing is, we don't actually know how much our debt and deficit will increase because Republicans are in such a hurry to rush this through without a formal CBO analysis. We have no idea how much this is going to cost--probably trillions, but they haven't even asked for a CBO score. They don't want to know how much this is going to blow up the debt and the deficit because all of the fiscal hawks will be found to be hypocrites who have been railing about deficits for all of their career. Yet this might be the biggest budget-busting piece of legislation in many, many years, and they don't want to know how much it costs because they have made a promise. They are going to go ahead and fulfill that promise no matter how ridiculous it is.  Sixth, this bill will trash mental health coverage. The ACA was a huge step forward for the mental health community because it required insurance companies to cover mental health and substance abuse disorders. We are in a moment when every State is struggling with an addiction crisis. What I don't know is why we would rip away these services when so many people are counting on it to break their addictions.  Seventh, this bill will defund Planned Parenthood because they can't help themselves in the U.House of Planned Parenthood is a provider that offers healthcare to millions of women across the country, but this bill will stop low-income women from getting critical health services like breast cancer screenings from local clinics. Oftentimes, this would happen in communities where women have nowhere else to turn. Many community health centers don't have the services women need or they have twice the wait times that a Planned Parenthood would have. For women waiting to find out if they have cancer, that is simply not an option.  Finally, this bill is too partisan. I think we can all agree that our approach to healthcare could use some improvements, and I am more than ready to work with my Republican colleagues to make healthcare better. That is not just a rhetorical flourish. I have tried to back that up with my legislative actions. I have worked with Senator Hatch on legislation to increase access to high-quality care in hard-to-reach regions. I have worked with Senator Cassidy and many others on a bill to create a public health emergency fund. I have worked with Senators Wicker, Cochran, and Thune on a telehealth bill.  We can work together on healthcare, but it requires three things: 1, good faith, and there is no good faith in this piece of legislation. 2, bipartisanship. This bill, I am quite sure, will get zero Democratic votes in the House or the 3, we need legislative hearings. We need to have a conversation in the light of day and let the American people weigh in. We need to figure out what it is that they are doing to the American healthcare system.  If they are so proud of their plan, why no hearings? If they are so proud of their plan, why not get at least a score from the Congressional Budget Office? If they are so proud of their plan, why do they lack the confidence that any Democrat will support it?  Look, we do have the opportunity to work together to improve healthcare, but this bill is basically a mess. It is worse than I thought. I think it is worse than a lot of people thought, especially given that they have been talking about this for 7 years. So one might think they would have had a really well-thought-through plan. This has all of the characteristics of something that was rushed out the door in about a 48-hour period.  I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this very bad piece of legislation and give us some space and time to do this right and to do this in a bipartisan fashion.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Hoeven). The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

13,topic-id,962,"Mr.Speaker, 100 years ago next month, on April 2, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson stood in this Chamber and asked Congress to declare war on While the proximate cause for America's entry into World War I was Germany's campaign of unrestricted submarine warfare, Wilson and his supporters were also motivated by the belief that they, and the force of American arms, could deliver Europe from its intractable squabbles and, in so doing, make the world safe for democracy.  It was not until the following spring that the American doughboys were committed to the Western Front in large numbers, but they provided not only the additional combat power needed to break the exhausted Germans within months, but also imbued a sense of moral purpose into what had been nearly 4 years of futile slaughter.  A generation later, millions of American GIs returned to help free Europe from Adolf Hitler, while millions more pushed Japan back from its imperial conquests in This time we stayed--the living to keep the peace and prevent one form of tyranny being replaced by another and the dead as silent witnesses to the cost of liberation.  The United States worked to create the United Nations and a host of other international organizations designed to bind together humanity and avoid another catastrophic world war. We extended aid and friendship to our former enemies through the Marshall Plan and rebuilt Western Europe into an alliance of democracies, a shining contrast to the Soviet Union's eastern satellites.  America's commitment to peace was matched by an equally resolute willingness to defend freedom. When the Soviet Union blockaded Berlin in 1948, in an attempt to force the Western allies out of their half of the city, American pilots flew missions around the clock for 11 months to keep the city supplied until the Soviets relented.  Walls, barbed wire, and stifling oppression characterized the Soviet bloc and Communist Against this, the United States marshaled its greatest weapons--individual liberty, democratic governance, and a market economy to discredit and defeat communism.  When the Cold War ended four decades after it had begun, it was the fall of the Berlin Wall that symbolized the triumph of freedom and seemingly heralded a new era of peace and prosperity.  Nearly three decades have passed since communism's collapse and the global harmony that many hoped for has been replaced by an international order more challenging to American leadership and American ideals than any we have seen in my lifetime.                              {time}  1030  Intolerance, ultra-nationalism, and crude populism are rising across the developed world and threaten to undo the work of decades. After a century of American leadership of the international community, there was a sense among many here at home and around the world that we have lost our will to lead, that we will no longer honor President Kennedy's commitment to ``pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.''  The world sees President Trump's executive orders on immigration and asks: Where is the America that welcomed millions to its shores?  Well, I am happy to say that America is alive and well in communities across this great Nation, where people from every continent live together, eat each other's food, celebrate each other's holidays, and it also lives on in the hundreds of State Department officials who signed a Dissent Channel memorandum opposing that policy.  The world sees President Trump's threats to withdraw from Europe and Asia unless our allies ``pay up,'' and asks whether America will still defend its friends. That America, the one that stands shoulder-to-shoulder with NATO and South Korea, can be found in our troops stationed in the Baltics, Poland, and along the DMZ; and it can be found here in Congress, where there is broad support for our alliances and our allies.  The world sees President Trump threatening to drastically cut our foreign assistance budget, the literal difference between life and death for millions of the world's most vulnerable people, and asks: Where is America's legendary generosity?  That America, Mr.Speaker, is alive and well, too. Our USAID professionals, our Peace Corps volunteers, and the thousands of individual Americans working as medical missionaries or with NGOs are still making a difference around the globe every day.  The world sees President Trump's embrace of Vladimir Putin and his seeming disdain for key allies like Germany and Australia and wonders whether we will remain committed to democracy and the rule of law, or we will abandon principle in favor of expedience and flattery.  That America--the America that stood with Solidarity in Poland, with Nelson Mandela in South Africa, and with Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma--is still here, too. Millions of Americans, Democrats and Republicans, the old and young, still stand with those who seek freedom, and we will never allow this President to abandon our ideals.  And finally, Mr.Speaker, the world has seen the rise of Donald Trump and wonders whether Americans will still fight for their own democracy--are we still worthy heirs to Washington, Lincoln, and Roosevelt? The answer to that is on display every day across this country. From the millions who clogged our nation's streets on January 21st, to the calls pouring into Congress every day to demand a full investigation of the Russia scandal, the American people are engaged and ready to fight for our democracy here at home and for freedom around the world.  To those who doubt us, or wonder whether we remain true to our ideals, whether we will stand up for what we believe, and defend not only America but the beautiful idea it represents, let me borrow a phrase from John Paul Jones, the Revolutionary War hero. ``We have not yet begun to fight.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1398.txt,1635,SEARCHING FOR AND CUTTING REGULATIONS THAT ARE UNNECESSARILY BURDENSOME,2017.0,1.0,March

276,topic-id,1268,"Mr.President, before I get into the substance of my remarks, I was listening to our Republican leader talking about compromise--not that he ever engaged in very much of it when he was leader last year--but compromise requires something to compromise over. We have nothing from the administration, nothing on infrastructure, nothing on trade, nothing even on  You want to sit down and talk? Let's see what your plans are. See if you can get your own act together before you are pointing the finger at  The President's speech--let me say this: This President's speech was detached from this President's reality. The President, in this speech and in so many others, talks like a populist. He talks to the working people of America and promises them things. When he governs, it is nothing like that at all. He is favoring the very powerful special interests, making their lives easier, and putting more burdens on the backs of the middle class and people trying to get to the middle class.  A metaphor for this was his speech at the inauguration. He gave a speech--also aimed at the working people--and within an hour after that, he signed an Executive order that helped the banks and added about $500 to the mortgage of every new homeowner.  You can't just talk the talk, Mr.You have to walk the walk. On issue after issue, we haven't seen anything--or negative things for the working class.  We heard about infrastructure. A month ago, the Democrats put together an infrastructure plan of $1 trillion. It was a strong plan. It has a lot of support throughout the country.  Where is the President's infrastructure plan? We haven't heard a peep about it. Some of his White House folks leaked that we will not get to infrastructure until next year. Mentioning it in a speech--infrastructure--is not going to employ a single new worker.  What about trade? The President talked about trade, putting America first. My views tend to be closer to President Trump's than they were to President Bush's or President Obama's on trade. Again, what we hear in the speech and what the President actually does are contradictory.  Throughout his campaign, the President took an issue near and dear to my heart and to the heart of Senator Graham of South Carolina--China manipulating its currency. He had said over and over again in the campaign: On the first day I am President, I will sign an Executive order that labels China a currency manipulator.  They are. We know they manipulate their currency, and it has cost America hundreds of thousands, if not millions of good-paying jobs and caused a load of wealth to flow from our country to theirs.  This one didn't require congressional approval. This one didn't require a single Democrat to join in. All the President had to do was sign the order. We are now 40 days into this administration. Not only has he still not signed the order, but he is saying he may back off.  Last night, the President talked about research, wiping out rare diseases. Yet with the budget they proposed, given that they want to slash domestic discretionary spending by tens of billions of dollars and exempt veterans and Homeland Security, there is no alternative to the fact that the President in his budget, at the same time he is talking about medical research, is going to slash it.  He talked about the great issue of education. The same thing: His budget is going to slash education to smithereens, hurting our students, hurting our teachers, hurting our schools.  Perhaps the most hypocritical of all was draining the swamp. That was one of the President's main themes when he was President-elect: Drain the swamp. Look who is in his His Secretary of Treasury, his Secretary of Commerce, and his NEC adviser are from Wall  Is this the same man who said that we are going to go after Wall Street if we get elected? Wall Street is running the economic show. The Cabinet is filled with bankers. The Cabinet is filled with billionaires, not people who feel for the average In fact, if you add up the net wealth of his Cabinet, it has more wealth than one-third of the American people total--close to 100 million people. That is cleaning the swamp? Give me a break.  The problem with the President's speech is very simple: His actions don't match his words. His words in the campaign are not matched by his actions. His words in his inaugural speech are not matched by his actions, nor are his words in his speech last night.  It was so funny that he spoke to a bunch of cosmopolitan news anchors, and he mentioned that maybe he will change his views on immigration. The media got into a buzz about that. Then, the speech he gave was one of the most virulently anti-immigrant speeches that we have heard any President ever give. He is saying one thing, doing another.  It is not the hypocrisy that bugs us, although it is there. It is the fact that he is not helping middle-class It is the fact that he is not making it easier for more people to travel and get into the middle class because he seems to have governed from the hard, hard right. The hard right is very far away from where the average American is.  Mr.Mulvaney's idea of a budget--maybe 10 percent of America, mostly ideologues, would support it. It is even far away from where the average Republican is. Yesterday, when the President proposed his budget, we had one of my colleagues on the Republican side saying it is dead on arrival. We had the majority leader saying that you can't cut the State Department foreign aid in half. He is far over, and that is hurting him and hurting us, hurting the American people.  The first 40 days have been a pretty rough 40 days for President It hasn't worked out very well. Why? It is not because he hasn't given a few good speeches. It is because he is governing from the hard right. He is governing far away from what the American people want. He is governing way off to the extreme.  A speech isn't going to change that. A speech isn't going to create one job or one infrastructure plan or one trade law that makes our trade laws, which need to be changed, fairer. No, no, it takes action. Unfortunately, when the President takes action, it is quite the opposite of what he says in the speech on the issues that affect the middle-class and working-class people.  If President Trump does not change how he governs--how he governs, not what speeches he gives--in the near future, then these 40 days, which have been of tumult, of contradiction, of turning one's back on the working class, will be 6 months and then will be a year and then will be 2 years.  The problem with the Presidency does not lie in the speeches the President gives, even though I might object[[Page S1511]]to a lot of the things he puts in them. It lies in how he governs, and he is not governing well. He is not governing down the middle. He is not governing in a way that lends itself to compromise. We Democrats will continue to hold the President accountable. That is our job. That is what the Constitution says we should do, and we will continue until we see the President change his course in governing. No speech is going to change that or affect that.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgS1510-2.txt,1036,SEARCHING FOR AND CUTTING REGULATIONS THAT ARE UNNECESSARILY BURDENSOME,2017.0,1.0,March
287,topic-id,587,"Mr.President, one other issue is our nominee today, Mr.I want to spend a minute on him. He is the nominee for Secretary of One of the most important issues handled by the Interior Department is the stewardship of our national parks. These are some of the great national resources of our country.  When my children were younger, my wife and I would take them to national parks, and we would go hiking. We loved it. We so looked forward to going out I remember the reward at the end of a big hike was a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I probably wanted it even more than my kids did. I loved peanut butter and jelly.  From Niagara Falls to the Erie Canalway, to places like Seneca Falls, Stonewall, and Ellis Island, my dear State of New York is home to some of our country's most famous national parks and monuments. They are places I have visited and treasured my whole life. I have been concerned in recent years about the reluctance on the other side of the aisle to properly care for these great national beauties, these great national resources. Currently, there is a $12 billion maintenance backlog for our national parks. Our Republican majority has not seen fit to address them.  Now, adding insult to injury, the new administration's hiring freeze across Federal agencies has already affected parks like the Women's Rights National Historic Park in Seneca Falls, which I have visited many times. It has had to cancel tours due to insufficient funding.  Most troubling, our Republican colleagues want to make it easier to sell off or give away public lands and expand the footprint of the oil and gas industries on public lands--as usual, helping those narrow special interests, hurting the average That seems to be the trademark of this administration, which our friends on the other side of the aisle are happily going along with.  That is the context in which I approach Congressman Zinke's nomination. He claims to be a conservationist in the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt, a great New He has demonstrated support for rules, however, that would make it easier to sell off public lands. It is the opposite of what Teddy Roosevelt wanted.  Congressman Zinke claims to be a conservationist, but he said he would revisit actions taken by the last administration to use the Antiquities Act to permanently protect endangered places of cultural, tribal significance. He claims to be a Roosevelt conservationist but pledged his support for the Trump administration's energy agenda--once again, centered on efforts to expand drilling and mining on Federal lands and waters. A few big oil companies would be made happy, but America would lose a great resource that is an economic resource as well as a beautiful natural resource.  I would say to Mr.Zinke: You can't be a Roosevelt conservationist when you vote to make it easier to sell off public lands. You can't be a Roosevelt conservationist when you support opening up public lands to increased extraction and drilling. You are not much of a conservationist when you downplay the authority of the legislation that allows the President to create national monuments.  In sum, Congressman Zinke says he is a dyed-in-the-wool conservationist but doesn't have the record to back it up. That should concern every outdoor enthusiast, every lover of our great and grand national parks.  Unfortunately, because of his record, I will vote no on Mr.Zinke's nomination.

702,topic-id,792,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon on a few matters: first, Russia and the continuing investigation into Russian interference in our election and the ties between the Trump campaign, transition team, and  The events of this weekend, which included another troubling, baseless tweet from the President, highlight and, in fact, strengthen the argument for a special prosecutor to conduct the investigation. And the American people agree. A CNN/ORC poll this morning showed that about two-thirds of Americans think a special prosecutor should conduct the investigation--67 percent of the Independents and even 43 percent of the The trend line suggests these numbers will continue to grow.  So my Republican colleagues should understand that what they know in their hearts is the right thing to do. Do a strong, impartial investigation and get to the bottom of this. That is where the American people want them to go. The American people disagree with President Trump and want a thorough and impartial investigation--even 43 percent of They are right.  A special prosecutor is the best way to ensure that an investigation proceeds impartially for several reasons.  First, by Department of Justice guidelines that are set up for this purpose, a special counsel is not subject to day-to-day supervision by the Attorney General--now recused--or anyone else at the Justice That means the special prosecutor would have much greater latitude in whom he can subpoena, which questions he can ask, and how to conduct the investigation. Second, the prosecutor can only be removed for good cause, such as misconduct, not to quash the investigation. So there is an insularity there. He or she is protected if they are moving forward on the investigation. Third, there is built in congressional oversight. Congress is notified whenever a special counsel is appointed, removed, or finished with the investigation. Last, the special counsel has the independence to prosecute not only the subject of an investigation but anyone who attempts to interfere.  This is the right way to go. Let me quote Attorney General Jeff Sessions on this issue. Here is what he once said: ``The appropriate response when the subject matter is public and it arises in a highly-charged political atmosphere is for the Attorney General to appoint a Special Counsel of great public stature and indisputable independence to assure the public the matter will be handled without partisanship.''  If there were ever a case that fit exactly what then-Senator, now-Attorney General Sessions called for, this is it.  This week, the Senate Judiciary Committee is going to have a hearing on the nomination of Mr.Rosenstein to serve as the Deputy Attorney During that hearing, Mr.Rosenstein should commit to naming a special prosecutor to look into the Trump campaign's ties to Mr.Rosenstein, by reputation, is a fair man. He is a career prosecutor. Now that the Attorney General has recused himself, Mr.Rosenstein, pending confirmation, will have the duty to appoint a special prosecutor. If he will not appoint a special prosecutor, he will need a darn good reason. It is hard for me to see one right now.  Whether Mr.Rosenstein will appoint a special prosecutor will be front and center tomorrow at the Judiciary Committee's hearing and far and away the most important question he needs to answer. As I mentioned last week, if, pending confirmation, Mr.Rosensetin delays or refuses to appoint a special prosecutor, Congress should consider reviving a narrower version of the independent counsel law.  Also, we should make sure, certain, that the investigation has not been interfered with thus far. I sent a letter today to the inspector general of the Department of Justice, Michael Horowitz, which was made public today, urging him to open an immediate investigation to determine if anyone has interfered with this investigation up to now, either attempting to influence the direction of the investigation or those conducting it.  The Attorney General should have recused himself on day one. I asked him to do it almost 3 weeks ago, on February 14. We need to know if he or anyone else has meddled in this investigation in any way. His misleading statements to the Judiciary Committee about his meetings with the Russian Ambassador only add suspicion.  Attorney General Sessions has been in charge of this investigation for 3 weeks. We need to know if he or anyone else did anything in that time to[[Page S1591]]hinder the investigation because it is absolutely critical that we protect the integrity of this investigation. That means ensuring that it is completely independent going forward and that nothing has already occurred that could compromise it. The good news is, the inspector general can take this investigation on his own and go forward with what we asked for in the letter on his own. I would urge him to do so.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-06-pt1-PgS1590-3.txt,1036,0915,2017.0,6.0,March

706,topic-id,520,"Mr.President, finally, on the Affordable Care My Republican friends have repeated the mantra for 7 years, ``Repeal and replace, repeal and replace.'' It turns out, during those 7 years, they never came up with a coherent plan to replace the Affordable Care It was all slogans, no policy.  Now they are scrambling to come up with something. The problem is, every draft, every leaked detail or outline or list of principles we have seen is tied together by one common thread: It will raise costs on average Americans and cut back on their benefits. Average Americans, under the Republican plan, will pay more and get less.  No wonder they are hiding the plan somewhere in a basement room, even as they are scheduling markups on the bill for a week from now. They don't want the folks to see it until the very last minute; just rush it through. I don't blame them. It is going to be very hard for Republicans to be proud of this plan, which hurts average Americans, raising their costs and taking away benefits.  It is the absolute height of hypocrisy to be hiding this plan. My Republican colleagues complained bitterly, day after day, week after week, month after month, about not having enough time to read the Affordable Care Act when it was being debated. At the time, my friend, the distinguished majority leader, said:       Americans want us to slow down, and Congress is putting its      foot on the accelerator. Americans want to know what this      bill would mean for them, and Congress won't let them read it      before a vote . . . [on a] piece of legislation that will      affect one of the most significant aspects of their lives.      Americans [he continued] have concerns about what they're      hearing, and they are being told to shut up, sit down, and      take the health care we give you.  By keeping their replacement bill under lock and key, only a week before potentially voting on it, the Republicans are engaging in enormous hypocrisy--exactly what the majority leader complained about only a few years ago. Their mantra in past years was always ``read the bill.'' Now they will not even let us glance at it. Why are they hiding it? I think I know why. They are not very proud of it. They know it is not going to work.  They are being pushed blindly forward by their ideologues and their incessant campaign promises. The American people ought to know how Republicans plan to drastically reshape this Nation's health care policy. I suspect Americans will not like it much. I suspect it will raise costs and cut benefits. I suspect far fewer Americans will get coverage. I suspect their plan will put the insurance companies back in charge.  Whatever it does or doesn't do, the American people and their representatives in Congress, after 7 long years of slogans, ought to know the true face of ``replace.''  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

731,topic-id,601,"Mr.President, first, I thank my colleague from Washington State who has been such a leader on issues like this, throughout this session of Congress and throughout her entire career.  I want to add a few comments on H.37, which I strongly oppose. More[[Page S1601]]than one in five Americans is employed by a company that has at least one Federal contract. Unfortunately, every year tens of thousands of workers are denied overtime wages, not paid fairly because of their gender or age, or have health and safety put at risk by corner-cutting contractors. Those contractors who obey the rules are put at a disadvantage by those who cut corners, and that is what this proposal that President Obama put into effect was supposed to curb. That was the rule.  What do we find President Trump and our Republican colleagues doing? Once again, favoring the special interests, Big Business, over the working people. As my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Warren, just said: ``This is a debate about whom Congress actually works for.'' The President tries to present himself as a populist favoring working people. That is in his speeches, but in all of his actions, just about every single one, when there is a special interest, a business interest at stake versus a worker interest, he sides with the special Big Business interests.  The President promised to be a champion for working people in his inaugural address. An hour later, he signed an Executive order making it harder for working people to get a mortgage. Last week, the President made a whole host of claims about what his government would do only 24 hours after releasing a budget blueprint that would take a meat ax to the Federal agencies he was talking about. He had this beautifully sympathetic moment about medical research, and his budget is going to slash it. He talked about education as a major issue in His budget will slash that.  Again, less than a week after another populist speech to Congress, the President is doing exactly the opposite of what he said he was going to do--stick up for working men and women--by signing this resolution. President Trump promised: I will deliver better wages for the working class. Well, President Trump, more than 300,000 workers have been victims of wage-related labor violations while working under Federal contracts during the last decade. Are you now going to sign a bill, President Trump, that would make it easier for recidivist Federal contractors to skirt wage standards and hurt their workers? It sounds like it to me. This administration's hypocrisy knows no end. It is not populist. It is not for the working people, not in what they do.  In his joint address to Congress, the President said, he would ``ensure new parents have paid family leave.'' Now is he going to sign a bill that makes it easier for companies that violate family leave laws to win contracts from the Federal Government? If the President was true to his populist rhetoric, he would say this resolution is dead on arrival because it hurts the working people. But if past is prologue, he will not. He will think that his tough talk about standing up for the working class is enough to cloak a hard-right, pro-corporate, pro-elite agenda.  So I challenge the President: If Republicans pass this resolution, show some courage and veto it because you are not going to get away with constantly, constantly saying that you are in favor of working people and signing legislation that hurts them.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Lankford). All time is expired.  ",CREC-2017-03-06-pt1-PgS1591-5.txt,1036,0915,2017.0,6.0,March
735,topic-id,296,"Mr.President, the second issue I would like to discuss is the travel ban, the recently issued Executive order on immigrants and refugees. Now that we have the details, it is clear that while the administration has made some very minor changes, it has done nothing to alter the core thrust of the order, which I believe is terribly misguided and does nothing to address the core concerns of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled the original order was potentially unconstitutional.  Moreover, we know that the administration delayed its announcement and implementation so President Trump could bask in the aftermath of his joint address. That should be all the proof Americans need to know that this Executive order has everything to do with optics and nothing to do with national security. If national security were at stake, it should not have been delayed a single day.  The truth is, there is very little new or improved about this Executive order. It is barely a fresh coat of paint on the same car that doesn't drive. It is still a travel ban. It is still a refugee ban. It still makes us less safe, not safer, according to not just me but to Republicans like Senator It still attempts to turn innocent immigrants and refugees into scapegoats and still does not do the things that would actually make us safer, like going after lone wolves and closing the loopholes in the Visa Waiver  The new Executive order is still mean-spirited, misguided, and, in my judgment, goes against what America is all about, being a country that accepts and cherishes immigrants, not disdains them. I fully expect the President's new Executive order will have the same uphill climb in the courts that the previous version had.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-06-pt1-PgS1591.txt,1036,0915,2017.0,6.0,March

958,topic-id,320,"Mr.President, this morning the Judiciary Committee will have a hearing on the nomination of Mr.Rod Rosenstein to serve as the Deputy Attorney During the hearing, Mr.Rosenstein should commit to naming a special prosecutor to look into the Trump campaign's ties to  There is a strong legal rationale for a special prosecutor. A special prosecutor, by the Department of Justice rules, would be free of day-to-day supervision by anyone at the Department of Justice, would be free to follow the investigation where it leads, and would be subject to an increased level of congressional oversight. Moreover, it is the right thing to do to ensure that this investigation remains impartial, nonpartisan, and truly gets to the bottom of the matter. The bottom line is very simple. The special prosecutor can only be fired for cause, but a line person in the Justice Department could be fired at will. We saw that happen when President Trump didn't like what Sally Yates said about his Executive order. He simply fired her.  Mr.Rosenstein is a very fine man, an excellent, longtime prosecutor in the Justice Department, but this is when we call for a special prosecutor. It is not an aspersion against him in any way. We are worried the White House will not let an investigation within the Justice Department, without the insulation of a special prosecutor, go forward.  So if Mr.Rosenstein is unwilling to commit to naming a special prosecutor or says he needs to be confirmed, and in his position he can make an assessment, that is insufficient. The need for a special prosecutor is clear enough today to make that call.  Of course, we don't need to wait for Mr.Mr.Boente, the Acting Deputy Attorney General, can make the call today, but if neither will commit to a special prosecutor, Congress will have to consider bringing back a narrower independent counsel law to see that this investigation is conducted properly.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgS1608-5.txt,1036,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,7.0,March
960,topic-id,1090,"Mr.President, on another matter, last night we saw the House Republicans plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care After 70 years of talking about the same thing over and over again, you would think the Republicans would have been able to come up with a better plan than this. This plan is a mess.  First, it will cost average Americans more money for their healthcare, while providing fewer benefits; second, it will cut taxes for the very wealthy, making average Americans pay more for their healthcare; third, it will raise premiums and costs for older Americans; and, fourth, it will remove the guarantee that ensures Americans with preexisting conditions can get coverage.  TrumpCare will make health insurance in America measurably worse in just about every way and leave more Americans uninsured. It does, however, greatly benefit the very wealthy and special interests. Let's quickly look at each of the items I just mentioned.  First, TrumpCare will cost more and you will get less. By eliminating minimum coverage for healthcare plans and decreasing the availability of tax credits, the cost for average Americans will increase by at least $1,000 annually. That is a huge increase, like a tax increase for average Americans who need healthcare. It cuts and caps Medicaid, which has expanded health insurance to over 20 million Americans, and affects poor people, as well as many elderly who are in nursing homes, as well as their children who might have to pay for their care with the kinds of cuts we are seeing.  The bill would greatly decrease coverage for maternity care, preventive screenings, mental health, opioid treatment, and more. With respect to women, TrumpCare would send us back to the Dark Gone are the protections for maternity care, mammograms, and more. Gone is all the funding next year for Planned Parenthood, where 2.5 million women a year get healthcare. The ACA finally made it[[Page S1609]]the case that you no longer had to pay more for coverage just because you are a woman. TrumpCare rips that away, undoes the progress we made just a few years ago.  Second, TrumpCare would be a boon to the wealthy, while making working Americans pay more. The bill is a winning lottery ticket for wealthy It removes an investment tax and a surcharge on the wealthiest Americans, folks with incomes of above $250,000 a year, saving them an average of $200,000 a year, and it allows a tax break for insurance executives making over $500,000 a year.  Third, TrumpCare will raise premiums and costs for older It would repeal the Affordable Care Act's premium subsidies and replace them with refundable tax credits that could be worth thousands of dollars less than what was provided under the Under this plan, a senior without Medicare might receive only $4,000 a year in tax credits, an inadequate sum for someone of that age. One illness or a bad break, and the value of their tax credit would evaporate. It also allows insurers to charge older Americans more simply because of their age.  Finally, TrumpCare would remove the guarantee of coverage for Americans with preexisting conditions. TrumpCare is breathtakingly irresponsible. It shifts the costs and the burdens from the rich to the poor and middle class, from the government to the people, and raises premiums on older It seems designed to cover fewer Americans and make that coverage less affordable and less generous. It seems designed to make America sick again.  We don't even know how large a negative impact this bill will have because Republicans are irresponsibly rushing forward before this bill even receives a score from the Congressional Budget  After years of howling at the Moon, at Democrats for rushing through the Affordable Care Act, the mantra they said over and over again on the floor here and in the House was ``read the bill.'' Republicans are having committee votes 2 days after the bill is released.  No wonder they don't want anyone to know what is in the bill. They are rushing it through because it is very hard to defend what they have done, and the longer it is out there, the harder it is going to be for their colleagues, Republicans, to vote for it. Lawmakers will be voting blind, without a final analysis of how this bill will affect overall coverage and affordability. I know this affects a lot of my colleagues on the other side.  We have no knowledge of how this affects the deficit. It is removing a lot of the revenues for healthcare without replacing them. In all likelihood--we will see what CBO says--the deficit is going to go way up.  The President is already throwing his arms around this plan, and ultimately he and his party will bear the responsibility for its passage and implementation. At this time, I would like to remind President Trump that he said repeatedly in the campaign that he would expand treatment for Americans suffering from opioid addiction, but this mess of a replacement bill would rip treatment away from hundreds of thousands of Americans dealing with opioid addiction. President Trump said he would ensure Americans with preexisting conditions would continue to have access to coverage, but this bill makes that harder in several ways. President Trump, in his campaign, said:       Everybody's got to be covered. . . . I am going to take      care of everybody. I don't care if it's going to cost me      votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of, much      better than they're being taken care of now. . . . They can      have their doctors. They can have their plans, they can have      everything.  ``They can have everything.''  Well, if you read the bill the way it reduces funding for Medicaid and replaces the Affordable Care Act subsidies with much smaller tax credits, there is just no way this bill meets the President's standard.  Was the Affordable Care Act perfect? It could use some improvements, but Democrats spent a long time thinking about it and crafting the policy to achieve two very real and specific goals, expand coverage, lower costs.  TrumpCare will do the very opposite. If it has any one coherent positive goal, it is to limit the tax burdens on the very wealthy, and in the process it will badly hurt millions of Americans and throw our healthcare system back into chaos.  If the final product out of the House looks anything like this draft, the Senate should consider it a moral duty to reject it.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgS1608-6.txt,1036,SEARCHING FOR AND CUTTING REGULATIONS THAT ARE UNNECESSARILY BURDENSOME,2017.0,7.0,March

It enables us to proceed with the work that the American people have sent us here to accomplish. It is of great measure of the work that we are doing today. We had an extensive and long committee hearing at the Committee on Rules yesterday with witnesses from both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats, who felt strongly about the issues and ideas that were before them and the ideas which will be presented on the floor of the House of Representatives today, the underpinning of which are entitled to give the American people a better shot at a better life not only from a business perspective, economic development, but also the creation of jobs in the United States of  Madam Speaker, I also rise in support of the underlying legislation contained in this rule. These bipartisan initiatives will enhance transparency, provide for a check on Federal agencies, and I believe help create a better process in the Federal Government for the people we serve, which are the people of this great  Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act in 1946 to ensure that the public had an opportunity to provide expertise, opinions, and other comments during the rulemaking process that takes place in the administration. It was designed to provide guarantees of due process in administrative procedures for self-governing American citizens who have to live under these rules that are promulgated by those unelected and not necessarily known by the American people.  The Administrative Procedure Act, known as the APA, as it is commonly referred to, was designed to require agencies to keep the public informed of the information and ideas, procedures, and rules, and to provide a means for public participation in the rulemaking process that would take place here in Washington, D. Unfortunately, as is too often the case, Federal bureaucrats over years and previous administrations have exploited the broad language of the Administrative Procedure Act to focus the rulemaking process solely for special interest reasons. Sometimes it is groups, sometimes it is ideas, and sometimes it is against the voices of the average American who wishes to participate in this process. This clearly was not the APA's legislative intent and reflects yet another encroachment on Congress' Article I powers which are enshrined in the United States  This shift away from the intent of the Administrative Procedure Act, known as the APA, has meant that most agency deliberations are carried out without a record or even a public review of those decisions that are made. Additionally, and possibly more troubling, agencies have undermined the purpose and the spirit of the notice-and-comment process by actively campaigning in support of their ideas using government resources and processes to that advantage.  The clearest example of this abuse can be found recently and numerously at the Environmental Protection Agency, known as the After issuing the waters of the United States notice of proposed rulemaking, the EPA undertook a public campaign utilizing social media platforms to solicit support for what was, at the time, a promulgated rule. Following this abuse, the GAO issued a report finding that the EPA violated propaganda and anti-lobbying provisions concerning the use of their fiscal year 2014 and 2015 appropriations.  The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017 helps ensure transparency in the rulemaking process by prohibiting Federal agencies from anonymously issuing statements for propaganda purposes, in other words, an agency lobbying for itself, its ideas, as opposed to the public comment period, final rulemaking, and then issues and ideas being discussed with and by the people of the country. Specifically, H.1004 requires agencies to make available online information about public communications on pending regulatory actions.  Further, H.1004 requires that agencies ``expressly disclose that the Executive agency is the source of the information to the intended recipients.''  Why is this important?  This is important because too many times information is provided without the basis of the facts behind it. It is opinion, Mr.When members of the public see information that is provided, a source should be behind that information.  Further, H.1004 prohibits agencies from ``soliciting support for or promoting . . . pending agency regulatory action.'' A simple concept of transparency and, I believe, professionalism that both sides of the aisle should not only demand, but also welcome from any executive agency, regardless of who is in the White It is in the best interest of the American public, and transparency and honesty related to that should be above reproach. Unfortunately, this has also not been the instance, as there are abuses and overreach by Federal agencies and unelected bureaucrats.  Presidents of both parties have required a centralized review of regulations since the 1970s. This has largely been handled by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, or OIRA, as it is commonly referred to. Every President since President Ronald Reagan has required a centralized review of regulations at OIRA so that an agency can do cost-benefit analysis of regulatory actions, which means there is a centralized process for the administration to look at what they do.  In 1993, President Bill Clinton put into place Executive Order 12866 to designate OIRA as the repository of expertise concerning regulatory issues. The executive order limited OIRA's review of regulations to only significant rules changes, those that have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. This office is responsible for reviewing the regulatory actions at both the proposed and final rulemaking stages. Unfortunately, lately, agencies have blatantly ignored the principles of the executive order from President Clinton, Executive Order 12866, and other governing authorities, including those requiring State, local, and tribal consultation in the rulemaking process have been ignored.  According to a policy center at George Mason University, agencies usually satisfy 60 percent or less of the requirements called for in the regulatory analysis, meaning that certain times we have found the executive branch did not even follow the well-known processes that are there to protect the people who they are trying to[[Page H1405]]provide services to. Mr.Speaker, we believe that is partially why we are here today, to clarify and correct these problems.  For example, between 2000 and 2013, 98 percent of the Environmental Protection Agency's final rules contained no estimated compliance costs. That means that the agency chose not to follow the process that is prescribed by the executive order. Additionally, the EPA routinely justifies its regulatory activities by claiming benefits from matters unrelated to the underlying legislation. Mr.Speaker, you can well see why there is consternation not only among people in the United States, but uncertainty with business that is attempting to follow the well-understood rules and regulations and the processes that go therein only to find out that our government chooses not to follow the rules and regulations that they should be following.  H.1009 codifies the requirement for OIRA to conduct a review of significant regulations to ensure the regulations are consistent with applicable law and the principles set forth in the executive order. It also establishes new transparency measures such as requiring increased disclosure when extending review time, explanations about regulations that are dropped from the unified agenda, and a redline of changes that agencies make to regulations while it is under review by  OIRA review is important to provide a double check on agencies to ensure not only compliance with the law, but the well-understood proposals that are made by agencies and the processes that they expect to understand in that process. That is why the main tenets of the underlying legislation have been supported by Presidents in the past, Members of Congress in the past, and even the judiciary that should expect that processes and procedures are followed properly.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to take a note, if I can, and add into the Record a Statement of Administration Policy that came from one of our former colleagues, now the Director of the OMB, the Honorable Mick Mr.Mulvaney, in his new duties as the Director of the OMB, provided his first Statement of Administration It is concerning exactly the act that we are speaking about. I would like to congratulate the young Director of the OMB for his ascension to not only an important role, but helping the United States Congress to clarify for the American people that which is in their best interest.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                   Statement of Administration PolicyH.998--Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily                          Burdensome (SCRUB) Act                (Smith, R-MO, and three cosponsors)              H.1004--Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017               (Walberg, R-MI, and eight cosponsors)        H.1009--OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act               (Mitchell, R-MI, and four cosponsors)       The Administration is committed to reducing regulatory      burden on all On January 30, 2017, President Trump      signed Executive Order 13771, Reducing Regulation and      Controlling Regulatory Costs, which provides for repeal of      two regulations for every new one issued. This historic step      accelerates the retrospective review process to make common-     sense reforms to regulations across the Federal      Legislation is helpful where it amends agencies' regulatory      processes to ensure they are transparent, and appropriately      balance costs and benefits.       Each of these bills would address different aspects of the      regulatory process. The SCRUB Act, H.998, addresses the      numerous outdated, duplicative, and otherwise unnecessary      regulations that have accumulated throughout government. The      Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017, H.1004, would restrict      the use of agency funds to advocate on behalf of regulations,      and the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act, H.     1009, would codify specific executive branch regulatory      review procedures.       The Administration supports the SCRUB Act, the Regulatory      Integrity Act, and the OIRA Insight, Reform, and      Accountability The Administration looks forward to      working with the Congress on technical and other amendments      to these bills.       The Administration appreciates the efforts of the Congress      to rationalize the regulatory system and looks forward to      continuing to work together to reform the regulatory process.

54,topic-id,436,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I appreciate the gentleman's thoughtful observations on this rule and on the bills. I will acknowledge that yesterday at the Rules Committee there was a vigorous discussion--I thought, professional on both sides--where there was an idea about the intent of this bill and what it would, in essence, lay off on the administration, or any administration, in trying to make sure that they complied with the law.  I will tell you that our Appropriations chairman, as well as the Appropriations Committee, would be able to deal effectively with this if they believed they needed more money in order to accomplish these efforts. But I think that transparency is an important issue, and I think that our authorizing and appropriating committees will understand that, as they deal with agencies, a better dialogue, whether it be Republican or Democrat in office, needs to be able to deal with Congress, provide us information, provide the American people with information, and be forthright about the decisions that they are going to make.  I think that the new Director of the OMB, the Honorable Mick Mulvaney, responded in his advice back--meaning the statement of administrative policy that directly took on this issue--that he looked forward to not only working with Congress on their needs, but also complying with the spirit of the law. I believe, Mr.Speaker, that what we are doing today is providing information to a brand-new administration and saying to a brand-new administration that it is okay if you have your ideas about those issues that you would wish to take up, but you have to be forthright about what you are doing. You have to provide information not only to Congress, but the American people; and when you propose changes or rules, you have to be honest and forthright in doing that.  It may be a little bit more money, but this Congress will stand behind this. And I believe that the new Trump administration, at least through my conversations with our new President and the head of OMB, they intend for across the government, across a new administration to attempt to be forthright and direct about what they are doing and why we are doing it. Now, more than ever, whether you are a Republican or Democrat or not--you could be a person back home--you are entitled to try and clarify and ask information. That is what we are doing.  Mr.Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.Newhouse), a member of the Rules Committee, who served his State honorably as their agriculture commissioner.[[Page H1407]]    ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1403-5.txt,1548,SEARCHING FOR AND CUTTING REGULATIONS THAT ARE UNNECESSARILY BURDENSOME,2017.0,1.0,March

60,topic-id,1422,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the debate today has been fair and above board. I want to congratulate and thank the gentleman from Colorado not only for his service on the Rules Committee, but his service today in annunciating not just his party's policies and ideas on this, but also his own, as he brings a vast business experience not only to Congress and to the Rules Committee, but to serve the people of his congressional district.  However, with that said, Mr.Speaker, I think that this will be overwhelming success on a bipartisan basis today, and the reason why is, because what we are doing is in the best interest of the American people.  We are doing this because the American people want and need an opportunity, as they petition their government, to know that they were heard, for their issues and ideas to be seen. And I would think now more than ever, especially if it were a prior administration, we would be accused of trying to jam down their throats something that we saw that was trying to put an undue burden on another administration. But, in fact, we are not.  And so the thoughts and ideas today should be--regardless of the administration, regardless whether you completely agree, or somewhat disagree,[[Page H1408]]we would want that government, that agency to be able to operate with the confidence of the American people. And that means that they are not there for their own purposes, or special interests, or for them to skew facts or information that might be provided to the American people, but, in fact, were opinions as opposed to something that was reasonably gained as a result of a scientific fact or information that was based on facts of the case.  Mr.Speaker, the regulatory state in this country has grown exponentially and, really, to unprecedented levels. Unelected bureaucrats have exceeded their authority, they are creating regulations, they are negatively impacting the marketplace, which causes a problem for me back home, and Members of Congress back home, as businesses talk about following rules and regulations rather than the marketplace, and trying to add employees and to turn the cash register.  Accordingly, the American Action Forum, when totaling all available regulatory costs reported by executive agencies, the Obama administration imposed more than $600 billion in regulatory costs from 2009 to 2014. That is $600 billion worth of regulatory costs imposed on the American people by unelected bureaucrats that have increasingly become unaccountable, not only to economic growth, but also to the American people, and I believe to  Other studies have produced the same conclusion and it is this: that runaway regulations have a disastrous effect on the United States economy, impacting not only job creation, but also the effective opportunity for the free enterprise system to exist.  Federal agencies should exist to serve the American people. And as such, they should heed and respect their views and comments, while staying within the parameters of laws passed by lawmakers or ensuring the rulemaking process is transparent and free of propaganda.  Mr.Speaker, we appreciate you allowing us time to debate this on behalf of the American people today. This rule and the underlying legislation will provide an important check on the regulatory state that we find exists today in the United States, and to return transparency, responsiveness, and, I believe, honest dignity to the American people that we serve, for this overreaching process. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying legislation.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Polis is as follows:            An Amendment to 156 Offered by Mr.Polis       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       Sec 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign      Interference in the 2016 All points of order      against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate      shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour      equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking      minority member of the Committee on Foreign After      general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment      under the five-minute rule. All points of order against      provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of      consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall      rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as      may have been adopted. The previous question shall be      considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to      final passage without intervening motion except one motion to      recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of      the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution      on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House      shall, immediately after the third daily order of business      under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the      Whole for further consideration of the bill.       4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.356.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

311,topic-id,1134,"Mr.President, I came to the floor to join my colleague and friend Senator Murray to say that I, too, am ready for this fight to oppose S.13, which would allow the discrimination against Title X family planning providers. This is a misguided measure that would leave millions of women and families with fewer healthcare options. It would drastically decrease women's access to basic primary and preventative health services, including lifesaving cancer screenings and HIV testing.  Make no mistake, as Senator Murray said, the primary target of this legislation is Planned For years now, Republican leaders in Congress have tried to keep women from choosing Planned Parenthood as their healthcare provider--this at a time when Planned Parenthood serves millions of women nationwide, including nearly 12,000 women in New Hampshire, my home Most of the women in New Hampshire have incomes below or near the poverty line. Many of those women live in rural areas where they don't have other options for healthcare coverage.  The sad irony of this attack on Planned Parenthood is that study after study has shown that cutting back access to birth control and to other family planning methods actually increases the number of abortions. So I understand that opponents are interested in supporting this legislation because they think Planned Parenthood provides abortions, but the coverage Planned Parenthood is providing to women in New Hampshire and across this country with Federal dollars does not allow for abortions. So what we are doing is taking away women's access to contraception and to other family planning services and saying: You have no choice now.  More than ever right now, facts matter. Research matters. Talking away women's access to birth control and family planning will lead to more abortions, not fewer abortions. Yet this legislation is part and parcel of a broader national campaign against Planned Parenthood, whose clinics have been the target of vilification, of threats, and of violence. In October of last year, the Planned Parenthood clinic in Claremont, NH, was vandalized not once but twice. The second attack, a breaking-and-entering incident, caused extensive damage. It forced the clinic to close for 5 weeks.  I have great admiration for the courage of doctors and other healthcare providers at the Claremont clinic. Despite threats and attacks, they are determined to continue serving women across the Connecticut River Valley, many of whom have no alternative to the Claremont clinic. They are typical of the dedicated healthcare professionals at Planned Parenthood clinics all across our country.  The good news is that, according to poll after poll, the American people across the political spectrum--from Independents, to Libertarians, to Democrats, to Republicans--strongly support Planned Parenthood and oppose efforts to take away women's ability to choose Planned Parenthood as their healthcare provider.  At last night's Presidential address to Congress, I was honored to have as my guest Jennifer Frizzell of Planned Parenthood of Northern New Jen knows exactly what is at stake for women if President Trump and Republican leaders succeed in closing hundreds of Planned Parenthood clinics across the United  So let's be clear again: Supporting family planning clinics is not about abortion, which by law is never funded by taxpayer dollars--something that I think is often misrepresented by some of our colleagues here in What this is about is ensuring that American women have access to the basic healthcare they need. For 40 percent of women, their visits to a family planning center is the only care they receive annually. In 2015 alone, Title X provided basic primary and preventive healthcare services, such as Pap tests, breast exams, birth control, and HIV testing, to more than 4 million women and men at nearly 4,000 health centers.  I am sure that every one of our colleagues is receiving letters and emails and phone calls from constituents on this issue. They are pleading with us not to take away their access to Planned Parenthood and the healthcare they trust and depend on.  I received this message from Caitlin Parnell of Hampstead, She said:       As a young mother of a 2-year-old, my husband and I knew we      wanted to wait to have more children. We were both working      full time but barely making ends meet. The companies we      worked for offered health insurance, but they were small      companies, and the monthly cost was well more than we could      afford. So we went without. With no insurance, I turned to      Planned Parenthood for birth control. With the sliding pay      scale, I was able to get exams and birth control within my      budget. We were able to decide the best time to have more      children, which also allowed us to responsibly manage our      finances as well. An unplanned pregnancy at that point would      have destroyed the little financial stability we had. I don't      know where our family would be without Planned  Karla Canderhoof is a stay-at-home mother in Newfields, She wrote this:       After being diagnosed with ovarian cyst issues that caused      debilitating pain, I turned to Planned Parenthood for      treatment. In my case, the treatment for ovarian cysts was      birth control. At the time (during my college years) I could      not afford the cost of birth control due to my lack of      insurance. But Planned Parenthood gave me birth control free      of charge.  Amanda Arel of Rochester, NH, sent this message:       During the ages of 22 to 25, I utilized Planned Parenthood      for my annual exams and birth control. As I did not have      insurance and was in college, I was not able to afford most      medical care. Planned Parenthood not only provided me with      essential care, they made it very comfortable for me and were      very knowledgeable and answered any questions I had. They      provided birth control for me that, if it wasn't for them,      I would not have been able to get, at a cost I could      afford.  I still support Planned Parenthood because they provide safe, affordable healthcare for all, and that is so important.  We need to listen to our constituents, those who are speaking out in passionate support of Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics.  As Senator Murray said so eloquently, this is about respecting women's access to healthcare services, including those millions of vulnerable women who have nowhere else to turn for essential care. This is also about respecting women's constitutionally protected right to make our own reproductive choices. We must not allow Congress to strip away Federal investments in family planning clinics by allowing States to discriminate against providers like Planned  I urge our Republican colleagues, don't bring S.13 to the floor.

The President said he supports the rule of law, but he is violating the Constitution's Emoluments Clause every single day.  And worst of all, the President says he supports the troops. Then he blames the military for his own botched raid. This disgraceful abandonment of responsibility makes a mockery of the grief of Chief Petty Officer Owens' widow, who wept in front of all the American people watching the speech on TV last night.  His comments earlier in the day blaming the military are really indescribable. I agree that we must never forget Ryan Owens' sacrifice, and that is why we must understand the circumstances that led to his death and follow through with his parents' request for an independent investigation.  This speech demonstrates that the President can read from a teleprompter that he so derided during his campaign. Last night, he showed a calm and civilized face to the Was this a one-night stand or a changed man who recognizes the ominous responsibilities of being President of the United States?

982,topic-id,2370,"Mr.President, I want to speak about the healthcare bill that has been laid out in the House now--introduced in the House of I have great concern about the proposal as it relates to the people of Michigan, whom I represent, as well as to the people across the country. This proposal--or whatever passes--will be judged based on whether or not people pay more for their coverage, if they can find it, and whether they are going to be able to get the healthcare they need.  Healthcare is very personal. Despite the politics here in Congress and in the White House, healthcare is not political; it is very personal. Can you go to a doctor? Can you take your child to a doctor? Can your parents or grandparents get the nursing home care they need? Are you going to be able to find insurance after you have had a heart attack or cancer or if your child has juvenile diabetes and, therefore, has a preexisting condition?  I am deeply concerned after the initial look I have had, and we will continue to look at more and more of the details as they come out. This proposal is going to create chaos in the healthcare system. Frankly, I would say this is a mess. It is going to create a big mess as it relates to the families whom I represent and whom we all represent in our home  This was written in secret. We have all seen the stories of the Senator from the other side of the aisle who was running around trying to get a copy of what was going on. Everything was done in secret, and now that it is out, we find out that there is no cost attached to it. We do not know what the overall cost will be to taxpayers. We also do not know how many people are going to be able to get healthcare, who is going to be able to be covered.  What I have seen really falls in the category of creating a mess for families--higher costs for middle-class families, higher costs for poor families, but less coverage--such a deal. This is not the kind of deal that the people of Michigan want to have for themselves and their families.  To add insult to injury, it cuts taxes for the wealthiest Americans, while it makes most Americans pay more. It makes seniors pay more, and we have heard people calling it the ``age tax'' or the ``senior tax.'' The reality is, in a number of different ways, in how we rate, which is based on age and other costs, seniors will pay more. It is my understanding that, in the middle of this, there is actually a sweetheart deal for the CEOs of big insurance companies that will give them pay raises. This whole thing is stunning to me, which is being put forward with a straight face.  On top of everything else, it removes the guarantee for preexisting conditions. It is very unclear what will happen to someone who has had a heart attack. I have a new, little, baby grandniece who has had two heart surgeries already, and there is another one that she will have to have in another year. While she is doing great--and my niece and nephew deserve incredible admiration for taking care of little Leighton--she is going to have a preexisting condition her whole life. She is going to have a reconstructed heart that is going to cause her various challenges. Without the current guarantees that we have that she gets with her insurance, her folks are going to have a hard[[Page S1618]]time, and little Leighton is going to have a hard time her whole life.  When we look a little bit more into the details of all of this, we see, in fact, that this bill provides tax increases for millions of families. It repeals the tax credits in 2020 that help working families afford insurance. By the way, even though things do not happen immediately, in their knowing it is coming, the insurance companies are certainly going to find themselves making different kinds of decisions, and, certainly, families will make different kinds of decisions. I would expect the insurance system to be destabilized immediately. We are already seeing problems with insurance companies pulling out just based on the debate about repealing healthcare.  When we look at the tax credits--or help--for buying healthcare, it goes from helping those from low-, moderate-, and middle-income families being able to afford insurance to changing the whole thing. It is based on your age and your income. So the higher the age and the higher the income, the more taxpayer dollars you get, which makes no sense. A 55-year-old with a higher income will get more taxpayer funding than will a 30-year-old who is working a minimum wage job and has the toughest time in trying to find insurance that he can afford. This is not the set of values or perspectives that make sense for people in Michigan, as well as for people across the country.  While that 30-year-old who is working a minimum wage job is going to be paying more and hoping that he does not have a preexisting condition because he may not be able to find insurance at all, we see that there is a $300 billion--with a ``b''--tax cut for the wealthiest Picture this: Somebody in a minimum wage job who could very well see his health insurance go completely away will have that happen, while someone who makes more than $3.7 million a year will save over $200,000 a year. So $200,000 a year is what he will get back now in the form of a tax cut, which is more than what most people make. Certainly, the majority of people in Michigan make less. They work very, very hard, but they make less than $200,000.  Just to underscore, this is the first bill out of the gate here in which we are talking about any kind of tax cuts. We are already seeing Republicans cutting taxes for the wealthy while raising taxes on the middle class and raising their healthcare costs if they can find healthcare. These tax cuts are just the start. Wait until we get to tax reform, when we are going to see this whole debate happen again. My guess is that middle-income people are going to end up paying the bill--paying more--and the wealthy people are going to get another round of tax cuts.  To add insult to injury again, there are the sweetheart deals so that the CEOs of the biggest insurance companies can get pay raises--can get more money--while people will pay more if they work or are poor or middle class. There are tax cuts for prescription drug companies of $30 billion, but the bill does nothing to lower the cost of prescription drugs. This, certainly, is not healthcare for the majority of This, certainly, is not healthcare for those who need to have access to affordable healthcare.  Then it is back to our seniors, who will pay more because of the changes in how healthcare costs will be rated. We will, essentially, see older people having twice the tax credit but five times more the cost. I am not sure exactly how it is being proposed for preexisting conditions. We are still working through that. I do know that the bill has a penalty. If you have health insurance and, for some reason, there is a crisis in your family and, for some reason, you cannot continue it and you drop that insurance and then you reenroll again, there is a 30-percent late enrollment surcharge. You will be paying 30 percent more for your health insurance if you have a preexisting condition.  There are just two other items that are very important. I know that the distinguished Presiding Officer shares the concern about this as well, which is the fact that we have been able to create more access to healthcare by expanding Medicaid, which is critically important.  One of the great success stories in Michigan today is that 97 percent of our children in Michigan can now see a doctor--97 percent. We do not want to go backward. Every child should have the ability to see a doctor--every mom, every dad, every grandpa, every grandma. Right now, in Michigan, 97 percent of children can see a doctor because of the work that we did on the Affordable Care Act, including in the expansion of This goes away. It takes a couple of years, but that goes away.  Instead, what is proposed, essentially, is a voucher, but it has been called a lot of names. There used to be folks talking about a block grant to the Now they call it ``per capita.'' Yet it is really simple. Just like there have been proposals by Republicans for years to have a voucher for Medicare, now this is, essentially, a voucher for Medicaid of X number of dollars. If you need more for your nursing home care, then you are on your own. There are X number of dollars for your child, for a family. If you have something happen and you get sick and you need surgery or if you have cancer and it goes above that voucher, you are on your own.  It completely changes Medicaid from an insurance system to a system of, essentially, a voucher. Millions and millions and millions of children, of families, of seniors--the majority of seniors in nursing homes get their coverage through Medicaid--and our moms, dads, grandpas, and grandmas, who right now get quality nursing home care because of Medicaid, will be severely impacted by this voucher that caps how much care they will be able to receive.  Finally, for over half of the population--for those of us who are women--we will see a return, essentially, to a woman being a preexisting condition. Essential services for women--maternity care, which I was at the front of the line in fighting for, and prenatal care--are not available in the majority of private plans a woman tries to buy without her paying more. You can get maternity care, but it is not viewed as basic. It may be basic to you, as a woman, but insurance companies say: Sure, we will cover maternity care, but you have to pay more. Forever, women have been paying more for their basic healthcare. Under the Affordable Care Act, that changed when we said: Do you know what? As a woman, you should not have to pay more for the basic care you need.  Now all of that goes away under the House proposal. Just to make sure that we see women's healthcare taken away, Planned Parenthood is defunded. Yet 97 percent of what they do is basic care--mammograms, getting to see your doctor, OB/GYN, prenatal care, and all of the things you need for annual visits and so on. That is completely defunded.  I congratulate everyone who has been involved in the effort to make sure that birth control is affordable for women, and under the Affordable Care Act, we have done that. This is an economic issue; this is not a frill for women or for men or for families or for those who have worked hard to make sure we can lower unintended pregnancies in this country.  The good news is that we are at a 30-year low in unintended pregnancies, a historic low in teen pregnancies, and at the lowest rate of abortions since 1973--1973. Why is that? That is because women have been able to get the healthcare they need. They have been able to get affordable birth control to be able to manage their healthcare, as well as seeing the economy improve. But we are seeing more and more where more information is being made available, costs for basic preventive care is down, and women having access to what they need in healthcare allows them to be in a situation where we are seeing these historic lows on unintended pregnancies, teen pregnancies, and abortions.  I know in Michigan we have a number of counties across Michigan, particularly in rural communities, where the Planned Parenthood clinic is the only provider of basic healthcare. It is the only provider for family planning and for cancer screenings and basic healthcare for women and for many men. It may be the only provider in the community. More than half of Planned Parenthood health centers are in rural and underserved communities. About one-third of all of the women living in those communities where Planned Parenthood is available find that this is the only healthcare provider available to them.[[Page S1619]]  So support for women, preventive healthcare, and Planned Parenthood funding are cut completely in this bill. Access to maternity care, prenatal care, and other basic essential services is eliminated. If you want that, you can pay more as a woman.  On top of that, we are seeing essential services like mental health and substance abuse services and other basic comprehensive services that we said for the last several years should be available--healthcare above the neck as well as healthcare below the neck should be viewed as essential services for people across All of that goes away with this proposal.  So, in my judgment, this is a mess. It is going to create a mess, with more costs, less service, shifting taxpayer dollars to the wealthy, while asking the middle-class and low-income families to pay more. This is simply not a good deal.  I would welcome the opportunity to work with colleagues on something that makes sense. Let's put aside this whole effort of repeal. Let's focus on how we can bring costs down, including prescription drugs, and continue to move forward, but let's not go back. When 97 percent of the children in my State can see a doctor today, that is worth keeping. That represents the best of our values. We can't go backward. The proposal we are seeing in the House would take us back to a place that would hurt the majority of Americans, and I strongly oppose it.

As the Presiding Officer and everybody in this room and those watching on TV probably know, Alaska is a breathtaking place. In fact, there is no place like it in the world--mountain ranges that seem to go on for eternity, salmon-filled waters and rivers, streams, massive glaciers. People save up their whole lives to come to visit my We welcome them. We want them all to come.  As I have also been saying, it is the people who make Alaska truly special, the Alaskans, people throughout my State banding together to form warm communities in cold climates. In Alaska, where the conditions are often extreme, we depend on each other--communities do--sometimes even for survival.  Today I would like to recognize Joyce McCombs, the director of the community library in Delta Junction, AK, as the Alaskan of the On March 9, Joyce will be celebrating 30 years as the library director--30. She was also recently named by the Alaska Library Association the Audrey Kolb Public Library Service Award winner and received the Public Library Roundtable Certificate of Appreciation for her ``significant, innovative activities'' to improve her library. That award is named after Audrey Kolb, who is a legend in the library world in Alaska, and Joyce has that award as well as our award.  Delta Junction, where she lives, is a beautiful community of about 1,000 residents, surrounded by 3 spectacular mountain ranges. The community is about 150 miles from Fairbanks, in Alaska's interior. It gets cold there in the winter. As a matter of fact, this morning in Delta Junction, it was 26 below zero. And it is home to Fort Greely, which is the cornerstone of our Nation's entire missile defense system, protected by 300 brave soldiers, part of the Alaskan National  For many in Delta Junction, the library--recognized by the Library Journal as one of the best in the State--is the place where people converge and find warmth and community.

They are tough people in Delta  Joyce, with the support of so many in Delta Junction, including Fort Greely, which supports the library, has made sure that this library stays one of the best in the State and in the country. In her words, Delta's library is the ``community living room.'' In a small town like Delta Junction, such spaces are rare and, indeed, special. Joyce brings all sorts of services and learning to the library, including bands, authors, cooking classes--``what the community wants and needs,'' she said. Sometimes those needs entail sitting someplace warm and reading a book. Sometimes it means Skyping a spouse who might be serving overseas in Afghanistan or Iraq or applying for a job or getting the right form to file their tax returns. Joyce said: ``We're open 6 days a week serving everybody from nursery schools to nursing homes.''  One Delta resident told Joyce on Facebook:       Your assistance to the literary education of now two      generations of children has been an invaluable contribution      to our community that will be paying dividends for years to      come.

134,topic-id,1316,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition to rolling back workplace safety protections for American workers. This use of the Congressional Review Act would endanger employees and throw away four decades of precedent for the sole purpose of protecting companies that repeatedly violate safety standards.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, commonly known as OSHA, is among the best tools we have to ensure that companies adhere to basic safety standards. Because the agency's budget is so small compared to its critical task, OSHA relies on accurate data to focus on the companies that pose the greatest danger to employees.  The previous administration sought to clarify and codify the responsibility companies have to maintain an honest record of their employees' injuries and illnesses. This resolution would undermine OSHA's ability to target serial offenders by removing companies' obligation to keep reliable data about safety issues in the workplace. If passed into law, the resolution would essentially grant amnesty to companies with years of workplace safety violations, while sending a clear message to employers that the Federal Government is no longer committed to worker safety.  Mr.Speaker, I have asked the question many times since the President took office, and I will ask it again today: How does this give power back to the people? How does undermining workplace safety regulations support middle class Americans? How does protecting companies that repeatedly violate safety standards improve the life of workers? The answer is that it doesn't.  I call on my colleagues to stand with working Americans who deserve a safe workplace and vote ``no'' on this resolution.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the UAW opposing the repeal of this rule and also a letter from National Nurses United in opposition to H.83.[[Page H1427]]                                                          UAW,                                                February 28, 2017.       Dear Representatives: On behalf of the more than one      million active and retired members of the International      Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural      Implement Workers of America, UAW, we strongly urge you to      oppose H.Res 83. This misguided resolution undermines      workplace health and safety standards in the most dangerous      industries. The proposed legislation will make it much harder      for the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to      ensure the safety and health of America's workers.       Since the early 1970s, OSHA has required employers to      maintain a safety record for five years and make reports to      the Department of Labor (DOL). These records are used by      workers and employers to identify hazards, fix them, and most      importantly, keep accidents from happening in the future. DOL      utilizes these records to publish statistics on workplace      injury and illness rates and OSHA relies on them to allocate      scarce resources.       OSHA issued the recordkeeping rule to clarify an employer's      responsibility to maintain a safe workplace. The rule does      not impose any new costs or obligations on employers and only      covers larger businesses with the most high risk occupations.       Accurate injury and illness records are critically      important for workers and their families. Having the      necessary tools to collect complete and accurate data on      work-related injuries and illnesses is a key component in      reducing, mitigating, and eliminating hazards and deaths in      the workplace.       Historically, OSHA has assessed and enforced injury      recordkeeping requirements under every administration. In      turn, workers in America have enjoyed a much safer work      environment. We must not take away or reduce OSHA's role in      improving health and safety conditions for workers and we      must ensure the accuracy of the reporting requirements.      Tremendous gains have been made in workplace hazard      reporting. We cannot go backwards.       The UAW members have a long and storied history of securing      workplace protections for all of America's workers. This bill      undermines those gains and more than 40 years of solid      science and practice.       We urge you to resoundingly reject H.Res 83 and vote No      when it comes to the floor.           Sincerely,                                                      Josh Nassar,     Legislative                                  ____                                       National Nurses United,                                                February 27, 2017.

By revoking OSHA's authority to enforce      recordkeeping requirements, this Congressional Review Act      (CRA) resolution denudes the agency of the tools necessary to      identify and target patterns of workplace hazards. These      recordkeeping requirements are fundamental to OSHA's ability      to protect workers from job-related health and safety      hazards. But H.83 would leave OSHA with no functional      mechanism to protect workers from longstanding workplace      hazards--health and safety dangers on the job would go      undisclosed and uncorrected. Congress must oppose this GRA      resolution lest it place the health and safety of workers in      serious jeopardy.       The published final rule, known as the ``Volks Rule,'' is a      common-sense measure meant to align OSHA regulations with its      40-year-long practice of enforcing employer injury and      illness recordkeeping requirements as continuing violations      under of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH      Act). Under the OSH Act, Congress authorized OSHA to      promulgate rules requiring employers to maintain accurate      records of workplace injuries and illnesses. Since 1972,      under multiple Republican and Democratic Administrations,      OSHA has required most employers to make and maintain records      of workplace injuries and illnesses for five years from the      date of the injury or illness. Each OSHA Administration has      determined that the five-year record maintenance requirements      were continuing obligations of employers and that OSHA      citations could be issued if a violation were identified any      time within that five-year period. But a 2012 decision by the      D.Circuit Court of Appeals in Volks Constructors v.      Secretary of Labor held that OSHA could not issue a      recordkeeping citation beyond a six-month period despite the      long-standing five-year recordkeeping requirements. There was      a gap in OSHA regulations, and the Volks Rule would fix it,      making agency recordkeeping rules consistent with its      decades-long enforcement practices.       To fulfill its statutory duties to protect America's      workforce from workplace safety and health hazards, OSHA      depends on its ability to enforce injury and illness      recordkeeping requirements. For OSHA to identify workplace      hazards and to develop effective means to correct those      hazards, complete and accurate information about what, where,      when, and how injuries and illnesses occur in the workplace      is vital. OSHA uses this information to develop injury      prevention plans and to efficiently direct OSHA's scarce      resources to worksites that pose the most serious hazards for      workers. Reliable workplace injury data is also fundamental      to the development and maintenance of effective occupational      health and safety standards. Moreover, federal, state, and      local officials also need reliable injury and illness data      during procurement processes, ensuring that taxpayer dollars      to contractors and subcontractors are going to fair and safe      workplaces.       The elimination of OSHA's ability to enforce rules on      workplace safety records allows--and even incentivizes--     employers to obscure ongoing workplace hazards. It would be      nearly impossible for OSHA to identify a recordkeeping      violation and conduct a comprehensive investigation within      six months of the injury or illness, instead of the full      five-year recordkeeping period. Chronic underreporting--left      unchecked if the Volks Rule was halted--erodes OSHA      inspectors' ability to enforce the country's occupational      health and safety laws and allows patterns of serious health      and safety violations to persist. The CRA resolution would      gravely weaken workplace health and safety protections,      exposing workers to serious harm while on the job.       Because workers deserve the full and effective enforcement      of the panoply of our worker protection laws, NNU urges you      to oppose H.83.

983,topic-id,1779,"Mr.President, irrespective of how the Presidential election came out last November, we would be having a conversation about how to fix There are many reasons for that, but most importantly is that it has just skyrocketed costs for people in this country. Premiums have gone through the roof, deductibles have increased, copays have increased, and out-of-pocket costs have become so extensive for people that even if they have coverage, they can't use their plans in many cases. So when our colleagues across the aisle talk about the recently rolled out proposal coming from the House--which they will be discussing and we eventually will be discussing--to try to drive down the costs for people in this country, that is what this debate is really all about.  You can say what you want, but the fact is that this year, 2017, premium increases are 25 percent in the exchanges--25 percent. In six States, the premium increases were 50 percent in the exchanges. I don't know how anybody--any family in this country--can keep up with those kinds of skyrocketing premiums. If you are buying your insurance on the individual market, the roof is blown off.  I talk to people in my State of South Dakota all the time who share with me the excessive amount that it now costs for them to cover themselves and their families. I talked to a lady in Sioux Falls recently, and she told me they are now paying $22,000 a year for health insurance. That is not working. That is why what we had was an abysmal failure.  In terms of choices, the whole idea was that people were going to have options out there. In a third of the counties in America today--one-third of the counties in America today--people have one option, one insurer. It is pretty hard to get a competitive rate when you only have one option. There is a virtual monopoly in a third of the counties in America today.  So we have markets collapsing, insurers pulling out, and we saw that last fall Blue Cross Blue Shield pulled out of the individual market in South Dakota and left 8,000 people wondering how they are going to continue to cover themselves with health insurance. The markets are collapsing, choices are dwindling, and costs are skyrocketing.  The Senator from Michigan was just on the floor talking about how terrible things are going to be under the proposal that is being considered and discussed in the House of Representatives, but the fact is, things are terrible today, and that is why we are having this conversation. Eight in ten Americans think ObamaCare either ought to be repealed entirely or dramatically changed, significantly changed. By any estimation, by any objective measurement or metric, it has been a failure, and that is why we are having this conversation, and that conversation would have occurred irrespective of what happened in the Presidential election last fall.  So let's be clear about why we are here and why we are having this conversation and why we are coming up with a better solution for the American people that will drive down their costs, give them more choices, create more competition in the marketplace, and give them a higher and better quality of care because it restores the doctor-patient relationship, which is so important, not having the government intervening and being in the middle of all of that.                   The Economy and Regulatory Reform  Mr.President, we have a recovery that technically began almost 8 years ago, but for too many Americans, it still feels as if we are in a recession. Americans basically have not had a pay raise in 8 years. Since the recovery began in 2009, wage growth has averaged a paltry 0.25 percent a year--one quarter of 1 percent increase in pay per year since 2009. Well, imagine if you are a family and you are looking at everything that is going up in your lives, whether it is healthcare, which I just talked about, or the cost of education or the cost of energy or the cost of food, all of these things that continue to go up, and you are getting a 0.25-percent--one quarter of 1 percent--pay raise on an annual basis. It is pretty hard not to feel like you are starting to sink and your head is going to be below water before long.  Good jobs and opportunities for workers have been too few and too far between. Millions of Americans are working part time because they can't find full-time employment. Even as some economic markers have improved, our economy has stayed firmly stuck in the doldrums. Economic growth for 2016 averaged a dismal 1.6 percent, and there are few signs that things are improving.  By the way, the historical average going back to World War II is about 3.2 percent average growth in the economy. So last year we were at one-half of what the average had been going back all the way to World War  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is projecting average growth for the next 10 years at just 2 percent--in other words, long-term economic stagnation.  The good news, though, is that we don't have to resign ourselves to the status quo. We can get our economy going again. Republicans are committed to doing just that. To get our economy going again, we need to identify the reasons for the long-term stagnation we are experiencing.  A recent report from the Economic Innovation Group identified one important problem: a lack of what the organization calls ``economic dynamism.'' Economic dynamism, as the Economic Innovation Group defines it, refers to the rate at which new businesses are born and die.  In a dynamic economy, the rate of new business creation is high and significantly outstrips the rate of business deaths. But that hasn't been the case in the United State lately. New business creation has significantly dropped over the past several years. Between 2009 and 2011, business death outstripped business birth.  While the numbers have since improved slightly, the recovery has been poor and far, as I mentioned before, from historical norms. The Economic Innovation Group notes that in 2012--the economy's best year for business creation since the recession--it fell far short of its worst year prior to 2008. This is deeply concerning because new businesses have historically been responsible for a substantial part of the job creation in this country, not to mention a key source of innovation. When new businesses aren't being created at a strong rate, workers face a whole host of problems.  ``A less dynamic economy,'' the Economic Innovation Group notes, ``is one likely to feature fewer jobs, lower labor force participation, slack wage growth, and rising inequality--exactly what we see today.''  Well, American workers clearly need relief, and restoring economic dynamism is a key to providing it. We need to pave the way for new businesses and the jobs they create, and we need to ensure that current businesses, particularly small businesses, are able to thrive.[[Page S1620]]  There are a number of ways we can do this. One big thing we can do is relieve the burden of excessive government regulations. Obviously some government regulations are important and necessary, but too many others are unnecessary and doing nothing but loading businesses down with compliance costs and paperwork hours. The more resources businesses spend complying with regulations, the less they have available for growth and innovation. Excessive regulations also prevent many new businesses from ever getting off the ground. Small startups simply don't have the resources to hire individuals, let alone the consultants and lawyers to do the costly work of complying with the scores of government regulations.  Unfortunately, over the past 8 years, the Obama administration spent a lot of time imposing burdensome regulations on American businesses. According to the American Action Forum, the Obama administration was responsible for implementing more than 675 major regulations that cost the economy more than $800 billion. Given those numbers, it is no surprise that the Obama economy left businesses with fewer resources to dedicate to growing and creating jobs or that new business creation seriously dropped off during those years in the Obama administration.  Since the new Congress began in January, Republicans have been focused on repealing burdensome ObamaCare regulations using the Congressional Review We have already used this law to repeal three Obama regulations, and this week we will use it to repeal at least two more, including the ``blacklisting'' rule, which imposes duplicative and unnecessary requirements for businesses bidding on Federal Government contracts, and the Bureau of Land Management methane rule, which curbs energy production on Federal lands by restricting drilling. This methane rule would cost jobs and deprive State and local governments of tax and royalty payments that they can use to address local priorities.  Another area of regulatory reform we need to address is ObamaCare, as I mentioned. Repealing the burdensome mandates and regulations this law has imposed on businesses will go a long way toward removing barriers to new businesses and spurring growth at existing businesses.  Another important thing we can do is remove unnecessary barriers that restrict access to capital. Both new and existing businesses rely on capital to help them innovate, expand, and create jobs.  In addition to removing burdensome regulations, tax reform needs to be a priority. Measures like allowing new businesses to deduct their startup costs and reducing rates for small businesses would spur new business creation and help small businesses thrive. Republicans plan to take up comprehensive tax reform later this year, and I look forward to that debate.  The American economy has always been known for being dynamic and innovative, and we need to make sure it stays that way. We need to free up the innovators and the job creators so that the next big idea isn't buried by government regulations before it has a chance to see the light of day.  Sluggish economic growth doesn't have to be the new normal. By removing burdensome government regulations and reforming our Tax Code, we can spur business creation and innovation. We can increase wages and opportunities for American workers, and we can put our economy on the path to long-term health, where that growth rate gets back to that more historic level that allows for better paying jobs and higher wages for American families.  I look forward to working with my colleagues in both Houses of Congress to achieve these goals, and I am anxious for us to start passing bills that will put policies in place that are favorable to higher economic growth, better jobs, and better wages for the American people and their families.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgS1616-2.txt,1534,TRAVEL BAN,2017.0,7.0,March

376,topic-id,815,"Mr.Chairman, I thank my colleague for leading this floor debate today.  Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of my bipartisan bill, H.1004, the Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017.  Regardless of the chatter that I believe simply confuses what we want to do in good government, this bill, H.1004, is a good government transparency bill that is simple in nature and seeks to preserve the integrity of the regulatory process; specifically, the public comment period.  Whether it is EPA or the Department of Labor or any other agencies or departments, they have their purpose, but they have to follow the law. The public comment period is an essential part of upholding our democratic values because it ensures that Americans will have their voices heard in the Federal Government's regulatory process.  Agencies must take the comment period seriously. Unfortunately, we have seen instances where agencies seem to believe that the regulatory process is simply a perfunctory act that the agency must undertake in order to reach a prearranged outcome.  This became abundantly clear during the EPA's Waters of the U.S., or WOTUS, rulemaking process. During that process, Mr.Chairman, the EPA undertook a campaign to solicit support and artificially inflate the positive reaction to the WOTUS rule. The EPA used the skewed results as evidence of public support.  Mr.Chairman, I include in the Record two letters coming from the National Association of Home Builders and the Michigan Farm Bureau to attest to this problem.                                           National Association of                                                Home Builders,                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2017.     Timothy Walberg,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative Walberg: On behalf of the 140,000      members of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB),      I am writing to express NAHB's strong support for H.1004,      the Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017. This legislation would      force agencies to follow an open and transparent federal      regulatory rulemaking process by making all aspects of a      rulemaking publicly available and preventing federal agencies      from illegally influencing the public in order to generate      support for a rulemaking.       Federal agencies are prohibited, by law, from engaging in      lobbying, grassroots, and propaganda activities designed to      advance a policy agenda. However, in recent rulemakings, the      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has ignored these      restrictions and used social media platforms to perpetuate      propaganda campaigns that advance their rulemakings. These      actions only support the notion that the agency is not      interested in a transparent and fair rulemaking process.       An excellent example of this is when the EPA created a      social media campaign on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to      counter opposition to its ``Waters of the US'' rulemaking.      The agency concealed the fact that its social media messages      were coming from within the EPA and deceptively engaged in      lobbying efforts designed to kill legislation that was not      favorable to their proposed rulemaking. In December 2015, the      Government Accountability Office released a report outlining      how the EPA participated in covert propaganda and grassroots      lobbying and condemned the agency for violating federal law.      Federal agencies must respect and uphold the law, and the      passage of H.1004 will help to ensure that federal      agencies are not lobbying against America's small businesses.       For these reasons, NAHB urges the House Oversight and      Government Reform Committee to support H.1004, the      Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017, in order to bring      transparency and neutrality to the regulatory process.       Thank you for giving consideration to our views.           Sincerely,     James Tobin                                  ____                                         Michigan Farm Bureau,                             Lansing, Michigan, February 13, 2017.     Jason Chaffetz,     Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House          of Representatives, Washington,     Elijah Cummings,     Ranking Member, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,          House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings:      Michigan Farm Bureau strongly supports the Regulatory      Integrity Act of 2017. The bill is a step in the right      direction to hold government agencies accountable and for      citizens to maintain trust in the government that serves      them. Introduced by Tim Walberg, the bill is scheduled      to come before the House Oversight and Government Reform      Committee later this week.       Last year, we heard about an EPA grant being used to fund      whatsupstream.com in the state of This initiative      used the following billboard message: ``Unregulated      agriculture is putting our waterways at risk'' to urge the      public to contact state elected officials. In a similar      campaign, GAO issued a legal opinion that EPA violated      federal lobbying laws by funding advocacy efforts on the      Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule. Michigan farmers      are frustrated when they read about federal agencies trying      to sway the public in a way that promotes their own proposed      rule before all stakeholders have had a chance to weigh in      the rule's merits. These examples only undermine the trust      our members place in the agencies meant to serve and protect      our citizens.       We believe it is critical that Congress pass the Regulatory      Integrity Act of 2017. We urge all members of the Committee      to support this bill.

My bill simply seeks to preserve the spirit and purpose of the regulatory process by simply telling agencies that they need to keep to the facts and not solicit support when they ought to be soliciting constructive comments.  H.1004 simply requires an agency to; one, identify itself as the source of information; two, clearly state whether the agency is accepting public comments or considering alternatives; and, three, and most importantly, speak about the regulations in a neutral, unbiased tone.  People need to have the confidence that the Federal agencies, regardless of whether it is a Republican or Democrat administration, are open to their insights an constructive criticism.  H.1004 will restore the integrity to our regulatory process by ensuring agencies are honestly asking for feedback, constructive criticism, and dialogue about how to improve upon the agency's existing thoughts, not advocating for a predetermined outcome.

718,topic-id,1238,"Madam President, the 115th Congress has now been in session for 2 months. Republicans control the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the White So what have they done so far with that power? Have they passed legislation to create jobs or increase wages for middle-class families? Have they proposed any plan to put Americans back to work fixing our roads, bridges, and other crumbling infrastructure? Have they done anything at all to help seniors who are struggling with high drug prices and other expenses? Not even close.  During his campaign, President Trump said over and over that he would stand up for workers. But so far, Republicans haven't voted on a single piece of legislation to help working families put food on the table, send their kids to college, or save a little money for retirement. No, they haven't helped families, but they have been busy.  With no hearings and barely any debate, Republicans have found a new tool, one that has been used successfully only once before in history, under the Congressional Review They have used it to kill basic protections for workers. No wonder they haven't wanted any headlines about the actual work they are getting done.  Senate Republicans want to repeal the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive order. So instead of creating jobs or raising wages, they are trying to make it easier for companies that get big-time, taxpayer-funded government contracts to steal wages from their employees and injure their workers without admitting responsibility.  The American people spend around $500 billion every year on private companies that provide goods and services to the government. Those companies do everything from building battleships and fighter jets to serving snacks at national parks. It is big business. It is estimated that as many as one in five American workers works for a company with at least one Federal contract.  With so much taxpayer money on the line, it really matters that contractors are using it responsibly. While many contractors are good employers, others cut corners on safety or squeeze their workers on wages and benefits just to keep their corporate profits going up, and they break Federal labor laws to do so. Here are just two examples.  VT Halter Marine is a company that builds ships for the They have received $680 million in Federal contracts since 2009--taxpayer dollars that were supposed to be used to create good, safe jobs. Instead, VT Halter took a lot of shortcuts on worker safety, and now they have killed or injured multiple workers at their shipyards in  In 2012, a worker died after the lid of a 20-pound cast iron pot containing abrasive ship-cleaning liquid came loose and sheared away his face. Investigations showed that VT Halter had ignored safety requirements to show employees how to safely handle these pots.  In 2014, a crane collapsed at VT Halter, injuring five workers, including a crane operator, who lost part of his skull, is now blind, and requires 24-hour nursing care. That employee had repeatedly told his supervisors that the sensors on his crane were broken, but VT Halter kept him working, and now he is blind and needs full-time nursing care.  The list goes on and on. Each time, VT Halter ignored the law, workers got hurt or killed, and the company got a slap on the wrist and another top-dollar defense contract courtesy of the American taxpayer.  Contractors that cannot meet basic safety standards should not get a single dollar of taxpayer money, and the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive order was the first step in making sure that this was the case.  Other Federal contractors have found other ways to take advantage of their workers and to boost profits. Federal contractors have been caught stealing wages from hundreds of thousands of workers. Right here in the Senate, the men and women who prepare the food in the cafeteria have had their wages stolen by the contractor that employs them. The Department of Labor just found out that hundreds of these hard-working employees together were owed more than $1 million in back wages. This case was right under our noses. There are countless more all across the country where the very companies that receive taxpayer money from the government are taking shortcuts, breaking the law, cheating their employees out of hard-earned wages, and driving working families into poverty.  Republicans in the House of Representatives have called this rule ``a solution in search of a problem,'' saying it would ``only hurt workers and small businesses,'' as if the deaths of those working for Federal contractors or the thefts of their wages was just business as usual and they didn't care. That position is parroted by the chamber of commerce, which calls the rule ``burdensome'' and ``unwarranted.''  My Republican colleagues and their buddies in the giant corporations that rely on huge Federal contracts to keep profits high want the American people to believe that by making it easier for companies that mistreat their workers to profit off of taxpayer dollars, somehow they are helping workers. That is just nuts.  Here is what the rule does: When a company wants a contract from the government that is worth more than $500,000, it has to disclose any judgments against it for violating labor laws for the preceding 3 years. The order also asks the Secretary of Labor to work with other agencies to come up with standards for assessing whether labor violations are serious, repeated, or willful.  If you are a company that does right by your workers, this rule will not affect you--not one bit. If you pay your workers fairly and keep them safe on the job, you won't even notice the new rule. It also does not stop companies from getting contracts if they have had just a few violations but have taken steps to remedy the problem, and it does not add one bit to the burden on smaller companies that bid on smaller contracts--again, not one bit.  So who gets hit by this rule? Who is it who is complaining? Who are the Republicans trying to protect? Massive corporations that repeatedly cut corners that put their employees' lives at risk or that steal their wages. This rule keeps the big corporations that are the biggest labor violators from getting the biggest contracts.[[Page S1597]]  Once again, this debate is about whom Congress actually works for. Does Washington work for the taxpayers, who want to see their hard-earned money spent responsibly? Do we work for the hard-working Americans, who want to be paid what they are promised and not have to put their lives at risk for a paycheck? Do we work for giant contractors that rake in enormous tax dollars and cannot even follow basic safety rules for American workers?  I came to Washington to stand with the men and women who go to work every day to build roads and bridges, to help communities recover from natural disasters, and to provide healthcare to our veterans. I think that is what we are here for. But the Republican majority wants to stand up for giant corporations that put workers at risk. They want to stand up against good, safe, well-paying jobs. That is their priority in the new If they succeed, it will be the American taxpayers and the American workers who quite literally pay the price.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Moran).

316,topic-id,1835,"Mr.President, I am here today for the 158th time to ask this Chamber to wake up to the mounting evidence of climate change. The sad truth is that, in Congress anyway, this issue has turned starkly partisan thanks to a torrent of dark political money that the fossil fuel industry uses to both threaten and reward the Republican Party in a dirty, dark money game of stick-and-carrot. Republicans in Congress ignore climate change for the simple reason that the fossil fuel industry has become their political life support system. It does not have to be this way.  Outside this Chamber, even Republicans see things very differently. In the investment sector, where people have to make decisions based on real facts and where duties to shareholders limit overly creative accounting, the Republican signal is clear.  An impressive group of Republican former Treasury Secretaries and Republican former Presidential economic advisers recently proposed a conservative, market-based climate solution. Republican Presidents trusted these folks with the conduct of the U.economy. Jim Baker was Secretary of the Treasury under President Reagan, Hank Paulson was Secretary of the Treasury under President George Bush, and George Shultz was Secretary of the Treasury under President Nixon, in addition to other distinguished offices that they held. Joining those three were Martin Feldstein, Chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, and Greg Mankiw, who held that position for President George Bush; Rob Walton, the former chairman of the board of Walmart, the world's largest retailer and employer; and Tom Stephenson from Sequoia Capital, the venture capital firm out in Silicon This Republican group proposed a ``carbon dividends'' plan. It combines a carbon tax on fossil fuels--which reflects harm from carbon emissions which market economics ordinarily requires to be built into the price of the product--with a big dividend returning all of the revenues to the American people, and a reduction of regulations, which may be mooted by a good enough carbon fee. This idea is actually not so different from my own American Opportunity Carbon Fee  In their report, they all note that the ``mounting evidence of climate change is growing too strong to ignore.'' Many would say that it grew too strong to ignore a good decade ago, but it is important that these Republican leaders have acknowledged this.  They also said: ``Economists are nearly unanimous in their belief that a carbon tax is the most efficient and effective way to reduce carbon emissions.''  This report lines up with many other Republicans outside Congress who support a revenue-neutral carbon fee. It is the favorite climate solution in conservative economic circles. Indeed, it is the only widely accepted climate solution among  The Niskanen Center, a Libertarian think tank that spun off from the Cato Institute, last month wrote this:       The case for climate action is now so strong that one would      be hard-pressed to find a serious academic economist who      opposes using market forces to manage the damage done by      greenhouse emissions.  Like the Treasury Secretaries, economists and investors throughout the financial community are saying loud and clear: We can no longer ignore climate change.  Goldman Sachs, for instance, in 2015 did a report on the low-carbon economy. It was called: ``Goldman Sachs equity investor's guide to a low carbon world, 2015-2025.'' So unless somebody here is going to say that Goldman Sachs is in on the hoax, Goldman Sachs is taking this pretty seriously.  Last year, the investment firm BlackRock, with more than $1 trillion in assets under management, issued a report titled: ``Adapting Portfolios to Climate Change.''  I don't think investors trust $1 trillion to a firm that falls for hoaxes. BlackRock, like Goldman, knows that climate change is real and is helping its investors plan for the economic fallout.  BlackRock warns in its report: ``Investors can no longer ignore climate[[Page S1530]]change. . . .'' Parenthetical editorial comment: That is the job of Republicans in  BlackRock also had something to say about a price on carbon. They said this: ``Higher carbon pricing would help address [externalities from fossil fuels] and would be the most cost-effective way for countries to meet their Paris agreement pledges.''  So in the real world, where real decisions are being made by very smart people backed by real money, they are telling their clients: You must take climate change seriously, and you must take carbon pricing seriously.  The BlackRock report had this data on prices that companies are setting on carbon internally--in their own internal accounting--across sectors, including healthcare and energy and utilities. As we can see, the price per metric ton ranges from a low of about $10 in information technology, up to over $350 per metric ton--internal costs of carbon accounting in these industries.  The point ought to be pretty clear. The business community is acting, investors are insisting on it, and a price on carbon is a key part of the program.  The legendary Wayne Gretsky's rule was to ``skate to where the puck is going to be.'' These major firms recognize where the carbon economy is heading. We should too. We would, if it weren't for the political mischief wreaked in Congress by the fossil fuel industry.  BlackRock and Goldman Sachs are not alone. The insurance and reinsurance industry is one of the world's biggest investors, as well as one of the world's best analyzers of risk. Munich Re and Swiss Re, and others in property casualty and reinsurance, warn us that climate change is real and portends huge costs for society. Munich Re's head of risk accumulation in the United States said in 2015: ``As a nation, we need to take steps to reduce the societal impact of weather events as we see greater variability and volatility in our climate.''  One of the biggest investors in the housing market is the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Freddie Freddie Mac has warned about climate change impact on the real estate sector: ``The economic losses and social disruption may happen gradually, but they are likely to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis of the great recession.''  When we think of what we went through in the housing crisis of the great recession, wow, Freddie Mac is warning that the economic losses and social disruption from climate change in our housing markets are likely to be worse.  These are all serious investors and they have serious warnings for us, and ignoring all of them just to please fossil fuel industry patrons is a big, big mistake.  Even President Trump's nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, Jay Clayton, thinks we need action. For years, his law firm has encouraged clients, including ExxonMobil, to disclose climate change-related risks to the SEC and to investors. If he is confirmed, I hope he will enforce the SEC's existing disclosure requirements for climate risk and clarify that public disclosures should include asset valuations based on global compliance with international treaties. Investors need climate change risks disclosed against a ``reality check'' baseline that assumes international compliance with the Paris climate commitments. An assumption that we fail should not be acceptable.  Slowly, investor disclosures are improving. Last year, New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman forced Peabody Energy to restate its disclosures. Just last week, Chevron acknowledged to its investors in an SEC filing that, lo and behold, some of its products ``may be considered pollutants,'' noted ``new conclusions about the effects of the company's operations on human health or the environment,'' and they acknowledged ``an increased possibility of governmental investigations and, potentially, private litigation against the company.''  It is better late than never, I suppose. Now it is time for the rest of the industry to report fully and fairly, first on the risks that shareholders bear from assets that are wrongly valued now--that are falsely valued in their reports--and, second, on the company's potentially culpable behavior in climate denial.  Institutional investors are joining in those efforts. Our Rhode Island pension fund, managed by our treasurer, Seth Magaziner, is pushing for greater transparency on political and lobbying spending at large energy companies like Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and For the resolution filed at ConocoPhillips, Rhode Island was joined by over 20 other cofilers, including the State of Connecticut, Senator Murphy's home State, whom I see here on the floor.  Just recently, the G20 nations--the 20 biggest economies in the world--set up a group called the Task Force on Climate-related Financial It is made up of 32 members from large banks, insurance companies, asset management companies, pension funds, credit rating agencies, and accounting and consulting firms--you know, liberal extremists. And they are saying: Here it comes; let's get ready. They have asked that companies begin to come clean on the climate risk they face.  The big energy companies need to come clean on how much they are spending to deny climate science and where they are spending it, because, ultimately, it is their own investors who will be hurt by their irresponsibility. Ultimately, all the phony climate denial they pay for is a fool's errand because the laws of physics, chemistry, and biology aren't going away, and a day of reckoning for all this mischief and nonsense they have paid for inevitably will come.  We in the Senate have a duty to the American people to find a way to combat climate change. I realize this body will need help in that task. We will need help from the business community, which can apply its understanding of market forces and risk analysis to this challenge. It would help if the fossil fuel industry would focus on the long term health of its shareholders rather than on short-term gain. The fossil fuel industry should stand down the relentless political opposition it has maintained to any climate solution, and it should stand down the phony climate denial operation it continues to support.  It will take all of us coming together--companies, investors, regulators, governments, citizens, Republicans and Democrats--to achieve Donald Trump's once-stated goal of combating the ``catastrophic and irreversible effects of climate change''--his quote: ``catastrophic and irreversible effects of climate change.''  I did not misquote President Trump, although he was Donald Trump then. It was 2009, and this full page advertisement was taken out in the New York Times declaring that the science of climate change was ``irrefutable'' and the consequences of climate change would be ``catastrophic and irreversible.'' It was signed by none other than Donald Trump, as well as his children, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, and Ivanka They were right then. If they get back to this, they will be right now.  The evidence and the science have only piled up since 2009. It is time for all of us to heed the advice of our universities, our scientists, and the people who actually know what they are talking about, and put the arguments of the fossil fuel industry where they belong--in the trash bin of history. We need to wake up before it is too late.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                              Gun Violence  ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgS1523.txt,1823,0915,2017.0,1.0,March

1009,topic-id,1769,"Mr.President, this is my ``Time to Wake Up'' speech 159. In giving these speeches, I have come to realize that some of my colleagues seem to have a hard time wrapping their heads around the basic understanding of climate change. Some of President Trump's Cabinet nominees seem to have the same problem.  They say the scientific community is split on the issue. It is not.  They say the climate has always been changing. Not like this, it hasn't.  They say we can't trust projections and complex computer models. But overall, they have actually been right.  And, of course, they have the notorious ``I'm not a scientist'' dodge. Well, if a colleague doesn't understand this, then perhaps he ought to trust the scientists at NOAA and at NASA, at our National Labs, and at universities in Rhode Island and across the country--the scientists whose job it is to understand this.  I must say, in addition to trusting the scientists, I also trust Rhode Island fishermen who see the changes in their traps and nets and our shoreline homeowners watching the sea steadily rising toward their homes. You don't need fancy computer models to see the ocean changes already taking place; you just need a thermometer to measure rising temperatures, basically a yardstick to measure sea level rise or a simple pH kit to measure the acidification of our oceans.  Let's look at ocean acidification. The oceans have absorbed about one-third of all the excess carbon dioxide produced by humans since the industrial revolution, around 600 gigatons' worth. When that carbon dioxide dissolves into the ocean, chemistry happens, and it makes the oceans more acidic.  Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid. Carbonic acid isn't stable in ocean water, so it breaks down into bicarbonate ions, a base, and hydrogen ions, an acid. The increase in acidic hydrogen ions is the crux of the chemistry of ocean acidification. More hydrogen ions lower the water's pH,[[Page S1630]]and the lower the pH, the higher the acidity.  Regular viewers of my ``Time to Wake Up'' speeches or people who spent the night up with us while we objected to Administrator Pruitt's nomination may remember that I demonstrated this in a simple experiment on the Senate floor just a few weeks ago. I took the glass of water on my desk, and I used the carbon dioxide in my own breath. Blowing through an aquarium stone, I was able to show, with the help of a little pH dye, how easy it is to actually measure the effect of CO2 on the acidity of water. With just a few breaths into the water, I was able to visibly make this glass of drinking water more acidic.  That little experiment is a microcosm of what is happening in our oceans right now, except, instead of bubbles blown through a straw, it is a transfer of excess CO2 from the atmosphere into the surface waters of the ocean all around the globe.  Scientific observations confirm that what the laws of chemistry tell us should happen is actually happening. Massive carbon pollution resulting from burning fossil fuels is changing ocean acidity faster than ever in the past 50 million years.  Now, you start talking in big numbers, and it all goes into a blur--50 million years, compared to how long the human species has been on the planet, which is about 200,000 years. So 50 million years is, what, 250 times the length of time that our species has inhabited the  This chart shows measurements of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere taken at the Mauna Loa Observatory in That is the redline of climbing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. And it shows carbon dioxide in the ocean, which is the green measure, which is also climbing in tandem with the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Finally, it shows the pH of ocean water in the sea. Of course, as the chemistry would tell us, as the carbon dioxide goes up, the pH comes down, and the acidity rises; the water becomes more acidic.  We measure that surface seawater on the Earth's oceans has, since the industrial revolution, become roughly 30 percent more acidic. NOAA predicts that oceans will be 150 percent more acidic than now by the end of the century. Coastal States, like Rhode Island and Florida, will feel the hit.  Ocean acidification disrupts life in the sea when those loose hydrogen ions we talked about latch onto free carbonate ions. Usually that carbonate is plentiful in ocean water. Shell-forming marine creatures, like oysters and clams, use this loose carbonate to help form their shells. But if the carbonate they need is bound up by hydrogen ions, they can't get enough carbonate to build their shells.  We have even seen acidification scenarios in which shells start to dissolve in the water. Shellfish hatcheries on the west coast have already seen devastating losses of larval oysters due to acidic waters. When ocean pH fell too low, baby oysters couldn't form their shells, and they quickly died off. Julia Ekstrom, the lead researcher for Nature Climate Change's 2015 study on ocean acidification, told PBS that it has cost the Pacific Northwest oyster industry more than $100 million and jeopardized thousands of jobs. Her research flagged 15 States where the shellfish industry would be hardest hit, from Alaska to Florida, to my home State of Rhode  Toward the bottom of the oceanic food web is the humble pteropod. Pteropods are sometimes called sea butterflies because their tiny snail foot has evolved into an oceanic wing. In 2014 NOAA found that more than half of pteropods sampled off the west coast were suffering from severely dissolved shells due to ocean acidification, and it is worsening.  This is a pteropod shell degrading over time in acidified water.  Of course, we are here in ``Mammon Hall,'' where it feels laughable to care about anything that can't be monetized. We talk a good game here in the Senate about God's Earth and God's creation and God's creatures, but what we really care about is the money. So let's monetize this.  Who cares about this humble species? Salmon do. As the west coast loses its pteropods, that collapse reverberates up the food chain, and the salmon care because many of them feed on the pteropods. The west coast salmon fishery is a big deal, so salmon fishermen care about this.  Another foundational marine species, krill, is also affected by ocean acidification. In the Southern Ocean, nearly all marine animals can thank krill for their survival. From penguin diets to whale diets, krill is king.  A 2013 study in Nature Climate Change found ocean acidification inhibiting the hatching of krill eggs and the normal development of larvae. The researchers note that unless we cut emissions, collapse of the krill population in the Southern Ocean portends ``dire consequences for the entire ecosystem.''  Closer to home, the University of Alaska's Ocean Acidification Research Center--yes, ocean acidification is serious enough that the University of Alaska has an Ocean Acidification Research Center, and it warns that ocean acidification ``has the potential to disrupt [Alaska's fishing] industry from top to bottom.''  Turning to warmer waters, coral reefs are also highly susceptible to ocean acidification. A healthy coral reef is one of the most productive and diverse ecosystems on Earth, home to 25 percent of the world's fish biodiversity. Those reef-building corals rely on calcium carbonate to build their skeletons.  Since the Presiding Officer is from Florida, I know how important coral reefs are to the tourism industry in his  Coral depends on a symbiotic relationship with tiny photosynthetic algae, called zooxanthellae, that live in the surface tissue of the coral. There is a range of pH, as well as temperature, salinity, and water clarity, within which this symbiosis between the coral and the zooxanthellae thrives. Outside that comfort range, the corals get stressed, and they begin to evict the algae. This is called coral bleaching because corals shed their colorful algae. Without these algae, corals soon die.  The effects of acidification on sea life are far-reaching. Studies have found ocean acidification disrupts everything from the sensory systems of clownfish--those are little Nemos, for those who have seen the movie--to phytoplankton populations, to sea urchin reproduction, to the Dungeness crab, another valuable west coast specialty.  I asked Scott Pruitt, our ethically challenged Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, about ocean acidification. He gave these answers: ``The oceans are alkaline and are projected to remain so,'' and two, ``The degree of alkalinity in the ocean is highly variable and therefore it is difficult to attribute that variability to any single cause.''  Let's look at those answers.  The first answer is plain and simple nonsense because the harm to ocean creatures from acidification comes from the dramatic shift in ocean acidity, not from where along the acid-based spectrum the shift takes place. The observation he made is irrelevant to the question.  His second answer is no better. It exhibits purposeful ignorance of the role humans' carbon pollution plays in damaging the ocean, because the chemical principles at issue here are indisputable. You can replicate them in a middle school laboratory in any Florida school. As I showed in my little demonstration, you can replicate them even here on the Senate floor. Like its carbon cousin, climate change, ocean acidification doesn't care whether you believe in chemistry. It doesn't matter to chemistry if you swallow the propaganda pumped out by the fossil fuel lobby. The principles of science operate notwithstanding. The chemical interactions take place by law of nature whether you believe them or not. If you believe in God, then you have to acknowledge that these laws of nature are God's laws, the basic operating principles He established in His creation. But, of course, here at Mammon Hall, it is always about the money.  Any decent EPA Administrator is obliged to trust in real science and to take action to protect human health and the environment. I am deeply unconvinced that Administrator Pruitt will live up in any respect to those obligations, but I would welcome being proven wrong. Likewise, I similarly challenge my colleagues here in the Senate.[[Page S1631]]  This Chamber and our Nation will be judged harshly by our descendants, both for our pigheaded disregard for the basic truths, the basic operating systems of the world we live in, and for the shameful reason why we disregard them.

649,topic-id,1132,"Mr.President, today I am introducing the Animal Welfare Accountability and Transparency This bill is a necessary step to restoring public information on animal cruelty that was removed from the U.Department of Agriculture's, USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, APHIS, website under the Trump administration.  On February 3, 2017, APHIS removed information from its website related to oversight and enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act, AWA, and Horse Protection Act, HPA, including animal inspection and licensing reports for more than 9,000 licensed facilities that use animals--facilities like commercial dog breeding operators, animal research labs, roadside zoos, and horse show participants. Since 2009, APHIS has made this information public to increase transparency and hold violators of these animal cruelty laws accountable. This information is now hidden from the public and is only available through a Freedom of Information Act Request, which can take months and sometimes even years for an agency to respond.  The Animal Welfare Accountability and Transparency Act restores transparency by requiring APHIS to once again make AWA and HPA inspection reports accessible to the public. In my view, transparency is key when it comes to giving animal lovers and consumers information about whether their pets or the products they buy are the result of heartbreaking beginnings. These inspection reports also help law enforcement officials track and understand trends in animal welfare violations.  Preventing animal cruelty starts with getting facts out to consumers. By shedding light on AWA and HPA violations, the Animal Welfare Accountability and Transparency Act holds accountable puppy mill operators and other businesses that use animals for breeding, research, and testing.  To ensure that taxpayers are not paying for entities that violate animal welfare laws, the Animal Welfare Accountability and Transparency Act also prohibits businesses that are found to be in violation of the AWA or HPA from collecting certain tax benefits.  Under current tax and accounting rules, companies can write off the value of breeding and working animals on their taxes using accelerated depreciation, as if those animals are machinery. They keep that preferential and valuable tax benefit, even if they violate animal cruelty laws. The Animal Welfare Accountability and Transparency Act puts an end to this practice and holds companies accountable for breaking the law by prohibiting businesses found to have violated AWA or HPA from claiming accelerated depreciation for tax purposes for five years.  The Animal Welfare Accountability and Transparency Act is a much needed step to restore transparency in animal cruelty and to hold companies accountable for violating the law.

650,topic-id,1284,"Mr.President, today I am reintroducing a bill honoring two Oregon legends--Frank and Jeanne Moore--who have spent their lives together on the North Umpqua River as fishers, stewards of the land, and hosts to visitors from across the world at the famous Steamboat  The North Umpqua River runs through the Umpqua National Forest in Southwest The river is a destination for rafters and kayakers, and is home to some of the best steelhead runs in the world, making it a fly-fishing haven. Frank and Jeanne Moore founded the Steamboat Inn in 1957, and spent years introducing visitors to the beauty of the Umpqua National Forest and the North Umpqua Frank, a decorated WWII veteran and a recent inductee into the Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame, was the fishing guide for the Inn's visitors, and has now been fishing this river for 70 years. The Steamboat Inn's website paints a wonderful picture of how Frank and Jeanne welcomed visitors to the North Umpqua River:  ``Each night, Jeanne Moore cooked evening meals for as many as sixty road construction crew members, who ate in shifts, before turning her attention to feeding her lodge guests. Frank pitched in, helped with the cooking, and also made a policy decision that would henceforth guide the Fisherman's Dinner: From then on, anglers could fish until the last light disappeared on the river. Dinner would be served one half hour after sunset!''  In the 1960's, the river and its tributaries experienced significant degradation, and Frank Moore has worked tirelessly ever since to rehabilitate the river and the steelhead populations. Frank served on the State of Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission and has received the National Wildlife Federation Conservationist of the Year award and the Wild Steelhead Coalition Conservation He works with his neighbors and local organizations to monitor the river, and just about everyone he comes across on his drives along the river knows his name and knows his work. Frank and Jeanne have opened their door to visitors and have taken great care of this Oregon treasure.  The Frank and Jeanne Moore Wild Steelhead Special Management Area will stand as a tribute to the Moore's and their dedication to protecting this special place in Oregon and preserving the hard work they've put in to ensure that Oregonians and visitors alike will have a healthy river, full of steelhead, to visit for decades to come.
