                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Peoples Church, Jacksonville, Texas, 
offered the following prayer:
  O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the Earth. When 
we consider the heavens and the Earth, the works of Your fingers, what 
is man that You are mindful of us?
  In our troubles, we cry out to You, and You hear us. Your ear is not 
deaf, Your arms of mercy never refuse our salvation.
  Great is the Lord, greatly to be praised. You are our refuge, our 
very present help in times of trouble.
  Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to its people.
  Forgive us O Lord, where we have sinned and come short of Your glory. 
Let Your grace wash over us. Though our sins be as scarlet, wash us and 
make us whiter than snow.
  Blessed is the Nation whose God is the Lord. Let us exalt the Lord 
together, and He will heal us.
  In Jesus' name, Amen.
