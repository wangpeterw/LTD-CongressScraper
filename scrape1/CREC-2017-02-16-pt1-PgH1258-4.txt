               GENERAL FLYNN, PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND RUSSIA

  (Miss RICE of New York asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, Michael Flynn's resignation and 
reports of constant contact between Russia and the Trump campaign raise 
serious questions, and the American people deserve answers.
  President Trump was informed weeks ago that Flynn lied about his 
discussions with the Russian Ambassador and might be vulnerable to 
blackmail.
  Why did the President take no action until that lie became public?
  President Trump has reportedly been briefed about contact between his 
campaign and Russian intelligence officers.
  Why does he continue to insist that there was absolutely no 
communication with Russia?
  These questions cannot go unanswered. We need to put politics aside, 
do what is right for our democracy, and create an independent 
commission to fully investigate Russia's influence on the Trump 
administration and the Presidential election.
