                      CONGRATULATIONS TO AMERICANS

  (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this 
opportunity to congratulate the American people for what you did over 
the course of a few months since January, when you found out that your 
healthcare benefits were threatened by the TrumpCare repeal-and-replace 
attempt.
  Because you went out into the streets, because you marched, because 
you attended townhall meetings, and you made your feelings known about 
the fact that you wanted to save the Affordable Care Act, you were 
successful. You gave backbone to the moderate Republicans who stood up 
and said no to the Trump replacement.
  For that, I congratulate you, and I congratulate the American people.
