            PAYING TRIBUTE TO MONTANA EDUCATOR, CRAIG WILSON

  (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an 
educator who touched the lives of thousands of Montanans with his love 
for our State as well as his knowledge and passion for Montana 
politics. As one of Montana's foremost political scientists, Dr. Craig 
Wilson was well known across the State and across both sides of the 
aisle.
  For 34 years, Professor Wilson spent his days in front of students in 
a classroom at Montana State University Billings, helping them 
understand the world in which they lived.
  He conducted reliable and respected surveys that engaged Montanans on 
issues that mattered most to them. His method was honest and 
straightforward, a welcome approach in today's politics.
  Craig was a loving husband to Kristianne, a proud father of Collin 
and Evan, and a doting grandfather to Blair and Jett.
  Dr. Wilson was an educator in and out of the classroom. He was dearly 
loved and will be missed.
