     EYES IN THE SKY: FLIGHT ATTENDANT SAVES VICTIM OF TRAFFICKING

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on a recent flight, flight attendant 
Shelia Fedrick of Alaska Airlines noticed a young girl, 14 or 15 years 
old, with blonde hair. Shelia approached two individuals, but the young 
girl refused to speak or make contact with her. The man next to the 
girl was defensive as she tried to make conversation.
  Something was just not right. Shelia quickly devised a plan. She 
convinced the girl to go to the bathroom where Shelia had left a note 
stuck to the mirror. The girl wrote back on the note, and she needed 
help.
  The flight crew quickly alerted the police on the ground. Shelia 
Fedrick ended up saving a victim of human trafficking.
  Traffickers often ship their victims across the country like baggage. 
The Department of Homeland Security and flight attendants are working 
together through training to spot warning signs of modern-day slavery.
  Thanks to Shelia Fedrick and other flight attendants for their work 
in rescuing victims of trafficking. We must continue to stop 
traffickers in their tracks.
  And that is just the way it is.
