                                 PRAYER

  Pastor Melissa Hatch, Prosper United Methodist Church, Prosper, 
Texas, offered the following prayer:
  Almighty and gracious God, today we are grateful for Your guidance 
and Your presence in our lives. We humbly follow Your lead and 
direction.
  When our own decisions seem too difficult to navigate, help us to 
turn to the One who never slumbers or sleeps. When we are impatient for 
decisions, help us to wait upon You for the right way to go.
  Strengthen us for the work that You have called us to do. Help us to 
work together for the common good and reach across lines to be Your 
hands and feet in a world that desperately needs You.
  When times and situations seem uncertain, help us cling to the hope 
that we find in You. And in the words of Micah 6:8, help us to act 
justly, love kindness, and walk humbly with our God.
  We pray all of this in Your mighty name.
  Amen.
