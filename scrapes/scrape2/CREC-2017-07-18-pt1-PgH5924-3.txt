                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Terry Sanders, Victory House Ministry, Uniontown, 
Pennsylvania, offered the following prayer:
  For this great assembly of leaders, Lord, we come today to ask for 
your guidance, wisdom, and support for our Nation.
  Help us to engage in meaningful discussions, and allow us to grow 
closer as our Nation's leaders and to nurture this Nation.
  Fill us with Your grace, God, as we make decisions that may affect 
our Nation and the world.
  Continue to remind us that all we do here today, all that we 
accomplish in our Nation, is for the pursuit of freedom, for Your 
greater glory, and for the service of humanity.
  We ask all these things in Your name.
  Amen.
