                 OPPOSING THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, my constituents have been calling all 
weekend. They do not support the Republican health care bill, 
TrumpCare.
  Over the weekend, we received 750 calls or emails. Ninety-three 
percent of those have contacted me to say that they are against 
TrumpCare, and here is why:
  Higher costs for less care; $2,400 annually for an average American 
family.
  Millions kicked off health care. The Congressional Budget Office says 
24 million. Some might say they are way off. So maybe it is 20 million. 
Maybe it is 30 million. Lots of Americans lose health care as a result 
of this plan.
  An age tax. If you are age 50 to 65, fasten your seat belts; $6,971 
in increased costs for lesser health care.
  And huge, huge tax breaks for millionaires. The 400 richest Americans 
would get an average $7 million tax break.
  This is not the right direction for this country. It is not the right 
direction for health care. We should reject it.
