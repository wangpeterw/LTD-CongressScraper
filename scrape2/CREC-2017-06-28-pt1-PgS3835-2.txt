             REQUESTS FOR AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have nine requests for committees to 
meet during today's session of the Senate. They do not have the 
approval of the Democratic leader for the seventh consecutive 
legislative day, therefore, they will not be permitted to meet after 2 
p.m. I ask unanimous consent that the list of committees requesting 
authority to meet be printed in the Record for today's session and the 
previous 2 days.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:
