240,topic-id,4443,"Mr.President, I wish to address the resolution the Senate is now considering.  In 2015, 85 U.Senators voted for the law fixing No Child Left Behind, which reversed the trend to a national school board and restored decisions to classroom teachers, local school boards, and The Wall Street Journal said it was the ``largest devolution of federal control to the states in a quarter of a century.''  The Department of Education regulation this resolution seeks to overturn does exactly the reverse. It begins to restore the national school board, and it takes away responsibilities from classroom teachers, local school boards, and It does this in direct violation of the law that 85 Senators voted for just 15 months ago. So the question before us, today, is not only whether we believe in a national school board or local school boards. More important, perhaps, the question is: who writes the law? Does the U.Congress write the law, or does the U.Department of Education write the law? Article I of the U.Constitution says that the Congress, elected by the people, writes the law.  The purpose of this resolution is to overturn a regulation of the Department of Education that in 7 cases directly violates the Every Student Succeeds Act, passed just 15 months ago, and in 16 other cases exceeds the authority allowed by that law.  This regulation would say to States: Ignore the law 85 Senators passed 15 months ago. Ignore the law that President Obama called a Christmas miracle. Ignore the law that Governors, teachers, school boards, and superintendents all supported, and even ignore why they supported it. Instead, listen to the unelected bureaucrats at the U.Department of  This regulation issued by the Department of Education specifically does things or requires States to do things that Congress said, in our law fixing No Child Left Behind, that the Department of Education cannot do. Therefore, it violates the law.  In this law, Congress said to the Department: You cannot tell States exactly what to do about fixing low-performing schools; that is a State decision. But this regulation does that anyway.[[Page S1667]]  Congress said to the Department: You cannot tell States exactly how to rate the public schools in your But this regulation does that anyway.  This is not a minor matter.  The remarkable consensus that developed in the 2015 bill in support of fixing No Child Left Behind was to reverse the trend toward a national school board and restore to States, classroom teachers, and school boards decisions about what to do about their children in 100,000 public schools. Teachers, Governors, and school board members were fed up with Washington telling them so much about what to do about the children in their schools. So this regulation, which contravenes the law specifically, goes to the heart of the bill fixing No Child Left  It is very unusual in Federal law to specifically prohibit a department from regulating on an issue, but that is exactly what Congress did in 2015. Here are seven specific examples of how the regulation which we seek to overturn violates prohibitions that Congress explicitly wrote into the law:  1, the regulation prescribes the long-term goals and measurements of progress that States establish for student subgroups.  The law says, for example, that the Secretary may not tell a State that goals set for students of one race must improve their progress 20 percent better than the progress of a group of students of another race. Yet the regulation says that States must establish goals and measurements for lower performing subgroups who ``require greater rates of improvement,'' which would necessarily mean that students of one race would have to do better than students of another race.  2, the regulation requires federally prescribed actions to be taken in schools that do not annually test at least 95 percent of students.  The law says that States must annually test not less than 95 percent of all students and each subgroup of students, but States determine how to hold schools accountable for ensuring that 95 percent of students participate on annual tests. The law says that the Secretary of Education may not prescribe ``the way in which the State factors'' the 95 percent testing requirement into their accountability system. Yet the regulation we seek to overturn prescribes four different specific ways that States must take action in schools that miss the 95 percent requirement.  3, the regulation prescribes that schools with consistently underperforming subgroups of students be identified with a lower summative determination.  The law says that States are required to identify schools for targeted support when a subgroup of students is ``consistently underperforming'' in a manner ``as determined by the state.'' So under the law, the Secretary can't tell States how to identify the lowest performing schools or what a school's rating should be. Yet the regulation we are seeking to overturn says that States are required to ``demonstrate that a school with a consistently underperforming subgroup . . . receive a lower summative determination. . . . than it would have otherwise received.'' The Department of Education is meddling into the methodology of school ratings again, despite the fact that Congress said it could not.  4, the regulation prescribes the timeline for identifying schools with consistently underperforming subgroups.  The law says that States are required to identify schools for targeted support when a subgroup of students is ``consistently underperforming'' in a manner ``as determined by the state.''  We had lengthy discussions about this. These issues in education are filled with conflict and filled with different opinions. I said many times during the debate that working on an education bill in the Senate is kind of like being in a football stadium on game day at Penn State or the University of Tennessee: Everybody in the stands has played football, and they know what play to call, and they usually do. So everybody had a point. We had to work these things out and we wrote down carefully the agreement we had. We wrote down that the Secretary of Education may not impose new requirements or criteria on State accountability systems, such as a timeline for the identification of lowest performing schools. Yet the regulation prescribes an exact timeline of 2 years.  5, the regulation requires States to resubmit their plans to the Secretary every 4 years.  The law says that each State plan ``shall . . . be periodically reviewed and revised as necessary by the State educational agency.'' Yet the regulation says States must review and revise their State plans ``at least once every four years'' and ``submit its revisions to the Secretary for review and approval.''  6, the regulation dictates exactly how school districts with significant numbers of low-performing schools must measure resources for students.  The law says States must ``periodically review resource allocation to support school improvement'' in districts that are serving a significant number of low-performing schools. The law says the Secretary cannot tell States what to review. Yet the regulation says that in addressing resource inequities, States must review differences in the following: rates of ineffective, out-of-field, or inexperienced teachers; access to advanced coursework; access to full-day kindergarten and preschool programs; access to specialized instructional support personnel; and per-pupil expenditures of Federal, State, and local funds.  But the law said the Secretary could not tell States what to review.  7, the regulation tells States how to count students in subgroups.  The law says each State decides the minimum number of students who should be included in the State's count of subgroups. So, a State might decide that for students to be included in the State's subgroup data, there needs to be at least 35 students, for example, of a subgroup in a school. The law says the Secretary may not impose new requirements or criteria on State accountability systems. Yet the regulation we are seeking to overturn says States must pick a number below 30 or States will have to explain themselves to the That is in violation of a specific prohibition passed by this body with 85 votes and signed by the President of the United  Those are seven ways the regulation specifically violates prohibitions in the law that were intended to keep the Secretary from doing what the Secretary then turned around and did.  Here are 16 more ways the regulation exceeds the authority of the U.Department of To some, this may seem minor. To some, it may seem dull. It is not dull to me. I don't think it is dull to most Article I of the Constitution isn't dull. We are elected to write the laws, and anytime we turn over to somebody else--whether it is the court, whether it is the executive branch--that constitutional prerogative, we violate our oath, in my opinion.  1, the regulation limits how States measure school quality or student success. The law says States must include at least one measure of school quality or student success that has to be ``valid, reliable, comparable, and statewide.''  The Secretary cannot tell States what measures to use in their State accountability system. Yet the regulation tells States they can only choose indicators that meet the criteria the Department came up with.  2, the regulation limits how States measure school quality or student success for indicators used specifically in high school.  The law says States must include at least one measure of school quality or student success, specific to high schools, and it has to be ``valid, reliable, comparable, and statewide.'' The Secretary cannot tell States what measures to use in their State accountability system. Yet the regulation tells States they can only choose indicators that meet criteria the Department came up with.  3, the regulation tells schools marked as low-performing that they will always be low-performing unless they improve on indicators the U.Department of Education has identified.  The law says something different. The law says that tests and graduation rates have to count more in the State accountability systems than indicators of school quality or student success. The Secretary of Education may not prescribe ``the weight of any measure or indicator used to identify or meaningfully differentiate schools.''[[Page S1668]]  The regulation says that a low-performing school must continue to be identified as low-performing unless it improves on tests and graduation rates, even if the school is making significant progress on other measures of school quality or student success, such as, for example, absenteeism or family engagement, something chosen by the  4, the regulation requires school districts where schools aren't testing 95 percent of students to develop and implement a Federal improvement plan.  The law says States must annually test not less than 95 percent of all students and each subgroup of students. The law leaves it to States to determine what to do in school districts with schools that are failing to meet the participation requirement. Yet the regulation tells States how to address school districts where schools aren't testing 95 percent of students. It invents out of whole cloth the idea of a Federal improvement plan, and then it mandates it.  5, similarly, the regulation requires schools that aren't testing 95 percent of students to develop and implement a Federal improvement plan.  The law says that States must annually test not less than 95 percent of all students and each subgroup of students. The law leaves it to States to determine what to do in schools that are failing to meet the participation requirement. Yet the regulation tells States how to address schools that aren't testing 95 percent of students.  Again, it invents out of whole cloth the idea of a Federal improvement plan with four federally prescribed elements, and then it mandates it.  6, the regulation tells States how to measure high school graduation rates.  The law says each State will establish long-term goals for ``all students and each subgroup of students in the State,'' including the goal of high school graduation rates using either the ``four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate'' or ``at the State's discretion, the extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate.'' Yet the regulation says States can only use the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate to identify low-performing schools in their accountability systems.  You can see that throughout these examples there appears to be a deliberate attempt by the Department of Education not to interpret the law but to ignore the law or, specifically, to contravene the law, to thumb the nose of regulation writers at the Congress and the President who passed and signed the law.  7, the regulation requires each State to come up with a definition for an ``ineffective teacher.'' The law says each State will describe how low-income and minority children enrolled in schools are not served at disproportionate rates by ineffective teachers. Yet the regulations says States have to define ``ineffective teachers.'' It is going to make it nearly impossible for States not to implement an entire teacher evaluation system.  8, in the same way, the regulation requires each State to come up with a definition of an ``out-of-field teacher.''  That is what the regulation does, but the law just says States will describe how low-income and minority children enrolled in schools are not served at disproportionate rates by ``out-of-field teachers.'' The regulation says you have to define that.  9, the regulation requires each State to come up with a definition for an ``inexperienced teacher.''  The law simply says a State will describe how low-income and minority children are not served at disproportionate rates by ``inexperienced teachers.'' Yet the regulation goes on to require a definition.  10, the regulation tells States to report on the number and percentage of all students and subgroups of students who are not included in the State's accountability system.  The law says each State will report a clear and concise description of the State's accountability system, including the minimum number of students that the State determines are necessary to be included in each of the subgroups of students. Yet the regulation requires States to provide new information outside of the scope of what is required by the law.  11, the regulation tells States how to rate schools and that the State accountability system has to produce a single rating for each school.  That was not envisioned by the law. The law says that States must create a system of evaluating all public schools in the It says, further, that the Secretary of Education may not prescribe the specific methodology used by States to evaluate schools. Yet the regulation tells States that the results must lead to a ``single summative determination'' for each school.  A State might choose to do that or a State might choose not to do that. That was the decision of the Congress, but the Department decided differently.  12, the regulation adds a requirement that the State's accountability system has to include at least three levels of performance.  The law says that States have the flexibility to establish a system of meaningful differentiation of schools without any parameters or federally prescribed methodology. That couldn't be clearer--without any parameters or federally described methodology. Yet the regulation prescribes a requirement that States use at least three distinct levels of performance for schools.  13, the regulation prescribes when schools may exit from identification as the lowest-performing.  The law says States must establish statewide criteria for schools to exit from being identified as in need of improvement. The law says that the Secretary of Education may not prescribe what the exit criteria are. That is a decision left up to States, but the regulation narrows the States' ability to develop their own criteria for schools to no longer be identified as the lowest performing.  14, the regulation prescribes how States intervene in school districts with schools that are labeled as the lowest-performing. The law says that if a low-performing school does not meet a State's criteria for no longer being identified as lowest-performing, then the State must take a ``more rigorous State-determined action.'' The Secretary of Education cannot prescribe, under the law, any specific strategies to improve schools. Yet the regulation requires the State to tell school districts to take interventions the Department has prescribed.  15, the regulation prescribes how school districts intervene in schools that are labeled as low-performing.  The law says if a low-performing school does not meet statewide criteria for no longer being identified as lowest-performing, the State must take a ``more rigorous State-determined action.'' The Secretary cannot prescribe any specific strategies to improve schools. Yet the regulation requires a school to take federally prescribed actions.  We have already tried Federal one-size-fits-all actions under the School Improvement Grant program in No Child Left We rejected that. We don't think Washington should be in the business of telling schools how to fix themselves.  Finally, 16, the regulation limits how States award school improvement funding to school districts and schools.  The law says States must establish the method they will use to award school improvement funding to school districts. The regulation dictates to States how much they have to award to low-performing schools receiving school improvement funds.  Here is what this resolution overturning the regulation would do. The resolution would ensure that the law fixing No Child Left Behind is implemented as Congress wrote it. The regulation violates the law and its clear prohibitions on the Secretary by prescribing new requirements through regulation or as a condition of a State plan approval.  In the law we passed, Congress reached an agreement about requiring States to identify a certain number and types of schools that need to be improved, but we left it to the States to determine how to go about fixing those schools and how long they had to fix the schools. The regulation prescribes how States and school districts intervene in and improve schools that do not improve.  Secondly, this resolution restores State flexibility. The regulation is in direct conflict with the intent of the law to allow States and school districts[[Page S1669]]to have greater flexibility to implement the law, as Congress intended.  Congress reached an agreement that there are some essential elements of a State accountability plan that need to be included in a State plan. The other half of the agreement was that we left to the States the decisions about how to include these factors into their accountability systems. This is about article I of the  Congress wrote the law with specific rules in mind. The Secretary of Education and his or her bureaucracy do not get to treat Congress as a minor impediment to the education system of their choosing. If they want to write the laws of the land, they should run for Congress and get themselves elected, draft a bill or an amendment--not wait for Congress to finish our work and try to undo it through a simple regulation.  This resolution, overturning the regulation, would preserve local decision-making. As I mentioned, the Wall Street Journal editorialized, when we passed the law, that it was ``the largest devolution of Federal control to States in a quarter-century.''  The regulation tried to restore Washington, DC, decision-making with mandates that States comply with specific requirements instead of letting States determine how to best proceed.  This resolution scuttles new and burdensome reporting requirements. The regulation created new reporting requirements on States and school districts that will drive up compliance costs and divert resources away from students and classrooms.  Let me conclude by dealing with some of the arguments and misinformation that I have been hearing about the resolution. 1, I want to make clear that this resolution overturning the regulation strengthens accountability in our public schools the way Congress determined to do it in the law fixing No Child Left  We transferred most of that responsibility for accountability from Washington, DC, to States and local school boards. We did not want a national school board.  The law also includes Federal guardrails to ensure a quality, public education for all students, including, for example, requiring States to identify and provide support to low-performing schools--at least the lowest performing bottom 5 percent of each State's schools--and requiring academic and English language proficiency indicators to be included in each State's accountability system. The law's Federal guardrails will shape how States design their accountability systems because a State plan would not be following the law if the State fails to include accountability provisions in their plan.  The repeal of this regulation does not let States--the ones who are supposed to be addressing accountability--off the hook by any means. Repealing this regulation simply ensures that individual States and their Governors, legislators, chief State school officers, local school boards, superintendents, principals, parents, and classroom teachers are responsible for these decisions.  This resolution, overturning the regulation, will allow States to implement the new law on the existing timeline to submit their plans and have the Department review and approve State plans.  U.Education Secretary DeVos has said that she favors the current timeline, the one established by former Secretary She said this at her confirmation hearing before our committee. She confirmed that again after taking office.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that Secretary DeVos's letter of February 10 to the Chief State School Officers outlining the timeline be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                February 10, 2017.       Dear Chief State School Officer: Thank you for the      important work you and stakeholders in your State are engaged      in to develop new State plans and transition to the Every      Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which reauthorized the      Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). I am      writing today to assure you that I fully intend to implement      and enforce the statutory requirements of the      Additionally, I want to provide you with an update on the      timeline, procedures, and criteria under which a State      Educational Agency (SEA) may submit a State plan, including a      consolidated State plan, to the States should      continue to follow the timeline for developing and submitting      their State plans to the Department for review and approval.       On November 29, 2016, the Department issued final      regulations regarding statewide accountability systems and      data reporting under Title I of the ESEA, as amended by the      ESSA, and the preparation of State plans, including      consolidated State plans. However, in accordance with the      memorandum of January 20, 2017, from the Assistant to the      President and Chief of Staff, titled ``Regulatory Freeze      Pending Review,'' published in the Federal Register on      January 24, 2017, the Department has delayed the effective      date of regulations concerning accountability and State plans      under the ESSA until March 21, 2017, to permit further review      for questions of law and policy that the regulations might      raise. Additionally, Congress is currently considering a      joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional      Review Act (CRA) (5 U.S.801808) to overturn these      regulations. If a resolution of disapproval is enacted, these      regulations ``shall have no force or effect.''       In a Dear Colleague Letter dated November 29, 2016, the      Department notified SEAs that it would accept consolidated      State plans on two dates: April 3 or September 18, 2017. The      Department also released a Consolidated State Plan Template      that States were required to use if they submit a      consolidated State plan. Due to the regulatory delay and      review, and the potential repeal of recent regulations by      Congress, the Department is currently reviewing the      regulatory requirements of consolidated State plans, as      reflected in the current template, to ensure that they      require only descriptions, information, assurances, and other      materials that are ``absolutely necessary'' for consideration      of a consolidated State plan, consistent with section      8302(b)(3) of the In doing so, the Department, in      consultation with SEAs as well as other State and local      stakeholders, will develop a revised template for      consolidated State plans that meets the ``absolutely      necessary'' requirement by March 13, 2017. The Department may      also consider allowing a State or group of States to work      together to develop a consolidated State plan template that      meets the Department's identified requirements through the      Council of Chief State School       The regulatory delay and review, and the potential repeal      of recent regulations by Congress, should not adversely      affect or delay the progress that States have already made in      developing their State plans and transitioning to the      The Department will be notifying States and the public of the      revised template once it becomes available. In the meantime,      States should continue their work in engaging with      stakeholders and developing their plans based on the      requirements under section 8302(b)(3) of the In doing      so, States may consider using the existing template as a      guide, as any revised template will not result in      descriptions, information, assurances, or other materials      that States will be required to provide other than those      already required under the The Department will still      accept consolidated State plans on April 3 or September 18,      2017.       For your reference, the following programs may be included      in a consolidated State plan:       Title I, part A: Improving Basic Programs Operated by Local      Educational Agencies;       Title I, part C: Education of Migratory Children;       Title I, part D: Prevention and Intervention Programs for      Children and Youth Who Are Neglected, Delinquent, or At-Risk;       Title II, part A: Supporting Effective Instruction;       Title III, part A: English Language Acquisition, Language      Enhancement, and Academic Achievement Act;       Title IV, part A: Student Support and Academic Enrichment      Grants;       Title IV, part B: 21st Century Community Learning Centers;      and       Title V, part B, subpart 2: Rural and Low-Income School            In addition, pursuant to ESEA section 8302(a)(1)(B), I am      designating the Education for Homeless Children and Youths      program under subtitle B of title VII of the McKinney-Vento      Homeless Assistance Act as a program that may be included in      an SEA's consolidated State plan.       I appreciate the hard work and thoughtful attention you are      giving to implementing the ESEA, as amended by the I      understand that a great deal of work has already gone into      the planning and preparation of your State plans, whether      that is a consolidated State plan or individual program      plans. One of my main priorities as Secretary is to ensure      that States and local school districts have clarity during      the early implementation of the law. Additionally, I want to      ensure that regulations comply with the requirements of the      law, provide the State and local flexibility that Congress      intended, and do not impose unnecessary burdens. In the near      future, the Department will provide more information on its      review of existing regulations, as well as additional      guidance and technical assistance.       We have a unique opportunity as we implement the I      look forward to working with you, districts, and parents to      ensure every child has the opportunity to pursue excellence      and achieve their hopes and dreams.           Sincerely,                                                      Betsy DeVos.[[Page S1670]]    ",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgS1666-2.txt,1695,ADJOURNMENT,2017.0,8.0,March
241,topic-id,1224,"So there is no confusion, let me clearly state what that timeline is. 1, States should continue to submit State accountability plans by the April or September 2017 deadlines. 2, States should continue to implement a State accountability system in the 2017-2018 school year. 3, States should continue to identify the lowest performing schools in need of comprehensive support and improvement by the beginning of the 2018-2019 school year.  To write these plans, States need simply to consult the law. The Every Student Succeeds Act requires States to submit a plan for peer review and approval by Secretary DeVos and the Education The Department is committed to working with States by providing technical assistance, issuing non-regulatory guidance and other support materials.  If questions arise, there are a variety of ways to answer the questions. The Department will continue to provide States with clarification on how to comply with the law through the use of non-regulatory guidance, ``Dear Colleague'' letters, frequently asked questions documents, webinars, phone calls, and in-person conferences. In other words, if there are any questions about how to comply with the new law, there are plenty of ways for Chief State School Officers and others to ask the U.Department of Education to provide the answers.  It is important to emphasize that this resolution does not in any way give the Education Secretary a path to creating a new Federal voucher program. Some of my friends on the other side of this debate have been resorting to scare tactics and alleging Secretary DeVos will use this opportunity to regulate into existence a mandate that State and local school districts adopt a school voucher program. The Secretary of Education does not have that power, and this Secretary of Education has said she does not want it. Secretary DeVos has repeatedly affirmed her opposition to federally mandating school choice, saying that she does ``not and will not advocate for any Federal mandates requiring vouchers. States should determine the mechanism of choice, if any.''  A school choice program cannot be unilaterally created by the U.Department of Only Congress could create a voucher program. I tried to do that on the floor of this Senate during the debate about fixing No Child Left I offered an amendment called Scholarships for Kids that would have allowed States to use existing Federal dollars to follow the children of low-income families to schools of their parents' choice. Senator Scott of South Carolina offered a similar amendment, but only 45 Senators voted for our proposals. If you pay attention around here, you know that the most important things usually take 60 votes to gain approval.  Also, the 2015 law that we passed actually includes provisions that would prohibit the Secretary from mandating, directing, or controlling a State, school district or school's allocation of State or local resources, and it bars the Department of Education from requiring States and districts to spend any funds or incur any costs not paid for under the law--for example, vouchers. Now I agree that previous Secretaries of Education have imposed their own personal, policy preferences on States and school districts. I opposed such mandates and worked against them. Congress writes the law, not the Secretary and not the bureaucracy.  Instead of using this scare tactic to rile up teachers and parents around the country, misleading them and confusing them about what the Secretary of Education might do, I would take that argument and turn it around. If Congress takes a stand here and now and says that this regulation exceeds the authority granted by Congress--the authority delegated to the Secretary of Education--because the Secretary imposed conditions on States not allowed by the law, then that means any current or future Secretary of Education would be similarly prevented from imposing their own conditions on  So there could be no legal method of forcing States to adopt a voucher program, unless Congress passes a new law. There could be no legal method of reinterpreting the Every Student Succeeds Act to impose the next good education idea--however well-intended--unless Congress acts first.  The suggestion has been made that this new law requires regulations. This regulation is not required by the law. The law does not specifically call for accountability regulations. The law allows for accountability regulations, but ``only to the extent that such regulations are necessary to ensure that there is compliance.'' So there is no requirement for this regulation. It is allowed, but it is not required.  Congress wrote prohibitions on the Secretary so that States would not be faced with a bunch of new mandates that ``add new requirements that are inconsistent with or outside the scope'' or ``add new criteria that are inconsistent with or outside the scope'' or are ``in excess of statutory authority granted to the Secretary.'' That is what Congress did. In the law, we laid out requirements for State plans. States can simply follow the law. A regulation isn't necessary.  Future Secretaries will still be able to write regulations on this subject. Under the Congressional Review Act, which is the procedure under which we are operating, if Congress overturns a regulation--as I hope it will in this case--the Department of Education is prevented from making final a new regulation that is ``substantially the same'' as the overturned regulation, unless Congress passes a new law to create an opportunity for that new regulation. But no court has defined what ``substantially the same'' means. But the commonsense interpretation of that is very simple: The Department simply can't turn right around and do the same thing Congress has just overturned. It could do something else by regulation, but it could not do precisely that.  So this is a question of whether we are going to restore the national school board that 85 Senators voted to reverse 15 months ago. And this is also a question of whether you believe that the U.Congress writes the law or the U.Department of Education writes the law. I believe that under article I of our Constitution, the U.Congress writes the law, and when signed by the President, then that is the law. The regulations must stay within it, and that is especially true when Congress has written explicit prohibitions about what a Secretary may do and may not do.  The remarkable consensus around the bill fixing No Child Left Behind was to reverse the trend to a national school board and restore to States, to classroom teachers, and to parents the decisions about what to do about their children in public schools. Teachers, Governors, school boards, and parents were all are fed up with Washington telling them so much about what to do with their children in 100,000 public schools.  So this regulation, which contravenes the law specifically, goes to the heart of the bill fixing No Child Left Behind, which received 85 votes here in the And this resolution to overturn that regulation upholds the law that received ``aye'' votes from those 85 I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution and to vote aye one more time.  I believe that overturning the regulation preserves the consensus and the compromise that we achieved when we enacted the law fixing No Child Left  I yield the floor.

268,topic-id,364,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the Tennessee General Assembly's proclamation recognizing the city of Kingsport, TN, centennial celebration.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          Kingsport Centennial       Whereas, it is fitting that the members of this legislative      body should pause in their deliberations to recognize and      honor those venerable communities of this State that are      marking special occasions in their histories; and       Whereas, the new city of Kingsport was incorporated in      1917, using the historical name of a nearby town that was      previously incorporated in 1822 but lost its charter after      the Civil War; and       Whereas, Kingsport is the first thoroughly diversified,      professionally planned, and privately financed city in      twentieth-century America; and       Whereas, Kingsport was the first city in Tennessee, and one      of the first in the nation, to adopt the ``model city      charter'' establishing a city manager form of government; and       Whereas, Kingsport was produced by the marriage of New      South philosophy and Progressivism, born at a time when      capitalists turned their attention to Southern Appalachia;      and       Whereas, the seeds planted in 1917 grew to become the      corporate headquarters of Eastman, a Fortune 300 company with      a significant global presence that has provided economic      opportunity for generations of Tennesseans; and       Whereas, early founders coined the term ``Kingsport      Spirit'' to describe the work ethic, can-do attitude, and      caring culture that are still widely prevalent today; and       Whereas, Kingsport continues to be a leader in innovation      and collaboration to redefine the economic future of      Tennessee and Tennesseans; and       Whereas, on this milestone occasion, it is fitting that we      recognize and honor the city of Kingsport and its residents:      Now, therefore,       I, Randy McNally, Speaker of the Senate of the One Hundred      Tenth General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, at the      request of and in conjunction with Senator Jon Lundberg, do      hereby proclaim that we honor and commend the fine citizens      of Kingsport as they celebrate their city's centennial and      extend to them our best wishes for continued success and      prosperity in the future.

627,topic-id,866,"Mr.President, in 2015, 85 U.Senators voted to fix the No Child Left Behind We reversed the trend to a national school board and began to restore decisions to classroom teachers, local school boards, and The Wall Street Journal said that it was ``the largest devolution of federal control to the States'' in 25 years.  The Department of Education regulation that we seek to overturn today does exactly the reverse. It begins to restore the national school board, and it begins to take away responsibility from classroom teachers, local school boards, and It does that in direct violation of the law we passed with 85 Senators voting for it 15 months ago.  The question before us today is not only whether we believe in a national school board or local school board, the question is whether we believe Congress ought to write the law or the U.Department of Education ought to write the law. Article I of the U.Constitution says that the U.Congress--we--should write the law.  The purpose of this resolution is to overturn a Department of Education regulation that in seven specific cases directly violates the Every Student Succeeds Act passed 15 months ago, and in 16 additional cases exceeds the authority allowed by the law. I spoke on this floor yesterday in detail of each of those 23 instances.  It is very unusual for the Congress to actually prohibit a department from regulating on an issue, but that is exactly what Congress did. The regulation we are seeking to overturn says to States: Ignore the law that 85 Senators passed 15 months ago. Ignore the law President Obama called a ``Christmas miracle.'' Ignore the law Governors, teachers, school boards, and superintendents all supported, and even ignore why they supported it, and listen instead to unelected bureaucrats at the U.Department of  This regulation issued by the Department of Education specifically does things or requires States to do things Congress said in our law that the Department cannot do; therefore, it violates the law.  For example, Congress said to the Department: You cannot tell States what to do about fixing low-performing schools in Alaska or Tennessee or your State; that is a State decision. But this regulation does that anyway.  Congress said to the Department: You cannot tell States exactly how to rate the public schools. But this regulation does that anyway.  This isn't a trivial matter. The remarkable consensus that developed in 2015 in support of the bill fixing No Child Left Behind was, as I said earlier, to reverse the trend toward a national school board and restore to States, classrooms, teachers, and communities decisions about what to do about schools. People are fed up with Washington telling teachers and schools and superintendents and States so much about what to do about their children in 100,000 public schools. So this regulation, which contravenes the law, goes to the heart of that consensus.  This resolution ensures that the law is implemented the way Congress wrote it. This resolution restores flexibility. This resolution preserves local decision making. This resolution scuttles new and burdensome reporting requirements that are in the Department regulation. This resolution ensures strong accountability for our schools, but it is State accountability. That is what we decided in our law.  Chaos? My distinguished friend from Washington said ``chaos.'' The Secretary of Education has announced that States may continue to follow the exact same timeline that the former Secretary, Secretary King, announced for sending in their State plans. If they have questions about how to do that, they can read the law, they can read the guidance, they can read frequently asked questions, or they can make a telephone call.  This resolution does not in any way give the Secretary new authority. In fact, it limits her authority and the authority of the next If we stand up and say we are not going to allow any Secretary of Education, whether it is Secretary King or Secretary DeVos, to, in 23 different instances in a regulation, contravene the authority granted in a law, that means we won't have Secretaries imposing their own policies. We will have Congress writing the law. This regulation--the one we are overturning is not required by the law. It is allowed by the law, but it is not required by the law. School districts can read the law.  Future Secretaries will be able to write regulations on this subject. Of course they will. When you overturn a regulation, it does mean the Secretary can't issue a new regulation that is substantially the same, but that simply means, in a commonsense way, the Secretary can't turn right around and do the same thing we just overturned.  This is a question of whether we are going to restore the national school board that 85 Senators voted to reverse. This is a question of whether you believe Congress writes the law or the U.Department of Education writes the law. This resolution upholds the law that received 85 votes from U. I urge my colleagues to vote aye. An ``aye'' vote preserves the bipartisan[[Page S1714]]consensus. A ``nay'' vote undermines the bipartisan consensus.  I yield the floor.  I yield back any remaining time.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgS1704-4.txt,1695,OBAMACARE,2017.0,9.0,March

I am filing my first piece of legislation today, and it is the Veterans, Employees and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2017.

Even physicians and nurses and folks who are hired to provide health care to our veterans, 100 percent of their time on union activity.  The law says their activity and time on union activities should be reasonable and in the best interest of the public.

526,topic-id,905,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for holding a Special Order on a topic that could not be more relevant than at this very time: the failures of  As a healthcare professional myself, the elected representative of over 700,000 constituents, and the grandfather of 13, I have a duty to see that access to medical care is more affordable for the welfare of my patients, for my constituents, and for the livelihood of my children and my grandchildren.  ObamaCare moved us away from the patient-centered affordable medical care--the traditional doctor-patient relationship--that we have enjoyed for well over a century. ObamaCare was designed by Washington bureaucrats who, unlike other Americans, are exempt from In the last 24 hours, I have heard from nearly 1,000 of my constituents who are overwhelmingly begging me to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with a bill that restores their healthcare freedom.  That is no surprise to me. I have heard from thousands of my constituents, including my own patients and my own family members, about how their premiums have skyrocketed and their deductibles have skyrocketed. They have health insurance, but they can't afford to access medical care because their deductibles are too high and their longtime family doctors are no longer accepted as providers in their new health insurance. They have to drive long distances to get to a new and different doctor in their medical plan. They have had medical care interrupted. Simply put, they want this ObamaCare nightmare to end.  A truck driver from Hardin County told me how she was forced to switch plans last year from the PPO that she wanted to keep to an HMO that she did not want. This has made it significantly more difficult for her to find a doctor to accept her insurance when she gets sick out on the road even though she pays much higher in premiums than she did last year for her  Melissa, who lives in Harris County, has the same story. Last January she had to switch her family to an HMO plan because of ObamaCare's limited choices in her community. This forced her family to leave their doctor of 20 years and their local pharmacy.  Melissa said: I have always been a very responsible American citizen, yet ObamaCare told me what kind of plan that I had to buy.                              {time}  2045  This is what ObamaCare does. It makes decisions for patients instead of the other way around. Brute Federal force.  The message is clear: ObamaCare's top down, Big Government approach is leading to higher premiums, less choice, and insufficient access for people in my district and all across this great land of ours. These higher out-of-pocket costs and premiums have priced too many Americans out of the insurance market altogether.  Melinda, who lives in the county next to me, had an ObamaCare plan last year and paid nearly $600 a month. She also had a $3,000 deductible. She had to spend over $10,000 before her health insurance plan paid for anything. Even with these high premiums, her insurance plan would not cover many of her asthma medicines or the cataract surgery that she desperately needs.  This year, when her premiums went up another $100, she dropped coverage altogether. Under ObamaCare, now she has lost affordable coverage, and she must pay a penalty, a tax.  Angela, from Harris County, actually decided to sign up for an ObamaCare plan after going uninsured for some time. Unfortunately, she soon realized that the cost vastly outweighed the benefits. So this year, she chose again to go without insurance. Now she pays the ObamaCare tax.  Others in my district don't want insurance coverage or only want catastrophic coverage. Yet, they are forced to pay expensive fines. Their freedom of choice is grossly limited.  Gina, a hardworking single mother and businessowner told me that she is now forced to use the little bit of money that she gets from her tax refund to pay the ObamaCare tax.  Charlie from Harris County says that he wants me to vote to repeal the individual mandate, stating that ObamaCare has forced him to buy a product that he doesn't want.  ObamaCare relies on force and coercion, but this is not the American way. If ObamaCare is so good, why did a larger percentage of Americans elect to pay the penalty than to take the subsidy for their coverage last year? The American people deserve much better.  I have got hundreds of similar stories, including those from a college student who couldn't work more than 27 hours a week over her Christmas break to earn money for school because the ObamaCare law imposed costly mandates for her employer if she does.  ObamaCare is in a death spiral and is imposing too much pain and suffering on the American people. Premiums have gone up, on average, by 25 percent across the country for enrollees this year alone. Some States, like Arizona, had a 116 percent increase in premiums.  Twenty-five percent of Americans have only one health insurer to choose from, and 50 percent of Americans live in areas with only two insurance providers. Folks, that is not a choice.  The complaints I am hearing now are at a fever pitch, and the American people are demanding a change now. We need a patient-centered healthcare system driven not by mandates and coercion, but by freedom and choice for my patients, for my constituents, for my family, and for all  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH2011.txt,2270,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,9.0,March

In 1976, John was elected to represent the 95th district in the Wisconsin State Legislature, where he ultimately served as assistant majority leader of the assembly.

314,topic-id,430,"Mr.Speaker, ObamaCare is collapsing. It is hurting more people than it is helping. It is forcing Americans to buy insurance they don't like, they don't need, and cannot afford. Premiums have increased by an average of 25 percent this year. Deductibles[[Page H1956]]are skyrocketing. Nearly 70 percent of U.counties have only two or fewer insurers offering plans on their State's exchanges. Thirty-four percent fewer doctors and other healthcare providers accept ObamaCare insurance compared to private insurance. Congress must act decisively to protect the American people from this failed law.  The American Health Care Act is an important step in this process. While not perfect, it moves us significantly in the right direction, which is why The Wall Street Journal says that the legislation would be ``the most consequential social policy reform since the welfare overhaul of 1996.''

315,topic-id,384,"Mr.Speaker, last month, a hospital worker in Paducah, Kentucky, applied for a loan of $38,500 to finance a manufactured home. He had an 8 percent down payment. His monthly income was $2,200 per month--plenty to cover the all-in housing costs of $670 per month. The payment for his own home would have been less than what he was spending on rent, but he was unable to get financing. He contacted his local banks and credit unions, but they did not finance manufactured homes.  This hospital worker from Kentucky can't get financing because of the very entity that was created to protect consumers--the Consumer Financial Protection That is right, the Federal Government is protecting people right out of homeownership. Consumers are protected so much they can't even purchase a manufactured home.  Lenders have stopped making manufactured housing loans because of the Dodd-Frank Act and CFPB regulations. Even worse, current owners are having to sell their homes below market value to cash buyers because potential buyers can't find financing.  And this isn't just anecdotal. Government statistics prove that CFPB rules have prevented credit-worthy consumers from accessing affordable financing that would allow them to purchase manufactured homes. According to 2014 HMDA data, manufactured home loan volume for loans under $75,000 decreased in the first year that these regulations went into effect.  This is proof that many lenders who were previously willing to make manufactured home loans are no longer capable of doing so under Dodd-These are exactly the kinds of top-down bureaucratic Federal regulations that my constituents in rural Kentucky are fed up with.  The CFPB has the authority to make adjustments to its requirements, but it has refused to act even when the data shows that consumers are being harmed.  A bipartisan group of Members of this body came together in the last Congress to do what the CFPB has refused to do. The House voted three times to make these changes so that people seeking to purchase manufactured homes would have access to financing.  I invite my colleagues to join me in this fight for consumers. Let's work together to make these changes to the CFPB and to their regulations and stop Federal bureaucrats from hurting modest income Americans who need access to affordable housing and deserve access to the American Dream of homeownership.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1955-3.txt,2238,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,9.0,March

612,topic-id,1356,"Mr.President, thank you for allowing me to engage in this colloquy with my friend and colleague, Senator Blunt from Missouri, who has been a real leader not just in the Senate but when he was in the House, traveling to all of the hospitals in Missouri and talking about the issues that concern the people there, as I do in Wyoming every weekend, going home and talking to people at home.  You may not know this, but I was the president of the Wyoming Medical Society and worked with something as the medical director called the Wyoming Health Fairs, where we brought low-cost health screening to people all around the Cowboy I had been going to these health fairs for years--when I was a doctor practicing medicine, when I was an orthopedic surgeon, and then when I was in the State senate and now as a U.Senator, to the point that I was at a health fair last Saturday in Buffalo,  People come to the fairs. They get their blood tested ahead of time so they can come and pick up the results and find out about their cholesterol and thyroid conditions and other issues. There are booths from the Heart Association and the Diabetes Society, depression screenings, all sorts of things. People there are very interested in their health.  When they see me as a doctor and knowing I am also a Senator, they want to talk about how the healthcare laws affected their lives. What I hear, story after story, is, you have to repeal this Many of them are people who had insurance that worked for them before the healthcare law was passed. When the healthcare law was passed, they were basically told that what they had, which worked for them and which they could afford, wasn't good enough for the government. The government said: No, you have to buy something else, something more expensive and not what you really need or want--which is getting into the fundamental problem here.  ObamaCare is collapsing all around the country. In Wyoming, as in many places--and I know Senator Blunt is in a situation where he has people whom he works with--there is not really a marketplace out there. It is a monopoly. There is only one choice.  We see our colleagues--Senator Alexander in his home State and Senator Corker--in some counties, there are no choices. Nobody is going to sell on the exchange. Even with the ObamaCare government subsidies, there is nothing to be bought.  We have to act now. The House is in the process of doing that. I think they have made an incredible effort, a fundamental change, a big step away from It is a monumental shift. What it does is it eliminates the things I hear about every weekend in Wyoming that people don't like about the healthcare law. It is the mandates. It is the taxes. It is the penalties they have to pay. People don't like that. They don't like the government saying: You have to buy a government-approved product, pay for it, whether or not you want it, whether or not it works for you.  We eliminate all of those things in what the House is debating now. What do we preserve? We preserve things that people know are important for them. People with preexisting conditions will still be protected. My wife Bobbi is a breast cancer survivor. She has been through operations. She has been through chemotherapy, radiation. As a doctor and as a husband, I know how important it is to protect people with preexisting conditions. There is also a limit on lifetime payments for people who get sick. Finally, we do want to keep and we do preserve for families--they can keep younger members of their family on their insurance, to the age of 26.  We eliminate the things people don't like. We preserve the things that are still so important for families all around the country. We work to get to the point where people can afford health insurance again.  It is interesting listening to the Democrats talking about how many people have been covered under What you find out is that coverage is empty. They may have an insurance card, but if the copays are so high and the deductibles are so high--$5,000, $6,000, $7,000--it is unusable. They say: I have ObamaCare, but I don't have the ability to get the care.  The issue of Medicaid, which was a failed system for a long time--it has been 50 years since Medicaid came into existence. There is a lot we need to do to modernize, update, streamline, strengthen, improve Medicaid in ways that actually help people.  I was in the State senate. Mr.President, I know you have a long history of involvement in your home Senator Blunt does as well with the activities there. What we have seen with Medicaid--and I saw it in the State legislature--if we had the freedom and the flexibility in the State to make the decisions about how that money was spent rather than dealing with all of these rules and regulations and one-size-fits-all that comes out of Washington, we always felt we could do a much better job of providing for the people of our Let the State make involved decisions for people on Medicaid, and we could help a lot more people for the same amount of money. It seemed there was so much waste and abuse in the whole Medicaid system.[[Page S1706]]  So much of what the House is doing is to try to get the power out of The question is, Whom do you want in control? Do you want the government in control or the people, and their care and the decisions being made at home?  I come to the floor today to thank my colleague from Missouri for his leadership on this from the days before he was even in the U.Senate, from his days in the House, and for his involvement. He was really one of the leaders in the House before coming to the Senate on this whole topic. He knows it well. He visits with people at home in his home State, as I do at home in mine.  I will be at home in Wyoming again this weekend, traveling around the State with different activities. I think one of the things we all do when we go home is visit with people and find out where they are going to be and what is on their minds, and that is the best way to do it.  I will be at a pancake breakfast. I will be at a Boy Scout event. I will be at a dinner at the Rocky Mountain Elk I will visit with a number of high school students. You hear people. You want to be there and listen to what they have to say. So I am looking forward to being there again this weekend, as I was last weekend--in Buffalo last weekend for the health fair in Rawlins--for an event to hear how what Washington does impacts their lives.  What we have seen over the past 6 or 7 years since ObamaCare became law is that decisions being made in Washington hurt a lot of people in Wyoming, hurt people who were patients of mine when I was actively practicing as a surgeon. The regulations, the one-size-fits-all in terms of the impact on the hospitals, the healthcare providers, and the patients--we know these people need relief. They need to be rescued from this collapsing ObamaCare healthcare law. And we want to repair the damage. We can't get it all done overnight. It is not possible. It took us about 6\1/2\, 7 years to get to this point. President Trump has only been in office for about 7 weeks. You can't get it done overnight.

Despite its good intentions, the law came with onerous requirements that did not work for many communities, including my own.  When I was the superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, there were few experiences more miserable than dealing with the Federal bureaucracy and their auditors, who would make judgments that were driven more by compliance than by the needs of our children. Somebody who understood that well was Margaret Spellings, who was, at that time, the Secretary of Education for this country. We owe her a debt of gratitude for the work that she did as I, personally, owe her a debt of gratitude for the waivers she granted to the Denver Public Schools, when I was superintendent, to allow us to focus not on the compliance of rules that made no sense but to focus on the kids in this school district.  I know that was the experience of educators all over America, which is why, in 2015, the Senate came together--and I am a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--to replace No Child Left Finally, 8 years too late--8 years after it was supposed to be reauthorized--under the leadership of Chairman Alexander and Senator Murray, we were able to pass the Every Student Succeeds The bill earned overwhelming support. The country was ready for a change.  The law brought much needed reform to the Federal Government's role in education by giving States far more flexibility for innovation, while preserving important, core accountability protections, which are critical for those of us who are interested in the civil rights mission of the Federal It was a rare example of bipartisan cooperation and smart policymaking in Washington, In fact, I cannot think of another case in which we received that much bipartisan support on such a difficult issue in the time that I have been here.  The way I see it--and I say this as a parent of three children in the public schools in Denver and as a former school superintendent--the only reason for Washington to be involved at all in public education is with regard to civil rights, and that is an important reason for us to be involved. All kids should have access to great schools regardless of where they live, what ZIP Codes they are born into, or who their parents are.  With Every Student Succeeds, the new bill, States will design their own accountability systems and interventions when schools struggle. That is a big change from No Child Left It is a welcome change. The law shifts enormous responsibility from the Federal Government to States and transforms over 15 years of education policy. The law is not perfect, but it represents one of the most significant changes and, I would say, importantly, one of the most significant retrenchments of the Federal Government in domestic policy in modern American history. That should be acknowledged. It should be welcomed.  As States shift to the new model, many are asking for clarification about how to implement the law and make the most of greater State control over education. That is why the Department of Education issued rules last year to provide much needed clarity, stability, and flexibility to States, making it easier for them to transition from the broken system that we had under No Child Left Behind to the newer and more State-driven approach that we now have.  Now some in Congress have targeted this regulation. They have invoked the Congressional Review Act to repeal the rules wholesale. That would be so foolish after the progress we have made and the direction in which we have headed. It would tie the hands of the Department of Education from properly implementing the law and delay much needed flexibility and accountability for the It would be a disservice to students, to educators, to teachers, and to principals all across the country, and it would undermine the implementation of the entire law.  As I have said many times--and I have learned this the hard way--when it comes to education policy in particular, bad implementation can be just as harmful--even more harmful--than bad policy.  Repealing the rules would also sow confusion among States about when they must comply with this new law. The Every Student Succeeds Act includes a timeline for transition so that States have time to plan, but many specifics of that transition are unclear. The Department of Education's rules clarify that timeline and give States the flexibility with which to implement some parts of the law later than others.  Why would we want to take that away? Repealing the regulation would throw all of that away. Will schools have to fully comply with all aspects of the law by 2018, or is there some flexibility to stagger its implementation?  Beyond the timeline, striking the regulation wholesale would also throw States into limbo by creating uncertainty over other important parts of the law. For example, the act includes a major change in how the law applies to English learners, which is one of the fastest growing populations in our schools throughout the country and now represents nearly 1 out of 10 students nationwide. In the new law, many provisions concerning English learners moved from title III to title  As States undertake this shift, they need clarity on how to design accountability systems that include English learners in order to ensure kids do not fall through the cracks. For example, the rules make it clear that States can create proficiency goals for different groups of English learners rather than creating a uniform goal for all students.  Striking the rules would also undermine core elements of the law, like the requirement for States to report on school spending and resources. The regulation clarifies that States must create a uniform procedure for this reporting, which is vital for transparency around funding and investments and, I would say, is vital with respect to the civil rights mission of this law.  It is easy to publish numbers. Believe me; I have seen it. It is a lot harder to publish numbers that are accurate and meaningful by which parents and kids can make informed decisions.  Right now, as we sit here, States are developing accountability plans under the Every Student Succeeds Act, and they are drawing on the current rules to guide that process. A change now could delay the submission and approval process for these plans. States will not know whether to use different templates or the ones they already have. They do not know if they have to restart public comment periods, delaying submissions and throwing the entire timeline into uncertainty. There is no reason we should be doing this to our schools, our teachers, and our principals.  Repealing the rules would also suppress innovation and limit flexibility. I know that is the clarion call on this floor a lot of the time. In this case, people are going to get the opposite of what they expect. Flexibility is central to the Every Student Succeeds I fought for many aspects of the law in order to give States the ability to design their own accountability systems, and I believe in that. Yet, in the absence of express, legally binding guidance from the Department of Education about where and how they can experiment, States will respond to that uncertainty by embracing the safest course. I saw that all the time when I was superintendent.  States stand to lose a lot of money if they are not in compliance, particularly $15 billion in annual title I funds for students who live in poverty. They do not want to risk it. It may seem odd, but we need these rules in order to ensure flexibility and innovation for Nonbinding guidance is not enough.[[Page S1711]]  Finally, if we use the Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule--a very, very blunt instrument--the Department of Education will not be able to publish any rule that is ``substantially the same'' unless the Congress passes a new law--the Congress that took 8 years longer than it was supposed to in order to reauthorize No Child Left Behind the last time. This could mean that the Department of Education--and this is something people here need to pay attention to if they care about civil rights--would not be able to issue any new regulation to provide clarity for States as they transition to the new law. They would be left completely in the lurch, potentially hamstringing education policy across the country for a decade.  What is a shame about it is that there is absolutely no reason to do this. If the rules need to be changed, we should work together to improve them, but a CRA is not the correct policy tool. That is especially true when passing it would prevent all future regulation on core aspects of the Every Student Succeeds  There has to be a better way for us to come together than this. I agree with the President that education is the civil rights issue of our time, and we should defeat this vote on this  I yield the floor.

227,topic-id,1656,"Mr.President, even in its early days, this administration has embarked on a course of foreign private interest entanglements and conflicts of interest that are truly staggering.  Just this morning, the Associated Press reported that China has granted preliminary approval for 38 new trademarks. They are Trump trademarks, paving the way for the President, Donald Trump, and his family to ``potentially develop a host of branded businesses from hotels to golf clubs to bodyguard and concierge services.''  These reports are contained in public documents. All but three are in the President's own name. The AP report also quotes an official as saying that ``for all these marks to sail through so quickly and cleanly, with no similar marks . . . no issues with specification, boy, it's weird.''  Now, the speculation is that these trademarks could not have been issued without approval by the ruling Communist Party, that hierarchy had to be involved, and that awareness had to involve their approval for these intellectual property interests. The benefit is to the President through his private interests. The fact is, the President of the United States should be beholden only to the American people, not to personal profit, but in fact these trademarks raise the specter that the President possibly is beholden to the approving officials in China even more than to the American people. That is an issue that merits investigation. Like so many issues arising in this young administration, the question is, Who will do that investigation?  The lawyers in China representing Donald Trump applied for these trademarks in April of 2016, even as then-Candidate Donald Trump railed against China at his campaign rallies, criticizing Chinese currency manipulation, its intellectual property theft, its attraction of jobs from this country to theirs. The question arises, What has he done about those issues? In fact, China continues to manipulate its currency, continues to attract jobs from this country, and continues its aggressive policies in the area around that country.  The question is whether an inquiry is appropriate--which certainly it seems to be--and who will supervise it. It is the same question that arises with respect to Russian interference in our electoral system and the potential ties between Trump team officials and the Russians who committed those acts. Those ties have been established by evidence that is now incontrovertible because it is admitted by the officials themselves, now Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former National Security Advisor Michael  It is now a matter of factual record that Russia engaged in a series of deliberate cyber attacks in order to carry out an unprecedented plot to undermine the 2016 elections with the goal of assisting Donald The growing body of evidence clearly and unmistakably indicates that Trump campaign officials were in contact with Russia during the election. These deeply troubling claims of coordination with a foreign government to influence an American election certainly deserve exacting scrutiny and investigation, and the more we learn, the more troubled we become. In fact, we are rapidly careening toward a constitutional crisis. These recent revelations about Vladimir Putin's government and former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resulted in his resignation. There have also been details about contact between Attorney General Sessions, our former colleague, and the Russian Ambassador that have caused his recusal from all inquiries of that subject matter.  I believe a special prosecutor must be appointed to investigate the Russian interference and meddling in our election, the massive cyber attack misinformation, and propaganda campaign conducted to subvert that election. The potential for cooperation, condoning,[[Page S1661]]connecting between the Trump officials and Russia certainly merits investigation as well. Without reaching conclusions, the special prosecutor ought to investigate and then reach a conclusion. His conclusion should be based on fact, not surmise or speculation.  For weeks, I have called for a special prosecutor to investigate possible ties between members of the Trump campaign, the Trump transition, and the Trump White House to Russian officials who sought to interfere with our election. I support the Intelligence Committee in conducting its investigation. I would favor the appointment of a special commission or a select committee of the Congress to do factfinding, make reports and recommendations in a fully transparent way, but only a special prosecutor can take action based on criminal intent. Only a special prosecutor can pursue violations of criminal law, to not only investigate but also bring charges and seek appropriate punishment and remedy. Only the Deputy Attorney General of the United States can appoint a special prosecutor because the Attorney General has recused himself--in other words, taken himself out of all of the areas of this subject matter. That is why I asked yesterday that the nominee for Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, commit to appoint a special prosecutor.  His answer to me was that he wishes to wait until he is approved by the Senate--assuming his confirmation occurs--to decide whether to appoint a special prosecutor. He claims he needs to familiarize himself with the facts and circumstances of any ongoing investigation before he can make a decision. With all due respect, the facts he needs to know are already established. They are already a matter of public record. They are already known to the American public. There is an investigation ongoing by the FBI--and with good reason--into Russian meddling in our elections, this massive campaign of misinformation and cyber attack that they purposefully conducted to influence the outcome of our election.  We know the Justice Department must investigate and pursue the ongoing investigation, wherever the evidence leads. Part of that evidence inevitably will be meetings that were conducted by his boss, the Attorney General of United States, Jeff Sessions, which is why the Attorney General has recused himself--because he could be involved in that investigation as a witness, as a subject, even possibly as a target, as could the President himself.  To close that investigation, the Deputy Attorney General, or whoever is conducting it, needs to question the Attorney General of the United To conduct that investigation, that questioning must occur. So the Deputy Attorney General would be expected to be investigating his boss. If he decides to conduct that investigation himself, he must appoint a special prosecutor to establish the independence of that inquiry, to assure that in reality and in appearance the American public is assured that the investigation is independent, objective, impartial, vigorous, and fair.  The facts that warrant a special prosecutor are already known and they are already a matter of public record. That is why I believe he must commit himself now, before his confirmation--in fact, as a condition of his confirmation--to take that action, which preserves the credibility and public confidence in the Department of Justice that he observed very eloquently in his confirmation hearing as one of his central objectives.  There is a lot of precedent for this step. The most prominent one perhaps is Elliot Richardson, when he was the Attorney General designee. He was requested by the Judiciary Committee, at that time, to make the same kind of commitment--and he did. He kept his promise. He appointed Archibald Cox to be special prosecutor, and the Watergate scandal was appropriately investigated and pursued. That example--when Elliot Richardson had enough facts, just as Rod Rosenstein does now--ought to be the lodestar here. It ought to be the model for his commitment to appointing a special prosecutor.  The simple fact is, Rod Rosenstein, like Elliot Richardson, knows everything he needs to know to be sure a special prosecutor is necessary, and especially because he is a career prosecutor with a distinguished record, and because he has that intellect and integrity that would qualify him probably to be confirmed, he should know it is the right thing to do. Maybe he will do it if he is confirmed, but it would serve the interests of justice, and it would help to sustain and enhance the trust and public confidence in the Department of Justice if he were to do it now, as Elliot Richardson did many years ago.  We live in an extraordinary time. The conflicts of interest and foreign entanglements that threaten our Nation, beginning at the very top of this administration, impose a unique mandate on the Department of The recusal of the Attorney General from this investigation indicates that leadership and integrity are necessary at every level as never before. That is why, in this extraordinary time, I urge the Deputy Attorney General nominee, Rod Rosenstein, to do the right thing and make sure there is an investigation that is independent and vigorous, as well as fair and full; that we know all of the facts eventually and that action is taken appropriately to deal with the Russian interference in our election, the potential ties between the Trump administration--before and after the election--in those improper interferences by the Russians in our election, and that the danger of coverup, indicated by the potential false statements made by Jeff Sessions before the Judiciary Committee and Michael Flynn elsewhere, be stopped before it starts. Only a special prosecutor can provide the unbiased and fair answers that are so urgently needed.  The American people deserve an explanation. They deserve an explanation for the trademarks that have been issued to Donald Trump in They deserve an explanation by a special prosecutor on Russian meddling and Trump ties to that meddling. Whether the independent and special prosecutor broadens the scope of that investigation to include the entanglements or conflicts of interest involving China is a question that will have to be addressed by that official, but this much we know now. We are rapidly careening toward a constitutional crisis, a crisis of credibility as well as legal challenges. The historic opportunity and obligation this nominee owes the country cannot be avoided.

What I see and I think what you mentioned you see is that people who have coverage often don't have access. It doesn't matter if you have coverage if there is nowhere to go or you feel like there is nowhere to go. I continually hear that from people who have the high-deductible policies. That means they are discouraged from spending the first $6,000 or $8,000 that is out-of-pocket spending.  Many people I talk to say they have not only more expensive coverage than they had before but less coverage than they had before and are reluctant to spend the out-of-pocket dollars that used to be covered by the insurance that didn't meet the new standards but met their family needs. I am wondering if the Senator is seeing that same thing.  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgS1704-4.txt,1464,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1301, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE",2017.0,9.0,March
615,topic-id,2636,"It is.  Mr.President, I think you are seeing that too. The critical needs hospitals, the critical access hospitals--the only hospitals available--are often also hospitals that disproportionately have people who are not insured or people who are of low income who aren't on any government program. What has happened in those hospitals and in the ones that have been able to stay open is that they have often had to go outside the traditional community support they had and associate with a bigger hospital.  That may turn out to have been a good thing, but one of the basics of the President's healthcare plan was--which we now know is a highly unlikely result--that everybody will have coverage. In a world where everybody has coverage, you don't have the disproportionate share of problems that inner-city hospitals, like the Truman Hospital in Kansas City, MO, have, or rural hospitals, like the dozen-plus that we have in our State that are critical needs hospitals. Those things don't happen. If this had worked the way the President thought it would work--and Democrats, when they, all on their own, passed this bill 7 years ago--we wouldn't be having the problems we see now: the havoc in our healthcare system--leaving Missourians, people from Alabama, people from Wyoming, people from all over the country with higher costs, with fewer options, and with more uncertainty.  How many times did the President say, when he was supporting this just after the election and during his election 8 years ago--President Obama kept making the case--that Americans would be able to keep the plans they like. They would be able to keep the doctors they like. Now we act as if those pledges--well, everybody knows--couldn't happen.  When the bill was passed, everybody said that was what would happen. Remember this: If you have a doctor you like, you will be able to keep the doctor you like, period. If you have an insurance plan you like, you will be able to keep the insurance plan you like, period. The period should have at least been a question mark.  As it turned out, it was not true. People didn't get to do that. According to the advocates of the law we have now, there would be more choices, there would be more competition, and there would be lower costs, and none of those things happened. Those things just did not happen.  In Missouri, several insurers have totally pulled out of the individual market. We have 115 counties. Last year, they all had at least two companies willing to offer insurance. This year, we have 97 counties where only one company is willing to offer insurance. I have always thought we needed to expand that insurance marketplace, not reduce it--and buying across State lines and buying an insurance product you thought met the needs of you and your family, rather than the needs somebody at the Department of Health and Human Services thought they knew was better for your family, rather than what you would know was better for your family. But instead, we have done just the opposite. Instead of expanding the marketplace, expanding choices--somehow ObamaCare was designed in a way that actually prevents this--instead of being able to buy across State lines, now you can't buy across county lines. We have 97 of our 115 counties where only one insurance company is willing to be part of the process on the individual market. That one insurance company, rightly, was able to go and say: Here is what we are going to charge. If you don't want to accept that, State insurance regulator, we won't offer the product.  Families one year to the next are often facing 40 percent increases. I[[Page S1707]]think the average is a 25-percent increase year over year. Many people are paying more than 100 percent, double what they paid when this started. The rate hikes have gone up and the coverage has gone down.  The average deductible in the bronze plan, the third plan down, is $6,000 for an individual and $12,000 for a family. That is before anybody helps you at all. So you have insurance that you are paying for every month, but if you get sick, you have to pay $6,000 for each individual and more than twice that if two people in your family have healthcare problems before anybody does anything. For most families in our country, and certainly most families in Missouri, that is like not having insurance at all.  Even in the silver plan, the average deductible is $3,500. That is an increase of 15 percent of the deductible over last year. Every year, the price goes up and the deductible goes up. All of us hear from families, individuals, and businesses who say: We can't continue to do this. Mark from Blue Springs told me: ``There is nothing affordable'' about the Affordable Care When it comes to what he and his family are facing, he said that before ObamaCare, they paid $246 a month to cover five people with coverage they thought met their needs. Now the premium is $800 a month. There are only three people. Only one child and he and his wife are still at home. For five people, they were paying $246 a month. Now they are paying $800 a month. He says:       These days, when we go to the doctor, nothing is covered.      We still have to pay for that visit 100 percent out of      pocket. In other words, we pay $800 per month only to be told      that none of the office visit or procedure is covered until      the $8,000 deductible is met.  He says: Really, what are we going to do? They have taken insurance away from us, and the promise that was made over and over was never kept.  Dave, a small business owner in Columbia, says his premiums have more than doubled at the same time that his business has been forced to continually raise deductibles and seriously reduce benefits so that people could continue to have insurance at work. As he puts it, President Obama's healthcare plan ``is far from affordable.''  Let's see. That is exactly what Mark said: There is nothing affordable about the Affordable Care And Dave's increase this year over last year was 40 percent. At some point, Dave and lots of other employers are deciding that this isn't working.  We have a group in our State that many other States have, the Older Adults Transportation It is a nonprofit that provides transportation services for older adults. The title is actually pretty descriptive of what they do. The cost has gone up over half a million dollars. The paperwork is ``so complex and so cumbersome,'' the executive director told me, that they have to spend additional money to hire a consultant just to fill out the forms to have the insurance they used to have. Then the insurance doesn't keep up with what they need and what their drivers need. They have to begin to cut services back to have insurance that even begins to resemble what they had before the Affordable Care Talk about people being left out. There are older adults in Missouri who don't have the same access to transportation they had before the Affordable Care  President Trump, in his address to the Congress just a few days ago, reiterated his commitment to step-by-step healthcare reforms ``that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and, at the same time, provide better healthcare.''  I was encouraged that he decided to back the expansion of health savings accounts. That allows everybody in the country to put more of their pretax dollars into portable health savings accounts that go with them wherever they go from job to job. You still have that health savings account. The plan that the House of Representatives is debating right now expands the way you can use that health savings account, as well as expands how much money you can put into that account.  Most importantly, the President reaffirmed the need to ensure coverage for all preexisting conditions. I have always supported providing insurance options for people who have preexisting conditions. I sponsored the legislation that allowed young people to stay on their parents' healthcare until they were 25. The people drafting the Affordable Care Act put exactly that language in the bill and raised the age to 26. Three million people every year have access to insurance because of a simple choice like that. I think that bill was four pages, with lots of white space, and 3 million people get insurance every year who wouldn't have insurance otherwise, or at least traditionally hadn't had insurance otherwise at no cost to taxpayers. Frankly, there is not much cost to anybody because those young, healthy people are just establishing themselves, just leaving home, just going off mom and dad's insurance, and they thought they could get by without it for a while. In all likelihood, they were right. They are not a hard group to insure.  That is the kind of thing we ought to think about, where we figure out how to increase access to coverage without taxpayers having to bear the load for somebody else's healthcare, if there is another way to do it. We want to be sure that, whether it is keeping them on your family insurance, staying on your family insurance longer, or having no lifetime cap--that was a legitimate problem that many people faced--they would have their insurance. They would pay for it forever, and then when they faced a catastrophic situation, at some point the insurance companies in earlier times were able to say: You reached your lifetime cap; so we are now canceling your policy. That wouldn't happen under the plan we are discussing.  The landscape for healthcare--and what families and individuals have to deal with--has dramatically changed. Because of that, it is going to be more challenging to go forward than it would have if we had done the same half-dozen commonsense things just a few years ago. This is no 2,700-page response or substitute for the 2,700-page ObamaCare bill.  This is an easily understood way to go forward that eliminates taxes that everybody is now paying on their healthcare. There is a medical device tax. There is an over-the-counter medication tax for things you don't have a prescription for. There is a special tax on those over-the-counter medicines in the current law. Those will be repealed. The medical device tax would be gone, would be phased out. The over-the-counter tax on medicines would be phased out and the tax on prescription drugs. If you buy over the counter, you pay a tax, but if you get a prescription, you also pay a tax. There may be a place in here where you pay a tax for just paying a tax. But the medical device tax is gone. The over-the-counter medication tax is gone. The tax on prescription drugs would be gone. The tax on health insurance policies would be gone. When you get health insurance, there is a tax to be paid under ObamaCare on that, as well. The Medicare tax increase would be gone. The tanning bed tax would be gone. The net investment tax would be gone. The health insurance tax would be gone. It is about a trillion dollars in taxes that were added back into the system. By the way, if you have some kind of coverage for a medical device, you are paying for the coverage. You are paying a tax on the coverage, if you are lucky enough that the medical device is covered, if your insurance company pays that. Of course, they pay the tax on that, and, then, you have paid it in the premium that you had to pay to cover the tax. We have to step back here and try to do the right thing.  My friend from Illinois earlier mentioned that there traditionally were five different community ratings of people of different ages based on the healthcare costs that they might have, but the ObamaCare bill said: No, you can only have three ratings. The oldest, sickest, most likely to use health coverage can't pay more than three times what the youngest, healthiest people pay, which is another reason, if you are young and healthy, not to get insurance.  Things that were put into this raised costs for so many people. Then what happens? Then people say: Well, why is it that we don't have enough people covered? They say: The real problem with ObamaCare is that there weren't enough young, healthy people who bought coverage on their own. It was designed into the plan to make it very unattractive, if you are young and healthy, to buy coverage because suddenly coverage for that population was in relationship to all other people[[Page S1708]]being covered, higher than it had ever been before.  With the bill the House is debating now, we would restore the disproportionate share payments to inner-city hospitals, to rural hospitals, where you have to treat more people who are either on a government program that doesn't pay very well or more people who don't have any coverage at all. That was eliminated in  We now realize that world is a world that doesn't exist, a world in which everybody who goes to the hospital, everybody who goes to see the doctor, everybody who seeks healthcare has insurance coverage.  Who takes care of that?  This bill, being debated right now in the House, looks at that again and says: Let's get back to where we are actually helping those institutions that are particularly focused on underserved populations, that are particularly focused on doing that.  We have an opportunity here, basically in three different steps, to do what needs to be done. The first two steps are critical. One is to set an end date for the chaotic situation we are in now, to do as much as we can with budget tools to set a framework for how we move on and get out of these incredibly devastating budget situations for both the Federal Government and for families. The second is to let the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who was confirmed by the Senate just a few weeks ago, look at the over 1,400 times in ObamaCare where that Department can create regulations that either make it harder or make it easier for people to comply with the law. One of the most important decisions, if you are an insurance company and you are offering a healthcare product, is deciding what classifies as an acceptable product, what is the basic criteria you can offer people and still be offering healthcare insurance. So we are at an important moment.  There is no doubt that the current situation is collapsing, that healthcare providers are providing healthcare to people who don't have coverage, who are not protected by programs they were previously protected by. The people who used to have a lot of choices in insurance, in many cases, now have only one choice, and it is not a choice they can afford, and when they do pay for it, they feel like they are living without insurance at all.  So we are doing what needs to be done. We have to do what we can to get back to where people can buy the insurance they think meets their needs, insurance they can afford and enables them to see the doctor they want to see. A patient-centered system, instead of a government-centered system, is the answer here. We have to get this job done, and I believe we will.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

Dewey and Virginia Riehn have both held significant leadership roles within the veterans' community, and their decision to turn over that role to the next generation will be felt by the numerous lives they have impacted.  Dewey Riehn is a retired chief warrant officer of the U.Army, originally from Jackson, He married his beloved wife, Virginia, on August 24, 1958. Enlisting in the Marine Corps in 1956, Dewey transitioned to the Army, where he served as a counterintelligence agent, seeing multiple tours in He and Virginia were stationed overseas on multiple occasions. After retiring from the Army, he transitioned to the Missouri Department of Social Services, where he successfully completed a 24-year career as a child abuse investigator.  From the time Dewey retired from military service, he and Virginia have both been pinnacle figures within the Veterans of Foreign Wars, American Legion, and Vietnam Veterans of Dewey has testified on numerous occasions before the Missouri Legislature, ultimately helping legislators shape State and national policy.

677,topic-id,785,"Mr.President, when President Trump began his campaign for the White House, he made national security and, in particular, homeland security a cornerstone of his platform. His calls to secure the border to keep terrorists off U.soil and to protect our communities struck a chord with a large majority of Americans who for years felt that Washington ignored their very real concerns about our porous borders and broken immigration system.  As expected, the President moved quickly to deliver on his promises to fix this broken system. This week, the Trump administration rolled out a revised version of this Executive order aimed at restoring confidence in the procedures we have used to vet refugees fleeing from nations that are known to harbor radical and violent extremists.  The revised version appears to have benefited from the engagement of the President's Cabinet, especially the key input of Homeland Security Secretary This valuable input underscores how important it is for the President to have his team in place to govern effectively.  Senate Democrats have slowed the confirmation process at every turn. I encourage them to abandon the political games so we can quickly fill the remaining vacancies that require Senate confirmation.  It is vital that every affected agency is engaged in these types of decisions. That isn't possible if the Senate is failing to do its duty to confirm the President's nominees. Congress has many problems to tackle, but protecting our Nation is at the top of that list. That requires we work together to govern.  It also requires we take a step back from the heated rhetoric and have honest conversations. Taking the fundamental steps to protect our homeland does not diminish the fact that we are a welcoming nation that strives to help the vulnerable.  It is no secret that ISIS and other volatile extremists want to exploit our Nation's generosity and welcoming spirit to sneak terrorists onto American soil. This plan has worked well in ISIS believes it can work here as well. We can, and must, take reasonable measures to prevent that.  It is reasonable, responsible, in fact, to put a pause on accepting refugees from these nations in order to fix the flaws in the process and instill confidence in the system. The revised order removes Iraq from the list of countries. That is a move in the right direction. It shows that the Iraqis have taken the right steps in agreeing to increase their cooperation with us, and effecting positive outcomes in our relations with these nations is what this pause is all about.[[Page S1737]]  Four of the countries on this list don't even have a U.So you can understand how difficult it is to get a complete picture of the refugees seeking asylum from those countries when we don't even have a means by which to communicate.  Once the President's Executive order goes into effect, every country will be evaluated within 20 days. If a country comes up short of where it needs to be, it will have 50 days to fix the failures and communications with us.  The reasonable measures we are taking to reduce this threat in no way run counter to the ideals our Nation is built upon. We can be proud of the resources the United States has provided to support those fleeing persecution in war-torn I have visited the refugee camps we support in Jordan and Our commitment to their well-being is strong. The rhetoric doesn't match the realities when it comes to this issue.  The administration's efforts to secure our borders has been met with similar hyperbole. Again, there is nothing unreasonable about ensuring that we know who is coming into our We are a nation of immigrants and must remain welcoming to those who want to achieve the American dream. We should be proud of our record to naturalize those who immigrate here legally. We naturalize more new citizens per year than the rest of the world combined. Enforcing the law, ensuring the safety and security of our Nation, will not change our commitment to being a welcoming society to those who seek a better life.  But you can't create policies to secure our homeland while wearing rose-colored glasses. There are terrorists seeking to exploit our good graces so they can attack us here at home. This is not a scare tactic; this is reality, and we have to root our policies in reality.

875,topic-id,509,"Madam President, I rise today to honor Jim Rollins, an Arkansan who has dedicated his life to public education. Rollins is the superintendent of the Springdale, AR, public schools, where he has served since 1980.  Rollins started his career in the classroom as a science teacher in North Little Since that time, he has consistently sought to provide students with a quality education. The work he has done leading Springdale's public schools speaks for itself.  Rollins' motto when it comes to education is ``Teach them all.'' This worthy goal has been especially important in Springdale, where enrollment has grown from 5,000 students when Rollins arrived in 1980 to nearly 23,000 students today. Many of these students are part of immigrant families where English is not their first language. More than 55 percent of the district's students are not proficient in English, and around 75 percent qualify for free and reduced lunches. As you might imagine, this has presented unique challenges to educators in  In order to meet these challenges and ensure that the school system is doing everything it can to provide these students with a great education, Rollins has introduced innovative programs that cater to immigrant families, including the unique Marshallese population in  As superintendent, Rollins has fostered an atmosphere where families feel welcome and understood so that parents, students, teachers, and administrators are working together to create a supportive environment that leads to growth in the classroom. In the spirit of engaging the entire family in the education of every child, Rollins has helped lead an effort in Springdale's schools to promote English as a second language instruction for students and parents.  This year, Rollins is once again being recognized for his outstanding efforts in the achievements Springdale public schools have enjoyed under his leadership. Rollins is being recognized as one of Education Week's 2017 Leaders to Learn From, which highlights forward-thinking district leaders who are working to enact and inspire change in our Nation's public schools. Rollins is certainly very deserving of this honor. You only need to look at the work he has done over several decades to understand that he has dedicated his professional life to improving public education outcomes for every child in the Springdale education district. The teachers and parents in his district have also had wonderful things to say about Rollins and his leadership in their community. I am so pleased that his trailblazing work in Springdale public schools is being noticed by national education organizations.[[Page S1765]]  Rollins has made Arkansas very proud, and we are so grateful for his leadership and commitment to educating children no matter where they come from or their station in life.

225,topic-id,564,"Madam President, I join literally millions of Ohioans and tens of millions of Americans in my concern about what the House of Representatives is trying to do to our healthcare laws and our healthcare system.  I leave just one statistic with my colleagues in the Senate, and that is that in my State alone, there are 200,000 people who are now under treatment for opioid addiction, and they are able to get this comprehensive treatment because they have insurance under the Affordable Care  The legislation apparently coming out of the House of Representatives, even though we do not know how much it costs, is a big tax cut for the wealthy. We do not know how much it costs because they are moving so quickly. It was under wraps, and now they are moving it so quickly that the Congressional Budget Office has not even had time to look at it and understand what it costs, nor has it been able to tell us how many of the 22 million Americans who have insurance under the Affordable Care Act will lose their insurance. They want to move so fast that they are not even answering the basic questions of how much it costs--a lot; how much it is going to add to the deficit--a whole lot, but they will not be specific; and how many people will lose their insurance.  As I said, today 200,000 Ohioans are getting treatment for opioid addiction under the Affordable Care Most of them--we think at least half, but tens of thousands of them will lose their treatment just like that, right in the middle of their addiction treatment. What does society gain by that, other than some Republican talking points, when people chanted for 6 years ``repeal and replace ObamaCare,'' never having any idea how they were going to replace it--still don't--to do it right and continue that effort.  Finally, there is the hypocrisy of this, where Members of Congress in the House and in the Senate enjoy taxpayer-financed health insurance. People in this body--most of the 100 Senators and most of the 435 Congressmen and Congresswomen--have health insurance provided by taxpayers, yet they want to take insurance away from millions of These are people who have jobs. They are millions of Americans who have jobs, who are making relatively low wages. Some of them may be holding two or three part-time jobs. They make low wages. They have no health insurance provided at their job. People in Congress who have taxpayer-funded health insurance are taking their insurance away, stripping them of that insurance. How morally repugnant that is. How hypocritical that is. Yet they move along their merry way.  We should defeat these efforts. We should continue to make improvements in the Affordable Care Act, but not wholesale destruction that will throw hundreds of thousands of Ohioans off of the insurance they have.  I will close with this. My Republican Governor has admonished his Republican colleagues around the country and in Congress not to repeal the Affordable Care Act and throw 900,000 people in Ohio off of their insurance without a replacement to take care of it.

74,topic-id,825,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. Current Federal court rules allow trial lawyers to engage in picking their preferred venue. In particular, trial lawyers are able to file suit against the defendant in one State while keeping their case in a different State's court.  When a lawsuit is filed against a defendant in another State, trial lawyers may also sue a defendant in the State where they want the trial to occur. This keeps the case in the lawyers' preferred State court.  Many times the target of the lawsuit is a large, national business. But if the only defendant in the case is an out-of-State business, then the case can be heard in Federal court. Because of this, the trial lawyer will then also sue an innocent local individual or a small business in order to keep the case before a local court.  Usually, the case against the innocent local defendant is dropped once the case is safely back in State court, but it is dropped only after the innocent local defendant has spent time and money dealing with the lawsuit.  This practice is wrong. This practice perverts our justice system and causes needless pain. Trial lawyers should not have the power to subject innocent local individuals and small businesses to costly and time-consuming lawsuits just to rig the system. This kind of abuse of litigation is unjust and must be stopped.  A well-respected Federal appeals court judge, Harvie Wilkinson of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, has publicly supported Congress putting an end to this abuse. He has suggested that Congress provide judges greater leeway in making the proper decision on whether a case should be removed to Federal court. He has also suggested that Congress give Federal judges greater discretion to determine early on in a case whether a local party has been fraudulently sued. The Innocent Party Protection Act provides these exact changes.  In 2014 Judge Wilkinson addressed these proposals and said:       That is exactly the kind of approach to Federal      jurisdiction reform that I like because it is targeted.       And there is a problem with fraudulent jurisdiction law as      it exists today, I think, and that is that you have to      establish that the joinder of a nondiverse local defendant is      totally ridiculous and that there is no possibility of ever      recovering.  That is very hard to do.  So Judge Wilkinson went on:       So I think making the fraudulent joinder law a little bit      more realistic appeals to me because it seems to me the kind      of intermediate step that addresses some real problems.  The legislation that this rule makes in order is the solution to the problem that Judge Wilkinson identifies. The underlying legislation would protect innocent local defendants in two main ways. First, the Innocent Party Protection Act allows Federal judges more leeway when determining whether a defendant has been fraudulently joined to a lawsuit for the purpose of keeping the case out of Federal court.  When a judge has a case before his or her court, the judge will have clear guidelines for determining whether the locality of a defendant can be disregarded in establishing whether the case will proceed in Federal or State court. However, this in no way infringes on our State court systems.  The judge must conclude that the defendant will not face a liability under applicable State law. Once that conclusion is reached, the judge then may release the innocent defendant from the case. This provision keeps legal claims in Federal Court that properly belong there by allowing Federal judges to decide whether a local party is truly a legitimate defendant and not simply ensnared in a case for the sole purpose of keeping the case in a trial lawyer-friendly State court. This is a fair and efficient solution to the problem.  Secondly, the Innocent Party Protection Act establishes a uniform approach for evaluating whether a plaintiff has a good-faith intention of seeking judgment against a local defendant.  While the U.Supreme Court has long recognized the right of courts to consider whether a plaintiff has a good-faith intention of seeking a judgment against a local defendant, the application of this principle has not been uniform.  The Innocent Party Protection Act simply codifies this longstanding principle and permits Federal judges to limit a lawsuit to the appropriate defendant.  Plaintiffs with legitimate claims against both a local and out-of-State defendant will be able to pursue their case in State court. However, if no legitimate claim exists, the out-of-State defendant will have the opportunity to have the case heard in a neutral forum. By codifying this principle, we effectively protect innocent individuals and small businesses from bad-faith litigation.  Mr.Speaker, the underlying legislation is a fair solution to one type of frivolous litigation. I support this effort, and I thank Chairman Goodlatte and the Judiciary Committee for bringing this bill to the floor.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

87,topic-id,1094,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close.  Mr.Speaker, the rule before the House today is simple. It provides for the consideration of the Innocent Party Protection  Mr.Speaker, we often speak of the Federal regulations or taxes inhibiting job growth in our country, but there are other headwinds that our Nation's job creators face as well. One of those headwinds is frivolous litigation.  I believe strongly that anyone and everyone should have access to justice. Everyone who is injured deserves to have their day in court, and they should have the opportunity to make their case. However, sometimes trial lawyers take advantage of our justice system and seek to gain an unfair advantage against a defendant. Trial lawyers may try to go court shopping in order to rig the case against the defendant.  One way they may seek to secure their preferred venue is to sue a perfectly innocent individual or a small business who happens to reside in the jurisdiction within which the trial lawyer desires to pursue the case. After some time, the innocent party is often released from the litigation, but not before incurring legal costs as well as emotional and opportunity costs. Each time an innocent small-business man or woman has to divert their attention from growing their business and divert resources away from investing in their employees and creating jobs and divert energy away from expanding their involvement in our communities, and instead they are forced to direct their attention toward defending themselves from a frivolous legal claim, each time this happens is a missed opportunity for creating jobs and for realizing economic growth.  The Innocent Party Protection Act defends our small-business men and women from bad faith lawsuits. It provides relief from trial lawyers who seek out friendly courts in order to pursue their cases. It balances the needs of justice with proper restraints on decidedly unjust actions. The Innocent Party Protection Act is a good and equitable solution. I ask my colleagues in the House to support our local businesses and defend them against frivolous lawsuits. Vote ``yes'' on the resolution. Vote ``yes'' on the underlying bill.

A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

The proposal we are seeing coming out of the House of Representatives really isn't innovation. I like to say that if you are looking at this, just at the specifics, the per capita cap is really just a budget mechanism. It doesn't have anything to do with innovation. It just has to do with basically triggering a cut to Medicaid and shifting that cost to the My concern is that we already do a lot with a lot less, and we know how to innovate. We would prefer that the rest of the country follow that same model.

So Medicaid equals long-term care for so many In the Affordable Care Act we accelerated the process of shifting the cost to community-based care because it is more convenient for patients and up to one-third of the cost of a nursing home. So if we keep more people in their homes, that is better innovation.  In the Affordable Care Act, we incentivized In fact, we had 21 States take us up on that--including Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Hampshire, Texas, Ohio, Nevada, There are many States that are doing this innovation and basically trying to move the Medicaid population to community-based care so we can save money.  Savings from rebalancing could make up for a large portion of the money the House is trying to cut in this bill. Basically, they are not saving the money. They are shifting the burden to the States, instead of giving innovative solutions to people to have community-based care; that is, long-term care services and staying in their home longer. Who doesn't want to stay in their home longer? Then we support them through community-based delivery of long-term healthcare services, and we save the Nation billions of dollars.  In fact, our State did this over a 15-year period of time, and we saved $2.7 billion. That is the kind of innovation we would like to see. But instead of implementing the innovation we started in the Affordable Care Act, they are trying to cap the Medicaid funding, which basically is changing the relationship from a mutually supported State and Federal partnership to a capped federal block grant.

246,topic-id,3030,"Mr.President, along with the Presiding Officer, I have the distinct honor of serving on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and am the ranking Democrat on that committee. There are many areas of challenge for our national security. We could talk about what we think is the greatest threat to the national security of the United Unfortunately, there are a lot of candidates.  One could certainly be China has been very provocative in the China Sea, raising concern about maintaining maritime security, which is so critically important to world commerce. Clearly China could be a candidate.  North Korea could be a candidate. We know that in North Korea, they have a nuclear capacity. We know their government will gas and poison people who disagree with them, including family. It is a repressive regime, and they are developing the capacity not only to have a nuclear weapon but the capacity to be able to deliver that nuclear weapon beyond just the region in which they are located. So we could pick North  We certainly could mention the threat of ISIS, which is a growing threat of terrorism that challenges not only the Middle East but our own country.  We could mention the security threat of Iran was one of the greatest sponsors of terrorism of any country in the world, which is causing major problems for the Sunni Gulf States, in Syria, and in the Middle Clearly Iran is a candidate for major interest in our national security.  But the country I would pick as the greatest threat to America's national security would be Russia has been very aggressive in trying to dominate beyond its own geographical borders. It has incurred into other countries and has attacked the United States of  I want to take us back to 1975 when the Helsinki Final Act was passed, through the leadership of the United States and the  I have had the opportunity through several Congresses to be either the chair or the cochair or the ranking member of the U.Helsinki I have spent a lot of time on the Helsinki work.  What was remarkable about that document that was entered into in 1975 was that it recognized that security is beyond just military in that for a country to be secure, it must pay attention to its borders, yes, and its military, but it also must have economic security and must respect human rights.  What was also very unique in the Helsinki Final Act was the commitment that these standards we agreed to would not only be of internal interest to the member country but that any country to the Helsinki Final Act could challenge the actions of any other country. We have not only the right but the responsibility to call out countries that fail to adhere to the basic principles that were agreed to in 1975. The Helsinki Final Act now applies to about 56 countries--all of the countries of Europe, Canada, the United States, and all of the republics of the former Soviet  Let me review with my colleagues the guiding principles that were agreed to in 1975 under the Helsinki Final Act, signed by Russia, so that they are bound by these principles. As I read through these 10 principles, let me talk about how Russia has violated every single one of the basic 10 principles they agreed to in  1, sovereign equality and respect for the rights inherent in sovereignty.  2, refraining from the threat or use of force.  3, the inviolability of borders.  4, the territorial integrity of states.  In each of these cases, Russia has violated these basic principles. They invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea, annexing it against the will of a sovereign country. They are interfering in the eastern part of Ukraine as we speak, violating the territorial integrity of Russia's troops are in Georgia, violating the sovereignty of that country. Russia's presence in Moldova is not respecting the territorial integrity of a member state. Russia has violated the basic principles of sovereignty that were brought out in the Helsinki Final  Let me read some of the other principles.  5, the peaceful settlement of disputes.  Russia shoots first. They took their troops into They took their troops into They have not used peaceful methods.  The sixth principle is the non-intervention in internal affairs.  Russia attacked the United States of America in our free election system. That is not subject to any dispute today. They attacked They interfered with our internal affairs. They tried to influence our election. That is an attack against America and a violation of their basic commitments.  Let me read through the remaining.  7, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Ask the people who have disagreed with the Russian Government and who have tried to form a party whether there is respect for human rights and fundamental freedom in Russia today. Ask independent journalists who are arrested and killed for trying to carry out their profession. Russia today is intimidating civil societies and NGOs, and anyone who disagrees with Mr.Putin is subject to arrest, torture, and perhaps death. We know that in the case of Mr.Magnitsky, which is a cause that has been taken up by this body with the passage of Magnitsky laws.  Another principle is equal rights and the self-determination of people. That is not present in Russia today.  9, cooperation among states.  Let me conclude with the 10th principle: fulfillment in good faith of international legal obligations.  Russia entered into an agreement with regard to Ukraine's sovereignty, only to invade Ukraine a few years later. Ukraine gave up its nuclear stockpile, believing that Russia would[[Page S1674]]live up to its commitments. Russia has violated the Minsk agreements that were entered into to resolve the problems between Ukraine and Russia has not lived up to its international agreements.  Let me sort of summarize why I think Russia is the 1 candidate for concern with regard to our national security. They have violated the sovereignty of many countries of the world. They have violated the sovereignty of Ukraine and continue to do so. They have violated the sovereignty of Georgia and They have attacked the United States of America through cyber. It may not have been a MiG, but it was a mouse, and its intended purpose was to bring down our democratic election system and to favor one candidate. That cannot go unanswered.  Today, Russia is engaged in Syria and supports the Assad regime, which attacks humanitarian convoys, uses the civilian population as an instrument of war, gases its own people--violating basic international human rights and committing war crimes. That is what President Putin is doing in Russia today.  Russia's human rights records are deplorable. Kara-Murza has been poisoned not once but twice. He is an opposition leader. He is now in the United States and is recovering from the second poisoning episode. The Russian authorities tried to kill him. Why? Because he dared to oppose the Putin regime.  We need to speak out. We need to know more about that. It does not end there. Russia is violating the INF, the International Nuclear Force agreement, which is a major concern to all of us.  Russia's bottom line is that they are trying to dismantle the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which has been the bulwark of security since the end of World War II, the relationship between Europe and the United States, providing a blanket of protection not just for our physical security, but providing international leadership in dealing with the development of democratic countries around the world. That is what Russia is trying to do today, is to dismantle that protection.  What should we do? We have identified Russia as our 1 concern, and I think most Members of the Senate would agree with that assessment. I have talked to many, particularly on the Senate Foreign Relations What should we do? What is the role of Congress?  We know we are waiting for President Trump to give us his foreign policy as it relates to Russia, and that is an important thing for us to know--how the President intends to deal with a country that has done so many things against our national security interests.  We have a role. We are the first branch of government that is mentioned in the Constitution, article We have responsibilities to act. We need to take steps, and I have encouraged my colleagues.  There have been a lot of accusations made around here about Russia's contacts with Americans and that Russia is stealing information through cyber and planting that information through WikiLeaks in order to influence elections. There is the potential contact with General Flynn, what happened with the Russian Ambassador, and what happened as far as domestic wiretaps. There have been a lot of comments made around here, but we do not have the facts.  First and foremost, we need an independent commission that is similar to what the Congress constituted after the attack on 9/11 so that we get independent, nonpartisan experts, without restriction to jurisdiction or turf, who can determine exactly what Russia's game plan is and what steps we can take to protect ourselves in moving forward and what action we should take against That is the first thing we should do. Congress should also pass a resolution. I have introduced one that would set up that type of an independent commission to look at what Russia has done.  There is a second issue, though, that I want to bring to our attention, and I know the Presiding Officer is very familiar with it. It is the Countering Russian Hostilities Act, which is a bill I filed. I am very proud that this bill was not created by one Member, it was created by a group of us working together and recognizing that Congress needed to speak with a strong voice.  I am proud that, in addition to my sponsorship, Senator McCain helped draft this bill. Senator Menendez is a key leader on this bill. Senator Graham is one of the architects of the bill. We have Senator Shaheen, Senator Rubio, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Sasse, Senator Durbin, Senator Portman, Senator Murphy, Senator Gardner, Senator Blumenthal, Senator Sullivan, Senator Daines, Senator Donnelly, Senator Young, Senator Whitehouse, Senator Coons, and Senator  You might notice that I alternated between Democrats and Republicans because this is not a partisan effort. We all recognize the seriousness of what Russia has done to the United We all recognize that Congress needs to respond. When you are attacked, you don't stand by; if you do, you will get attacked again and the next time could be even more devastating. So we have to take action to protect ourselves.  So what the Counteracting Russian Hostilities Act does, first and foremost, is it codifies the sanctions currently imposed against Russia for its cyber attack on the U.election. Secondly, it extends those sanctions for what we call secondary sanctions--businesses doing business with those that are sanctioned--so we can enforce the sanctions.  The Presiding Officer recognized that when we were working on the North Korea sanctions law, we needed to strengthen that, and I congratulate the Presiding Officer on the work he did regarding North Korea, and I was pleased to join him. I am pleased he is joining with this group to see how we can strengthen our sanctions and pressure on Russia to know that they can't get away with this type of an attack against America, but then we go even further.  We recognize that Ukraine today--we have sanctions against Russia, but we can strengthen those sanctions. We can apply those sanctions to the energy sector. We can apply those sanctions to prevent American companies from financing the Russian economy through the moneys they need for sovereign debt or privatization. So we extend the program of sanctions to include those types of activities.  We take up two other major issues that I just want to share with my colleagues because these are contributions made by the Members who joined together to file this bill. We recognize that the rules of engagement have changed. Russia is using tactics today that we never thought would be used. They attack our country, get private information, give it to WikiLeaks, use it as part of a strategy to get news out there that could influence our elections. Then they develop fake news, use that fake news through social media to make it look like real news in an effort to try to affect our free election system in the United This is pretty frightening. We have to meet them. We have to protect ourselves.  So this legislation provides for a democracy initiative similar to what we have done on our security initiative with We have stationed NATO troops on the border countries of NATO with Russia to let them know we will not tolerate the invasion of a NATO country. We have done that. That is our security initiative. We have to have a democracy initiative to protect the democratic institutions of Western Europe because Russia will use the democratic institutions to try to undermine the democratic institutions--the free press, the opportunities of free speech, the opportunities to try to influence through their money the election process. They have done that. They tried to do it in Montenegro during the parliamentary elections to affect Montenegro's accession into  We have to protect the democratic institutions. This legislation would authorize that protection.  Then it sets up a resource so we can fight this propaganda, so we can find ways to counter Russia's use of propaganda in order to carry out their nefarious activities.  This is a comprehensive bill. I urge all of our colleagues to take a look at it. We are looking for input. We are looking to make sure this does exactly what we need it to do--to speak as one[[Page S1675]]voice in Congress to make it clear to Russia that it is not business as usual; that we intend to take action and be strong and let them know they cannot do this type of activity; that America will protect its national security.  There is another bill, let me just mention, that Senator Graham is the principal sponsor of that I have cosponsored and others have sponsored also. It is the Russia Sanctions Review I mention that one because we had a great debate here in the last Congress on the Iran nuclear agreement, and part of the reasons we had a great debate is because the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was able to pass a review act and get broad consensus on it, get it signed by the President, which gave us a role. More importantly, it gave the American people a role in getting transparency on a very important agreement--the Iran nuclear agreement. So we had time for public hearings. We had time for national debate. We had time for questions.  Because that law passed, I am convinced the agreement was stronger. The administration knew there were millions of eyes looking at what they were doing; they just couldn't do it in the dark of night. It helped us, I think, carry out our responsibility as the legislative branch of government.  So Senator Graham and I and others believe we should have a similar process, if there is going to be a fundamental change in the relationship between the United States and Russia; that the President should consult and work with Congress and give us an opportunity for transparency and for the American people to be heard. That is exactly what this bill does. It is a bill that I think is for good legislating, for good governance, and I would encourage my colleagues to take a look at this, and hopefully we will be able to get this done.  I will just say in conclusion that we have no issue with the Russian people. They are good people. We want to have a good relationship with the Russian people. It is Mr.Putin and his government that are directing this country to do things in interference with the sovereignty of other countries--in violating human rights, in supporting violations of human rights, in war crimes, and they should be held accountable for that and for what they are doing in Syria, and, of course, very personally, attacking our own country. That is what we are aimed at.  Mr.Khodorkovsky was in my office yesterday. I think my colleagues might recall that he was a leader in Russia--a great business leader. He made a lot of money. He decided Russia needed reforms to protect the rights of all people, that human rights were not strong enough, the right of expression was not strong enough, so he took up that cause as a successful businessperson. As a result, he was arrested, served 10 years in prison, and they tried to keep him out of politics because he did not represent Mr.Putin's politics.  Well, he has been very active. He no longer lives in Russia for fear of his own life. He has been here championing the cause for good governance within Russia and the importance for the international community to be engaged in that. As he left my office yesterday, he said: Please continue to speak out. He said: Please continue to speak out.  The United States must lead when a country driven by Mr.Putin does what it does. It is our responsibility to speak out about this outrageous conduct--threatening the integrity of so many countries and violating the human rights of so many people.  We can make a difference. The Congress can make a difference. It is for all of those reasons that we need to act.  I urge my colleagues to take a look at the legislation I have talked about on the floor and which so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have joined. Let's get together and let's speak with a united voice and let Russia know we are going to protect the national security of the United States of America, and we are going to protect the rights of our friends.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgS1666-2.txt,,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,8.0,March
250,topic-id,1278,"Mr.President, I thank Senator Durbin, Senator Menendez, and Senator Coons for joining on the floor today to talk about the threat that Russia poses.  Senator Durbin is absolutely correct, and I thank him for his leadership on this. The only way the American people will have a full accounting of what Russia's intentions were and what they did in attacking our country is to have an independent commission.  We had such a commission after the attack on 9/11. Democrats and Republicans came together. There was no controversy about that. We wanted to find out what and how we were attacked, how they got through our intelligence network, how they put together the horrific attack on our country, and then we wanted to know how we could get recommendations to protect us moving forward.  I am going to tell you, that commission served a very important national security function because we learned a lot. We learned that we were stovepiping too much information. We weren't sharing it. The way the agencies were set up, it was more over turf than it was over mission. Congress acted on the recommendations, and we are safer today as a result of it.  We don't know what Russia's intentions are all about. We suspect that they are trying to undermine our democratic system of government. We suspect that Russia is interested in regaining its reputation of the former Soviet They are looking for a greater geographical footprint. We see[[Page S1679]]that in their military operations, not just on their border countries such as Ukraine or what they are doing in Georgia or Moldova, but we see that also in the Middle East where they have a military presence today, and they want to have a footprint there.  We believe they want to become a greater We know they don't like democratic systems of government. Their government stays in power through making sure that there is no effective opposition. They have quelled any opportunity for a Democratic opposition and for the free press.  We know those--but what are their ultimate aspirations? What do they intend to do with the transatlantic partnership? We talked about that. We are safer today because of the transatlantic relations. NATO has made our Nation safer. The strength of the EU has made our Nation stronger.  We know Russia is trying to interfere with that. They interfered with the Montenegro election in an effort to prevent Montenegro from agreeing to join We know they are trying to pull other nations out of We know that.  What we need to have, though, is a full accounting as to what happened in the attack on our country and how we can prepare ourselves to defend ourselves. By the way, it might also give us a blueprint for what we need to do to show Russia we will not tolerate that type of activity.  Senator Durbin is absolutely right. We have responsibilities in The committee I serve on, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--our relationship with Russia, we have to have hearings. Senator Menendez was right in calling upon our committee to have additional hearings. What is Russia doing? How does it affect not only our relationship with Russia, but how do we deal with Europe? How do we deal with the authorization for use of military force? If we were attacked, can you use cyber as an attack vehicle? Does that require congressional authorization?  We have to be prepared in our committees. The Intelligence Committee has a responsibility to find out exactly what happened and whether we need to change our intelligence network because Russia was able to invade our country. They were able to get private information and then send it to WikiLeaks to use politically against us. They may compromise some of our classified information. We don't know. We need to find that out.  The Intelligence Committee has a function to play. The Judiciary Committee has a function to play. I know the subcommittee is doing some work under Senators Whitehouse and The Armed Services Committee certainly has a role to play.  There is only one way the American people will get a clear view of how serious this matter is and that we are taking every conceivable possible step to make sure we protect the national security of the United States and our Democratic institutions, which are part of our national security, and that is to have an independent commission.  There are no turf problems there. They can look at everything. They can have a transparent process, and the American people can get an eye as to what is happening. They can make the recommendations we need.  I thank Senator Durbin for underscoring that point. It is something I think we will ultimately get to. I was hoping we could get to it sooner rather than later because I think the American people would have a great deal more confidence.  I thank Senator Coons for putting this in historic perspective. He is absolutely right; we go back a long time as to what Russia's intentions are all about. I thought that was extremely helpful to fill in all of the aspects of what we are trying to do.  Senator Menendez's point was very critical; our reasons for being here and our reasons for wanting to take action are to protect our country, the American people. We are not talking about any one person or any one election. This is not challenging the results of this past election. This is all about making sure that we protect the integrity of our free election system and, particularly moving forward, knowing that Russia may very well be engaged, as we speak, in trying to interfere with the elections in the Netherlands and Germany and We need to have a better game plan on how to deal with this.  As Senator Menendez said--I think it is a very important point; I want to underscore this: You can't trust Let's be clear about that. Ask the They signed the Budapest The United States was part of that. They very clearly gave up their nuclear capacity, and in exchange they got the security from Russia on their jurisdiction, on their territory, on their sovereignty. Look how long that lasted before Russia invaded Ukraine, annexed part of Ukraine, and they continue to supply resources to disrupt the eastern part of Ukraine so Ukraine will have a very difficult time in its integration into That is what Russia is doing today in contravention to their written commitments with  Then I might tell my colleagues: Look at the Minsk agreement set up to try to end this hot war, and Russia has violated all the aspects of the Minsk agreement. You can't trust Russia's agreements.  As Senator Menendez pointed out--he is right--look at the Look at the treaty obligations. Russia is violating their treaty obligations, which directly affect the security of These are pretty serious things. We counter this by unity.  That is why I am so proud that we have Democrats and Republicans working together. This is not one party. Both parties recognize the danger of Both parties recognize that we have to protect ourselves. I would just urge my colleagues to follow this vigorous strategy, where we can show the American people that unity and that resolve and that we will not allow Russia to attack our country, that we are going to prepare to make sure that we defend our democratic system of government and that we will be united in standing up to those types of activities that are against our national security interests.

995,topic-id,1143,"Mr.President, in December 2015, this body came together to enact what then-President Obama called a Christmas miracle, the Every Student Succeeds Act, This truly bipartisan, bicameral compromise reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, for the first time in more than 14 years on the compromise of local control for Federal safeguards. First enacted more than 50 years ago as a part of the civil rights era, the ESEA sought to ensure that all children, regardless of their ZIP Code, were able to obtain a high-quality education. The legislative process is about compromise, and I have[[Page S1804]]concerns that last Thursday's vote to use the Congressional Review Act to repeal the Department of Education's ESSA regulations will roll back that compromise and leave our neediest students without the Federal safeguards they deserve.  Ensuring access to a high-quality education is one of the most important duties of Federal, State, and local governments. I supported ESSA, along with 84 other Members of this body, to move our State and local school systems away from a Federal, one-size-fits-all ``adequate yearly progress'' accountability system and allow States to design their own accountability systems to identify, monitor, and assist schools. Rather than rely on a collective set of test scores to measure student performance as under No Child Left Behind, ESSA allows States to design accountability systems that will take into consideration student growth over the course of a school year. States will be able to consider multiple measures of student learning, including access to academic resources, school climate, and safety, access to support personnel, and other measures which can allow for differentiations in student performance within a school or a local school district. All of this is being done while ensuring students are held to the high, yet achievable, standard of being college- and career-ready upon completion of high school. While State and local school systems have newfound flexibility under ESSA, they must adhere to a Federal civil rights safeguards meant to ensure children with disabilities, students of color, low-income students, and our English language learners are not forgotten.  Just as the Bush administration led Department of Education provided after the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2002, the Obama administration led Department of Education worked to enact regulations and provide States with guidance and technical assistance to properly implement After work for nearly a year and feedback from more than 20,000 education stakeholders, the Department published its final accountability, State plans, and reporting regulations in November 2016. The regulations provided broad flexibility for State and local school systems to improve student outcomes in their States and districts while ensuring all students receive an excellent and well-rounded education. The regulations provided certainty to States and local school systems and clarified how to comply with their statutory requirements.  The Congressional Review Act was the wrong instrument to modify the Department's accountability regulations. In 2006 and 2008, the Bush administration led Department of Education responded to concerns regarding the implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act by education stakeholders and updated the regulations and guidance necessary for State and local school systems to adhere to the law. Now that the Congressional Review Act has struck down the existing regulations, the Department is prohibited from issuing similar regulations or addressing future implementation concerns raised by those same stakeholders. Just as we have worked to move away from the one-size-fits-all Federal solutions under the No Child Left Behind Act, the Congressional Review Act wrongly utilizes a one-cleaver-eliminates-all approach. We could not pick and choose which parts of the regulations we would have wanted to keep, such as the regulation's additional year for States to implement their State-designed accountability systems before taking corrective action, all aspects of the regulation, and nearly a year's worth of the Department's work is eliminated. School systems will now have to rely on nonlegally binding guidance from the Department on how to adhere to their statutory requirements.  In my home State, the Maryland State Department of Education has worked for more than a year to develop our State's education plan as required under Our State superintendent of schools, Karen Salmon, has traversed the State, listening and engaging with Marylanders who seek to have a voice in their child's education. The purpose of ESSA was to ensure that we return the ability of our State and local school systems to provide for the education of our children in exchange for staying within certain Federal safeguards for our neediest students. This is what we are doing in The concerns and feedback expressed by Marylanders will be incorporated into a revised State plan and submitted to the Department of Education later this year. All of this work to comply with the Department's draft and final ESSA regulations, all of the consultation with members of the local community, is now for naught now that the Senate agreed to the use of the Our State and States are left with uncertainty as to how to comply with their statutory Federal requirements. Our States are clamoring to move away from the uncertainty of the Department's No Child Left Behind waivers from 2012 and have a clear understanding of how to comply with Federal law. The elimination of the Department's accountability regulations further delays the ability of State and local school systems to move away from No Child Left Behind policies.  Throughout Secretary DeVos's confirmation hearing, the Secretary repeatedly demonstrated a lack of depth in the longstanding debates surrounding the education community. I have concerns that Secretary DeVos, who did not understand the protections afforded to children with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, would be a forceful advocate to require States and local school systems to ensure that children with disabilities are counted and not forgotten. Given Secretary DeVos's expressed support for the privatization of our Nation's public schools and resistance to meaningful Federal oversight of nontraditional schools, I have concerns that any new regulations created by the Department could incentivize States and local school systems to promote the privatization of low-performing public schools or set different accountability standards between public schools and nontraditional schools. These concerns are not unfounded; Secretary DeVos has already informed States that the Department will be creating a new template for submitting State plans outside of what is required under the Department's existing accountability regulations. Our students need a Secretary of Education that will uphold Congress's ESSA compromise, local control for Federal safeguards.  The use of the CRA to repeal the Department's ESSA accountability regulations provides Secretary DeVos with the ability to significantly undermine the bipartisan nature of ESSA and Federal safeguards necessary to protect our students. I am disappointed a majority of my colleagues voted in favor of this shortsighted measure that fails to protect our children with disabilities, students of color, low-income students, and our English language learners.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-14-pt1-PgS1803-2.txt,,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,14.0,March
676,topic-id,4151,"Mr.President, it is good to be with my colleagues and the chair of the Senate Finance I am pleased to say a few words about the President's nominee, Seema Verma, who, if confirmed, will lead us at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid She is from Indiana, and folks I know in Indiana have said that she knows a lot about Medicaid, but not nearly so much about Medicare, which is a cause for some concern.  If confirmed, let me just say we certainly look forward to working with her and with the team she will have around her in that responsibility. It is a very tough job, as the Presiding Officer knows.                               Healthcare  What I would really like to focus on is that I want to go back in time, if I could. I want to go back to 1993. I am[[Page S1734]]not sure what the Presiding Officer was doing in 1993, but I was a brand-new Governor in 1993. We had a brand-new President and a brand-new First She was asked--I presume by her husband, or maybe she just decided on her own--to try to do what Presidents had talked about doing for a long time; that is, to try to make sure that everybody in our country had healthcare coverage. Her name was Clinton, and what she came up with, in consultation with a lot of folks, was something that was called HillaryCare--not always as a compliment, but sometimes, in some cases, derisively. I think our Republican friends, who were somewhat pointed in their criticism of it, were basically asked: Well, where is your idea?  In 1993, a guy named John Chafee, whom the Presiding Officer knows--we served with his son Lincoln in the Senate, and Lincoln went on to be Governor of Rhode Island--took up the challenge, along with at least 20 other Senators--I think mostly Republican and a couple of Democrats--and they offered legislation in 1993 that was the Republican alternative to  At the end of the day, HillaryCare did not survive, as we know, and the Chafee proposal from that time essentially went away in that particular What he had proposed had five major concepts to it. One of those was the idea that folks who didn't have healthcare coverage should be able to get their coverage in their own State--unless they were very wealthy--and to be able to get coverage in a large group plan. They called them exchanges or marketplaces, which would be established in each If that sounds familiar, it should.  They also said that folks who were going to get their coverage who didn't have coverage for healthcare in these 50 States would get some help in buying down the cost of their healthcare, and they would get that by the adoption of a sliding-scale tax credit which would buy down the cost of premiums for low-income people. The lower their income, the bigger the tax credit was; the higher the income, the lower the tax credit. And finally, it phased down.  There were concerns raised by insurance companies that it would be hard to insure folks who were going to be getting healthcare coverage on these exchanges in each of these States because a lot of these people hadn't had healthcare in a long time. There was an expectation that they would have a high demand for healthcare, they would need a lot of healthcare, and they would be a hard group to insure because their need for healthcare was very large. The insurance companies were fearful that the group of people in each of the States they would be asked to insure on the exchanges would not be insurable--not in the way in which the insurance companies could break even or make money.  This idea came along. Just to insure that we have a good mix of healthy and maybe not-so-healthy people in the exchanges to insure in each of the States, Senator Chafee and these folks came up with the idea that people would be mandated to get coverage in the States--everybody. You can't make people get coverage, but under the Chafee plan, for folks who didn't, they would have to pay a fine, and the fine, over time, would go up and become stiffer. So finally, people might say: Well, I am paying all this money for no healthcare coverage. Maybe I ought to get coverage and stop having to pay this fine. At least I would have something for my money.  The two other things in the original legislation from Senator Chafee and company were something called an employer mandate, the idea that employers were mandated to provide coverage. At least employers with a minimum number of employees would have to provide coverage--to provide a large group plan within their business or within their employment. That was the employer mandate in the Chafee proposal.  The other thing that was in Chafee, as I recall, was something like a provision that said to insurance companies: You can't just stop providing coverage for people because they have a preexisting condition; you have to insure people.  So those are the five major precipes: 1, creating exchanges in every State or marketplaces for people to get their coverage; 2, sliding-scale tax credits to help drive down the costs for low-income people for their coverage in their States; 3, individual mandates, or trying to make sure the mix of people insured was actually insurable, without the insurance companies losing an arm and a leg; 4, employer mandates that employers of a certain size have to provide coverage for their employees; and, finally, the idea of knocking people off coverage because of preexisting conditions was a no-no.  As we know, HillaryCare was not adopted, and neither was the Chafee plan. But it turned out the Chafee plan had legs, as they say in show business. It means it actually lasted beyond just being a bill introduced in the Senate in 1993.  It surfaced in Massachusetts about 10 years later, thanks to Governor Mitt Romney, who was thinking about running for Some of the people advising him said: You know, Governor, you could probably help your chances of running for President if Massachusetts could be the first State to have universal healthcare coverage for its residents. That sounded pretty enticing.  He said: How do we do this?  They looked up the Chafee bill. They apparently knew about it, thought about it, and said: Let's take the Chafee proposal and do that in  That is what they did. Guess what. They found that they did a pretty good job in terms of covering more people on the coverage side. It worked pretty well. Where it didn't work very well was on the affordability side. As we might imagine, there were the young invincibles--like some of these pages we have down here and their older brothers and sisters who maybe say: I don't need healthcare coverage. I am young and invincible. I will never get sick and go to the hospital.  They had a sliding scale. They had an individual mandate, but they had a fine people had to pay over time. Eventually, as more years went by, the young and healthy people said: I might as well get coverage. It helped provide for a better mix of folks in the exchange to provide insurance for. So they did a better job on the cost and, after a while, affordability.  When we went to work in the beginning of the Obama administration in 2009 on the Affordable Care Act, some people think Democrats just sat down in our caucus and just rolled out a plan and said: This is what we are going to do to provide healthcare coverage to people. That is not what we did. We spent a lot of time trying to figure out what we should do. We had, I want to say, dozens of hearings in the open, in public, on the Finance I am sure they had other hearings in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which shares jurisdiction with Finance on this subject. We had dozens of hearings. We actually had the head of the Congressional Budget Office come and testify.  We had a pretty good idea of what it would cost. We had a pretty good idea of what impact it would have on the Medicare trust fund. It turned out that the adoption of the Affordable Care Act extended the life of the Medicare trust fund by, I think, 12 years. It actually brought down the Federal budget deficit over the next 10 years by quite a sizeable amount, and over the 10 years after that by even more. The idea was to provide coverage for a lot of people who wouldn't have it--actually, using the Chafee plan.  I think it is really ironic, sometimes almost humorous, when my Republican friends--and they are my friends--attack the Affordable Care The piece that they attack is, I like to say, their stuff. They are the Chafee-Romney ideas.  I studied economics at Ohio State and studied some more in business school after the Vietnam war. I like market approaches to problems. So I find real virtue and interest in what Chafee came up with and what Romney put to work. Romney provided kind of a laboratory in Massachusetts to see how that idea would work--maybe not on a national scale but at least on a statewide scale, with a lot of people involved.  I am troubled by where we find ourselves today. During Presidential campaigns, I know people say things in campaigns that maybe they don't mean[[Page S1735]]or maybe they exaggerate or something like that. But I think the campaign might have been over and Donald Trump had been elected He promised, I believe shortly thereafter, that his plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act would lower the cost of health insurance, while providing better coverage for everyone. That is what he said. His plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act would lower the cost of health insurance, while providing better coverage for everyone.  I realize that the ink is barely dry on what the two House committees--the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee--have been working on. As best we can tell at this point in time, the bill they reported out of the committees--and I presume they are going to vote in the full House pretty soon, if they haven't already--but the House Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act does just the opposite of what Donald Trump called for. It does not lower the cost of health insurance, as best we can tell, and it doesn't provide better coverage for everyone. The House Republican bill to repeal the ACA does nothing to slow down the growth of healthcare costs.  One of the great virtues of the Affordable Care Act is the focus on value. How do we get better results, better healthcare outcomes, for less money? If we go back to where we were 8 years ago and compare how much we were spending in this country for healthcare as a percentage of gross domestic product, we were spending 18 percent. One of our major competitors in the world--a major ally but a major competitor--is In 2009, while we were spending 18 percent of GDP, Japan was spending 8 percent--less than half as much, 8 percent of They got better results, and they covered everybody.  So as we were approaching the debate and eventually the markup on voting on the Affordable Care Act, we had this in the back of our mind. We looked around the world to see what seemed to be working to get better results for less money, and we looked at Massachusetts to see how that was working and what we could learn from what they called RomneyCare up there.  But the House Republican bill to repeal the ACA does, as best we can tell at this point in time, very little--maybe nothing--to slow the growth of healthcare costs, and that is a shame. Apparently, fewer people will be insured. I think Standard & Poor's estimates as many as 10 million people could lose coverage under the House Republican plan. Insurance markets will destabilize faster. I mentioned earlier that a great concern insurance companies had is that they would end up in each or in a number of States with a pool of people to insure in the exchanges that were uninsurable--the elderly, maybe the sick, people who hadn't gotten healthcare for a long time. It is hard to insure that group and stay in business if you are a health insurance company. There was a concern about destabilization and instability within the markets for health insurance.  The individual mandate is replaced by something called the continuous coverage requirement. I would like to think it is going to work. I am not sure it would. But under this, I understand that people who go without a health insurance plan for more than 2 months will be charged a 30-percent surcharge when they are able to get back on and reenroll. People with expensive healthcare conditions will be willing to pay a penalty. But how about healthier people who often chose to stay out of the health insurance markets?  Also, as best we understand, in the House Republican plan, health insurance plans will become less robust, and many Americans will only be able to afford rather skimpy insurance plans. Preliminary estimates of the House GOP plan shows that insurance costs for the average person would increase by roughly $1,500. By 2020, the average person would pay $2,400 more.  I had the privilege of representing Delaware as One of the things I was responsible for in the treasurer's office was administering fringe benefits for State employees and teachers and a lot of folks. So this is something I have thought about over the years--about healthcare coverage for people.  We have only three counties--unlike Missouri, where the Presiding Officer is from, which has probably hundreds of counties--maybe not that many. But we only have three. In our southernmost county, Sussex County, we have a lot of chickens, a lot of corn, and a lot of soybeans. We have five-star beaches. A number of people like to come to Delaware to retire. We have no sales tax. We have very low property taxes in Sussex And for people who are not making a ton of money, we have pretty low personal income tax.  Take the example of a 60-year-old Delawarean in Sussex County who makes $30,000 a year. Under the Affordable Care Act, they get a tax credit. I mentioned earlier a sliding-scale tax credit. If you are lower income, it is a bigger tax credit. If you are a higher income, it finally fades out when your income goes up to a certain level. But for somebody making $30,000 a year in Sussex County, under the current law--the Affordable Care Act--the tax credit in 2020 will be about $10,000 to help buy down the cost of their coverage.  As I understand it, under the GOP health plan, for their comparable tax credit for the same person in Sussex County--which, quite frankly, has a lot of people 60, 65, 70 years old who make this amount of money down there; a lot are retired or semi-retired--the tax credit in 2020 would be $4,000. That is about $6,200 less. If you happen to be this person, you may want to think twice about which of these two paths you want to take.  We have another chart here that might be helpful. This is something we got from When we are passing legislation or drafting legislation or debating legislation, we are always interested in what key stakeholders feel. AARP is a big stakeholder. They represent a lot of people 50 and older. We are interested in hearing from folks who represent seniors. AARP represents the views of a lot--not all. We are interested in the views of those like doctors, the American Medical Association, nurses, providers. We are interested in hearing from hospitals. As it turns out--again, while the ink is barely dry on what is coming out of the House of Representatives--AARP tells us they are not very excited. Well, maybe they are excited about it, but not in a good way.  They say the change in structure will dramatically increase premiums for older consumers. That is what we have seen from the previous chart. In their example, AARP tells us about a 64-year-old person who is earning about $15,000. Their premiums go up $8,400. They are making $15,000 a year. I don't know how they pay for much of anything else with that kind of increase in their premium costs. That is a concern for me and certainly a concern for the folks at AARP and the people they represent, the millions of people they represent.  The House has come up with different names. Some call it ObamaCare light, ObamaCare 2.0 or .5. Some people call it The House is working on it. The concern we are hearing from a lot of folks is that it forces women to pay more for basic care.  Let's go back to the care for women. My wife and I have been married 31 years. I don't know everything about healthcare needs for women, but I do know this. A lot of women I have known--including my own family, my sister, my mom, and my wife's family--their primary healthcare provider is their OB/I didn't know that for a long time--not for everybody, but for a lot of people that is who their primary care provider is. For millions of women, surprisingly, their primary healthcare provider happens to be an OB/GYN or healthcare provider who works at Planned  For some people, Planned Parenthood is synonymous with abortions, but I think a very small percentage of what they do relates to abortions. What they do, for the most part, is try to make sure women get the healthcare they need, a lot of times in the OB-GYN realm but also in terms of contraception.  Somebody told me the other day that the cost of contraception for a woman in a year could be as much as $1,000. It is not cheap. The cost of a single delivery of a child from an unplanned pregnancy that is paid for by Medicaid is over $10,000, if I am not mistaken.  A lot of times, as we know, especially if a young person brings a baby into[[Page S1736]]the world, maybe doesn't finish high school or whatever, the outcome can be not that good for that child. I heard Mary Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund say these words. If a 16-year-old girl becomes pregnant, does not graduate from high school, does not marry the father of her child, there is an 80-percent likelihood they will live in poverty. The same 16-year-old girl who does not have a baby, finishes high school, graduates, waits until at least 21 to have a child, marries the father of the child, there is an 8-percent likelihood they will live in poverty. Think about that.  That suggests to me that we should--particularly for young people and those not so young who are sexually active--we want to make sure that when they are ready to bring a child into the world they can do that, a healthy child, a child with a lot of promise in their life.  For those who aren't prepared to bring that child, raise that child, prepare that child for success, contraception is needed. One of the things the Affordable Care Act does is provide access for that contraception. I am fearful the plan in the House of Representatives, however well-intentioned, will take away that opportunity for a lot of women and frankly for their children.  We have other people who have arrived on the floor. I want to be mindful of their time.  I don't know if we have another chart to look at before I yield.  We have all heard of double whammy. This has been described as TrumpCare, ObamaCare light, whatever you want to call it. It has a triple whammy. One of those is higher costs, a second is less coverage, And for some people, particularly low- and middle-income folks, more taxes. For certain people whose income is over one-quarter million dollars, they get a tax break. It adds up to quite a bit for somebody who makes a lot of money, but this is not the kind of triple whammy we ought to be supporting.  When the bill gets over here, if it gets out of the House, we will have a chance to slow down and hopefully do hearings in the light of day and bring in the folks from CBO, ask them to score this, let us know what is the real impact of what is being proposed in the Does it really save money? Does it do what President-Elect Trump said he wanted to do, which is make sure everybody gets coverage and be less expensive. Does it really do that? And we need to find out what the impact is on taxpayers. Is this the holy grail of better results for less money or is this something altogether different?  The Presiding Officer, from Missouri, is somebody who is pretty good at working across the aisle. I would like to think I am too. We have worked together on a number of issues. When you are working on something that is this big and this complex and has this kind of impact on our country, we are always better off if we can somehow fashion a bipartisan compromise and something that would have bipartisan support.  We tried to do that in the Affordable Care I know my Republican friends feel we didn't, but I was there. I know we tried. In fact, the evidence that we tried was literally the foundation for what we do for the Affordable Care Act, a Republican proposal from Senator Chafee and 20 other Republicans, including Orrin Hatch and including Chuck Grassley from I think that was a pretty good effort.  If this bill makes its way over here, we need to have at least a strong effort, maybe a better effort, maybe a more successful effort in the end.  If we are not going to repeal the Affordable Care Act, actually find a way to repair it and make it better, there are things we can do. I know I can think of some--I know the Presiding Officer can as well--that would move us closer to better coverage at a more affordable price.  The last thing I would say is this. I have a Bible study group that meets here on Thursdays with Barry Black, who opens our session with a prayer every day that we are in session. We also have his Bible study group that meets for about a half an hour, 45 minutes in the Capitol--Democrats and We pray together, share things together. I describe it as the seven or eight of us who need the most help.  He is always reminding us of our obligation to the least of these. There is a passage of Scripture in Matthew 25 that a lot of us have heard of, and I am sure you have heard this in Missouri too. It says: When I was hungry, did you feed me? When I was naked, did you clothe me? When I was thirsty, did you get me to drink? When I was sick and imprisoned, did you visit me? When I was a stranger in your land, did you take me in?  It doesn't say anything about when I didn't have any healthcare coverage and my only access to healthcare was an emergency room to a hospital. It doesn't say that in Matthew 25. I think the implications are clear. They are the least of these as well. They need our help, and I think we have a moral obligation, as people of faith, to help them.  We also have a fiscal imperative because while the Federal deficit is down from $1.4 trillion 6, 7, 8 years ago, down to about one-third of that, it is still high. We need to make more progress on that. We have a fiscal imperative to meet that moral imperative.  With that, I think I will call it quits. I know my colleagues will be disappointed, but they are standing here, from all over the country, waiting to say their piece. I am going to yield to them and wish them all a good weekend, and I look forward to seeing you on  I yield the floor.

Mr.Chairman, I also oppose this underlying bill, which is why I call it, as others have, the wrongdoer protection act for multistate and multinational corporations, and for that purpose, I add this amendment.  It is no coincidence that these corporate wrongdoers want to force consumers to fight them in Federal court. That is the effect of this bill, to enlarge Federal court diversity jurisdiction.

They know that, after a generation of regrettable decisions across the street by the Supreme Court of the United States, Federal court has become very favorable turf for corporate wrongdoers--generations of bad decisions that invite and exhort Federal judges to forget about the Seventh Amendment in our Bill of  You remember the Seventh It was written by James It was announced as approved by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, whose statue stands right outside this It was an amendment that says very simply: `` . . . in suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed $20, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved. . . . `'  There is nothing ambiguous about that statement. It is not hard to understand. It is about how important the right to trial by jury is to us here in these United  But since the 1980s, there has been this steady drumbeat of decisions from the United States Supreme Court encouraging and emboldening Federal court judges to decide and dismiss cases without the trouble of a jury trial. Their toolkit is enormous for doing that: motions to dismiss, motions for judgment on the pleadings, motions for summary judgment, motions for directed verdict, motions for judgment as a matter of law.[[Page H1974]]  Cases do get thrown out every day in this country without the trouble of a jury trial, and the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial is not preserved. That is why wrongdoer corporations prefer to be in the Federal court.  Federal court has become candy land for corporate wrongdoers in this country, and this bill helps them stay there and fight consumers in Federal court. It changes the law to allow corporate wrongdoers to do that.  I want to give you some very strong reasons, Mr.Chairman, why this bill is so bad.  Number one, it is discriminatory. Unless you are a multistate or multinational corporation, this bill doesn't help you. If you are an individual sued in State court, this bill does not help you. If you are a small-business owner only doing work in your State, this bill does not help you. Only multistate, multinational corporations get help from this bill, and that is why I call it the wrongdoers protection act for multistate and multinational corporations.  Number two, it is burdensome. The Federal courts are already overworked and understaffed. The civil caseload is growing at 12 percent a year. There are currently 123 vacancies in our Federal judiciary. There is no reason to add to this burden by changing the law.  Number three, this bill forces State court cases into Federal court. We have a crowd in this House that consistently preaches about states' rights and the need to cut back on the Federal Government's reach, but a bill like this comes along and they drop that state's rights banner like it is a hot potato and pick up the coat of arms of the multistate, multinational corporations.  If you really do care about states' rights, you should be voting ``no'' on this bill.  You see, these cases called diversity cases are filed in State court under State law. Ever since the 1930s, in the Erie Railroad case, if you take these cases and handle them in Federal court, the Federal judges are bound by law to follow State law, not Federal law.  Mr.Chairman, there is nobody better at interpreting and following State law than State court judges. It stands to reason.  I offer this amendment that is at the desk to exempt consumer cases against insurance companies for bad faith in insurance practices. If the majority is going to persist and present this gift to multistate and multinational corporations, at least include this amendment and protect consumers trying to fight insurance companies.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1968-2.txt,2159,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,9.0,March

656,topic-id,862,"Mr.President, I thank Senator Cantwell for raising the issue about the impact of this decision that the Congress will make with regard to a particular healthcare bill and then also, particularly, the Medicaid consequences.  I was just looking at what is a 2-page report that was just produced today and that I was just handed from the Center on Budget and Policy It is State specific.  In this case, looking at the data from Pennsylvania--I will not go through all of the data on Medicaid--just imagine that three different groups of Americans have benefited tremendously from the Medicaid Program every day. That is why what is happening in the House is of great concern to us.  We have in Pennsylvania, for example--just in the number of Pennsylvanians who have a disability--722,000 Pennsylvanians with disabilities who rely upon Medical Assistance for their medical care. Medical Assistance is our State program that is in partnership with There are 261,000 Pennsylvania seniors who get their healthcare through Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people who happen to be over the age of 65 or who happen to have a disability of one kind or another are totally reliant, on most days, on The third group, of course, is the children, and 33 percent of all of the births in Pennsylvania are births that are paid for through  When we talk about this bill that is being considered in the House or when we talk about the confirmation vote for the Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, this is real life. What happens to this legislation and what happens on this nomination is about real life for people who have very little in the way of a bright future if we allow some here to do what they would like to do, apparently, to  It sounds very benign to say that you want to cap something or that you want to block-grant. They are fairly benign terms. They are devastating in their impact, and we cannot allow it to happen. That is why this debate is so critical.  I have more to say, but I do commend and salute the work by Senator Cantwell, Senator Stabenow, and Senator Wyden in fighting these battles.  I will read just portions of a letter that I received from a mom in Coatesville, in Southeast Pennsylvania, about her son, The mom's name is She wrote to us about her son, who is on the autism spectrum. In this case, she is talking about the benefits of Medicaid--Medical Assistance we call it in  Here is what she wrote in talking about the benefits that he receives. After he was enrolled in the program, she said that Rowan had the benefit of having a behavioral specialist consultant. That is one expert who was helping Rowan, who was really struggling at one point. A second professional they had helping him was a therapeutic staff support worker. So there was real expertise to help a 5-year-old child get through life with autism.  Here is what his mom Pam wrote in talking about, since he was enrolled, how much he has benefited and how much he has grown and progressed:       He benefited immensely from the CREATE program by the Child      Guidance Resource Centers, [which is a local program in      Coatesville]. Thankfully, it is covered in full by  She goes on to write the following, and I will conclude with this:       Without Medicaid, I am confident I could not work full time      to support our family. We would be bankrupt, and my son would      go without the therapies he sincerely needs.  Here is how Pam concludes the letter. She asks me, as her representative--as her Senator--to think about her and her family when we are deliberating about a nomination like this and about healthcare legislation.  She writes:       Please think of us when you are making these decisions.      Please think about my 9-month-old daughter, Luna, who smiles      and laughs at her brother, Rowan, daily. She will have to      care for Rowan later in life after we are gone. Overall, we      are desperately in need of Rowan's Medical Assistance and      would be devastated if we lost these benefits.  This is real life for people. Sometimes it is far too easy here in Washington for people to debate as if these things are theoretical--that if you just cut a program or cap a program or block-grant a program, you are just kind of moving numbers around and moving policy around. This is of great consequence to these families, and we have to remember that when we are making decisions around here.  Everyone who works in this building as an employee of the Federal Government gets healthcare. We do not have someone else around the country who is debating whether or not we are going to have healthcare, like those families on Medicaid are having to endure.  I thank the Senator from I know that Senator Stabenow from Michigan may have more to add on this.

759,topic-id,441,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction I want to commend my colleague from Texas (Mr.Smith) for his leadership on this important bill. Mr.Smith, of course, who is now the chairman of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, was, for a number of years, the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, and he has a long reputation, much experience in trying to find ways to make the legal system work better for more people all across the country, and this is part of that, because there is a huge cost associated with the abusive lawsuits that have been filed for many years in this country.  Businesses are a popular target for frivolous lawsuits that lack any legal or factual basis. These lawsuits can easily result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees and discovery costs. Small businesses oftentimes don't have the financial resources to obtain a dismissal or sometimes even good legal counsel, and, therefore, their only option, in many cases, is to settle the case. In fact, many businesses and other entities put aside--insurance companies do this as well--a nuisance value of many of these cases because they realize so many cases are basically filed for not really legitimate reasons, but because there is a cash payout at the end of this, and some who are able to will actually put that in their budget. But these expenses don't just cost small businesses time and productivity. Too often they force small businesses into bankruptcy, and that means real people lose their jobs. This happens thousands and thousands and thousands of times all across this country.  Mr.Chairman, as chairman of the House Committee on Small Business, I cannot emphasize enough that we absolutely cannot afford to lose any more small businesses in this country and the associated jobs that go with them.  By ensuring that there are penalties for lawyers filing frivolous lawsuits, H.720 will deter abusive litigation practices that pose a real threat to the stability of many small businesses all across this country. After all, small businesses are the backbone of the economy. About 70 percent of the new jobs created in the American economy nowadays are created by small-business folks, so we should do everything we can to make sure that they are successful and able to hire more and more Americans so that we can get this economy moving again.  I urge my colleagues to support H.720. I again thank Mr.Smith for putting forth this very wise and thoughtful legislation which I think will go a long way toward improving the legal system that we have in this country.

51,topic-id,1232,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 174, which provides a closed rule for consideration of H.1301, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal 2017. I would like to thank, in particular, Chairman Frelinghuysen, Chairman Granger, and Ranking Member Visclosky for their hard and dedicated work on this bill.  Mr.Speaker, we have no higher obligation as elected representatives of the people of this great Republic than ensuring for the security and defense of our We are gathered here at a tremendous time of action and achievement across an array of crucial policy areas, regulatory relief for the citizens and businesses of our Nation, restoration of authority to our States and local communities, tax reform, ObamaCare repeal and replacement, and the list goes on.  President Trump is doing what he promised during his campaign, and it is an honor to serve the people of Wyoming at this historic moment. But, Mr.Speaker, it is no exaggeration to say that if we fail to provide the resources our military needs to defend our Nation, if we fail to do what is necessary to ensure America's Armed Forces remain superior to all others in the world, if we fail to provide the support our men and women in uniform need to recover from 8 years of devastating policies, nothing else we are doing in this body will matter.  Mr.Speaker, the need is urgent. As we meet today to debate the 2017 Defense appropriation, our Nation faces a more complex and grave threat environment than we have faced at anytime since World War II, and possibly, Mr.Speaker, more than at anytime in our history. For 8 years, our adversaries' strength has grown, while our relative capabilities have stagnated and, in some instances, declined.                              {time}  1230  North Korea continues its ballistic missile launches as it threatens our allies and interests.  The Iranian nuclear agreement has bought time for Iran to continue to advance its nuclear weapons program, as it reaps the windfall of at least $1 trillion of U.taxpayer funds provided to it by the Obama administration. Iran continues to threaten U.naval vessels in the Strait of Hormuz, support terrorism across the Middle East, and test ballistic missiles despite its U.obligations.  China is rapidly building up its military, and it is targeting, in particular, technologies to try to level the playing field with our capabilities. It continues to threaten freedom of navigation and trade in the South China Sea, and to conduct cyber operations against the United  Russia has invaded Ukraine, threatens Eastern Europe and the Baltics, is violating INF Treaty obligations, and openly threatening the use of nuclear weapons.  Al-Qaida today exists in more counties than ever before, and ISIS continues to recruit and hold territory as it plans and launches attacks against the  Most of the actors I just mentioned are also responsible for cyber attacks against the United  Against this backdrop, Mr.Speaker, the U.military is vastly under-resourced. At a recent House Armed Services Committee hearing, the vice chief of staff of the Army told members that of the 58 brigade combat teams, only three are ready to ``fight tonight.'' The vice chief of naval operations, Admiral William Moran, recently testified that more than half of all Navy aircraft are grounded due to maintenance issues and an inability to acquire the necessary parts. Our nuclear force is aging, even as our adversaries continue to make advancements in their own nuclear forces and capabilities. Our Air Force is the oldest, smallest, and least ready it has ever been.[[Page H1605]]  These stories and shortfalls, Mr.Speaker, exist across nearly every aspect of our military. America's fighting men and women are the greatest fighting force and the greatest force for good our world has ever known. They deserve the resources to do their job.  We have prevailed over great challenges in the past, from our unlikely and miraculous founding, through our Civil War, two world wars, the Cold War, and the early years of the war on terror. We must, Mr.Speaker, marshal our forces to do so again. To prevail, Congress--this Congress--must do its job.  That job begins with passing this 2017 Defense Appropriations bill. Then, Mr.Speaker, we must repeal the Budget Control Act and end sequestration. There is a rational and responsible way for us to undertake defense budgeting. The process in place today is neither.  The last time our military was able to assess the threats we face and then recommend the necessary funding levels to defeat those threats was fiscal year 2011, over 6 years ago. We must return to this standard budgeting process. In describing the effects of sequestration several years ago, our current Defense Secretary put it this way: ``No foe in the field can wreak such havoc on our security as mindless sequestration is achieving today.'' We must end this practice with all speed.  This should not be a partisan issue, Mr.It has not been in our past. Since World War II, every American President, Republican and Democrat alike, has understood the importance of American military superiority of ensuring a world in which America and our allies set the rules.  Threatened by the Nazis and the Japanese, Franklin Roosevelt and George Marshall knew America had to be the ``arsenal of democracy.'' At the beginning of the Cold War, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and John Kennedy roused the Nation to defeat freedom and liberty against communism. John Kennedy knew America had to be ``the watchmen on the walls of freedom.'' In the 1980s, President Reagan oversaw the defense buildup we are still benefiting from today. He knew that ``war comes not when the forces of freedom are strong, it is when they are weak that tyrants are tempted.'' And in the aftermath of 9/11, it was George Bush and Dick Cheney who kept us safe, who knew we could not win this war on defense, who understood we had to have a military strong and capable enough to deny terrorists the safe havens from which they plot and plan and launch attacks against our fellow citizens.  Mr.Speaker, now it is our turn. Across the globe, our adversaries challenge us, from China to North Korea, to Iran, to Russia; across the Middle East, in Syria, Iraq, and Thirty-four years ago, Ronald Reagan described our duty at another time, against another enemy, this way:       It is up to us in our time to choose, and choose wisely,      between the hard but necessary task of preserving peace and      freedom, and the temptation to ignore our duty and blindly      hope for the best while the enemies of freedom grow stronger      day by day.  Mr.Speaker, we can no longer ignore our duty while our enemies grow stronger. We must take the first step today to begin rebuilding our military. H.1301 is that first step. It increases defense spending, provides a full pay raise for our servicemen and -women, and begins to address our readiness shortfalls. This bill provides funds based on our military's priorities for fiscal year 2017 and gets us off the cycle of continuing resolutions, which are doing real damage to our readiness and capacity.  Therefore, I urge support for the rule to allow for consideration of H.1301, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

421,topic-id,483,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act of 2017.  Mr.Chairman, there can be no doubt that this legislation is an assault on the civil justice system. By effectively banning class actions, H.985 would give wrongdoers a permission slip to avoid public scrutiny or liability for their unlawful conduct. Worse still, this legislation also contains the text of the so-called FACT Act, which is designed to delay justice for asbestos victims and deny accountability for corporate defendants.  As the ranking member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee that exercises jurisdiction over this bill, I am strongly opposed to this dangerous and offensive measure.  For decades, medical experts have closely linked asbestos exposure with mesothelioma, a form of lung cancer, and other forms of lung disease. Asbestos manufacturers have also known about the deadly effects of asbestos exposure; but, as a Federal judge noted in 1991, there is compelling evidence that these companies sought to conceal this information from workers and the general public. Instead of sharing this critical information, which could have saved countless lives through exposure prevention, asbestos companies ``continued to manufacture one of the most widely used asbestos products without informing workers or the public,'' as the nonprofit Environmental Working Group has reported.  Real examples of this widespread corporate deception are legion, but one in particular stands out. In 1966, the senior executive of a corporation that currently operates as a subsidiary of Honeywell wrote that, if asbestos victims ``enjoyed a good life while working with asbestos products, why not die from it.''  In the wake of numerous lawsuits related to asbestos-related deaths, Congress amended the bankruptcy code in 1994 to authorize the use of trusts for the settlement of asbestos liability.  In 2001, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office conducted an exhaustive study of these trusts but did not find a single example of fraudulent conduct. Despite this finding, proponents of H.985 now make the outrageous and totally unsupported claim that victims of asbestos exposure have committed fraud--more alternative facts.  In the name of what they describe as transparency, the bill would force trusts to publicly disclose asbestos victims' sensitive personal information, including their names, partial Social Security numbers, and the like. Beyond the obvious consequences these requirements would have in the form of hacking and identity theft, this information is already available to relevant parties on a confidential basis through the discovery process, as both the GAO and the RAND Corporation have reported.  I agree with the majority that asbestos trusts must be accountable and transparent to both present and future claimants, but there is no evidence to suggest any wrongdoing or any fraud. This legislation would only make it easier for wrongdoers to get away with harming others and to make it harder for Americans to be compensated for these injuries.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.985.  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1974.txt,2055,FAIRNESS IN CLASS ACTION LITIGATION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,9.0,March

53,topic-id,1574,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and, frankly, I want to thank her for taking on this rule and the role she plays in this She came to Congress with an extraordinary expertise in national security, probably unsurpassed by any new So she is not only a valuable member of the Rules Committee, she is an important voice for the security of the United States of America in a very dangerous era.  Before I begin, I want to actually agree with my friend from Massachusetts on a couple of very important points that he made. First, I want to agree with him that this should have been done earlier. My friend is exactly right about this. This could have been done, in my view, in November and We should have gotten it done then. We would have avoided a lot of problems that come with a continuing resolution.  I am very pleased that we are moving it now, but earlier would have been better, no question about it. And that is true with every other bill, and my friend made that point as well. We really should make sure that each of the appropriations bills are passed. All of the problems associated with the continuing resolution are so evident for our military, are evident, frankly, in every other department. So I would hope my leadership continues to do what they are doing today and that is move these bills forward.  My friend is also right, in my opinion, about the authorization of the use of military force. This is something we have agreed on, even when we disagree on other things. This is a congressional responsibility. The President has announced he is going to announce a new strategy going forward on I would suggest to my side of the aisle and to the administration, now would be a great time to come to the Congress so we could have this robust debate on deploying and using our military and discharge our constitutional responsibilities.  I am less persuaded by my friend's arguments about the spending levels here. I just point out for the record this is well below what former Secretary of Defense Gates, when he was Secretary in the Obama administration, recommended we should be doing at this time. Frankly, that is because the last administration dropped the ball and simply didn't listen to its own experts as to what the appropriate level of our forces should be.  The underlying legislation here is an excellent bill. My friends have already talked about it in detail. I am going to take a 30,000-foot look at the bill and remind our listeners and our colleagues, there are three important objectives that this bill achieves:  The first is stopping the erosion in end strength, something that went on for years under the last administration that somehow thought we would be safer if our military got smaller. That was a bad assumption.[[Page H1607]]  The second is to restart the procurement cycle. We have fallen far, far behind what we should be doing in terms of replacing, upgrading, and improving the weapons systems and the communication systems, every system that we move into war with and that we ask our men and women to use.  And finally, this actually begins to address a problem that my friend from Wyoming discussed in great detail: readiness. We simply are not ready now to fight with the effectiveness. Now, I don't have any doubt, if we had to deploy massively, that our forces would do well and they would win, but a lot of people would die because they hadn't had the appropriate training, the appropriate time on task to get ready.  The other great objective that this bill meets is that we finally match up spending with the authorization. Last year, we had an excellent authorization bill out of the House Armed Services Unfortunately, that doesn't get you very far if the money doesn't match the policies and the recommendations that they advanced. This now takes care of that problem.  I also remind our colleagues that passing this bill is only a first step. As my friend from Wyoming pointed out, we are going to need a supplemental later this year, just for this year. We are going to need a robust increase in the fiscal year 2018 authorization and appropriation, something that the President has committed to and something I hope we can advance on a bipartisan basis.  Finally, again, as my friend pointed out, real military buildups take years, not months and weeks. We are going to have to be at this task for several years to restore and strengthen, frankly, what we allowed to decline, what the last administration allowed to decline over several years.  So this is an extraordinary first step, but it is only a first step; and I would hope my colleagues would join us on a bipartisan basis, while we have differences, but come together and put the defense of the country in a very dangerous time ahead of all else that we do.  Mr.Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill and the underlying legislation, and I urge the passage of the rule.  Again, I want to thank my friend from I want to thank my friend from We sometimes disagree, but he makes very valuable and very important points in some of the critiques he offers, and I hope that we heed them well.  With that, again, Mr.Speaker, I urge the passage of the underlying legislation and the adoption of the rule.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for his kind words and for understanding that it is inappropriate for Congress to continue these wars without having a vote on an I hope that that changes, but I appreciate his support, and there is bipartisan support for having this body actually do its job. That shouldn't be a radical idea, but, unfortunately, nowadays, doing our job seems to be something that a lot of people don't want to do.  Mr.Speaker, at the very beginning of the year, the Republican majority adopted a rule to explicitly exempt the cost of any bill that repeals or amends the Affordable Care Act from a requirement that it not increase spending by $5 billion. They effectively adopted a legislative blindfold to completely ignore the cost of repeal.  Let me show you the poster of the language, and I am happy to provide this to my colleagues on the Republican side. I will even give you my bifocals if you want to read it, because I think it is important that people understand what it says. It says:       Point of order: It shall not be in order to consider any      bill that would cause a net increase in direct spending in      excess of $5 billion.       Limitation: This subsection shall not apply to any bill      repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Mr.Speaker, as you can see, with this act, the majority declared that they were not going to let the rules of this House, which are purportedly in place to ensure fiscal discipline, stand in the way of repealing the Affordable Care Act no matter how much it would cost American families.  But, Mr.Speaker, it gets even worse. As we stand here today, Republicans have taken their head-in-the-sand approach to the Affordable Care Act to a new low. Right now, both the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees are considering Republican legislation to repeal healthcare reform without providing any analysis from the nonpartisan experts at the Congressional Budget Office on the cost of their legislation.  So let me put this another way. Earlier this year, the Republicans said: It does not matter how much it will cost to take health care away from millions of Now they are saying they don't even want to know how much it will cost or what impact it will have on American families.  Mr.Speaker, we have over 200 employees at the Congressional Budget That office costs nearly $50 million a year. We pay them to advise us precisely at times like this. Republicans have talked about repeal and replace for 7 years. Acting like they had not enough time to weigh the cost of their actions would be laughable if it were not so irresponsible.  Now, we Democrats care about health care and we care about costs and we demand to know what the impact of this repeal bill will be. Members should not be asked to vote on this legislation until they know the full weight of their decision.  Mr.Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that would require a CBO cost estimate to be made publicly available before any legislation that amends or repeals the Affordable Care Act may be considered in the Energy and Commerce or Ways and Means Committee or on the House floor.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of that amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Austin Scott of Georgia). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?  There was no objection.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr.Khanna), who has been a leader on this issue, and he will explain this even further.

In 2014, my former colleague and friend, Senator Elizabeth Dole, commissioned a study by the RAND Corporation to learn more about the military caregiver population and explore common issues experienced by America's caregivers. The experts at RAND found that those caring for our servicemembers and veterans provide nearly $14 billion worth of unpaid services every year--an incredible cost that would otherwise be passed on to the  There are more than 5.5 million military caregivers in the United States, and of those, 1.1 million are caring for post-9/11 veterans. These are spouses, parents, children, and other loved ones who have voluntarily put their lives on hold to provide our returning servicemembers with a trusted continuum of care that could not be replicated without them. Many of them will provide this care for years, if not decades, to come.  Tragically, caring for those suffering from the scars of war takes an enormous toll. According to the RAND study, military caregivers face increased instances of mental and physical health problems, chronic absenteeism from work, deteriorating personal relationships, legal and financial troubles, and feelings of isolation. These difficulties are often more pronounced for post-9/11 military caregivers.  Our Nation owes America's veterans our deepest gratitude. Their sacrifices are often very visible. In many cases our veterans have earned medals or awards for their bravery that they can wear proudly on their chest. But our military and veteran caregivers truly are hidden heroes, serving alongside our veterans to provide the love, care, and support they need. Despite their enormous sacrifice, these hidden heroes often do not receive the awards and admiration. That does not mean that they don't deserve it.

719,topic-id,838,"Mr.President, I rise to introduce the Fire Sprinkler Incentive I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Delaware, Senator Carper, in introducing this bipartisan bill.  In the United States, the annual cost of fires is enormous. In 2015, according to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), fires resulted in approximately $14 billion in direct property loss. In addition, more than 3,000 civilians were killed and more than 15,000 people were injured in fires. The NFPA also reports that a fire department responded to a structure fire every 63 seconds.  These statistics are of particular concern in Maine, which has some of the oldest housing stock in the country and which has experienced deadly apartment building fires. In 2014, an apartment fire resulted in the deaths of six people--Maine's deadliest fire in nearly four decades.  Historically, Maine has also seen commercial property damaged by fires. In fact, much of the construction in the historic areas of Portland was done following a devastating fire in 1866. This fire destroyed a third of the city, including most of Portland's commercial buildings, many of its churches, and countless homes.  The NFPA reports that when fire sprinklers are present during a large fire, they are effective 96 percent of the time, saving billions of dollars in property damage but more importantly, thousands of lives. Our bill would encourage commercial building owners to invest in fire safety upgrades. While building codes require sprinklers in new commercial buildings, a great number of structures across the U.were built and put in service before sprinklers were required.  Small business building owners, however, may find it difficult to fund retrofit sprinklers. To help these owners, our bill would provide two tax incentives to encourage them to make this lifesaving investment.  Currently, commercial building owners must depreciate fire sprinkler retrofits over a lengthy 39-year period. The period for residential buildings is 7\1/2\ years. This bill reclassifies fire sprinkler retrofits as 15-year depreciable property, thus allowing building owners to write off their costs more quickly. The bill also provides an option for certain small businesses to deduct the cost of the fire system upgrades immediately under Section 179 of the tax code. Together, these proposals will provide a strong incentive for building owners to install fire sprinkler systems.  This bill was originally drafted in response to the deadly nightclub fire in West Warwick, RI, in 2003, which killed a staggering 100 people. That building did not have a fire sprinkler system. Let us work together to lessen the chances of another tragedy like this one. I invite my colleagues to join Senator Carper and me in support of this bipartisan, common sense legislation.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the  There being no objection, the letter of support was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         International Association                                               of Fire Chiefs,                                       Fairfax, VA, March 6, 2017.

The      IAFC appreciates your leadership in creating an incentive for      property owners to retrofit their properties with automatic      fire sprinkler systems. If passed, the FSIA will be an      important tool to save lives in the future.       Fires continue to be a devastating problem in Maine and      across the United According to the National Fire      Protection Association (NFPA), in 2015 alone, there were more      than 1.3 million fires in the United States which resulted in      nearly 3,300 civilian deaths, 15,700 civilian injuries, and      $14.3 billion in property damage. Additionally, the U.Fire      Administration reports that the relative risk of fire death      in Maine is 1.5 times higher than the U.average. Fire      sprinkler systems play a crucial role by significantly      increasing the chances of surviving a fire and reducing      property damages. The NFPA found that a fire sprinkler system      decreases the likelihood of dying in a fire by 83%, reduces      property damage by 74%, and confines a fire to its room of      origin in 95% of instances. Incentivizing fire sprinkler      systems simply makes sense from both life safety and public      policy perspectives.[[Page S1749]]       Despite the clear benefits of fire sprinkler systems, the      current tax code fails to incentivize these lifesaving      systems. Your legislation would fix this oversight by      classifying fire sprinkler systems as Section 179 expenses      and allowing property owners to deduct the cost of      retrofitting their buildings. Additionally, the FSIA will      allow high-rise building owners to depreciate the costs of      these systems much faster than the current tax code allows.      The FSIA provides a real incentive for building owners to      protect not only their properties but the lives of those      people inside them.

Class actions are an important litigation tool that consumers, workers, and anyone else who has suffered injury can use to vindicate their rights. They are also a critical mechanism for enforcing public policy and are especially key in the enforcement of Federal civil rights laws.  For instance, plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases who seek backpay because of an adverse employment decision often pursue class actions because such cases tend to be the kind that are well-suited for class treatment. These cases typically concern multiple victims who were subjected to the same discriminatory employment practice or policy.  While damages awarded pursuant to a single plaintiff may not be large enough to deter the employer's alleged wrongdoing, aggregate damages awarded to plaintiffs as a result of class action would have a deterrent effect.  Unfortunately, this bill, H.985, requires class action plaintiffs to prove at the certification stage that every potential class member suffered the same type and same scope of injury, a requirement that is obviously virtually impossible and cost prohibitive to meet.  This onerous requirement would effectively deter employment discrimination and other civil rights plaintiffs from proceeding with any class action.  As if this provision were not onerous enough, H.985 would also harm civil rights plaintiffs by making it virtually impossible to pursue class actions pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil  All Federal appeals courts interpret that provision as allowing courts to certify a class limited to one issue in a case, such as liability, without having to certify a putative class for the entire cause of action.  Allowing courts to decide common questions within a case, while permitting other issues to be determined on an individual basis, would promote judicial efficiency, which is also one of the principal benefits of class actions.  H.985, however, would prohibit certification of such ``issue'' class actions unless the putative class for the entire cause of action is certified, which would only further delay and possibly deny justice for plaintiffs.  This provision would have a particularly devastating impact on civil rights class actions that often can only be maintained as to particular issues, such as liability.  Indeed, for these, and many other reasons, including the bill's mandatory appeals provision, its automatic stay of discovery, and its draconian and unworkable standards for setting attorneys' fees, 123 civil rights groups and organizations have written a letter to the Judiciary Committee in strong opposition to H.985, which I include in the Record.[[Page H1989]]                                                    March 7, 2017.     Re Strong Opposition to H.985--Section 2.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: We understand that the      House will soon consider H.985, the ``Fairness in Class      Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency      Act of 2015.'' The 123 signatory civil rights organizations      and advocates write to strongly oppose Section 2 of H.985.      The bill will undermine the enforcement of this nation's      civil rights laws and upend decades of settled class action      law. This sweeping and poorly drafted legislation will create      needless chaos in the courts without actually solving any      demonstrated problem. In this letter, we highlight the most      egregious of its many harms.       As advocates for the marginalized and often invisible      members of our society, we write to remind House members that      class actions are critical for the enforcement of laws      prohibiting discrimination in employment, housing, education,      and access to public areas and services. As the Supreme Court      has recognized, class actions provide ``vindication of the      rights of groups of people who individually would be without      effective strength to bring their opponents into court at      all.'' Amchem Products, v. Windsor, 521 U.591, 617      (1997). Courts have interpreted Rule 23 of the Federal Rules      of Civil Procedure, the federal class action rule, over      decades and the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules has,      through its deliberative process, reviewed and amended the      rule to ensure its fair and efficient operation. No further      revisions are needed at this time.    H.985 Adds Years of Additional Delay, Expense, and Disruption       One of the stated purposes of the bill is to ``assure . . .      prompt recoveries,'' yet it includes provisions that will      extend the duration of cases by years and add exponentially      to the expense on both sides.       The bill allows for an automatic appeal--in the middle of      every case--of the class certification order. Such appeals      are extraordinarily disruptive and typically add one to three      years to the life of the case. While the case sits in an      appellate court, expenses and fees rise, memories fade, and      injured victims remain without justice. Automatic appeals of      all class certification orders will clog our already-taxed      Courts of Appeals of class certification rulings are      already permitted at the discretion of the Courts of      An appeal of every class certification ruling is unnecessary.       The bill similarly builds in an automatic stay of discovery      in the district court whenever an alleged wrongdoer files any      one of a list of motions. This is an invitation for      gamesmanship and delay, and will deprive judges of the      ability to properly manage their cases.       The bill, by its terms, applies to all cases pending upon      the date of enactment. This means that hundreds of cases that      have been litigated and certified under existing law would      start from scratch with new standards, new class      certification motions, and new automatic interlocutory      appeals. The resulting waste of judicial resources would be      enormous. Civil Rights Injuries Are Never Identical and Are Already Subject to                         Rigorous Judicial Review       H.985 imposes a new and impossible hurdle for class      certification. It requires that the proponents of the class      demonstrate that ``each class member has suffered the same      type and scope of injury.'' At this early stage of a civil      rights class action, it is frequently impossible to identify      all of the victims or the precise nature of each of their      injuries.       But even if this information were knowable, class members'      injuries would not be ``the same.'' As a simple example,      those overcharged for rent will have different injuries. In      an employment discrimination class action, the extent of a      class member's injuries will depend on a range of factors,      including their job position, tenure, employment status,      salary, and length of exposure to the discriminatory      conditions. For this reason, nearly forty years ago, the      Supreme Court developed a two-stage process for such cases in      International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. U.S., 431 U.324,      371-72 (1977). In the first stage, the court determines      whether the employer engaged in a pattern or practice of      discrimination. If the employer is found liable, the court      holds individual hearings to determine the relief (if any)      for each victim. The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the      use of the Teamsters model for discrimination class actions      in part because of the individualized nature of injuries.      Wal-Mart Stores, v. Dukes, 564 U.338, 366 (2011).      Thus, this bill would overturn the approach established four      decades ago to permit a class of victims of discrimination to      seek effective relief.       For the same reason, the bill's limitation on ``issue      classes'' will impede the enforcement of civil rights laws.      Under current practice, the district court will decide in      some cases that the best approach is to resolve the      illegality of a discriminatory practice in an initial      proceeding, and then allow class members to pursue individual      remedies on their own. In such cases, class certification for      the core question of liability (often a complex proceeding)      will be tried and resolved just once for the benefit of the      many affected individuals. These issue classes can promote      both efficiency and fairness. Section 1720, however, would      deprive courts of this ability that they currently have to      manage class actions to ensure justice.   Requiring the Early Identification of Class Members Is Unnecessary       Section 1718 seeks to impose a heightened standard for      identifying class members, an approach that has been rejected      by the majority of circuits to have considered the question.      This stringent standard would not further any interest that      is not already adequately protected by Rule 23, which      requires that the court consider whether the case is      manageable and the class action device is the ``superior''      method for fairly and efficiently resolving the case.       Moreover, 1718 would impose a nearly insurmountable      hurdle in situations where a class action is the only viable      way to pursue valid but low-value claims. In such cases,      records of who has been affected may have been destroyed by      the wrongdoer, may be incomplete, or may have never existed      at all. In those cases, individual notice to all class      members may be impossible. But, without class certification      in these situations, class members who have valid claims and      who can be identified would not be allowed to recover. The      bill also ignores the important objective of deterring and      punishing wrongdoing, and encourages defendants not to      maintain relevant records.Arbitrary and Unworkable Standards for Attorneys' Fees Undermine Civil                            Rights Enforcement       Civil rights class actions are often about systemic reforms      that benefit the most vulnerable. In many cases, the sole      remedy is an injunction to change illegal laws or practices.      To ensure that non-profit legal organizations and other      advocates are able to undertake these important, complex, and      often risky cases, dozens of our civil rights laws      incorporate fee-shifting provisions. If a case is successful,      the judge awards a reasonable fee based upon the time that      the advocates have spent working on the case. This method of      determining attorneys' fees provides for consistent and      predictable outcomes, which is a benefit to all parties in a      lawsuit.       H.985 would entirely displace this well-settled law with      a standard long ago rejected as arbitrary and unworkable.      Under the bill, attorneys' fees would be calculated as a      ``percentage of the value of the equitable relief.''      1718(b)(3). But how is a judge to determine the cash      value of an integrated school, a well-operating foster care      system, the deinstitutionalization of individuals with      disabilities, or myriad other forms of equitable relief      secured by civil rights class actions? Asking judges to      assign a price tag in such cases is an impossible task and      would lead to uncertainty and inconsistency.       Non-profit organizations cannot bear the risk of these long      and expensive cases if, at the end, their fees are calculated      under this incoherent and capricious standard. Indeed, the      bill creates an incentive for defendants to prolong the      litigation so as to make it economically impossible for      plaintiffs' attorneys to continue to prosecute the      litigation.       These serious issues warrant, at a minimum, careful      consideration and public hearings. A rush to pass such far-     reaching and flawed legislation will deny access to justice      for many and undermine the rule of law.

756,topic-id,534,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in strong opposition to H.720, the so-called Lawsuit Abuse Reduction  This bill amends rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in ways that will chill the advancement of civil rights claims and increase exponentially the volume and costs of litigation in the Federal courts.  These concerns are not hypothetical. H.720 restores the deeply flawed version of rule 11 in effect from 1983 to 1993 in two ways: by requiring mandatory sanctions for even unintentional violations rather than leaving the imposition of sanctions to the court's discretion, as is currently the case; and secondly, by eliminating the current rule's 21-day safe harbor provision, which allows the defending party to correct or withdraw allegedly offending submissions.  Simply put, H.720 will have a disastrous impact on the administration of justice in numerous ways. To begin with, the bill will chill legitimate civil rights litigation, which, to me, of course, is very important.  Civil rights cases often raise novel legal arguments, which made such cases particularly susceptible to sanction motions under the 1983 rule. For example, a Federal Judicial Center study found that the incidence of rule 11 motions under the 1983 rule was ``higher in civil rights cases than in some other types of cases.''  Another study showed that, while civil rights cases comprised about 11 percent of the cases filed, more than 22 percent of the cases in which sanctions had been imposed were, in fact, civil rights cases.  Under the 1983 rule, civil rights cases were clearly disadvantaged. Yet, H.720 would reserve this problematic regime.  Although the bill's rule of construction is a welcome acknowledgment of the problem, it does nothing to prevent defendants from using rule 11 as a weapon to discourage civil rights plaintiffs. Even a landmark case like Brown v. Board of Education might not have been pursued had H.720's changes to rule 11 been in effect at that time, because the legal arguments in the case were novel and not based on then-existing law.  In addition, H.720 will substantially increase the amount, cost, and intensity of civil litigation and create more grounds for unnecessary delay and harassment in the courtroom itself.  By making sanctions mandatory and having no safe harbor, the 1983 rule spawned a cottage industry of rule 11 litigation. Each party had a financial incentive to tie up the other in rule 11 proceedings.  We heard testimony on a previous version of this bill that almost one-third of all Federal lawsuits during the decade that the 1983 rule was in effect were burdened by such satellite litigation, where the parties tried the underlying case and then put each side's counsel on trial.  Finally, H.720 strips the judiciary of its discretion and independence. H.720 overrides judicial independence by removing the discretion that rule 11 currently gives judges in determining whether to impose sanctions and what type of sanctions would be most appropriate. It also circumvents the painstakingly thorough Rules Enabling Act process that Congress established more than 80 years ago.  For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join us in opposing this highly problematic legislation.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

763,topic-id,203,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. These constitute my closing observations on this measure.  Mr.Chairman, H.720 would turn back the clock to a time when rule 11 discouraged civil rights cases, restricted judicial discretion, and engendered vast amounts of time-consuming and costly so-called satellite litigation.  Not surprisingly, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the principal policymaking body for the judicial branch charged with proposing amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure under the careful, deliberate process specified in the Rules Enabling Act, opposes this measure, noting that it creates a cure worse than the problem it is meant to solve.  Likewise, the American Bar Association opposes this legislation, as do numerous consumer and environmental groups, including: Public Citizen, the Alliance for Justice, the Center for Justice and Democracy, the Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Earthjustice, the National Association of Consumer Advocates, and six other major organizations.  Finally, last Congress, the Obama administration, strongly opposed a substantively identical measure, noting that the bill was ``both unnecessary and counterproductive,'' and that it ``actually increases litigation.''  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues in this body to reject this flawed bill.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.[[Page H2030]]    ",CREC-2017-03-10-pt1-PgH2025-3.txt,229,LAWSUIT ABUSE REDUCTION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,10.0,March

768,topic-id,450,"Mr.Chairman, I am very concerned that H.720 may have a serious, deleterious impact on the ability of individuals to protect their civil and constitutional rights in Federal court. This is a point that has been emphasized on this side ever since we have started examining, more carefully, H.720. Accordingly, my amendment would simply exempt these types of cases from the bill.  Based on a decade of experience with the 1983 version of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we know that the civil rights cases were, in fact, disproportionately impacted because they often raised novel arguments.  For example, a 1991 Federal Judicial Center study found that the incidence of rule 11 motions was ``higher in civil rights cases than in some other types of cases.'' Another study shows that, while civil rights cases comprised only 11 percent of the Federal cases filed, more than 22 percent of the cases in which sanctions had been imposed were, in fact, civil rights cases.  The bill contains a rule of construction intended to clarify that ``it not be construed to bar the assertion of new claims or defenses or remedies, including those arising under civil rights laws or the Constitution.''  The inclusion of this language is an acknowledgment of the disproportionate impact that the 1983 rule had on civil rights cases, and we should applaud--and I am sure we do--its intent.  Nevertheless, I fear this rule of construction, by itself, will not prevent defendants from using rule 11 as a weapon to dissuade civil rights plaintiffs from pursuing their claims.                              {time}  1015  My amendment makes an explicit exception for civil rights and constitutional actions. As a result, litigants will be clearly aware of its existence and will not be able to force opposing parties into satellite litigation when the case is brought under a civil rights law.  This amendment is necessary to avoid even the possibility of a chilling effect that the revisions made by the bill to rule 11 could have on those advocating for civil rights and constitutional law protections. As the late Robert Carter, a former United States judge for the Southern District of New York, who earlier in his career represented one of the plaintiffs in the Brown v. Board of Education case, said of the 1983 version of rule 11:  ``I have no doubt that the Supreme Court's opportunity to pronounce separate schools inherently unequal in Brown v. Board of Education would have been delayed for a decade had my colleagues and I been required, upon pain of potential sanctions, to plead our legal theory explicitly from the start.''  For that reason alone, I urge the adoption of this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

247,topic-id,1158,"Mr.President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from the great State of Maryland and to commend him for his leadership on the Foreign Relations Committee and on the floor today, as well as his great work with the Helsinki Commission, his tireless bipartisan work with our committee chairman, and with many others.  We have just heard detailed, in terms of the legislation he has put forward, the effort, the time, and the engagement he has put forward in terms of standing up. I think it is important for all of our colleagues and the American people to hear us working together to push back on Russian aggression and on Vladimir Putin's regime for its interference in our most recent election and its long and sad record of appalling human rights violations.  In 1950, the CIA delivered a report to then-President Harry Truman that outlined two key goals of the Soviet The first goal was ``destruction of the unity among the Western countries, thereby isolating the United States.'' The second goal was ``alienating the Western people from their governments so that the efforts of the Western countries to strengthen themselves would be undermined.''  Nearly 70 years later, the regime of Vladimir Putin in Russia remains fundamentally committed to these same two goals, but today his government has a whole new arsenal of cyber tools and information tools which it uses to interfere in democratic elections here in the United States and across Europe--among the nations that are our vital allies--to launch propaganda and misinformation campaigns that spread falsehoods and create a climate of doubt and uncertainty among citizens and democracies around the world.  Last week, on this floor, I rose to speak with my friend and colleague, Senator Marco Rubio, to highlight the threat that we know Russia poses to the American-led, rules-based international order that has been sustained by both Republican and Democratic Presidents and leaders in this body since the Second World  Just yesterday, several of us participated in a hearing of the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, chaired by Senator Lindsey Graham of South We heard directly from representatives of the Governments of Ukraine, Poland, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, and All of these nations know better than any others just how serious the Russian Government is today about fulfilling the goals the CIA quoted and outlined in that report from the 1950s. Russian troops today are massing on the borders of many of these countries. In the case of Ukraine, Russia has recently invaded and continues to illegally occupy Crimea while arming and supporting separatists in the eastern 20 percent of the country.  Russia previously invaded Georgia in 2008 and continues to occupy about one-fifth of its territory, backing rebels in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and The Russian Government has tried and, in several cases, succeeded in executing cyber attacks against these countries' governments, most famously against Estonia in 2007. Its ongoing disinformation campaigns have created widespread doubt about Western institutions like NATO, the European Union, the OSCE--institutions that have helped to maintain a stable and peaceful world for seven decades.  These Ambassadors and the Foreign Ministers who testified yesterday before our appropriations subcommittee made clear their countries depend on the United States not just for leadership, not just for military strength but for leadership and our commitment to effective foreign assistance. These are the same requests I heard last August from Eastern European leaders, when I led a bipartisan congressional delegation--two Republican House Members, two Democratic Senate Members, and The five of us went to Ukraine, Estonia, and the Czech Republic, and we heard exactly the same message--that they are threatened by a constant wave of attacks of disinformation, both overt and covert efforts to subvert their democracies and to change the direction of their nations.  Maintaining our forms of American leadership, our support for the democracies, the civil societies, and the military, and the strength of these nations in Eastern Europe is not charity. A world committed to democracy and the rule of law is a more stable world. A stable world means Americans are safer and more economically secure. It[[Page S1676]]is that simple. That is why we must push back against Russian aggression in a bipartisan way and stand up for our allies and our values.  Conversations like this one on the floor today are important to educate our American people about the true nature of the Russian threat we face. The Russian Government's current strategy relies on disinformation and propaganda in an effort to divide the American people, both from their government and from each other.  Our discussion this afternoon makes clear that both Republicans and Democrats in Congress haven't lost our will to highlight, to condemn, and to fight Russian actions. Unassailable facts must serve as the basis for a bipartisan foreign policy. A clear-eyed understanding of Russian intentions and actions will protect us from their anti-Western propaganda and avoid the internal divisions that Russia seeks to leverage in an attempt to project its influence worldwide.  To that end, I am determined to support the efforts of Senator I am also determined to support the efforts of Senator Graham to provide sufficient funding that specifically targets the Russian Government's subversive actions. I will also continue to work with my colleagues, such as Senator Cardin, to see that his bill, 94, the Counteracting Russian Hostilities Act, is marked up this work period so the full Senate can consider this important legislation. As Senator Cardin commented, there are 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans who have already cosponsored this important bill.  Why is this bill, the Counteracting Russian Hostilities Act, so important? It will make sure the Russian Government pays a price for breaking the rules by supporting sanctions for its occupation and illegal annexation of Crimea, for its egregious human rights violations in Syria and elsewhere, and, most importantly, for directly interfering in our election. This bill would prevent the lifting of sanctions on Russia until its government ceases these activities that caused those sanctions to be put in place in the first place. The bill would also support civil society, pro-democracy, and anti-corruption activists in Russia and across  Today Vladimir Putin has a whole array of powerful modern tools that he intends to use to undermine democracy and promote his brand of authoritarianism, but as that 1950 memo to President Harry Truman made clear, Russia's goals haven't changed. Russia's goals are to oppose us, our vision, our values, and our democracy. We must make it clear that America's vision of a freer, safer, and more democratic world hasn't changed either.  I thank Senator Cardin for organizing this discussion, thank Senator Menendez for everything he has done to support these important efforts, and thank Senator Graham for hosting yesterday's important hearing. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to continue with this fight.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

The XM395 Accelerated Precision Mortar Initiative (APMI)      is a Global Position System (GPS), Precise Positioning      Service (PPS) guided 120mm high explosive mortar cartridge      capable of enemy defeat with low collateral damage. It      utilizes a Precision Light-Weight Universal Mortar Setting      System (PLUMSS) that contains an Improved Platform      Integration kit (iPIK) to load GPS coordinates, mission      trajectory and fuze mode data into the mortar round. The GPS      PPS crypto key is loaded into the iPIK by system key loader      PYQ-10. Both the XM395 and the iPIK contain a Selective      Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM). The XM395 has 90%      commonality with the Army's M1156 Precision Guided The      overall system classification is       2. XM395 utilizes the Army's M782 Multi-Option for      Artillery (MOFA) Proximity Height of Burst (HOB)      The HOB sensor is comprised of components with technologies      deemed as state of the art, requiring specialized production      skills. The sensitive/critical technology is primarily in the      design, development, production and manufacturing of the      components (integrated circuits and assembly), and the      integration methodology required to integrate those      components onto an assembly to process embedded data (the      software--algorithm--working parameters). The overall system      classification is       3. Disclosure of this technology could result in an      adversary developing countermeasures, thus lessening the      effect of the projectile. Disclosure of test data,      countermeasures, vulnerability/susceptibility analyses, and      threat definition could allow reverse engineering and use by      an adversary for possible use against U.and Coalition      forces. Compromise could jeopardize the U.inventory      through jammer development by adversaries. The risk of      compromise has been assessed as moderate. Risk is reduced for      fuze/munitions if adequately controlled and protected in      storage and on the battlefield. Risk is mitigated by the      prevention of disclosure of sensitive classified information      (the know-how, software, and associated documentation).       4.

221,topic-id,1583,"Mr.President, this week our colleagues in the House released a plan to clean up the mess left in the wake of the ObamaCare's failed promises. The bill known as the American Health Care Act represents the next step forward in keeping our promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare, which continues to fail Texans and folks all across the country.  Instead of helping more Americans and more Texans by providing more healthcare choices, ObamaCare has actually led to dwindling insurance options in a lot of counties across the country. In fact, it is estimated that almost 40 percent of counties in Texas have just one option on the exchange this year. It is hard to shop, it is hard to compare, and it is hard to get the benefits of competition when there is only one option because of  So that is actually the opposite of what the President and the advocates for the Affordable Care Act promised. That is what happens when government interferes with the market and[[Page S1658]]takes a one-size-fits-all approach to our Nation's healthcare. The fact of the matter is that the path that President Obama put us on is not sustainable. It is hurting families and burdening job creators and is taking a tremendous toll, and Americans are paying the price.  I know some of our colleagues across the aisle are relishing the fact that Republicans, the majority, are now taking this step to keep our commitment to repeal and replace They are sitting back and hoping that we fail. But the fact of the matter is that we would be having this debate no matter who won the Presidency last November 8, because ObamaCare is in a meltdown mode. It is unsustainable, and we would be dealing with our broken healthcare system no matter who won the White House on November 8 of last year.  One of my constituents wrote me earlier this year about her daughter. She said that before ObamaCare, back when she could choose the policy that she wanted, she was paying about $190 a month for health insurance, and she had a $500 deductible. Well, that sounds pretty reasonable--not great, but not terrible either. Then came Now her daughter, who unfortunately lost her job in the interim, must pay almost $400 a month with a deductible that is more than $6,000. I don't know many people who can write a check for $6,000 when they have an unexpected healthcare crisis. So in essence, she is being forced to self-insure and has been denied the benefit of even the insurance that she has, even though her premium has gone up more than double, and, of course, her deductible is now $6,000.  So to our friends across the aisle who seem to be relishing this moment where we are actually undertaking the hard work of working through a repeal and replacement program, I would say to them that ObamaCare is certainly no gold standard. It is the opposite of what we need to help our Nation's healthcare woes. There is no doubt that it is a failed piece of legislation, full of empty promises, and one we have to scrap.  So with the American Health Care Act, starting today in the House of Representatives, we will repeal ObamaCare and deliver better, more affordable healthcare choices to the American people.  This bill actually also improves That is another big part of what ObamaCare did. It forced more people onto Medicaid, which is frankly not the best quality healthcare insurance or coverage that exists.  I remember back during the ObamaCare debate, I actually introduced an amendment in the Finance Committee saying that if Congress passed ObamaCare, Members of Congress needed to be put on Medicaid--my theory being, not that it was such great coverage, but that if Members of Congress were on Medicaid, we sure would take every step necessary to actually improve it and make sure it works.  But this legislation actually does improve Medicaid and puts it on a sustainable path for the future by working with the Governors, because Medicaid is a shared Federal-State responsibility. But right now, it is growing by leaps and bounds. It is at the consumer medical inflation rate plus two, which means it is growing much faster than the economy and, unfortunately, putting unprecedented burdens on our State governments. For example, I know, talking to some Texas legislators, they said it is easily the second--and, if they weren't careful, the largest--expense item in the Texas State budget--Medicaid, or the State share of  Of course, Medicaid was designed to help the most vulnerable in our communities and enjoyed broad bipartisan support. Along the way, it became less about serving those who needed it and more about unchecked government spending, as I mentioned a moment ago. So what the American Health Care Act does is it actually puts Medicaid on a budget. It doesn't cut current spending in Medicaid; it just says that it will grow at a slower rate, and it sends much of the authority to work out the best healthcare delivery systems to our State Governors and legislators. It gives States more flexibility along the way so they can use resources to serve the specific needs of their citizens. I know in my State we frequently will come to Washington and ask the Health and Human Services Department and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, for a waiver so we can actually use the Medicaid money and to spend it most effectively--to build either a medical home or to deal with chronic diseases, or some other flexibility we need in order to deliver quality healthcare to our constituents. But the gall of having to come to Washington, DC, and asking permission on how to spend your own money is just too much.  I believe, actually, the American Health Care Act is the most significant entitlement reform in decades. That is something we should all applaud--putting Medicare and Medicaid on a more sustainable path, not continuing to spend money that we don't have, and racking up annual deficits and adding to our national debt, which now is in the $20 trillion range, with no end in sight.  Both Federal and State governments spend a significant amount of money on Medicaid every year. As I indicated, last year nearly one-third of the Texas budget was dedicated to The fact of the matter is that when the States have to spend so much of the money they tax and collect on Medicaid, then, it is unavailable for other important purposes--law enforcement, education, and the like. There is a crowding-out effect. By responsibly reforming Medicaid, the States and the Federal Government will benefit, all while helping Medicaid work for the most vulnerable in our country and putting us on a path to fiscal sustainability.  In addition to entitlement reform, this bill will also get rid of the ObamaCare taxes that have led to hikes in premium costs, fewer options for patients, and more redtape for job creators. I know, being in Tyler, TX, for example, back after ObamaCare passed, and meeting with a woman who said she was forced, actually, to work two jobs because her employer laid her off of her full-time job, so as to come under the cap necessary for the ObamaCare employer mandate. So, literally, this single mother had lost her full-time job because of ObamaCare and was forced to work two part-time jobs just to make up the difference in income.  We will also, in this American Health Care Act, eliminate the individual mandate. President Obama said when he ran for office back in 2008 that he was opposed to penalizing the American people if they did not buy government-approved insurance, but of course he changed his tune once he was sworn into office.  We will eliminate the individual mandate so people who don't want to purchase a government-approved plan are not forced to buy a plan they don't want and that they can't afford or else suffer a penalty. This bill will also help families spend money on healthcare decisions that make the most sense to them by giving them tools so they can manage their healthcare expenses like health savings accounts.  The American Health Care Act is an answer to a promise we made and we have made repetitively in the last three elections since ObamaCare became the law of the land. I believe it is imperative we keep our promise.  Some have said: Well, this is a difficult process. I agree. There are a lot of different ideas that people have. I agree. That is a good thing, but in the end, we have a binary choice. We can either keep the status quo, which is in meltdown--which is ObamaCare--or we can pass legislation which offers more choices at affordable prices to the American people.  I believe the choice is very clear. It is a great opportunity to reform our healthcare system and Medicaid and move healthcare decisions away from Washington and back to the families, back in the States where we all live, and back in the hands of patients and their doctors. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Trump administration to make this a reality.  Again, the choice is between the status quo, which is unacceptable, which is not working, or a better way. I, for one, choose a better way: more choices at a price consumers can afford.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgS1651-3.txt,1692,JCC THREATS,2017.0,8.0,March

As a result, the Texas soldiers had disappeared and were dubbed ``the Lost Battalion.''  They were combined with survivors of the USS Houston, CA-30, which had been sunk in the Battle of Sunda Strait on March 1, 1942, and dispersed to POW labor camps located in Burma, Thailand, and Japan to work as slave laborers. They worked on the Burma-Siam Death Railway, building a railroad through the jungle and into the coal mines, docks, and shipyards in Japan and other Southeast Asian countries. For 42 months, the men of 2nd Battalion, 131st Field Artillery and the USS Houston suffered together through humiliation, degradation, physical and mental torture, starvation, and horrible tropical diseases, with no medication.  Five hundred and thirty-two soldiers of the battalion, along with 371 survivors of the USS Houston were taken prisoner. As many as 163 soldiers died in captivity, and of those, 133 are estimated to have died working on the railroad.

632,topic-id,791,"Madam President, this week the Senate continues to press forward on a number of congressional review actions; in this case, a disapproval that will roll back and repeal many Obama-era regulations that have hurt people across the country and strangled our economic growth.  By doing away with excessively burdensome rules and regulations, we are delivering on our promise to the American people to actually do what we can to help the economy, to grow the economy, to create jobs and not hurt it with unnecessary, expensive, and burdensome redtape.  Earlier this year, we began the legislative process to deliver on our biggest promise: repealing and replacing ObamaCare with more affordable and more accessible healthcare options, options that will work for all American families. The American Health Care Act, introduced in the House on Monday, is the first step in fulfilling that promise.  ObamaCare is collapsing. It has already failed countless families across the country, and it has forced people off good insurance plans they liked and strong-armed them to sign up for plans that were more expensive, offered less care, and didn't even let them use the doctor of their choice. So we would be revisiting healthcare even if Hillary Clinton had been elected President of the United States because ObamaCare is in a meltdown mode.  ObamaCare has also saddled our economy with more than a trillion dollars in new taxes. Most of those taxes are so hidden that most Americans are probably not aware of the fact that there is even a tax charged on the premium for their health insurance policy, for example. Well, all of these taxes end up being absorbed and have to be paid by American families.  At its very core, the individual mandate of ObamaCare was a major power play and overreach by the Federal Basically, what it said was, if you don't buy the government-prescribed health insurance plan, we are going to fine you; we are going to penalize you.  The government should not be able to force anyone to spend their own hard-earned money for something they don't want but have to buy under a threat of financial penalty. The American people have spoken up loudly and clearly and rightfully demanded that Congress do better, and we will.  Since the 2010 timeframe--when our colleagues on the other side of the aisle passed ObamaCare with 60 votes in the Senate, a majority in the House, and with the White House--they have lost the majority in the Senate, they have lost the majority in the House, and they have lost the White I think ObamaCare has been one of the major reasons why, because people, the more they learn about it, the less they like it, and they don't appreciate Washington forcing them to do things they don't want to do with their own money.  About 2 months ago, one of my constituents in Texas wrote me about her skyrocketing healthcare costs. Before last year, her premium was about $325 a month. A short time later, that was revised to $436 a month. This same Texan later moved from one city to another and, because of her change of address, her premium jumped to $625 a month. It started at $325 and is now $625. In 2017, thanks to ObamaCare, her premium went up again to an astronomical $820 a month. It started at $325 before ObamaCare and is now $820 a month. I don't know many people who could absorb that kind of increase in their healthcare insurance premium.  In about a year, her monthly healthcare payment jumped by more[[Page S1715]]than 150 percent--150 percent. That is hardly what I would call affordable; thus, the misnamed Affordable Care Act should be the un-Affordable Care  To make matters worse, she then found that her provider would be putting a halt to individual plans in Texas, something that has been a recurring theme in my State and across the country. So while President Obama said: If you like your plan, you can keep your plan, as a result of ObamaCare, she was not able to keep her plan so she had to find a new plan and a new doctor, a plan ultimately with less care, less flexibility, and even a higher price.  Suffice it to say, for this constituent of mine and for millions more like her, ObamaCare is not working. ObamaCare is not affordable, and it is hurting It is time for Congress to keep its promise that we have made in every election since that given the privilege of governing--of being in the majority, being in a position to change things--we would repeal and replace ObamaCare with options that fit the needs of all Americans and their families at a price they can afford.

634,topic-id,629,"I will not, not at this time.  Fortunately, we now have a President in the White House who clearly sees the failure of ObamaCare and wants to do something about it. Republicans in Congress have introduced a bill, which is now being marked up in the House, that the President can actually sign, once it is passed, to get us out of this mess. The American Health Care Act is the vehicle to do just that, and I am glad President Trump endorsed the plan earlier this week.  It is a work in progress. The House committees are marking it up as we speak. There will be changes along the way, but, ultimately, the House will pass the bill and send it to the Then we will have an opportunity to offer our amendments during the course of its passage. The important point to make, though, is that this legislation will actually put patients first so they are not forced into a plan that they don't want or that provides coverage they can't afford. It does away with the outrageous new taxes and the penalties that have made the economy worse off and have made life harder for American families.  The legislation will also give families more flexibility so they can get the healthcare specific to their needs that actually works for them. If they decide, for example, to get a major medical policy that is relatively inexpensive and then use a health savings account to use pretax dollars to pay for their regular doctors' visits, they will have the flexibility to do that. So this legislation promotes sensible reforms to ensure that big ticket items like Medicaid are put on a more sustainable fiscal path.  I have heard some suggestions that this legislation actually guts That is false. That is not true. It actually continues at current levels in this shared State and Federal program, but it is subject to a cost-of-living index that will actually put Medicaid on a more sustainable path. Just as importantly, it will also return the authority back to the States to come up with the flexible programs they need to deal with the specific healthcare needs of the people of their  This legislation makes sure that Medicaid doesn't lose sight of its design, which is to serve the most vulnerable among us who can't afford access to quality healthcare. It provides them that access--and better access--by providing flexibility to the  We know that the States and the Federal Government spend an awful lot of money on In Texas, for example, my State spent close to one-third of its budget on Medicaid last year--one-third of all State spending--and it is uncapped, so it goes up every year by leaps and bounds. Under the American Health Care Act, Medicaid will be tied to the number of people in the State using it, a per capita rate, which makes sense, and it represents the first major overhaul of the program in decades.  ObamaCare left us with unchecked government spending, more taxes, and fewer healthcare options. This bill is the opposite of ObamaCare in every way. It will control spending in a commonsense way, it will repeal ObamaCare's taxes and the individual and employer mandate, and it will provide more flexible free market options for families across the country. That is not just a bumper sticker or advertisement; that is actually what is contained in the legislation.  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House, in the Senate, and in the Trump administration to get this done in the next few weeks.  Madam President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

ObamaCare, to boot, has wreaked havoc on our economy and on American families just trying to stay healthy. In my State of Texas, it has led to fewer healthcare options, skyrocketing premiums, and deductibles so high that insurance plans are rendered almost useless. By one estimate, about one-third of Texas counties have only one insurance option, and that is the case throughout the Nearly one-third of all counties in the country have only one insurance company offering plans on their States' exchanges.  The truth is, ObamaCare has never added up to better coverage at a more affordable price; it has never delivered more options--just the opposite; and it never kept its promises when it was being sold to the American people.  Now is the time for us to do right by the American people by delivering more access to quality healthcare at a price Americans can afford.  The American Health Care Act doesn't just tinker around the edges of ObamaCare; it is a complete do-over.  This bill, for example, repeals ObamaCare's individual mandate, the requirement that you buy government-approved insurance, and if you don't, we are going to fine you. That is repealed.  It repeals the employer mandate. I still remember being in Tyler, TX, and talking to a gentleman who owned a restaurant and who said he had to lay[[Page S1763]]off some of his full-time staff, putting them on part time, just to avoid the penalties that go along with the employer mandate. And by the way, he introduced me to the single mom who now, instead of working one full-time job, had to work two part-time jobs just to keep food on the table for her family.  This bill also repeals the medical device tax. This was an incredible tax on medical innovation which wasn't on income but literally on gross receipts, forcing jobs to move from the United States to places like Costa Rica and Central  This bill repeals ObamaCare's Medicare payroll tax increase, the net investment tax increase, the ObamaCare tax on prescription drugs, and the ObamaCare health insurance tax.  This is the full repeal of ObamaCare that we have been promising for years now.  I want to point out that this bill also provides unprecedented entitlement reform. Some of the main cost drivers for the Federal Government are not the 30 percent of Federal funds that we appropriate each year that are largely divided between defense and nondefense spending. Entitlements are driven by the fact that they are not capped or pegged to an inflation rate for Medicare, Social Security, and  This legislation actually begins to put Medicaid--the healthcare plan for the most vulnerable in our country--on a reasonable path to sustainment. This bill also makes sure that the States that share in the cost of Medicaid can manage their own State budgets in a much more responsible way.  This bill is the first real Medicaid reform since the program was created which, perhaps most importantly, gives more authority, more flexibility to the States to manage the dollars they spend, to manage not only the dollars they come up with through their own tax rolls but the Federal portion as well. And as I said, it puts the Medicaid Program on a path toward fiscal responsibility.  I believe this legislation is critically important across the country and for my State of Texas, too. In Texas, every other year, when the legislature meets and tries to determine how to allocate its budget, they work very hard to try to make sure that Medicaid isn't the single largest expenditure in the State budget. Right now, about a third of that total budget is spent on Medicaid alone, and the Federal Government essentially ties the hands of the State in terms of managing the healthcare delivery system to help those most vulnerable low-income folks in our  With this legislation, not only do States like Texas have the ability to manage the expenditure of the money to focus on chronic diseases--people who are using our healthcare system a lot because of the nature of the illnesses they have--but also to help encourage medical homes so that people have ways of managing their healthcare to stay healthy longer and to reduce healthcare expenditures.  This legislation will help Texas and the rest of the country have a way to rein in spending while serving those who need Medicaid the most. You will hear some of our friends across the aisle saying that this is about kicking people off of Well, that is not true. For those people currently on Medicaid, Medicaid expenditures will not change at all as long as they remain on the rolls. That includes those who live in States that expanded the Medicaid coverage from 100 percent of Federal poverty to 138 percent. Those people will stay on Medicaid as long as they are eligible. Under this new legislation, Medicaid is put on a sound fiscal footing so the program is still around for our children and grandchildren.  Another important feature of the American Health Care Act is that it establishes a patient and State stability fund to equip Texas and other States to meet the specific healthcare needs of their patients, particularly those, as I have said, with low incomes and those suffering from chronic illnesses.  It will provide more money to community health centers that do a lot of heavy lifting to make sure that families are healthy and that people get access to the treatment they need regardless of whether they actually have health insurance. In Texas, we have hundreds of community health centers serving more than 1 million Texans each year. Under the American Health Care Act, they will be able to do their job more effectively and keep more Texans healthy.  Responsible entitlement reform is something we should be all about. It serves the American people not just for tomorrow but for decades down the road. Most importantly, I believe what this legislation does is it finally delivers on the promise we made back during the debate over the Affordable Care  Now that the Affordable Care Act has proven itself to be unsustainable and does not deliver on the basic promises, the fundamental promises upon which it was sold to the American people, I believe it is important that we keep our promise to repeal it and replace it with more choices of affordable healthcare at a price people can afford. It is the conservative answer to healthcare that will empower individuals, provide more options and competition, and responsibly help those who need care have more access to it.

973,topic-id,1767,"Mr.President, today the Senate Finance Committee has considered the nomination of Mr.Robert Lighthizer to be the country's next Trade This position serves as a vital role in our country's economic policy by negotiating trade agreements on behalf of the American people and making sure they are enforced according to their terms.  President Trump has made clear that his administration will be devoted to getting the very best trade deals possible for the American people. For Texas, my State--the Nation's top exporting State--trade is incredibly important. Many of our jobs and industries rely on trade agreements, like NAFTA, so that our goods and services can find new markets and more customers. As a matter of fact, 5 million American jobs depend on binational trade with Mexico alone, which gives us a sense of how important trade is to our economy at large.  I am happy to support Mr.Lighthizer for this important post. He has served in the Senate as a staffer on the Senate Finance Committee for the former chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Bob Dole, and as the Deputy U.Trade Representative during the Reagan administration as well. In his nearly three decades in the private sector, Mr.Lighthizer has represented a number of U.commercial interests through trade enforcement cases, while also focusing on opening up foreign markets to American ranchers, farmers, and small businesses. I look forward to working with him to improve existing trade deals and to cut better ones for the benefit of the American people.                        American Health Care Act  Mr.President, last week the House of Representatives unveiled a plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare with one that provides more options for the American people at a price they can afford. This was in direct response to what has been an ObamaCare disaster--one that led to skyrocketing healthcare costs, insurers leaving markets left and right, and a big government solution to a complicated problem that fails to actually deliver on its promises.  We have all heard it a hundred times if we have heard it once. President Obama said: If you like your policy, you can keep it; if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor; and a family of four would see a decrease in their premium costs by $2,500. Obviously, that did not prove to be the case.  There is really no denying that ObamaCare isn't working, and the status quo is unacceptable. Under ObamaCare, tens of millions are uninsured--almost 30 million people now in America, which, to me, is one of the most supreme ironies of It was sold to us on the premise that everyone would have insurance. Yet 30 million people are uninsured, and 20 million of those 30 million are either people who have paid a penalty because they haven't bought the government-[[Page S1795]]approved healthcare and thus are not complying with the individual mandate or they are people who claimed a hardship exemption, saying they simply can't afford to buy the policy that the government mandates they purchase, so the government has supplied them an exemption. So 30 million are uninsured under ObamaCare, and 20 million of those 30 million have either paid the penalty or have been otherwise excused from complying with the mandate.  We know that under ObamaCare, tens of millions are uninsured, premiums have skyrocketed, and mandates have crushed job creators.  I remember several conversations with employers--restaurant owners and one gentleman in an architectural firm--saying: When does the employer mandate kick in? In other words, when do you get penalized for not complying with the ObamaCare requirements?  He said: I am going to hire fewer people because I don't want to come within the ambit of that employer mandate.  Then I remember one restaurant in East Texas where a single mom basically was laid off of her full-time job and forced to work two part-time jobs to make up for that lost pay because her employer couldn't comply with the employer mandate under ObamaCare, so what he decided to do was lay off his full-time workers and hire people on a part-time basis. ObamaCare is riddled with stories like that, which demonstrate its flaws.  Consider that a 24-year-old individual in Texas could spend up to 30 percent of their gross income just paying for their healthcare premiums and their out-of-pocket costs--hardly affordable healthcare. We really should have called it the un-Affordable Care We have begun the first step to repeal and replace it.  Yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office offered us a glimpse into the impact the legislation would have. But I hasten to add that this is just the first step out of multiple steps, and there is additional work to be done, first of all, by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who has enormous discretion in terms of how to administer healthcare policy at the national level and the authority to delegate a lot of that responsibility, along with the money that goes with it, back to the States where it historically has been done, to offer people lower cost health insurance that suits their needs--not a government mandate--and offers them more choices.  There is a number of additional things in the Congressional Budget Office report yesterday which are important to consider.  First, the CBO estimates the American Health Care Act would lower premiums by 10 percent over time. We know ObamaCare raised premiums for many families across the country; they skyrocketed to an unaffordable level. So this is a start in the right direction, but I hasten again to add that it is just a start.  The Congressional Budget Office also confirmed that the American Health Care Act is a fiscally conservative bill that puts forward responsible solutions to our Nation's healthcare woes. CBO estimates that we could reduce the Federal deficit by $337 billion by passing the American Health Care  It also reforms Many of our most vulnerable population get their healthcare through This bill provides a way of sending that money and authority back to the States and lets them manage the growth of the Medicaid Program according to a Consumer Price So people who are on Medicaid now, including those in the expansion States, can stay on Medicaid, but ultimately the responsibility is going to be sent back to the States, along with the money to pay for it, and grow--not to cut it, but to grow--according to a Consumer Price Index, which makes sense. That change alone saves taxpayers another $880 billion--$880 billion. This is the most significant entitlement reform in certainly a generation.  The bill repeals ObamaCare's job-killing taxes like the individual employer mandate and the medical device tax, which has moved jobs offshore to places like Costa Rica because of its impact on innovation. We also repeal the payroll tax, the tax on investments, and the tax on prescription drugs. The fact is, middle-income Americans and our job creators will find massive tax relief as a result of this legislation--to the tune of more than $800 billion.  Put simply, the American Health Care Act dismantles, repeals, and stops ObamaCare in its tracks.  I should point out that the CBO doesn't take into account other steps Congress and the administration will take in order to make our Nation's healthcare system a vibrant marketplace where more options and better quality healthcare exist.  I might say that a lot of the news yesterday on the CBO report had to do with the reduction in the number of people who would actually buy health insurance under this new legislation, but the reason for the change is in large part, as the Congressional Budget Office said, that when you don't punish people through a penalty for not buying government-approved health insurance, as ObamaCare did, people may well decide in their own economic self-interest not to purchase that government policy, particularly when their choices are so limited.  I believe this is a first step in unraveling this convoluted puzzle called ObamaCare and getting our Nation's healthcare back on track. The American people have demanded better than Families are forced to pay for insurance they can't afford that provides subpar care, and they are tired of being forced to pay a penalty because they don't want to opt into a government program that fails to deliver on its most basic promises.  Let me just say this in closing: I know some of our friends across the aisle have a dim view of this proposal. They say the CBO score demonstrates that not enough people will be covered by this alternative to But my question to them is, What are you going to do about the current meltdown in ObamaCare that is forcing people into insurance they don't want and denying them any real choice, where the premiums are skyrocketing, and where the deductibles are so high you are effectively denied the benefit of any health insurance coverage? What are they going to do about that? I would simply say that if they don't like the alternative we have offered, I invite them to join us in trying to solve this problem.  One of the lessons of ObamaCare is that partisan healthcare legislation isn't very durable and doesn't survive. I hope at some point the fever will break, and Democrats and Republicans alike will find a way to work in the best interests of our constituents, the people we serve--the American people.  We can't afford another one-size-fits-all approach to healthcare. The American Health Care Act will provide the first important steps of relief from this unworkable, unsustainable system that was created based on false promises made to the American people. At the end of the day, our goal is to deliver more access, more options, and better quality care for families across the country. I look forward to getting it done soon.  In the House, the Budget Committee will take up the healthcare bill, which passed the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee, and then it will move to the floor of the House where I presume it will be open to some amendments. Then it will come to the Senate where, under the Senate rules, it will also be open to amendments.  If people have a better idea, I hope they will join us in trying to come up with the very best solutions possible. But to simply hang back and sort of enjoy the difficulty of trying to reform this broken ObamaCare system for partisan reasons, to me, seems to be beneath the dignity of what we are sent here to do by our constituents.

H.42 passed the House 236 to 189, with support on both sides of the aisle, including nearly unanimous Republican support, and I urge my colleagues in this Chamber to swiftly approve this legislation and to send it to the President's desk for his signature.  In the bipartisan Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Congress permitted but did not require States to assess State unemployment compensation or insurance program applicants for drug usage under two circumstances: workers who had been discharged from their last job because of unlawful drug use and workers looking for jobs in occupations where applicants and employees are subject to drug testing.  The unemployment insurance program is designed to facilitate swift reemployment by requiring applicants to be able to work and actively seek employment in order to be eligible. The 2012 job creation act noted that if a worker lost a job due to drug usage, that worker would have established him- or herself as not being fully able or available to work.  Further, under appropriate State-level programs, States could choose to restrict benefits for individuals who fail drug tests as well as to design programs to help them overcome their drug use and become work-ready. A number of States have responded to this opportunity. We are not helping anyone by leaving them in the position where they are dependent on and addicted to drugs.  In Texas, for example, the Texas Legislature passed senate bill 21, which not[[Page S1782]]only sought to secure the quality of job applicants, but it also provided help to those who needed it but would not have sought out that help otherwise themselves.  The wording of the 2012 job creation act clearly shows that Congress specifically intended to provide States the ability to determine how to best implement these programs for their citizens. However, the Obama Department of Labor substantially narrowed the law to circumstances where testing is legally required, not merely allowed. Such an arbitrarily narrow definition undermines the ability of States to conduct drug testing in their programs, as permitted by This regulation is overly prescriptive. It removes State discretion regarding implementation, and it ignores years of congressional concern on both sides of the aisle.  I thank Chairman Brady for taking the lead in the House on dealing with this overreach and for his leadership on H.42 to repeal this regulation.  This joint resolution has broad support, including from President Trump, Texas's Governor Abbott, Mississippi's Governor Bryant, Utah's Governor Herbert, and Wisconsin's Governor All are united in restoring the flexibility of the States to deal with the problem of drug use and drug addiction and to tailor their unemployment programs to meeting that problem.

435,topic-id,371,"Mr.Chairman, the right to choose one's own counsel is a basic right in our democracy. This is a right that is a foundation of a fair and impartial judicial system.  Having the right to choose one's own attorney ensures that a person can hire an attorney who will best represent their interests and protect their rights in the judicial process.  H.985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act, undermines this basic right by requiring a court to deny any class action certification based solely on a proposed class representative or named plaintiff being represented by a family member. The bill provides no discretion to the court and no exceptions.  The bill uses an expansive definition that includes not only immediate family members, but extended parts of a family tree by blood and marriage. Such a broad definition is an unfair restriction on the right to an attorney of one's own choosing.  Previously, the manager's amendment modified this provision but did not relieve these concerns. Such broad, blanket assumptions about family relationships fail to recognize the importance of trust and expertise into the attorney-client relationship.  In many instances, a family member will best represent their interests in court or could have specialized training and experience relevant to the case, yet the language in this bill does not provide for any discretion or any exceptions.  The fact that a lawyer representing a potential class is a family member of a named class member does not, in itself, create a conflict of interest; and under current law, there is a process for courts to address real conflicts of interest when they arise.  Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 23(g), courts have an extensive list that must be satisfied when appointing counsel to represent a class. There also already is a strong disincentive against conflicts through fairness hearings after settlement is reached. Any potential conflict of interest risks spoiling the agreement and wasting the efforts of counsel and the class.  Removing the discretion of the courts is overly broad and will remove access to appropriate counsel where no conflict exists. I urge strong support for my amendment and the removal of this provision from this bill.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1974.txt,1976,TRUMPCARE,2017.0,9.0,March

441,topic-id,599,"Mr.Chairman, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the right to vote, the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, and other rights enumerated in the Constitution have an intrinsic value that cannot be adequately expressed in dollars and cents. When a person's constitutional rights are violated, they cannot be made whole entirely with money, and yet the bill that we have before us today would require our judicial system to hang a price tag on our most cherished constitutional rights.  Under H.985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act, if a ``judgment or proposed settlement in a class action provides for equitable relief, the portion of any attorney's fee award to class counsel that is attributed to the equitable relief shall be limited to a reasonable percentage of the value of the equitable relief, including any injunctive relief.''  Mr.Chairman, when a court grants such relief, it is not awarding money to a plaintiff. In these cases, the courts are stepping in to say this is a violation of constitutional rights and it must stop.  My amendment would strike the provision in this bill that would devalue our fundamental rights by requiring a highly subjective and wasteful, costly, and demeaning process of putting a price tag on these rights. Worse, it would deter attorneys from bringing critical civil lawsuits that reform systemic and widespread violations of individual rights.  When we think of class actions, we usually imagine a group of people seeking money to compensate them for an injury or a harm--a toxic spill, a horrific accident, an Erin Brockovich-type story. But the reality is that there are many class actions that do not seek monetary damages but are fighting to right a systemic wrong in our society.  These class actions have made lasting changes to our legal system and society that have moved our country closer to equality and justice, landmark class actions such as: Brown v. Board of Education, ending separate but equal as a basis for racial segregation in our schools; Allen v. State Board of Elections, finding that section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires preclearance of any changes in voting practices; and Alexander v. Holmes County School District, requiring immediate integration of the schools. In these cases, plaintiffs asked the courts to protect and preserve their constitutional rights for themselves and others in similar situations in the future.  Under the system set forward by H.985, a court would have to also set a dollar value to the judgment. How do you place a price tag on desegregating our Nation's public schools? How do you place a price tag on protecting the right to vote? How do you put a price tag on preserving the Constitution's Sixth Amendment right to counsel? How do you put a price tag on the fundamental right of marriage? It is not possible. These are fundamental, constitutional rights, and these rights are priceless.  If this bill were to become law, courts and civil cases would become bogged down in ancillary litigation aimed at establishing the value of rights, rights that are protected through equitable and injunctive relief. It would be a mess, and we don't have to make this unforced error.  I oppose the underlying bill, but it is my sincere hope that, if the House is going to pass it, the least that we can do is remove this provision from the bill and end this insulting pretense that the courts or anyone else can put a dollar value on our constitutional freedoms.  I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1974.txt,1976,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2017.0,9.0,March

Instead of referring to hours and an hourly rate reasonably spent by an attorney, this bill requires the court to establish the value of the actual, equitable, or injunctive relief.

211,topic-id,1995,"Mr.President, in recent weeks, we have seen an astonishing series of revelations about Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 election in support of the Donald Trump campaign. Last week, the Washington Post reported that Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with the Russian Ambassador in July and September during the campaign. Yet, during his confirmation hearing, the Attorney General said under oath: ``I did not have communications with the Russians.''  Last Thursday, the Attorney General announced he would partially recuse himself from any investigation into the Presidential campaign. I note that this was a partial recusal when it comes to investigations into Russia's influence on President Trump and his circle of advisers and associates. The scope of the recusal is still unclear. For example, Attorney General Sessions does not even appear to believe that his own meeting with the Russian Ambassador on September 8, 2016, was related to the campaign. The scope of his recusal will need to be clarified.  We also continue to learn of previously undisclosed communications between the Russians and President Trump's inner circle. For example, we learned last week that Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, had met in December with the Russian Ambassador in Trump Tower, along with the President's National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, who resigned on February 13. People across America are wondering when the next shoe will drop.  It is becoming clear that the President is desperate to change the headlines from these Russian revelations--so desperate, in fact, that in a series of tweets on Saturday morning, President Trump claimed that President Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower in an act President Trump described as ``McCarthyism'' and ``Nixon/Watergate.'' Well, President Trump's tweets again made news but not in the way he had hoped. It quickly became clear that President Trump has no evidence to back up his claims. In fact, it appeared he got his information not from America's law enforcement or intelligence agencies but from rightwing talk radio.  On Sunday, the former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, denied the President's claims, and the Director of the FBI, James Comey, took an extraordinary step of calling on the Justice Department to publicly deny the President's claims. Even Republicans like House Oversight Committee chairman Jason Chaffetz and Trey Gowdy, chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi, said they had not seen any evidence that would support what President Trump tweeted. Nonetheless, the President's spokespeople doubled down, saying that the President does not accept the contention of the FBI Director and he stands by his tweets.  Let's be clear. President Trump is playing games with the credibility of his Donald Trump is destroying the credibility of the Office of the President 140 characters at a time. If President Trump had consulted with his adviser--any credible adviser--prior to his tweets, he would have learned something that is crucial, and it is as follows: The President of the United States does not have the authority to order a wiretap. Instead, such a wiretap can be granted upon a finding by a court that there is probable cause to believe the target has committed a crime or is an agent of a foreign power.  Clearly, there are more revelations to come. The only question: How long is it going to take? How much damage will be done to the credibility of the Office of the President and America in the process?  These recent events confirm yet again the need for an independent, transparent, bipartisan commission led by Americans of unimpeachable integrity to get to the bottom of this Russian attack on the United Russia attacked our democracy. We need to fully understand what happened. We certainly need to prevent it from happening in the next election or ever again.  This week, a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that Americans, by a margin of 58 percent to 35 percent, believe an outside independent investigation is needed into Russian involvement in our election. It is worthy of note that just a few weeks ago, only 30-something percent of the American people were aware of this controversy with Now over 55 percent of people want an independent investigation. America is listening.  We also need the Justice Department and the FBI to proceed with a credible, impartial investigation to determine if there may have been any criminal conduct involved.  Yesterday, the President's nominee for Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, appeared before the Senate Judiciary If confirmed, Mr.Rosenstein would oversee any Justice Department investigation into the Trump administration's Russian connections after Attorney General Sessions has partially recused himself. So I pressed Mr.Rosenstein to clarify the scope of Attorney General Sessions' recusal commitment. I also asked, as did Senator Feinstein, whether Mr.Rosenstein had read the January 6 Intelligence Community assessment into Russian election interference. I cannot explain it, but in 2 months Mr.Rosenstein had not read this 15-page, unclassified report that is available on the internet. It focuses on the major issue he will face initially as Deputy Attorney General, and he told us he had not read it.  Let me add that I respect Rod He served as U.attorney in Maryland, appointed first under a Republican President and held over under a Democratic President, and that says a lot about his professionalism as a prosecutor, his reputation, and his integrity. It is hard for me to believe that he could come before a hearing, which he knew would focus on the need for a special prosecutor to look into this Russian interference, and not have been briefed to read the 15-page public report that summarizes the conclusions of all of America's intelligence agencies when it comes to this Russian interference.  I am sure he is an excellent lawyer who wouldn't enter a courtroom or stand before a judge or jury without complete preparation to the best of his ability, but yesterday, time and again, he told us he didn't take the time to read this report. I urge him to do so as quickly as possible, and when he reads it, he will see that our intelligence agencies are unequivocal in their statement that Vladimir Putin was setting out to elect Donald Trump and to defeat Hillary This is not a report from the Democratic National Committee; it is a report from our intelligence agencies. And whomever Putin was trying to help, that is secondary to the fact that he was hacking into the internet, disclosing materials, and trying to become a material player in our Presidential election.  Mr.President, 3 weeks ago, I went to visit Poland, Lithuania, and They are watching this carefully because they have been the victims of Vladimir Putin and Russia's attempts to interfere in their elections, and now they hear the United States has been victimized by Putin, as well.  One of the scholars in Poland asked me what I thought was a very clear question, and I can't answer. He said: If[[Page S1652]]the United States will not take the interference of Putin in your election seriously, how can the people of Poland believe you will take your NATO commitment to protect us from Putin seriously? Important question. Valid question.  There are exceptions on the Republican side of the aisle, and I would like to point out one of them. My friend, my colleague, and the chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of Appropriations, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, made an extraordinarily forthright statement yesterday about the need for an investigation into this Russian interference. Thank goodness he is stepping away from party loyalty and stepping up when it comes to defending this I salute my Republican colleague for his leadership on this issue.  It is important to step back from the daily dysfunction we have when it comes to the Russian investigation and the White House and lack of governing and remember what is really at stake.  Five months ago, our intelligence services disclosed evidence that a foreign adversary--one ruled by a dictatorial former Communist KGB agent--was trying to help its preferred candidate in the U.Presidential election. Think about that for a moment. An adversary of the United States--a country which has imprisoned millions of Europeans in the Communist system for almost half a century and which today rigs elections and silences or murders members of the media and opposition--committed what I believe is akin to a cyber act of war against America in trying to elect someone they saw as more sympathetic to their interests.  Since those early reports, we have been provided with damning evidence by our intelligence agencies on the depth and sophistication of this operation--so favorable to its nefarious goal that it had Russian intelligence operatives boastfully celebrating after the outcome of the election.  We also know that members of President Trump's campaign met with those thought to be Russian intelligence; had suspiciously timed communications with the Russian Government just after the Obama administration placed sanctions on Russia; and in the case of top Trump advisers Michael Flynn and Jeff Sessions, refused to disclose those meetings, both in public and in one case to the Vice President and in another case to the Senate Judiciary  No candidate would or at least should want help from a foreign dictator to help win political office in the United So in a situation like this, the response is obvious: Help in any way possible to clear suspicions and concerns. Go forward and serve the American people with an investigation. It seems so obvious.  Leon Panetta was on one of the Sunday morning talk shows. Leon Panetta is a friend. I served with him in the House of He was the Chief of Staff to the President of the United States, President He served as Secretary of He headed up the Central Intelligence He is an extraordinarily gifted and well-thought-of person who has a record of public service that is enviable. He was asked about what the Trump White House should do about this allegation of Russian interference in the election and the suggestion that they might have been complicit.  He said: Get out in front.  The President of the United States should say: I have nothing to hide, and we will fully cooperate with an independent commission to get to the bottom of what happened in that election. But instead, what do we have? Fanciful--in fact, patently false--tweets by the President, alleging a wiretap by the former President Trump, if he has nothing to hide, should help us clear this up once and for all.  To my Republican colleagues, so many patriots and champions of American national security, it is time for more to join Senator Graham and others to step up and speak out even on the floor of the Senate about this situation.  Each one of us in the Senate swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against enemies foreign and domestic. Clearly, the Russian attack is a call for all of us--of both political parties--to step up. This issue is not going to go away. We are going to continue to pursue the truth.

249,topic-id,1628,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for his excellent statement summarizing the challenge we face. I thank my colleagues from Maryland and from Delaware as well.  Yesterday, we had a hearing in the Judiciary There is an individual seeking the Deputy Attorney General spot. Of course, he is seeking this position--a key position--at a critical moment in American history.  The Attorney General of the United States of America, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, announced publicly last week, on Thursday, that he was going to recuse himself from any prosecution involving the Russians and the last Presidential campaign. That is historic, and it was the right thing to do. Many of us on the Democratic side have called on him for weeks to do just that.  Senator Sessions had been an active participant in the Trump campaign, and when he became Attorney General, we felt that, in the best interests of preserving the integrity of the Department of Justice, he had to step aside when it came to the investigation of Russian involvement in that campaign.  Of course, in the meantime, during the course of this national debate, the National Security Advisor to the President of the United States, General Flynn, resigned after he misrepresented to the American people and to the Vice President of the United States conversations he had with the Russian It came to light last week that then-Senator Sessions, during the course of his confirmation hearing, gave misleading comments and answers to a question by Senator Franken, saying that he had had no contact with the Russians, either. In fact, he had.  He sent a clarification letter, but yesterday's hearing was about his successor, the Deputy Attorney General, who would have the power to oversee this investigation. The gentleman who was nominated is well known to the Senator from Maryland because he served as U.Attorney there for a number of years--since 2005. He served under President He was initially appointed under President Bush, a rare bipartisan selection, who, by every indication, is a professional prosecutor.  The disappointing moment at the hearing is when we asked Mr.Rosenstein if he had read the intelligence report that was publicly announced in January about the Russian involvement in our election campaign. It is an unclassified report. It is on the internet. It is about 15 pages long. It is as precise and conclusive as you can expect. It said quite clearly that the Russians did attempt to change the outcome of the election, that they were, in fact, working to benefit Donald Trump and against Hillary  I quickly added that this was not published by the Democratic National This was by the intelligence agencies of the U.I was disappointed when Mr.[[Page S1678]]Rosenstein said no, he had not read it. He was asked over and over again why he would not read a piece of information, a document so critical to his service as Deputy Attorney  I will set that aside for a moment and just observe the obvious. If you believe our intelligence agencies, there is no question that Russia was trying to change the outcome of the Presidential election. They were engaged, we believe, with up to a thousand trolls in some office buildings in Moscow, invading the internet, invading emails in the United States in an attempt to glean information that they could feed back to the public through Wikileaks and other sources.  Although there is no evidence to date that they had any impact on the actual casting or counting of ballots, their intent is clear. They wanted to pick Donald Trump as They believed he was a better choice for Russian interests than Hillary  Is that worthy of an investigation? I certainly hope so. To our knowledge, it is the first time in the history of the United States that a foreign power--and one that has been an adversary time and again to our interests around the world--tried to invade our election. It was, in fact, a day that will live in cyber infamy in terms of this Russian effort.  If we ignore it, we can expect several things. Get ready for the next election. Do you think they learned anything during the course of the last one? Do you think the Russians will be involved again? It would be naive to believe otherwise.  Secondly, there is a critical element here that we cannot ignore. Three weeks ago I visited Warsaw, Poland; Vilnius, Lithuania; and Kiev, I talked to those leaders--in a couple of instances, the Presidents of those countries, as well as opinion leaders, parliamentarians--and they continued to raise the same question to me. It came down to this: If the United States does not take seriously the invasion of Russia in your own Presidential campaign, will you take it seriously when Putin invades our country? You have told us under the NATO alliance, article 5, that you will stand by our side and protect us. If you don't take Putin seriously when he invades your own Presidential election, there is a lot of doubt.  Questions are being asked. Several Republican Senators have stepped up. I want to salute them. I will start with Lindsey Graham, who yesterday, again before the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee on Appropriations, made it clear that he believes we have to thoroughly investigate this Russian involvement in our Presidential election.  A few others have said the same. Unfortunately, the reaction by many Republican Senators has been lukewarm to cold. They don't want to spend the time to look into this. They would rather start talking about investigating leaks in the Trump administration or even the President's far-fetched tweets suggesting that somehow President Obama was engaged in a wiretap. It is something that has been denied not only by the former President but also by the former Director of National Intelligence and the head of the Federal Bureau of  To date, there is not one shred of evidence for the claim made by President Trump in his tweets in the early morning hours of At the same time, the need for this investigation continues. You have heard cataloged in detail--and I will not repeat it--Russian aggression over the last several years.  I have seen it. I have seen it throughout history, at least during my lifetime, and I have seen it more recently in Ukraine, in Georgia, and threats that go on every single day in countries in the Baltics and It is clear to them that they are fighting a hybrid war, not just the military threat, which is very real, but also cyber threats that at one point closed down the Estonian economy--a Russian cyber invasion closed it down--and propaganda threats, which are nonstop through cable television known as RT, Russia They continue to broadcast false information into countries like the Baltics and try to do it with impunity. That is the reality of what we are facing.  The question we face, though, as the U.Senate sworn to uphold this Constitution, is whether we are prepared to defend it against foreign powers that will undermine it, in this case the Russian  There has been a suggestion that the intelligence committees can have an investigation of this matter. I would say that in and of itself is not objectionable, but it is certainly not complete and satisfactory. The Intelligence Committee is going meet behind closed doors. We will not see the witnesses. We will not hear their testimony. The American people may not ever hear who testified and what they had to say.  Some parts of this must continue to be classified, and I understand that. But by and large, the American people have a right to know what the Russians did and how they did it so that we can make sure we defend ourselves against this in the future. The Intelligence Committees have a role, but not in its entirety.  I think there should be a special prosecutor from the Department of Justice to see if any crimes have been committed. I don't know where the evidence will lead, but we should have someone we trust, a person of integrity, who will step up and assume that role and make that investigation for the Department of  One other thing: I think this is of sufficient gravity that we should have an independent, transparent, bipartisan commission. My colleague, Senator Cardin of Maryland, is the sponsor of that legislation, which I am happy to cosponsor. That is the ultimate answer.  Let's get to the bottom of this once and for all to make certain we know what the Russians tried to do to us and to make doubly certain that it never happens again. That is the reality of this challenge.  I hope we can get bipartisan support for it. When it comes to sanctions against Russia, we have had good bipartisan support, and that is encouraging--equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans saying they should pay a price for what they did. Let's get the investigation to its conclusion.  Leon Panetta is a friend of mine and served in our government at many different levels. In the Sunday talk shows, he talked about what he would recommend to the Trump administration. He said to them very simply: Get in front of this. Don't keep reacting to this. Say that if you have done nothing wrong you are going to cooperate fully with any investigation to get to the bottom of it. That is the way to deal with it.  I hope we will have an end to the tweets and a beginning of the cooperation that is necessary so that we can get to the bottom of this situation and know the facts, wherever they may lead us.

610,topic-id,839,"Mr.President, I just want to comment very briefly on the comments of the Republican leader.  It was interesting when he said the courtesies that were extended to President Clinton and President Obama when it came to Supreme Court nominees; he left out 1 year--last year.  Last year, when there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court when Antonin Scalia passed away and President Obama sent the nomination of Merrick Garland to the floor of the Senate, it was refused by the Republican leader to even give him a hearing, let alone a vote. So there was an omission in his call for courtesy when it comes to Nominee Gorsuch, a very grievous omission from the point of American history.  For the first time in the history of the U.Senate--for the first time--Republican leaders in the Senate refused to give a hearing and a vote to a Supreme Court nominee sent by President Many of us came to this floor pleading that we follow tradition and the I am going to stand by that. Even though I think Merrick Garland was treated poorly by the Republican majority, I believe that Neil Gorsuch is entitled to a hearing and a vote. I made that argument before; I will make it again.                       Republican Healthcare Bill  Mr.President, the second point I want to make, and very briefly, is that we now have seen the Affordable Care Act repeal that has been brought forward by the Republicans in the We still do not know its fiscal impact. The Congressional Budget Office, which traditionally scores legislation, tells us the impact it will have both on the deficit as well as on the American economy. In this case, we believe we will learn as early as next week what that impact will be. There are several things we know for certain. The Republican approach to changing the Affordable Care Act is going to reduce health insurance coverage in America, and it is going to raise the cost.  The cost, incidentally, will be especially hurtful to those over the age of 55. If you are a senior citizen or over the age of 55, this Republican bill says that your health insurance premiums can be substantially increased. There is a limit in the current law that you can't have a disparity of more than 3 to 1 in premiums between people of different age groups. That is changed by the Republican bill to say that older people can be charged up to five times[[Page S1705]]the premiums that are being paid by those in younger groups. That is substantial.  Secondly, it is painful and hurtful to Don't take my word for it; the American Association of Retired Persons has come out against the Republican healthcare plan, saying that it is going to reduce the number of years of solvency for the Medicare trust fund. That is not a positive thing; it is a negative thing for the tens of millions of Americans who count on  We also know that when it comes to this bill, there are provisions in here which are inconsistent with our goal to increase coverage across My Republican Governor in Illinois, who has been very careful to be critical of Republicans in Washington, came out this week and said that the elimination of Medicaid coverage and reduction in Medicaid coverage would create a budget hardship in our  I might add that it will be a hardship on the thousands of people in Illinois who rely on Medicaid to provide for their medical expenses. That includes not only the children and mothers in lower income groups but, substantially, seniors who are in nursing homes who have no place to turn. They are living on Social Security, Medicare, and That is how they survive. Reducing the Medicaid coverage is a danger to them when it comes to continuing on in a safe and healthy environment.  In addition to that, we know that Medicaid for many low-income Illinoisans and low-income Americans is the only health insurance they have. Many who work hard every day don't make enough money to buy health insurance, and their employer doesn't provide it. Medicaid came to their rescue under the Affordable Care Act, and it is going to be severely restricted. That is why my Republican Governor has come out against this Republican healthcare bill, and many others feel the same.  When we take a look at this bill when it comes over here--first, I plead with my colleagues, don't rush it through. Let's take the time to look at it carefully. It will affect the healthcare of millions of Second, let's hold to the standard that whatever changes we make will provide more healthcare protection in America and make a serious effort at reducing cost. We can only do that if we have the time to honestly debate it on a bipartisan basis.  Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Missouri for giving me this opportunity.  I yield the floor.

621,topic-id,649,"Mr.President, today I come to the floor in opposition to the resolution to repeal regulations that help States and districts implement important provisions of the Every Student Succeeds  In the last Congress, Members of Congress did what seems nearly unimaginable today. We passed a bipartisan bill, the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, to fix No Child Left After 14 years, Democrats and Republicans in both Chambers came together on compromise legislation to reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). It gave States and districts flexibility to develop their own plans for holding schools accountable and encouraging improvements. At the same time, it included important Federal guardrails--including through regulatory authority--to fulfill the civil rights legacy of the original ESEA, ensuring that all students have equal access to high-quality public education.  Today, we should be focusing on the implementation of ESSA and providing critical resources to students, teachers, and schools. But, instead, we are on the Senate floor debating a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval that would gut the regulations that help maintain the important balance that ESSA strikes between local control and making sure that States are held accountable for educating our students.  After listening to teachers, parents, principals, and superintendents, the Obama Administration issued the final accountability regulation last Among other things, this regulation provides important information to help States draft their State plans and develop accountability systems to determine whether children are actually learning. It gives more flexibility to States to develop academic standards, to measure student achievement, and to determine intervention strategies when subgroups of students are consistently underperforming. It also lays out how States should comply with important provisions of the law, including identifying low-performing schools for improvement.  Eliminating this regulation would roll back the Federal role in education that has been in place for more than 50 years. In 1965, when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, it created an extraordinary opportunity for our Nation to make an even deeper commitment to civil rights. It ensured that all children, regardless of their ZIP Code, background, disability, or family wealth, would have a right to a quality education. Repealing this regulation would overturn 52 years of progress. We should be committing ourselves to advancing equity in education, but instead Republicans are using a political tool--the Congressional Review Act--to remove important Federal protections for students. I believe it is a betrayal of the bipartisan framework that underpins  Striking this rule could also send States into chaos. Many States, including my home State of Illinois, have prepared their State plans to align with this regulation. Without the guidance and clarity that this regulation provides, states will not have the support they need to successfully implement It could ultimately lead to greater liability for States and districts that are responsible for complying with the law but are left to interpret how to implement the law for themselves. If this partisan CRA effort is successful, the Education Department will not be able to promulgate new rules related to these issues. Instead of policy that is subject to the public scrutiny and review of the formal Federal rulemaking process, repealing this rule gives incredible latitude to an administration that wants to dismantle public education.  When I voted for ESSA, it was with the understanding that the law allowed the Secretary of Education to promulgate rules to implement the bill's accountability provisions. Gutting these regulations swings the pendulum way too far in the direction of local control. Giving States more control with a blank check from the Federal Government is not responsible Federal policy. We should maintain critical Federal guardrails to hold States accountable for educating our children. We should uphold our vital role in protecting the civil rights of all children. Anything less says to our children that they don't matter. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this resolution.

717,topic-id,1339,"Mr President, I am proud to introduce the Fairness in Federal Disaster Declarations Act today, together with my colleague Senator Duckworth, to try to bring some transparency and fairness into FEMA's disaster declaration process.  The inspiration for this bill was a tragic one. On February 29, 2012, a category F-4 tornado tore through southeastern Illinois, causing major damage in the towns of Harrisburg and Eight people in Harrisburg died in that event and 15 people were killed in total. Winds reached 175 miles per hour. It is not too much of a stretch to say these two small towns were almost wiped off the map.  And just last week, on February 28, 2017, another tragedy struck the small towns of Ottawa and Naplate after a category F-3 tornado tore through North Central Two people in Ottawa died in last week's storm and at least 50 homes were damaged or destroyed.  Requests for Federal assistance after a disaster are made by the Governor of each State based on State emergency management damage assessments. In the case of the Harrisburg and Ridgway tornado, the Governor's request for a Federal emergency declaration for individual assistance was denied, as was the State's appeal of that decision. With that denial, individuals whose homes or properties were damaged were precluded from direct Federal help.  When I asked FEMA why it denied the Governor's request, I was told that the disaster did not meet or exceed the State's per capita figure. Currently, FEMA multiplies the number of people in a State by $1.43 to determine a threshold of the amount of damage a State would incur to be considered for Federal assistance. In Illinois, that figure is more than $18 million. In other words, because Illinois is a highly populous State, it is presumed it can absorb the costs of cleanup and recovery from disasters up to more than $18 million.  From 2002 to 2012, Illinois was denied Federal disaster assistance seven times. Texas was denied 13 times. Florida was denied Federal disaster assistance eight times during that period, and California, New Jersey, and New York were each denied four times.  FEMA's formula does not work for large, populous States, particularly those with a concentrated urban area, like  Illinois ran into this issue again in November 2013 when tornadoes swept through the That time, six people were killed and whole neighborhoods were nearly destroyed. The cities of Washington, Gifford, and New Minden, Illinois, experienced some of the worst tornado damage I have ever seen. Their infrastructure was decimated, but because Illinois did not meet one of FEMA's criteria, we were denied Federal public assistance.  In the case of last week's tornado in Ottawa and Naplate, Illinois, may not even be able to request federal help because damage assessments are too low to reach anything close to FEMA's per capita requirement. But for these small towns, covering losses and cleaning up damage of this magnitude can put a real strain on the community.  The Fairness in Federal Disaster Declaration seeks to improve the disaster analysis by assigning a value to each of the factors FEMA must consider when determining whether Federal disaster assistance will be made available. When it comes to individual assistance--funding to help people repair and rebuild their homes--the breakdown would be as follows:  Concentration of damages--the density of damage in an individual community--would be considered 20 percent of the analysis. Trauma--the loss of life and injuries and the disruption of normal community functions--would be 20 percent. Special Populations--including the age and income of the residents, the amount of home ownership, etc.--would comprise 20 percent. Voluntary agency assistance--a consideration of what the volunteer and charitable groups are providing--would make up 5 percent. The amount of Insurance coverage--20 percent. And average amount of individual assistance by State, which includes the per capita analysis, would make up 5 percent of the analysis.  The bill also would add a seventh consideration to FEMA's metrics--the economics of the area, which will receive 10 percent consideration. This includes factors such as the local assessable tax base, the median income as it compares to that of the State, and the poverty rate as it compares to that of the  For Federal public assistance, the breakdown would be similar, with a greater emphasis placed on the localized impacts of the disaster, which would warrant 40 percent of the analysis.  It is reasonable that FEMA should take into consideration the size of the State requesting assistance, but current regulations penalize large Assigning values to the factors will help ensure that the damage to a specific community weighs more than a State's population.  Illinois is a geographically large State with a concentrated urban area. And downstate communities are being punished for it.  If the cities of Ottawa and Naplate, Washington and Gifford, and Harrisburg and Ridgway cannot qualify under FEMA's current criteria for Federal assistance, something is wrong. The way FEMA evaluates whether to declare an area Federal disaster is not effective. It is working against small communities in States with large populations.

718,topic-id,1833,"Mr.President, today, Senator Wicker of Mississippi and I are reintroducing the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program This bill, named for a mentor of mine--the late Senator from Illinois, embodies a vision Paul Simon believed in throughout his life: a vision centered on our country's need for a culturally aware, and globally knowledgeable population and workforce.  Senator Simon saw these characteristics as essential to our country's economy, society, and national security. He believed that by building meaningful relationships with people around the world, America would grow even stronger as a nation. In his words, ``America's incompetence in foreign languages and cultural awareness jeopardizes our Nation's future in global affairs. This lack of global perspective damages America's ability to compete in world markets. The more our country becomes competent in foreign languages and cultures, the more enhanced our foreign policy decisions will become.''  He also believed that to truly be educated, our students needed more than a minimal understanding of the world around them. To be truly educated, they need to immerse themselves in the beliefs, customs, language, and environment of a culture other than their own. I share these beliefs with Senator Simon and many Republicans in this Chamber share them as well.  At a time when there are calls from some to shut out immigrants and refugees and pull away from other parts of the world, these beliefs are more important than ever. We need to continue to give our young people the opportunity to interact with people from all over the world, so they can develop their own informed opinions and beliefs.  Undergraduate study abroad programs are a popular source for this type of engagement. Unfortunately, far too few students take advantage or have the means to take advantage of this opportunity. Annually, less than 2 percent of undergraduate students participate in study abroad.  Those who do study abroad don't reflect the incredible diversity of our postsecondary institutions. Minority students, first-generation college students, community college students, and students with disabilities are significantly underrepresented in the study abroad population. These students miss out on the valuable personal and educational growth that comes from a study abroad experience, including interacting with other cultures, developing foreign language skills, and expanding international knowledge through firsthand experience.  We also know that those who currently study abroad do so mostly in highly developed countries. In fact, over 50 percent of students who study abroad each year do so in Increasing the diversity of study abroad destinations to include countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, South America, and Latin America will help American students develop a global perspective and build the insight and skills needed to better understand the global challenges of the 21st century.  In 2004, Congress took the first step towards expanding study abroad when it authorized the Commission on Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program to provide recommendations to Congress and the President on expanding study abroad programs.  The Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program Act combines the vision of Senator Simon with the recommendations of the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad It establishes a competitive grant program for institutions of higher education to encourage the sustainable expansion of study abroad opportunities for students in the United  Over the next 10 years, this grant program aims to increase the number of undergraduate students stud g abroad each year to one million students. It also emphasizes increasing opportunities for nontraditional students, minority students, and students with disabilities so that the demographics of students who study abroad more closely reflect the population of current undergraduate students.  This bill also focuses on getting students to study abroad in nontraditional destinations particularly in developing countries. We need to send more students to developing nations because these are the places that America needs to better understand. This legislation takes important steps toward expanding and diversifying participation in study abroad.  Senator Wicker and I are pleased to be joined today in introducing this bill by Senators Reed, Cochran, Merkley, and I am also pleased that several organizations have endorsed this bill including the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, the Association of International Educators, the American Council on Education, the Association of American Universities, and the Hispanic Association of Colleges and  In today's increasingly interconnected world, study abroad participation is an important element of a meaningful undergraduate education. Expanded access to study abroad opportunities is necessary to prepare the next generation of Americans with the global knowledge and skills needed to succeed. I hope other colleagues will join us in that effort.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 601       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Study      Abroad Program Act of 2017''.     2.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) To prepare students for success in the modern global      economy, opportunities for study abroad should be included as      part of a well-rounded education.       (2) Study abroad programs provide students with      unparalleled access to international knowledge, an unmatched      opportunity to learn foreign languages, and a unique      environment for developing cultural understanding, all of      which are knowledge and skills needed in today's global      economy.       (3) Less than 2 percent of all enrolled postsecondary      students in the United States study abroad for credit in any      given year, and minority students, first generation college      students, community college students, and students with      disabilities are significantly underrepresented in study      abroad participation.       (4) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission      on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program      pursuant to section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations      and Offsets Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199).      Pursuant to its mandate, the Lincoln Commission submitted to      Congress and the President a report of its recommendations      for greatly expanding the opportunity for students at      institutions of higher education in the United States to      study abroad, with special emphasis on studying in developing      nations.       (5) According to the Lincoln Commission, ``[e]xperience      shows that leadership from administrators and faculty will      drive the number of study abroad participants higher and      improve the quality of programs. Such leadership is the only      way that study abroad will become an integral part of the      undergraduate experience.''. A competitive grant program is      necessary to encourage and support such leadership.     3.       The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to ensure that significantly more students have access      to quality study abroad opportunities;       (2) to ensure that the diversity of students studying      abroad reflects the diversity of students and institutions of      higher education in the United States;       (3) to encourage greater diversity in study abroad      destinations by increasing the portion of study abroad that      takes place in nontraditional study abroad destinations,      especially in developing countries; and       (4) to encourage a greater commitment by institutions of      higher education to expand study abroad opportunities.     4.

869,topic-id,4044,"Mr.President, last Friday, I went to Rockford, IL, and had a roundtable discussion about healthcare. There is a lot of debate about healthcare in the Congress and certainly in What I have tried to do is to take this issue home and ask the people who actually are responsible for providing healthcare, and the people I represent, what they think about the new Republican alternative to the Affordable Care What I found is that with virtually no exceptions, they are all gravely concerned that the changes that are going to be made to the healthcare system in America, which represents a dramatic portion of our economy, could have a very negative impact on the real lives of people across my State and across the  Hospital administrators were there to talk about this issue. Swedish Covenant is one of the hospitals well known and respected in the area; OSF as well, and the administrators of both of these hospitals talked about the negative impacts of cutting back Medicaid coverage.  What the Republicans are suggesting in their proposal is that the expansion of Medicaid to provide health insurance for low-income Americans would continue until 2020 and then be cut off, and, they would argue, we will make it more cost efficient. We will let the Governors come up with alternatives. Well, the Governors aren't very happy with this because they know the cost of healthcare continues to go up and they are fearful that when you try to put this all together, the net result is fewer people covered by  Over 600,000 people, because of ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act--in Illinois now have health insurance. Who are they? Well, I met Ray Ray, a big Polish American fellow from Chicago, is a musician, and he has made most of his income during his life doing work as a musician. Ray Romanowski, in his 60s today, has never had health insurance until now. Because of the Affordable Care Act, he qualifies for Medicaid, and because he has Medicaid--he patted his wallet and said: I finally have that card in my wallet where I can walk into a hospital or a clinic and get good treatment.  It is the first time in his life, and he is in his sixties.  Judy is a friend of mine in Southern Illinois, and she works at local motels there--in hospitality--at places where they serve breakfast to you. She gets up early in the morning. She is a hard-working lady. It is the kind of job she has had her entire life, and she never, ever had health insurance--not once. She worked 20, 30, 40 hours a week, sometimes two different jobs, but never with health insurance. Now she has it because of the Affordable Care Act, and thank goodness she does because she has been diagnosed with diabetes and she needs that kind of care.  So what happened before, when people like Ray and Judy got sick? Before the Affordable Care Act, they would show up in the hospital, go to the emergency room, and they would get treatment, but they wouldn't be able to pay for it. What happens to those expenses at hospitals, under the old way of doing things? They are passed along. The rest of us pay. Anyone who has health insurance and goes in for treatment, part of it is going to be what your treatment is or for your family; the other part is to make up the difference for charity care, uncompensated care.[[Page S1759]]  Now the Republicans believe they have a new idea: Let's restrict access to Let's restrict the health insurance that is available to people like Ray and Well, they are still going to get sick, and they are still going to come to the hospital, and their costs are going to be passed along to others.  The Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, a neighbor from the State of Wisconsin, said that it is all about competition and choice. Well, when it came to competition and choice, Ray and Judy didn't have a chance. They just didn't make enough money. But they did get coverage under the Affordable Care Act, and they stand to see that coverage endangered, if not lost, under this new approach.  We also had representatives of the nursing association in These are women and men who are the most respected medical providers. Just take a look and ask whether people have higher respect for doctors or whomever; it is always the nurses, 1, because the nurses are the ones who are there day in and day out, hour after hour, in the hospital rooms with the people we love who desperately need medical care. The nurses are opposed to this Republican replacement plan as well.  The doctors--the American Medical Association and the Illinois State Medical Society--are also opposed to it because they looked at the Republican competition and choice alternative and said that at the end of the day, fewer people will have health insurance and the costs will go up dramatically for some. We had a representative of the American Association of Retired Persons there, and they are especially opposed to it. Why? We had a provision in the Affordable Care Act which said that the disparity in premiums can never be more than 3 to 1. Well, the Republicans decided as part of their replacement to make that 5 to 1. Who is going to pay five times instead of three times the base premium? Seniors, those over the age of 55. The Republicans built this into their proposal, and AARP has come out against it.  The second thing to go is--the Affordable Care Act has really brought some savings to healthcare; we wish there were more. But that savings in healthcare is translated into 10 more years of solvency for Medicare is a lifeline for 40 million or 50 million So we gave it 10 more years of solvency with the changes in the Affordable Care Now we are waiting for a score from the Congressional Budget Office, but the early indications are we are going to lose 4 years of solvency in Medicare because the Republicans want to bring in ``competition and choice.'' It turns out that phrase is not going to be good for the future of Medicare--one of the other reasons the American Association of Retired Persons opposes the Republican proposal to replace the Affordable Care  This bill will be scored this week by the Congressional Budget It was interesting to watch the Sunday shows and watch the procession of Republicans calling themselves fiscal conservatives who came in and discounted any conclusions from the Congressional Budget  When we wrote the Affordable Care Act, we waited sometimes for weeks for the Congressional Budget Office to give us a score: Is this bill going to add to the deficit or reduce the deficit? We had to wait to find out. Is this bill going to cover more people with health insurance or not? We had to wait to find out. But the Republicans went ahead with their proposal without a Congressional Budget Office score, and what they have done over the weekend is downplay the credibility of an office which Democrats and Republicans have relied on for decades. It shows that they are very concerned. I think they know what they are going to find. They are afraid it is going to add to the deficit and it is going to dramatically reduce health insurance for  There are some who estimate that 10 million to 15 million Americans could lose their health insurance. That is half of all of those in the past 6 years who have gained health insurance. It would also increase out-of-pocket healthcare costs for the average person--the Republican plan would--by $1,500 a year, seniors paying approximately $5,000 more a year because of that 5-to-1 premium change that I mentioned earlier. It would basically end Medicaid as we know it.  The Governors are telling us that this is a bad idea because it would shift the cost onto the families and to the Governors to find ways to save money.  It would shorten the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 4 years.  It would allow insurers to once again charge older people significantly more than younger people for health insurance.  And--Republicans added a little grace note there--they defund Planned Parenthood and cut 12 percent of the funding for the Centers for Disease Control and  Here is something my colleagues may not know. Because of family planning efforts in America, in the last 30 years, we are now at the lowest point in teenage pregnancies and the lowest point in unplanned pregnancies. So information and education are paying off to reduce unwanted pregnancies, unplanned pregnancies, and, I might add, the likelihood of abortions. So now, as the Republicans say we are going to defund Planned Parenthood for hundreds of thousands of women, that means stopping their access to the healthcare they trust across So in the name of choice, the Republican plan reduces choices for women when it comes to healthcare by defunding Planned  To top it off, the bill cuts taxes for the very wealthy. Those making over $1 million a year in income get a $50,000 tax cut because of the Republican proposal for this new health insurance approach. If you happen to be in the wealthiest 0.1 percent of Americans, the average tax cut is nearly $200,000. They just can't help themselves.  We put together a revenue source so that we could dramatically expand health insurance coverage in this We now have the lowest percentage of uninsured Americans in our history, and the Republicans--because they are opposed to it--have said: We are going to cut the taxes that help people pay for their health insurance, and we are going to reduce the options that are available to them. So for Americans, it means less coverage, higher costs.  We will see when it goes to the House of Representatives on the floor. The most conservative Republicans don't like it; certainly the Democrats don't like it. The question is whether Speaker Paul Ryan has enough votes. It has united The Republican approach has united America, in opposition. I don't know of a major health-providing group that supports it--not one; not doctors, not hospitals, not clinics, not Patients' groups all say the same thing about  The American Medical Association said:       We cannot support the [bill] as drafted because of the      expected decline in health insurance coverage and the      potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient      populations.  The American Medical Association goes on to say:       We are concerned with the proposed rollback of the Medicaid      expansion. . . . Medicaid expansion has proven highly      successful in providing coverage for lower income      individuals.       The AMA cannot support provisions that repeal the      Prevention and Public Health Trust Fund . . . and we cannot      support provisions that prevent Americans from choosing to      receive care from physicians and qualified providers . . .      [including] those associated with Planned Parenthood      affiliates.  The American Medical Association is saying to the Republicans that they reject their proposal for healthcare and is warning them not to cut off funding for Planned  What does the American Hospital Association say?       We cannot support the [bill]--  the Republican bill--     in its current form.       In addition to the lack of a CBO score, we have some      additional policy concerns with the proposal.       For example, it appears that the effort to restructure the      Medicaid program will have the effect of making significant      reductions in a program that provides services to our most      vulnerable populations.  That is from the American Hospital They estimate that in our State of Illinois, we could lose up to 90,000 jobs by repealing the Affordable Care Act without a suitable substitute--90,000 jobs in my President Trump made a lot of news when he went to visit one of the manufacturing companies after he was first[[Page S1760]]sworn in and saved a couple hundred jobs. Well, I am glad he saved those jobs. I hope he saves a lot more. But if he is going to eliminate 90,000 jobs in my State--people who work at hospitals, some of the best-paying jobs in downstate communities--for goodness sake, that isn't hiring It isn't really focusing on creating jobs in this country. It is just the opposite.  Here is what the American Nurses Association says about the Republican bill:       [The bill] threatens health care affordability, access, and      delivery for individuals across the nation. . . . [T]he bill      changes Medicaid to a per capita cap funding model,      eliminates the Prevention . . . Fund, restricts millions of      women from access to critical health services, repeals income      based subsidies that millions of people rely on. These      changes in no way will improve care for the American people.  What about the U.Conference of Mayors? Here is what they said:       States will be forced to end coverage and eliminate health      care for low-income seniors, people with disabilities,      children, and working families.       The GOP plan is bad for cities, bad for people who live in      cities and bad for people who provide healthcare in      cities.  It is interesting. We had a representative at a Rockford meeting of the disabled community. They are scared to death of this Republican alternative because these folks many times are in serious need of very expensive healthcare. If they are pushed off into these so-called money-saving insurance plans that really are empty inside and don't provide coverage, it could be devastating to these families. They have been through it over and over.  The American Association of Retired Persons said:       This Republican bill would weaken Medicare's fiscal      sustainability, dramatically increase health care costs for      Americans aged 50-64 and put at risk the health care of      millions of children and adults with disabilities, and poor      seniors who depend on the Medicaid program for long-term      services and supports.       It could hasten the insolvency of Medicare by up to 4 years      and diminish Medicare's ability to pay for services in the      future.  I remember when Candidate Donald Trump was telling us he would do nothing to hurt Now the first major piece of legislation that comes up threatens the solvency of  Here is what the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare said:       [We] oppose the . . . bill to repeal the Affordable Care      Act because it would weaken Medicare's solvency . . .      threaten access to Medicaid long-term care benefits, and      require ``near seniors'' to pay more for less health care      coverage. The . . . bill puts seniors and people with      disabilities at significant risk of ending up uninsured or      losing access to needed care.  In my own State, the Illinois Health and Hospital Association says:       [This organization] has serious concerns with the direction      of the [bill]. It would cut coverage for hundreds of      thousands of Illinoisans and impose a cap on . . . federal      Medicaid funding--our state is unable to absorb funding cuts      without impacting healthcare for all patients.  I was surprised last week when the Republican Governor of Illinois, Bruce Rauner, said of the Republican plan: ``My first blush read is Illinois won't do very well under the changes that they're recommending.''  He is very careful not to say things about Federal legislation. This he understands: Cutting back on Medicaid is going to impose a new debt on our State and reduce coverage for hundreds of thousands of people in our  So we said to the Republicans: You want to repeal the Affordable Care Act; you have been dead set on doing this for 6 years. Please come up with an alternative that at least expands the coverage of health insurance and makes it more affordable. They tried, and they failed. But now they are going to push it through as a matter of showing political purity. They don't care that there is not a single group of medical providers in this country who support their plan. They obviously don't care that the American Association of Retired Persons believes this is not good for seniors across the board.  I heard the Director of OMB say: Oh, that group--they are going to end up opposing this and then they are going to ask people to donate. Well, it is true that they live on donations. But they are taking a bold position in saying that the Republican approach is going to hurt seniors across Talk to the disability community, and you will hear exactly the same thing. Talk to the advocates for children.  I am really looking for the first group to stand up and say that this new Republican approach is good for this country or good for people when it comes to the cost or availability of health insurance, and I haven't found it yet. I don't know what they are waiting on, but they can't produce it.  What we are looking for is just the opposite. If you will take repeal of the Affordable Care Act off the table, I will pull up a chair. It is not perfect, it can be improved, and I am ready to sit down and do it on a bipartisan basis. But it is ``our way or the highway'' when it comes to the Republican majority on this bill. I hope we can do better. I think the American people expect us to do better.  At the end of the day, they want a better healthcare system, not one that is worse--not one that supposedly gives them ``competition and choice,'' yet they have less coverage in their insurance policies and end up paying more for it.           Calling for an Independent, Bipartisan Commission  Mr.President, I have been coming to the floor recently to discuss the Russian involvement in our last Presidential election. Remember that 2 months ago, some 14 different intelligence agencies all came to the same conclusion--that Vladimir Putin and the Russians were trying to impact the outcome of the Presidential election.  The intelligence reports, which were unclassified and available to the public, said expressly that the Russian intent was to defeat Hillary Clinton and to elect Donald I quickly add, this was not a report from the Democratic National Committee; it was a report from our intelligence agencies. They went through all the efforts taken by the Republicans when they were hacking into computers and releasing information during the course of the campaign.  I think this is serious business. It is the first time I know of that a foreign power has tried to influence the outcome of an American Presidential election. People in Eastern Europe and people in many parts of this world are used to the Russians getting involved in their campaigns, trying to run their favorite candidates and elect them. We shouldn't have to put up with that in the United States of America, so many of us have called for a real investigation of what the Russians were up to.  I think we ought to have a bipartisan commission--an independent, transparent commission to look into the involvement of the Russians; otherwise, we are sitting ducks for them to try it again 2 years from now, in the next election. We know--and this is public information--there were at least 1,000 people sitting at computers in Moscow, trying to hack into America to try to find enough information that they could release to influence the outcome of the election. They are not going to quit. They are going to continue to do this. The question is, What will we do about it?  We have already seen the National Security Advisor to the President, General Flynn, resign when he misled the American people and Vice President Pence about conversations he had with the Just 2 weeks ago, we saw that the Attorney General of the United States, Jeff Sessions, recused himself from investigations involving Russia in the campaign because of conversations he had had, which he didn't disclose before the Senate Judiciary  Almost every week there are more disturbing revelations emerging--not by any honest or open disclosure, mind you, but about the curious alliance among President Trump and the inner circle and Vladimir Putin, if there were one. Key figures, such as the National Security Advisor I mentioned and the current Attorney General, were caught not disclosing communications with the Allied intelligence reportedly confirms that members of the Trump campaign had repeated communications with those thought to be in Russian intelligence. Close Trump associate Roger Stone appeared to have advance knowledge of when Russian-hacked information of Hillary Clinton was going to be released by WikiLeaks, something he presumably could have known only if he was at least discussing it with the Russian hackers.  All the while, the administration has been saying nothing about Putin's actions, about this attack on the United[[Page S1761]]States, or about Russia's ongoing cyber and military aggression in In fact, instead of addressing and responding to this Russian attack head-on, the President has incredibly been parroting Russian strategic interests instead.  Let me repeat that from my largely silent Republican colleagues--and there have been a few exceptions, but most of them will not come to the floor to even discuss this matter. The American President, the same party of Ronald Reagan, has failed to acknowledge this major attack on our Nation and has refused to take action in response. How is this possible? Why is the majority party so silent in the face of these major national security issues?  There is a simple way to resolve these questions:  First, President Trump should do what every Presidential candidate has done in modern history and disclose his tax returns. Why won't he do that? What is in there that is so worrisome to him that he has defied all requests from media and from others across this Nation for him to do exactly what every other Presidential candidate has done?  The President should also be totally cooperative with any investigation about campaign contacts, including by his former campaign manager Paul Manafort; Michael Flynn, his former National Security Advisor; and his former foreign policy adviser, Carter How do we explain repeated reports of these contacts between that campaign and Russian intelligence?  The administration also needs to answer questions about Roger Stone's comments that suggest he had knowledge of WikiLeaks having and using, in strategically timed releases around periods when the campaign was struggling, the information that had been hacked by the  Tell us why the administration has criticized hundreds by Twitter when there is any perceived slight--from entire States to Major League Baseball to United Steelworkers--but not the Communist KGB agent who conducted an attack on our Nation and democracy.  We need to know why they not only repeatedly denied intelligence information about Russian attacks but, in fact, in July of last year encouraged Russia to hack into their opponent's campaign.  All of these things are being watched closely by nations around the world. Several weeks ago, I went over to Poland, Lithuania, and One of the Polish leaders said to me: We're watching. If you don't take the Russian invasion of your Presidential election seriously, how will you take the Russian invasion of our country seriously? It is a legitimate question because the Russians are up to a strategy that we have seen over and over again. This time, the Americans were the victims.  We need full cooperation by the White We need an independent commission. I have suggested we pick people who are beyond reproach, people we can trust. I mentioned General Colin Powell, a man who served our country so honorably in the military, then served in the Republican White House, and then served as a Republican Secretary of I would accept Colin Powell as the head of a commission to get to the bottom of this because it is a national security issue, which he has undoubtedly had some background in dealing with in years gone by.  There are many good people to turn to, but until we get the straight answers, we can expect the Russians to continue to try to find ways to invade our political process.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

957,topic-id,3355,"Mr.President, last week congressional Republicans finally unveiled their proposal to replace the Affordable Care The Affordable Care Act is a law passed by Congress a little over 6 years ago with the express goal of expanding the number of Americans with the protection of health insurance. It has been successful. We have the lowest percentage of uninsured Americans in history. What it means is that through offering Medicaid to those in low-income categories, offering help to pay premiums for those in middle-income categories, and offering choices in the insurance exchange, we have really changed health insurance in America in 6 years.  Now Americans realize that when they take a look at their actual health insurance policy, it is worth something. It may be hard to remember--but we should--that only 6 years ago, if you happened to have a child with a preexisting condition and you were not lucky enough to have your insurance through your employer and you went out on the open market, you were in for a rough ride. Many health insurance companies would not insure a family with a child who had a history of diabetes or surviving cancer. We changed that. We said that no health insurance company in America can discriminate against a person or family because of a preexisting medical condition. Is there one of us who lives in a family which doesn't have a relative, a close relative, with a preexisting condition? That was an important reform that was part of the Affordable Care Act,  We also came to realize they were selling health insurance to people with some fine print that made a difference--lifetime limits on coverage. Well, I have $1 million coverage. That sounds great, until the next diagnosis or the next accident. Now, $1 million doesn't seem like such a large amount of money, and God forbid you end up with a chronic illness.  One of my constituents came by to visit me 2 weeks ago. She was a guest of one of the Members of Congress during the President's speech to the joint session. She was diagnosed a few years ago with an unusual disease, one that is life-threatening at any given moment. She told me that in the past 3 years, she has spent more than $700,000 on medication--$700,000--and that will be a burden she faces for the rest of her life.  If her health insurance had a limit on how much it paid, there would reach a point where she couldn't buy the medicine she needs to save her life. We did away with that, and we said: You can't discriminate against people by putting these limits. We also said: When it comes to charging premiums, you can't discriminate against a person applying for health insurance solely because they happen to be a woman.  There has been a lot of controversy over that in the House in their debate over the last week or so, but what we said basically is that when it comes to insurance risk, put everyone in together, make this a bigger pool of people seeking health insurance so insurance can be profitable and affordable at the same time.  We also said: When it comes to the premiums charged on health insurance--and I call attention to all of us over the age of 50--we said you cannot discriminate in premiums you charge in health insurance. There can't be a disparity of more than 3 to 1 for the most expensive health insurance policy to the least expensive. We also said, in addition to that, if you have a child, son or daughter, graduating college and looking for a job but has no healthcare benefits, keep them on your family plan until they reach the age of 26. I have been through that. Most families have.  I had a recent college graduate, no longer with student health insurance, and I said: Jennifer, do you have health insurance?  Dad, I feel just great.  No father wants to hear that answer. So we changed the law.  When it came to Medicare, under the Affordable Care Act, we said: We are going to eliminate the gap in coverage for prescription drugs for seniors. They used to call it the doughnut hole. It made no sense. It was something only Congress could dream up. We closed it and said: We are going to give seamless coverage to Medicare prescription drugs. That was part of the Affordable Care  We put in incentives for people providing medical care to find ways to give us good quality care and reduce the cost. What was the net result? The slowest growth in hospitalization premiums for employer-based healthcare that we have seen in modern times.  When they put this new model for healthcare against the Medicare Program--that is a program for seniors and disabled--guess what. It bought 10 years of solvency for That[[Page S1785]]meant a program that is critically important for 60 million Americans had 10 more years of solvency.  Did this program have problems? Of course it did. When you take on the healthcare system of America, you are not going to get it completely right the first time. I believed--and many others did--that as important and valuable as that vote was, we had to be prepared to return to this program to make sure we addressed problems as they would arise.  For example, there is nothing in the Affordable Care Act of substance when it comes to controlling the price of pharmaceuticals--prescription drugs.  Well, I can tell you what has happened. Blue Cross Blue Shield in Chicago came to see me, and the CEO said: Blue Cross Blue Shield is now paying more for prescription drugs than we are paying for inpatient hospital care. The cost of drugs has gone through the roof. The net result of that, of course, is the cost of healthcare goes up too. The Affordable Care Act should have addressed that but did not.  We also had to find a way to make sure there was health insurance available all around the United Some companies jumped in; some jumped out. Many of us believe we should have a single-payer plan available in every part of America so you could choose for your family a Medicare-type plan if you wish. Otherwise, you would go to a private health insurance company, if you wish. It is your choice.  The Republicans opposed the Affordable Care In the House, they voted against it 57, 58 times--I lose count. Then came the day when they had the majority in the Senate, in the House, and in the White House--the answer to their prayers. Now, once and for all, they can get rid of the Affordable Care They have the votes, but then there was a problem.  People across America started asking: If you repeal it, what will happen next? Will I still be able to get health insurance? Will I be protected if I have a preexisting condition? Will there be limits on what the policy covers?  Well, they hadn't quite thought that far ahead to look for the substitute, to look for the replacement. So they went to work in a matter of 5 or 6 weeks and created what is now being considered by the House of Representatives--the Republican replacement plan.  The Congressional Budget Office is a nonpartisan office that takes a look at our bills and legislation and puts a score on them. How much is it going to cost? What is it going to do?  We waited for Congressional Budget Office scores over and over again when we wrote the Affordable Care They would come in and say: Nope, you have to go back to the drawing board. You have to change this and change that.  Well, just this week, they came out with the score on the Republican replacement plan, the one to replace the Affordable Care They took a look at it, and here is what they told us.  To start off with, the Republican replacement plan throws people off health insurance coverage. How many? Remember when President Trump said the GOP healthcare bill would have ``insurance for everybody''? Under TrumpCare, the new Republican plan, TrumpCare, 14 million people would lose their health coverage next year. By 2026, 24 million people will have lost their healthcare coverage.  Is this what we were looking for in the replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act, to say to 24 million Americans, you will no longer have health insurance coverage? Think about the outcome of that. Think about someone with a chronically ill child or someone who faces a chronic illness themself with no health insurance.  Think about a working person who has no health insurance where they work. At least they had coverage through Medicaid and perhaps through the insurance exchange with a subsidy. Now they are losing it.  Think about those same people without health insurance. They will still get sick and will still go to the hospital but will be unable to pay. Incidentally, their bills they can't pay, we pay. Those bills are passed on to everyone else.  So the first plank of the Republican TrumpCare, according to the Congressional Budget Office, is to eliminate health insurance for 24 million In addition, the Republican TrumpCare plan significantly raises premium costs on seniors.  According to the official Congressional Budget Office estimate, the bill will ``substantially raise premiums for older people.'' How does that happen? Well, in addition to cutting back on the financial assistance for seniors to buy health insurance, TrumpCare would allow insurance companies to charge older people significantly more than the Affordable Care Remember the limit, the 3-to-1 limit on premiums that we built into the Affordable Care Act? TrumpCare says: No, make that 5 to 1. So it means, if you are over the age of 50, buying health insurance, your premiums can go up dramatically, according to the Congressional Budget  There is another thing too. As we take more and more people off of health insurance coverage, it really, in a way, dampens the incentive for affordable healthcare so the costs are not contained as they are today, and the solvency of Medicare--which we said was 10 years more, remember that--they reduce it by 4 years.  What the Republican TrumpCare plan has done is it threatens the solvency of Is that what we were looking for on the repeal of the Affordable Care Act? I don't think so.  TrumpCare also raises costs for lower and middle-income families. By repealing the cost-sharing subsidies and lowering the bar on health plans, the Congressional Budget Office says that lower and middle-class families shopping in the individual market should expect to see--and I quote from the report--``substantially increasing out-of-pocket costs.''  The bill also defunds Planned Parenthood, which was to be expected. We expected it in many bills. According to the Congressional Budget Office, defunding of Planned Parenthood would ``affect services that help women avert pregnancies . . . most likely residing in areas without other health care clinics or medical practitioners who serve low-income populations.'' The Congressional Budget Office projects that 15 percent of those people--again, these are lower income women in medically underserved areas of America--would lose access to care.  Also, TrumpCare, at the same time it does this--eliminates health insurance for 24 million, raises the premium costs, and defunds Planned For good measure, TrumpCare also provides tax cuts to the wealthiest people in Is that what we were looking for? Was that part of the bargain? Those making over $1 million a year in income will get a $50,000 tax cut from the TrumpCare bill. The wealthiest one-tenth of 1 percent get a tax cut of nearly $200,000.  Finally, while cutting taxes for the very rich, TrumpCare also slashes $880 billion in Medicaid spending over the next 10 years. Medicaid is a vital healthcare program. Most people think about Medicaid--oh, that is health insurance for the poor. It is. But who are the poor? Overwhelmingly in numbers, they are children and their moms who are in low-income groups. That is the biggest number, but the biggest expense for Medicaid isn't kids and their moms. It is grandma and grandpa. It is our families and parents who are in an assisted care home who have Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to get by.  These cuts by the Republicans and TrumpCare to Medicaid will be felt by families across the board. In addition, it means that those who represent States like mine and the Presiding Officer's, with rural populations that have small hospitals that depend on patients paying something when they come through the door--many of them are paying through Medicaid, and if Medicaid is reduced, the payments to the hospitals are reduced.  That is why the Illinois Hospital Association warns us against The Illinois Hospital Association says it will threaten the hospitals of my They will not be receiving the Medicaid reimbursement. They believe that up to 90,000 jobs at these hospitals will be lost in I will tell you, as a downstater, those are some of the best paying jobs in the community. Many of my small towns trying to keep businesses or attract businesses brag up their hospital, as they should, and now TrumpCare threatens the future of these hospitals.[[Page S1786]]  Medicaid is a vital healthcare program for 65 million Americans--seniors, persons with disabilities, children, and low-income families nationwide, 3 million of them in my TrumpCare would devastate the program. By 2026, according to the Congressional Budget Office, 14 million fewer people would have  The Affordable Care Act took a lot of good steps toward improving healthcare for seniors. Before the Affordable Care Act, the number of uninsured adults ages 50 to 64 rose substantially--growing from 3.7 million in 2000 to 8.9 million in 2010. Insurance companies were rejecting more than one in five applications from individuals between the ages of 50 and 64.  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the rate of uninsured adults ages 50 to 64 dropped 47.4 percent, from 11.6 percent to 6.1 percent. The largest reduction in the uninsured rate occurred in the States that chose to expand  The Affordable Care Act also prohibited insurers from denying coverage, as I said earlier, to people with preexisting conditions. It limited how much insurers can charge older enrollees, closed the doughnut hole, and made important preventive services available for free, such as colonoscopies and annual checkups.  Let's look at what the TrumpCare program--the Republican program--does to seniors. It allows insurers to charge older people significantly more than younger people, it reduces tax credits to seniors who pay their premiums, and it would devastate the Medicaid Program, which helps to pay for two out of every three seniors in nursing home care.  There is another thing I want to make a note of. Many years ago in the Senate, back at that corner desk, sat a Senator from Minnesota named Paul Wellstone, a Over here on the aisle sat Pete Domenici of New Mexico, a For years they argued that we should include in every health insurance plan in America coverage for mental health, and the insurance companies fought them. Because many mental health conditions are chronic and long-term and may, in some cases, be expensive, they didn't want them. But Wellstone and Domenici had family members who struggled with mental illness, and they said we need to include this in every health insurance plan. Thank goodness they finally prevailed. Every health insurance plan in this country has to treat physical health issues and mental health issues the same, thanks to Wellstone and thanks to  In addition they added something that many of us overlooked: It said mental health and substance abuse treatment. What does that mean? It means that if some member of your family is addicted, your health insurance plan can help pay for the help they need to get rid of their addiction. For a lot of people it was the only place for them to turn, and it worked, and thank goodness it did, because we are at that moment in American history where because of opioids, heroin, and fentanyl, we have dramatic increases in addiction.  Now what is going to happen under the TrumpCare approach when it comes to mental illness and substance abuse treatment? Are we going to require--mandate--every health insurance plan to include mental health treatment as well as substance abuse? Over and over we hear from our Republican friends: We want competition. We want choice. We want to eliminate mandates.  They can take that approach, but we are going to lose coverage for 24 million If they take that approach, we are going to be offering health insurance plans that aren't there when families need them.  We had a roundtable discussion in Rockford, IL, last When I go to these communities, I bring in people who are administrators of the hospitals, the doctors, the nurses, the clinics, the substance abuse treatment centers. To a person, they oppose Every single one of them said that it is the wrong thing to do at this moment in time. It will leave people more vulnerable. It will leave families with health insurance that is worthless when they need it. Those are the bad old days we finally escaped 6 years ago, and now Republicans want us to return to this competition-choice access to healthcare. I have access to a Rolls Royce dealership, too, but I am not going to be buying a Rolls Royce because I can't afford it. If you give a person access to health insurance that they can't afford, you are not giving them anything.  What we tried to do with the Affordable Care Act is to make sure we gave people not only access but protection with health insurance. From the beginning, the Republicans have said: Let's repeal the Affordable Care Now they have found that replacing it is a lot harder than they ever expected.  I said from the beginning, as well, if the Republicans are willing to take repeal off the table, I am going to pull up a chair. If they want a bipartisan approach, an honest approach to making the Affordable Care Act better, let's sit down and talk. Sign me up. If the goal is to give more people good health insurance that they can afford to protect their families, if the goal is to find ways to give us better healthcare, quality results at a lower cost, I want to be a part of that conversation. But if the goal is to deny health insurance coverage to 24 million Americans, count me out. That to me is a step backward in time.  What comes next? If the Republicans do this to the Affordable Care Act, what is next--Medicare? Well, we happen to know the Secretary of Health and Human Services believes in privatizing I don't. I think that is a step in the wrong direction, and it will reduce the protection of But if they will do this to the Affordable Care Act, then can Medicare or Social Security be far behind?  It is important that we maintain our values when it comes to critical programs that America and its families count on.  I hope the House of Representatives defeats TrumpCare, puts it out of its misery, and then invites all of us to come together on a bipartisan basis to talk about what we really need for healthcare in this country.  I find it incredible that there is no major medical group in America today that supports TrumpCare--none, not one. All we have is some conservative think tanks that believe this is a wonderful model. But the people on the ground--the administrators in the hospitals, the doctors, the clinicians, the nurses, the people in the healthcare clinics--all tell us TrumpCare is a disaster. It is a step in the wrong direction. It is going to decrease coverage and increase costs. That is not something that America needs for its future.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

969,topic-id,587,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to talk about another rule the Republicans want to overturn instead of working with Democrats to create jobs. This rule outlines when State unemployment agencies can drug test applicants for unemployment benefits.  Today there are roughly 7.6 million Americans who are unemployed, and over 2 million of these unemployed Americans are collecting unemployment insurance. About 150,000 of these people live in  Unemployment insurance benefits provide a lifeline to many workers and families who are struggling to make ends meet. If this resolution passes, my Republican colleagues will succeed in preventing hard-working Americans from receiving these benefits, and they will succeed in making it more difficult for unemployed Americans to find work.  This past August, the Department of Labor finalized a rule that explains when State unemployment agencies can subject unemployment benefit applicants to a drug test. The rule clarifies which occupations regularly conduct drug testing, as established by the Department of Labor, to help State programs that conduct drug testing.  This rule makes sure States have the guidance they need to implement drug testing requirements in a fair and legal[[Page S1794]]mariner, but if this partisan CRA is signed into law, it will undo a bipartisan compromise that was created to ensure equitable access to unemployment benefits.  Unemployed Americans have paid into the unemployment insurance program, and they are entitled to receive that insurance when they lose their job to circumstances beyond their control. By supporting blanket drug testing of unemployment insurance applicants, my Republican colleagues are targeting hard-working Americans who in many cases have fallen on hard times.  And let me be clear, this will make it more difficult for them to receive the benefits they have earned.  Millions of Americans around the country voted for leaders who would fight for the working class. Repealing this rule will be another broken promise to those families.  Drug testing is also expensive. In 2011, the Texas Legislative Budget Board estimated it would cost Texas $30 million over the course of just 1 year if they moved forward with a universal drug-testing policy for unemployment benefits.  When States have conducted drug testing of applicants for other government programs, like the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, very few claimants have tested positive for drug use.  My Republican colleagues say that this resolution will help save taxpayer money, but overturning the Department of Labor's rule will lead to millions of wasted taxpayer dollars on drug tests that come back negative.  This resolution isn't about saving money. It is about paving the way for lawmakers who want to drug test every American who has to file for unemployment insurance; yet these same lawmakers aren't calling for drug testing Americans that claim other Federal benefits, like tax credits or deductions on their tax returns.  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to remember: the Department of Labor's drug-testing rule is about real people who depend on unemployment insurance to live in  They need these benefits to put food on the table, to make a rent or mortgage payment, or to pay for gas to allow them to continue their job search.  When people become unemployed, it is often a result of company downsizing or outsourcing American jobs, not drug use. We should not and cannot unfairly stigmatize these workers and make it even more difficult for them to get back on their feet after becoming unemployed by undoing this regulation.  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this resolution.  ",CREC-2017-03-14-pt1-PgS1784-3.txt,326,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,14.0,March
516,topic-id,1737,"Congressman, thank you for that introduction, and thank you for your service to the Congress and the great people of  I think it is really important tonight to focus on a few key things about what is happening in One is that 20 million people stand to lose their healthcare coverage. Many have never had it, and the Republican majority is set to snatch it from their hands. That is really sad.  One of the people who come to mind is actually a young woman who works on my staff. Her name is Abby, and she is a young woman who has her whole life to look forward to, but as a young person, when she was born, she had a disease called toxoplasmosis. She doesn't mind me talking about it because what Abby would tell you if she were here is that it was tough growing up.  She had a lot of medical attention growing up. She was a good student, and she really braved all of the medical care she needed with tremendous courage, and her family was there with her the whole time. But she had numerous surgeries growing up, and she also came close to death's door on more than one occasion.  One thing that she says--and says to anybody who is willing to listen--is that the Affordable Care Act helped save her life. Why? Because Abby has a preexisting condition, a pretty serious illness. And she had insurance companies that have lifetime limits and annual limits on coverage and care.  Without the Affordable Care Act and with the provisions that preceded the Affordable Care Act in the insurance industry, she simply was uninsurable, therefore, not in a position to get the care she needed. By some miracle, she made it to adulthood with the status quo before the Affordable Care Act, but the Affordable Care Act made the difference between her being with us and not.  I was talking to a physician who operates an institution in my district called the Hennepin County Medical Center, HCMC, who said: Look, if you were to stack up all of the diseases in our country that end in fatality, you would have to put up there car accidents, you would have to put up there heart disease, you would have to put up there pulmonary illnesses and cancers, of course. But, he said, if you stacked those illnesses up on a list, the most fatal in a given year, he said, the third one would be uninsured, people dying because they don't have insurance.  And our Republican majority is here to tell us they are okay with that. It is hard for me to believe, but it is true.  Right in front of us, we know that this repeal will relieve wealthy individuals of paying taxes. If they are able to repeal the Affordable Care Act, people with a lot of money are going to have more of it, and people who needed health care will have less of it.  People who need help dealing with the doughnut hole and need to be filled in with the moneys that come from the Affordable Care Act won't have that anymore. Now they will go back to the status quo of Medicare part D, which is where they get help up to a certain amount, then there is no help, then they have got to spend up to start getting help again. The Affordable Care Act filled in the doughnut hole, and seniors who can barely afford their prescription drugs now will have even more trouble.  Seniors who need Daraprim, which was a medication that cost about 13 bucks until this guy Shkreli bought the patent for it and jacked it up to about 700 bucks, people who need even things like insulin, people who need all kinds of medications now are going to be staring at that doughnut hole all over again.  I mean, we can get up here and talk about the toll, the human tragedy, the pain and suffering that people are looking at, but none of it seems to penetrate the minds of our colleagues. They seem to be deaf to the pleas of people like Abby and so many other people like that.  I was here when my colleagues on the other side brought forth I think as many as 60 attempts to repeal the Affordable Care We would come forth and we would say: People are getting lifesaving treatments that they never could afford before; people are getting treatments that are literally keeping their families intact, keeping their lives intact; people are getting coverage they never had; people have something more than the emergency room to turn to. Our colleagues would just say: Well, we are just going to get rid of it anyway.  In fact, I remember, Mr.Speaker, when the Republicans shut down the government for 16 days because we refused to cooperate with their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Ted Cruz occupied time and demanded that we repeal it. We said we would not turn people like Abby and others back to the tender mercies of the insurance industry. They said: Well, we will shut down the entire government unless you do it. We said no, and, well, here we are.  It is true that we never thought we were going to lose this election. We never thought we would be this deep in the minority, but we now have gotten in a position where the Democrats[[Page H2008]]don't hold the We have a President who ran on the promise of repealing the Affordable Care Act, and we have two Houses of Congress that are committed to doing it.  The last line of defense really is the American people, Mr.The last line of defense is the American people standing on the most fundamental of rights, the First Amendment, which guarantees them the right to redress grievances, guarantees them the right to petition their government, guarantees them the right to freedom of assembly, guarantees them the right to freedom of faith, guarantees them the right to receive information from a free press.  We are relying on that amendment, Mr.Speaker, to stop these Republican efforts to snatch healthcare access out of the way, out of the hands of We are relying on Americans to stand up and say: We will not tolerate this--going to community meetings, going out on the street, using their rights as Americans to express their right to have health care. This is what the moment calls for.  Governors, even some Republican Governors, are saying: Wait a minute. This Medicaid expansion, you know, we used it. It is not so bad. It is helping us.  Their pleas are being ignored as well. We are at a critical moment: Will the American people continue to make the same advances that people all over the developed world have made with regard to health care?  You know, Europeans look at us and think there is something wrong with us. Even our northern neighbors look at us and say: Wait a minute. Health care is not a right down there?  You get it if you can pay; and if you can't pay and answer somebody's bottom line, you are just out.  We pay the most for health care in the whole wide world, Mr.We pay the most--the most--and yet we don't have the best outcomes. We don't have the best indicators of health. Yet our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to return us to a day when the number one reason that people would declare bankruptcy was medical debt. That is the world we are looking at, and it is really, really something.  Now, many people have said--you know, Democrats say to me all the time, and I am sure they say it to Mr.Raskin of Maryland: Hey, look, you know, there are things we would change in the Affordable Care  We are not saying that it fell down from tablets in the sky. Of course, there are reasonable amendments that might be made. But I am here to say to you, Mr.Speaker, that the Republican caucus has never said: We will talk about how we are going to make reasonable amendments to make it better. They have only said to repeal, repeal, repeal.  They have also said replace, but everyone knows you cannot repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act because, if you repeal it, you are repealing all of the taxes that go along with paying for it. And if you repeal the taxes, you are going to tell me that a Republican caucus is going to levy a tax? They think tax is a four-letter word if somebody with a lot of money has to pay it.                              {time}  2000  Now, they are okay with fees and pushing down regressive taxes. They do that every day and all the time. If somebody with real means has to pony up, even though they are already wealthy, you could never see a Republican do that. It is just not something they are going to do.  The ACA has provided coverage to more than 20 million people. That is 20 million more people who have better patient care, access to doctors and medicines, and are no longer turned away because of preexisting conditions.  The Republican proposal puts the brakes on the progress we have made. People will lose access to insurance coverage. The Republicans gut the preventative health fund, which literally funds programs to invest in keeping people healthy.  Who do Republicans help?  Insurance and pharmaceutical corporations. They get huge tax breaks at the expense of the help and the future of the American people.  The Republican bill doesn't stop there. It is an outright attack on Seniors out there should know that the Republicans are attacking They are attacking  Medicaid is one of our most effective antipoverty programs and provides lifesaving care to millions of elderly, children, pregnant women, and people with disabilities. Republicans want to dismantle the program as we know it and kick people off and leave States to pay for the bill.  This bill takes away health care from women and shifts costs to the older, sicker people. It compromises the Medicare trust fund. It destroys Medicaid and gives tax breaks to corporations and millionaires. It is wrong, and the American people need to oppose it. And I oppose what they are trying to do.

518,topic-id,1400,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.Raskin) for being so clear on the issues in front of the American people. It is so important that we have these Special Order hours so that we can really help the American people understand what is at stake; and what is at stake literally is the health and security of our  When we talk about security, usually people think about law enforcement and military. There is also the security that families can expect, the security of your health. In this situation, the Nation's security of health and family security is absolutely on the chopping block.  Let me give you an example of what I mean. In the district I represent in Minnesota--which I am so proud to represent the people of the Fifth Congressional District of Minnesota--we used to have an uninsured rate which we thought was low. It was 10.9 percent. If you remember, in the pre-Affordable Care Act days, 10.9 percent was pretty low. Well, now it is 6.6 percent. That means literally thousands of Minnesotans can now go and get regular doctor care rather than just show up at the  Part of the way that we used the Affordable Care Act in Minnesota in the Fifth Congressional District is that the folks at HCMC set up something called Hennepin What Hennepin Health does is it says: We are going to take some of these Medicaid dollars and we are going to help people who are chronic users of the ER system. We are going to work with other agencies and other providers in the community to help house them stably and then do regular medical surveillance with them.  Do you know what has happened with this program?  The costs at the ER have dropped through the floor. The money has been[[Page H2010]]saved because of the Affordable Care Not only is it about the money--because if you talk to our Republican friends, all they want to talk about is money--something even more important has happened.                              {time}  2015  When you talk to the people who would go to the ER all the time, they are saying: I have somewhere to live. I have somebody who helps me stay on my medication. I am beginning to rebuild relationships with my family again. Schizophrenia can be very devastating to your mental health; and I was all out of control when I was off my meds, and I used to end up in the ER within an inch of my life. But now, because of the Affordable Care Act, I can get the care that I need, I can be stably housed, I can be productive in my community, I can be a participating family member again.  It has improved their lives.  I don't understand what the Republicans don't understand. It is a good thing to have people to have an option other than the  I heard one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say, well, in America, if you show up at a hospital, there is a Federal law that says they have got to take you.  It is true that if you show up at an ER, somebody is going to have to let you in there. They may move you from one hospital to another, but, eventually, the law does say you will end up with somebody seeing you.  Guess what the medical professionals say about it? It doesn't work. It is the most expensive care. It is usually left to people who have allowed an illness to fester and to go on and to advance, which makes it more difficult to treat, more expensive to treat. It is the wrong way to run a healthcare system.  Yet, people have a straight face and say things like, well, you know, you can go to the doctor if you need to. It is called the  This is absolutely not the right thing. And so here we are again, right at this hour where, really, things look kind of grave, and we need the American people to stand up and object. I tell you, we need people to say that they insist upon a humane society where a person suffering from schizophrenia, who is so afflicted by their illness that the only thing they can do is make it through the day and then, if they get sick, maybe somebody will take them to the  We should have a society where that person can get the care they need, can get housing that they need, can be cared for, and can be a participating member in our society with just a little bit more help.  I think that is what makes us That is the difference between us and them. We care about people. We believe people are inherently valuable and all have dignity, and we don't believe that you are only as worthy as what is in your pocket or your bank account. We reject that idea out of hand and believe that people must be--if you are too poor to work, too sick to work, too old to work, we believe our society should care for you; and I don't make any apologies to anybody for believing that.  I believe the government should do everything it can to make sure there are enough good-paying jobs for everybody. Lord knows we have got enough work to do around here, potholes here and there, school kids need help. We have got plenty of work to do. That is not the problem.  We have also got plenty of wealth. We have got plenty of wealth in our society. And I believe that if you live in this greatest of all countries in the world--and I believe that, I am so proud to be an American--and you are allowed to make a profit, which I believe in that, I am a former businessperson myself--I don't think it is asking you too much to put a little bit in the pot so some people who can't afford it can go to the doctor.  I don't think it is asking you too much to put a little bit in a pot so a kid can go to school, or so that a senior can get medication, or so that we can have clean water. I don't think it is too much.  But some people think it is too much to say that, even though I have been blessed by being an American and being able to pursue my economic dream, I don't want to give them anything. This is all for me.  I just don't--we are just not on the same page with that. We think that it is all right to make sure that we fund the basic necessities that people need to have a thriving, humane society, and that includes health care.  So tonight, I just want to say to people that it reminds me of a question that a lady asked Benjamin Franklin when Benjamin Franklin walked out of the Constitutional Congress in Philadelphia, way back so many years ago. The lady said to Benjamin Franklin: What do we have, Mr.Franklin? He said: A democracy if we can keep it.  Part of being a democratic society in this country right now means that we should have health care for people because this society can afford it. Part of what it means to have a civilized democracy in this moment means that people can rise up and lift their voices up to defend their right to have decent health care for all in this society; and we urge people to do that because it is the right thing to do, and this is the right time to do it.  So I want to just yield back to my friend from I will be taking my leave at this point, but I want to thank the gentleman for holding down this very important Special Order because the Affordable Care Act is worth fighting for.  As you said, Mr.Raskin, the Affordable Care Act is not perfect. What piece of legislation ever was?  We have amended the 1964 Civil Rights We have amended the 1965 Voting Rights We amend laws all the time because, as society changes and times change, the needs come up. But to just repeal and then not come anywhere close to replacing, it is wrong, and we must oppose it.

466,topic-id,599,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to H.985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act of 2017.  My amendment would exempt a claimant who is or has been living in public housing or any dwelling unit for which rental assistance was provided under the Section 8 housing program. While I firmly believe that every individual should be exempt from this outrageous provision, my amendment recognizes that we, the Federal Government, are the landlords, the owners, if you may, of public housing.  Speaker Ryan is a landlord of public housing. Our leader, the gentlewoman from California, is a landlord of public housing. The President is a tenant of public housing. The White House is public housing. While the White House has hot water, a nice roof, and likely no asbestos, it is still public housing. We, the taxpayers, pay the rent. We, as the Federal Government on both sides of the aisle, are the owners and the landlords of public housing.  As the owners of public housing, we have a unique obligation to the people living in these units. We are responsible for the dilapidated conditions of[[Page H1993]]our public housing units, and we are responsible for the health and well-being of low-income tenants living in them.  Much of our public housing was built in the 1950s and 1960s, coinciding with what was perhaps the peak time for the use of asbestos-containing products in building and construction materials. This has left thousands of our most vulnerable citizens at risk of exposure to asbestos, which has killed as many as 15,000 Americans each year.  People who have a legitimate claim and have been exposed to asbestos while living in either public housing or Section 8 housing should be afforded the due process they deserve and given the opportunity to bring their claims in a timely manner. I think this entire bill is a misnomer and should be renamed the unfairness in class action litigation act.  No one--no one--should have their due process rights delayed or denied. There is no doubt that the consequences of this legislation will be especially and uniquely detrimental to low-income individuals. This legislation will completely upend privacy and bankruptcy laws.  As it stands today, our laws guarantee that a claimant's information is protected. This bill, however, will require that an individual claimant's personal information and the amount they have received from the trust be made available on a public website. Not only is this a complete and total disregard for the individual's privacy, but it makes the most vulnerable in our society prey for financial predators.  My amendment will guarantee that tenants living in public housing and Section 8 housing are not subjected to such an outrageous shift in privacy rights. The bill sends trusts on a wild goose chase for information that may not even be there, while they should be spending their time working through the pending claims.  These companies hid the dangers of asbestos for decades, for far too long, and there is absolutely no reason why we should be helping them now. Rather than wasting time and taxpayer dollars obstructing the judicial system, we should be focusing on initiatives that will update our crumbling infrastructure. And, yes, public housing is undoubtedly infrastructure.  Finally, the CBO has indicated that, financially, this amendment will cost nothing. This amendment will cost absolutely nothing. But I can promise you that not adopting it will come at a great cost to our system of justice. I ask my colleagues to adopt this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

385,topic-id,334,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Since this bill was marked up in the last Congress, the very same plausibility standard used in this bill was adopted by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in which fraudulent joinder cases arise with the greatest frequency.  Last Congress, Ranking Member Conyers said of the bill, it should simply pick one of the existing articulations in the fraudulent joinder standard and codify that into law. At the time, the plausibility approach was applied by some district courts, but just last year, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals adopted the same plausibility standard this bill contains in a case called International  The Fifth Circuit stated: We must consider whether the plaintiff pleaded ``enough facts to state a claim to relieve that is plausible on its face.'' The plaintiff in that case petitioned for rehearing en banc, but the rehearing was denied, with not a single judge on the Fifth Circuit requesting a vote.  In just the last year, district courts in the Fifth Circuit have issued more than 40 fraudulent joinder decisions without much difficulty and with the results that indicate just the sort of reasonable reform that would occur nationwide when we get this bill passed into law.  So this is about making the system work and opening the door to the Federal courts so companies from foreign states are not unfairly, potentially disadvantaged.  The other piece of this that is easy to neglect is the local defendant. I don't know if the gentleman across the aisle has ever been sued. I have friends who have been sued. It is an emotionally and financially devastating procedure. You have got to take time off from your life and business to defend it. You have got to hire a lawyer, which is incredibly expensive. This is to protect the innocent third parties and open the doors to the Federal courts and just make it fairer and easier.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

It is expensive, it is emotionally draining, and it is time consuming.  I have no problem at all, and this bill is not designed to protect corporations. It is designed to protect, just as its name states, innocent parties. These are people who are joined solely to defeat diversity jurisdiction.

You are bringing phony defendants in, and that is what we are trying to stop. We have got to be fair about this.  It is not often that we have the opportunity to protect innocent local folks and businesses from costly and meritless lawsuits. This is an opportunity to rein in forum shopping and abuses by trial lawyers and hold them to a good faith standard in litigation. We can do that by passing a bill that is just a few pages long. That is the opportunity we have today.  All this bill does--all this bill does--is say that innocent, local parties--mostly small businesses--can't be added to a lawsuit for forum shopping purposes, and it only prohibits this when there is no plausible case against these small businesses or the case against them isn't brought in good faith.

396,topic-id,324,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment should be roundly opposed for the simple reason it doesn't protect any victims, but it also victimizes local parties in the types of cases covered by the amendment.  The purpose of the underlying bill is to allow judges greater discretion to free innocent local parties--that is, innocent people and innocent small businesses--from lawsuits when those innocent local parties are dragged into a case solely because a plaintiff's attorney wants to do some forum shopping.  These innocent local parties have, at most, an attenuated connection to the claims made by the trial lawyer against some national company a thousand miles away. These innocent local parties shouldn't have to suffer the time, expense, and emotional drain of a lawsuit when the plaintiff can't even come up with a plausible claim. The base bill protects these innocent local parties from being dragged into a lawsuit as a party just to keep the case in State court.  Now, let's bring in this amendment, which denies the bill's protection to innocent local parties adjoined to a lawsuit simply because the legal allegations in the case fall into one arbitrary category and that one is in another. It is terribly unfair.  This amendment would allow these things to happen to innocent people in the name of allowing trial lawyers to scuttle the hydraulic fracking industry through lawsuits. Innocent people are innocent people, and they should be protected against being dragged into lawsuits regardless of the nature of the case.  This doesn't deny anybody access to the courts. It protects innocent parties from being dragged into a case for forum shopping.  Every single one of the gentleman's cases will be heard in court. They will have their day in court and they will have justice based on the facts.  This bill does not protect wrongdoing corporations.

405,topic-id,593,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment continues to victimize innocent local parties just because they happen to be in an insurance case.  The underlying bill is designed to protect folks from being dragged into a lawsuit just to facilitate forum shopping by plaintiffs' attorneys.  The purpose of this bill is to allow judges greater discretion to free these innocent local parties. They are the ones that are suffering as a result of this.  This amendment denies the bill's protection to innocent local parties joined to a lawsuit simply because the legal allegations in the case fall into one arbitrary category rather than another, just like the previous amendment. It is terribly unfair. Innocent people are innocent people, and they should be protected from being dragged into a lawsuit regardless of the nature of the case.  The rules we have developed in this great country to protect the innocent are rules of general application, such as the rules protecting people's rights to have their side of the story told and the rules protecting people from biased or inaccurate testimony.  We should all be appalled by the suggestion that these general protections designed to protect innocent people from criminal liability should be suspended because the case is one of assault and battery or murder or somehow relates to insurance. It is the same kind of logic.                              {time}  1545  Our country is rightfully proud of its principles providing due process and equal protection, but these concepts are meaningless if they are only selectively applied to some type of cases and not others. And for the same reason, we should all be outraged at the suggestion that the rules of fairness, designed to protect the innocent, should be suspended in civil law cases because a case involves one particular subject matter or another. But that is exactly what this misguided amendment does.  This amendment would allow a plaintiff's lawyer to drag an individual insurance adjuster into a lawsuit even when the applicable State law makes it absolutely clear that only insurers, not individual people, are subject to bad faith claims. How does the sponsor explain this to a person like Jack Stout, why a lawyer pulled him into a bad faith lawsuit targeting State Farm? Mr.Stout was a local insurance agent who merely sold a policy to the plaintiff, met and spoke with the plaintiff once, and had nothing to do with processing the plaintiff's homeowner's insurance claim. A Federal District Court in Oklahoma found he was fraudulently joined and dismissed the claim against him, but under this amendment, the innocent person would have been stuck back in the lawsuit.  What about a person like Douglas Bradley, where the plaintiff's lawyer named him as a defendant in a bad faith lawsuit against an insurer? In that case, the complaint included Mr.Bradley, an insurance agent, as a defendant in the caption of the case. It referred to defendant, singular, not defendants. Throughout the entire pleadings, it didn't even mention his name. A Federal District Court in Indiana dismissed this claim against him as fraudulently joined, but under this amendment, this innocent person would have been stuck back in the lawsuit. It is not fair, it is expensive, and it is emotionally draining to these innocent parties.  For that reason, I urge opposition to the amendment and support of the underlying bill.

411,topic-id,1049,"I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, recently an independent research firm surveyed companies in 26 countries and found that 80 percent of those companies that were subject to class action lawsuits were U.companies, putting those U.companies at a distinct economic disadvantage when competing with companies worldwide.  But the problem of overbroad class action doesn't just affect U.companies. It affects consumers in the United States who are forced into lawsuits they don't want to be in. How do we know that? We know that because the median rate at which consumer class action members take the compensation offered in a settlement is incredibly low. That would be 0.023 percent. That is two-hundredths of a percent. That is right, only the tiniest fraction of consumer class action members bother to claim the compensation awarded them in a settlement. That is clear proof that vastly large numbers of class members are satisfied with the products they purchase, don't want compensation, and don't want to be lumped into a ginormous class action lawsuit.  Federal judges are crying out for Congress to reform the class action lawsuit system, which currently allows trial lawyers to fill classes with hundreds and thousands of unmeritorious claims and use those artificially inflated claims to force defendants to settle the case. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has recognized that ``A court's decision to certify a class . . . places pressure on the defendant to settle even unmeritorious claims.''  Judge Diane Wood of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, appointed by President Clinton, has explained that class certification ``is, in effect, the whole case.'' And as one appeals court judge, nominated by President Obama, wrote in his dissent in a recent class action case, ``The chief difficulty we confront in this case arises from the fact that some of the members of the class have not suffered the . . . injury upon which this entire case is predicated and that could constitute as many as 24,000 consumers who would have no valid claim against the defendants under the state laws even if the named plaintiffs win on the merits.''  He went on to chastise the other judges who allowed the class action to proceed, writing ``if the district court does not identify a culling method to ensure that the class, by judgment, includes only members who were actually injured, this court has no business simply hoping that one will work.''  The purpose of a class action is to provide a fair means of evaluating similar, meritorious claims, not to provide a way for lawyers to artificially inflate the size of a class to extort a larger settlement fee for themselves, siphoning money away from those actually injured, and increasing prices for everyone.  Just look at an accounting of recent class action settlements. The SUBWAY food chain was sued in a class action because trial lawyers complained their foot-long subs weren't a full foot long. As part of the settlement, small amounts were paid to the 10 class representatives, but the millions of other class members received nothing; not a dime, not a sandwich. Meanwhile, the lawyers were awarded $520,000 in fees. The settlement was appealed, and during oral arguments Judge Diane Sykes remarked that ``A class action that seeks only worthless benefits for the class should be dismissed out of hand. That's what should have happened here. . . . This is a racket.''  The Coca-Cola Company was sued in a class action lawsuit involving Class members received zero dollars in the settlement. The lawyers were awarded $1.2 million in fees.  In a case involving Facebook, the company agreed to settle the case by paying class counsel $3 million. Zero dollars were paid to class members. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the deal, but in a withering dissent, Judge Kleinfeld observed that ``Facebook users who had suffered damages . . . got no money, not a nickel, from the defendants. Class counsel, on the other hand, got millions.''  This bill includes several reforms. It prevents people from being forced into a class with other uninjured or minimally injured class members, only to have the compensation of injured parties reduced. It prevents trial lawyers from using incestuous, litigation-factory arrangements to gin up lawsuits. It requires courts to use objective criteria in determining who is injured in a class action and how compensation will actually reach the victims. It requires that injured victims get paid first, before the lawyers, and that lawyer fees be limited to a reasonable percentage of the money received by victims.  It requires judges to itemize exactly who gets what in a class action settlement and who is paying and controlling the lawyers. It requires all the rules governing class action be followed, that expensive pretrial proceedings be put on hold while the court determines if the case can't meet class certification requirements, and allows appeals of those class certification orders so justice can be done faster.  It ensures lawyers don't add plaintiffs just for forum shopping purposes, and it requires the verification of allegations in multidistrict pretrial proceedings, ensuring defendants receive due process while plaintiffs, not lawyers, get the benefits of any cost savings achieved by the multidistrict pretrial process.  H.985 also contains provisions to include much-needed transparency into the asbestos bankruptcy trust system. On too frequent an occasion, by the time asbestos victims assert their claims for compensation, the bankruptcy trust formed for their benefit has been diluted by fraudulent claims, leaving these victims without their entitled recovery.  The reason that fraud is allowed to exist within the asbestos trust system is the excessive lack of transparency created by plaintiffs' firms. The predictable result of this reduced transparency has been a growing wave of claims and reports of fraud.  This bill strikes the proper balance of transparency and preserving the dignity and medical privacy of asbestos victims while also minimizing the administrative impact on the asbestos trusts. This bill saves the money in these trusts, which is a limited amount of money, to make sure future claimants, many of whom are veterans, have the opportunity to seek and receive compensation for their injuries and prevent double-dipping and fraud.  Please join me in supporting this bill on behalf of consumers and injured parties everywhere.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Chairman, I would like to point out to my colleague across the aisle that over the past several Congresses, we have had multiple hearings on class action reform and asbestos trust litigation, all of which are easily and publicly available.  I further would like to go on to say this bill doesn't prevent any claim from being brought as a class action--zero, zip, none. All it does is maximize the recovery of the victims.  Under this bill, a class action lawyer's fees are pegged to a reasonable percentage of the money actually received by the client under the settlement. What that will do is incentivize lawyers to make the maximum amount available to their clients, to seek the maximum recovery for their client.  Under this bill, class action lawyers will no longer be able to agree to settlements that give them millions of dollars and get their clients absolutely nothing, or maybe a coupon, if they are lucky.  Under this bill, a class action lawyer will get more in fees as long as they agree to a settlement that actually means that their clients, the actual plaintiffs, are getting a reasonable amount of money. Imagine that: incentivizing lawyers to do the best work for their clients. That is what this bill does.  I would also like to talk for a second about the asbestos portion of this. I have to say that this is a little troubling for me. The disclosure requirements in the FACT Act portion of this bill requires less than would be required in a State court pleading for damages. It is the minimum amount of information necessary to make sure somebody isn't double-dipping. It specifically protects medical records and social security numbers. It is designed as a fraud prevention tool.  The argument that this is designed to protect companies that manufactured asbestos is flawed. This is designed for the asbestos trust--companies that have gone bankrupt and set aside large amounts of money to be paid to the victims of asbestos. This protects the assets in those trusts, not the tortfeasor companies. We are making sure there is enough money in these trusts to pay future victims by stopping fraudulent claims today.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1974.txt,2067,MOTION TO ADJOURN,2017.0,9.0,March

This FACT Act provision is designed to protect veterans from fraud and make sure our future veterans who are exposed and other people who are exposed in their jobs to asbestos have the resources available because the company that actually made the asbestos is most likely bankrupt and out of business now.  There are finite resources in these trusts, and we owe it to our servicemembers and to future victims of asbestosis or mesothelioma to make sure there is money there to take care of their medical bills and compensate them for the injuries.

Fraud has been documented in news reports, State court cases, and in testimony before the Judiciary Committee.[[Page H1979]]  The Wall Street Journal conducted an investigation that found thousands of dispiritedly filed claims. Court documents in many States, including Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Virginia, attest to widespread fraud. Most recently, a bankruptcy case in North Carolina uncovered a startling number of dispiritedly filed claims.  Additionally, the Judiciary Committee heard testimony over the course of four hearings about the FACT Act, during which witnesses repeatedly testified that fraud existed within the asbestos trust bankruptcy situation. Keep in mind that the fraud reported today has been in spite of the lack of disclosure that exists.  Consistent with other multimillion-dollar compensation programs, there is fraud occurring in the asbestos trust system, and the FACT Act will go a long way to uncovering that fraud. The FACT Act is designed to provide the minimum amount of transparency necessary to prevent this fraud while protecting the personal information of those victims of asbestos.

428,topic-id,579,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to address the fact that there have been numerous hearings on the FACT Act and the problems associated with it. There was one hearing before the Judiciary Committee on the Constitution on September 9, 2011. There were three legislative hearings before the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial, and Antitrust Law, one during the 112th Congress, one during the 113th Congress, and one during the 114th I am sure the gentleman's staff could have gotten him copies of those.  I also point out that the minority used these opportunities to call witnesses that were representatives of the plaintiffs' asbestos trial bar. They called the attorneys to voice their concern about the bill, not the victims. In fact, the minority called the same witness for three out of the four hearings. Now they claim that asbestos victims were never provided an opportunity to testify.  The Judiciary Committee has provided ample opportunity to include asbestos victims' views on the legislation in the record, and there are many letters and statements from victims in the record.  In closing, I do want to say--going back to the class action part of this bill for a second only--that only the tiniest fraction of consumers in class actions bother to claim the compensation awarded them in the settlement. That is clear proof that the vastly large number of class members are satisfied with the products they have purchased, don't want compensation, and don't want to be lumped into a gigantic class action lawsuit.  Federal judges are crying out for Congress to reform the class action system, which currently allows trial lawyers to fill classes with hundreds and thousands of meritorious claims and use those artificially inflated classes to force defendants to settle the case.  As I recounted, class action settlements have left lawyers with millions of dollars while victims receive absolutely nothing or a coupon, at best. The bill prevents people from being forced into class actions with other uninjured or minimally injured members only to have the compensation of injured parties reduced. It requires that lawyer fees be limited to a reasonable percentage of the money injured victims actually receive. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.  I also want to talk a second about the FACT We hear these stories about these corporations that did all of this wrong. Many of them are bankrupt, and the only money available to the victims are the money that has been set aside in these asbestos trust funds. When an unscrupulous attorney makes a claim against multiple trusts or files claims in Federal court and State court, it is difficult, if not impossible, to find out if that claim has already been made. The FACT Act makes that easily available while providing privacy necessary to protect the victims.  The FACT Act is designed to protect the future victims and make sure there is money there for the children, for the veterans, for the hardworking Americans who are injured by asbestos but whose symptoms have not yet manifested. Sometimes these asbestos-related diseases take decades to show up, and there needs to be money there to take care of those folks. That is what this legislation is intending to do, not to protect corporations.

909,topic-id,478,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan legislation with my colleague Senator Portman that would align HUD homeless assistance with existing Federal children and youth programs and provide flexibility to local communities to use available resources to meet the needs that they identify.[[Page S1781]]  According to the U.Department of Education, approximately 1.2 million children were homeless during the 2014 to 2015 school year; this is a 34-percent increase from the 939,903 homeless students in the 2009 to 2010 school year.  In California, over 229,000 children experienced homelessness in 2015, nearly four times the 65,000 homeless children in the State in 2003.  Unfortunately, the numbers reported by the HUD Point-in-Time count fail to reflect these increasing numbers.  According to the national 2015 HUD Point-in-Time count, there were only 206,286 people counted as homeless in households that included children, a fraction of the true number.  This is important because only those children counted by HUD are eligible for vital homeless assistance programs and included in local planning efforts. The rest of these children and families are simply out of luck.  The Homeless Children and Youth Act of 2017 would allow HUD homeless assistance programs to serve extremely vulnerable children and families, specifically those staying in motels or in doubled-up situations because they have nowhere else to go.  These families are especially susceptible to abuse and trafficking because they are often not served by a case manager and thus remain hidden from potential social service providers.  As a result of the current narrow HUD definition, communities that receive Federal funding through the competitive application process are unable to prioritize or direct resources to help these children and families.  This bill would provide communities with the flexibility to use Federal funds to meet local priorities. The bill requires the Secretary to assess the extent to which Continuums of Care use separate, specific, age-appropriate criteria for determining the safety and needs of children and unaccompanied youth and divert people to safe, stable, age-appropriate accommodations.  And I would note that the bill does not impose any new mandates on service providers.

How did we get here?  A decade ago, taxpayers learned that many of their elected representatives were complicit in an insidious practice that rotted the legislative branch to its core, and that is congressional earmarking. Called a ``gateway drug'' by our distinguished former colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Tom Coburn, earmarks have long exacerbated the Federal Government's spending addiction.  As old as the Republic, earmarks have always been used by generations of politicians as currency to curry favor with well-connected special interests. After public outrage reached a critical mass, both the House and the Senate instituted bans on earmarking, ending what had been a corrupt pay-to-play culture in  In order to preserve this important check against the corrupting influence of earmarks, I recently sent a letter to President Donald Trump respectfully urging him to veto any legislation containing earmarks that reaches his desk. I thank my colleagues, Senators John McCain, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Ben Sasse, for cosigning this letter.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following letter.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.Senate,                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2017.     President Donald Trump,     The White House,     Washington,       Dear President Trump: With our national debt set to top $20      trillion within days and growing at a rate of over half-a-     trillion dollars a year, bringing fiscal sanity to the      federal budget requires immediate attention and action. We      write today to urge opposition to any efforts by Congress to      return to earmarking.       While cutting unnecessary and wasteful spending may be      commonsense to most taxpayers, behind every dollar spent is a      boisterous special interest group with the loudest being      Congress itself. Even with a full agenda that includes      repealing Obamacare, reforming the tax code, easing the      regulatory burden, and strengthening our nation's security,      some lawmakers are focused on reviving the corrupt practice      of earmarking that was ended in 2011 after what seemed like      an endless series of corruption scandals.       Fondly described as a ``favor factory'' by a lobbyist      convicted of exchanging gifts for government grants, earmarks      represent the pay-to-play culture you have pledged to end. It      is unfathomable to those of us who fought to end earmarks and      witnessed our colleagues go to jail for corruption that pork      barrel politics would return, especially at this time when      Americans are clearly fed up with business-as-usual. However,      despite the success of the current moratorium enacted in both      chamber of Congress, there are efforts underway seeking to      revive the disdainful practice.       President Reagan vetoed a highway bill in 1987 because it      was larded up with 152 earmarks. Escalating exponentially,      the over-budget transportation bill signed into law in 2005      contained more than 6,300 earmarks. Earmark proponents are      trying to reassure that this time will be different,      promising fewer projects and even rebranding them as      ``congressionally-directed spending.'' With the serious      fiscal problems facing our nation, processing thousands or      even hundreds of pork requests will only distract and delay      addressing pressing national needs and push spending      decisions once again into the murky shadows.       We respectfully urge you to make it clear that you will      veto any bill Congress sends to you containing earmarks      within the legislative text or the accompanying report. We      look forward to working with you to make Washington more      accountable and stop wasteful spending where it starts, which      is often right here in           Sincerely,       Jeff       Mike       John       Rand       Ted       Ben  ",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgS1651-3.txt,1633,FAIRNESS IN CLASS ACTION LITIGATION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,8.0,March
219,topic-id,1427,"To explain the urgency behind my letter to the President, I wish to remind my colleagues in this body, many of whom were not in the Congress before enactment of the moratorium, just how bad the earmarking epidemic became.  For the uninitiated, the term ``earmark'' is a euphemism for when lawmakers work to circumvent the regular, normal appropriations process in order to secure special funding for projects in their home districts or their This resulted in Federal tax dollars being doled out to Members of Congress on a whim, bypassing normal rigorous Federal and public vetting.  Instead of focusing on oversight responsibilities or devising legislative solutions for the Nation's most pressing challenges, lawmakers and staffers devoted thousands of man-hours toward filling earmark requests. Congressional appropriators and appropriations committees transformed into what were termed ``favor factories,'' abandoning oversight responsibilities to focus on rationing out pork. To me, that was one of the most insidious parts of the whole earmarking era.  We have oversight responsibilities in There is a huge Federal budget on which we should be providing oversight, but instead of poring over agency spending and searching for waste in our trillion-dollar discretionary budget, Members and staff devoted countless hours to roughly 2 or 3 percent of the Federal budget. There was so much focus on just doling out what represented 1 or 2 or 3 percent of the Federal budget that we basically neglected the rest of the Federal budget in terms of oversight.[[Page S1657]]  In less than 20 years, the number of earmarks in the Transportation bill alone grew from 152 to 6,300. President Reagan, I believe, in 1988 famously said that he vetoed the highway bill because he hadn't seen that much pork since he handed out ribbons at the county fair. There were 152 earmarks in the Transportation bill that year, and by 2005 it was 6,300. That is an increase of more than 4,000 percent.  Examples of earmarks range from a quarter billion dollars for a bridge to nowhere in Alaska--everybody became familiar with that one; $50 million for an indoor rainforest in Iowa, paid for by taxpayers across the country; and half a million dollars for a teapot museum in North All of these earmarks added up, eventually totaling about $29 billion a year.  It was in this environment that, along with a small group of like-minded colleagues, I set out to put an end to this form of transactional politics that had infected the Halls of Our mission was to place a permanent moratorium on congressional earmarks.  It took unprecedented revelations of widespread corruption and illegality and ultimately the jailing of lawmakers, staffers, and lobbyists before the public's outrage forced Congress to clean up its act. But even brazen instances of public corruption didn't stop Congress from dragging its feet on reforms, and the majority party, my party, paid the price at the polls in 2006.  The dominant mood of the electorate at that time--that of mistrust in government institutions--is strikingly reminiscent of the drain-the-swamp mentality that permeated last November's election. But despite this surging anti-insider sentiment across the ideological spectrum, there is now a chorus of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle working behind the scenes to lift the congressional earmark moratorium. These earmark defenders will trot out arguments ranging from constitutional prerogative to the insignificance of earmarks relative to the entire Federal budget. They will say: It is OK to earmark. We are only earmarking 1 percent of the Federal budget.  But all of these defenses ring hollow. The constitutional power of the purse is not a blanket mandate for Congress to spend freely; rather, it is a fundamental duty to prevent the executive branch from wasting taxpayer dollars. By using earmarks to funnel billions of dollars to special interests, Congress ceases to be a check on the executive branch. We have become no better than the free-spending bureaucrats whom we rail against.  While we were ultimately successful in securing earmark bans in both the House and the Senate, today we are seeing far too many cracks in those foundations. With so many in Congress now willing to sacrifice fiscal discipline, we have to remain vigilant against the return to business as usual. We can't afford to forfeit the hard-fought progress we have made.  The Senate Republican conference's vote earlier this year to preserve the earmark ban was an important step in the right direction, but we need to do more. That is why I sent the letter to President Trump, and it is why, should earmarks return, I intend to challenge each one of them on the Senate floor. Just as I did in my time in the House, I will file amendments to force debate and force votes on these earmarks. That way, Members can publicly defend their earmarks to the hard-working taxpayers they represent.  As we look forward to the future, I have been encouraged by the President's recognition of Washington's addiction to spending and his administration's commitment to finally doing something about it. I look forward to working with the administration to make the Federal Government leaner, more transparent, and more accountable to the taxpayers it serves.                         Border Adjustment Tax  Mr.President, I take the floor today to express my concern with the border adjustment tax. The border adjustment tax is quickly becoming the centerpiece of a planned overhaul of our tax and trade policies. I am certain that I am not the only one hearing that this approach could make everyday consumer products more expensive at the very places middle-class families shop the most. From the aisles at big-box stores to the checkout lines in grocery stores, household staples could be pushed out of reach for those who can least afford it.  In addition, there are concerns that this new policy could disrupt global supply chains and make it harder for our country's largest private sector employers to grow and to do business.  There are those who suggest that the known downsides to the new tax will be a wash because the U.dollar will be stronger; however, others are not so comfortable gambling the purchasing power of the average consumer on the unpredictability of international currency markets.  At first glance, the plan seems simple enough: Tax companies in the United States less and tax goods made overseas more. That seems simple. According to supporters, this would boost our exports, incentivize companies to locate operations here in the United States, and it would reduce our trade deficit. Unfortunately, it turns out that is not so easy. Looking inward, we simply do not produce everything we need here in the United That is why we trade with other countries in the first place. And for the things we do make here, those products often require inputs from all over the world. In fact, whether it is raw material or specialty parts, roughly 50 percent of our Nation's imports consist of inputs for U.production and manufacturing. Let me say that again. Roughly 50 percent of our Nation's imports consist of inputs for U.production and manufacturing, many times for products that are then shipped overseas.  Because of our trade deals with other nations, these inputs are cheaper than they would be otherwise. Cheaper inputs mean lower production costs for U.S.-based businesses, which in turn allows these companies to expand production and to reduce prices.  What will happen if we place a 20-percent tax on all imports? Looking beyond our borders, we should also consider the reaction such a tax is sure to trigger amongst our trading partners. If the protectionist trade policies of the past have taught us anything, it is that countries tend to retaliate when they believe trade obligations have been violated. When we increase barriers to trade, nobody wins.  Do I agree that we should work to make U.businesses more competitive? Do I agree that we need to reform our Tax Code? You bet. Tax reform and pro-growth trade policies have been at the top of my list of priorities throughout my tenure in  I look forward to working with my colleagues to lower corporate and individual tax rates, eliminate costly tax earmarks, and make our Tax Code flatter, simpler, and more conducive to growth. There will always be winners and losers in a robust debate on reforming the Tax We ought to make sure the middle class isn't in the losing column.  I yield back the remainder of my time.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

340,topic-id,123,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today because ObamaCare has failed the American people; and one of its biggest failures is that, instead of lowering costs, healthcare prices have increased. Americans are paying more for coverage, and families are hurting.  In my State of Tennessee, premiums are rising by an average of 63 percent. Why pay so much for health insurance if you still can't afford to see a doctor? It puts us right back where we started. And no one--no one--thought the status quo before ObamaCare was good enough.  I am glad to see the American Health Care Act was released, and I look forward to working on specific legislative details with my colleagues so that we can finally fix our broken healthcare system.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1959-6.txt,2061,FAIRNESS IN CLASS ACTION LITIGATION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,9.0,March
350,topic-id,160,"Mr.Speaker, for 7 years, Republicans have been making promises about their secret healthcare plan. They said that under their plan, nobody would have to carry health insurance if they did not want to; and then when they got sick, they could demand their health insurance with no exclusions for preexisting conditions, no limits on coverage for expensive diseases, and that their coverage would be better and cheaper than ObamaCare for all  While they made these questionable promises, the Affordable Care Act provided more than 20 million Americans with lifesaving health care. And now, after 7 years, Republicans have finally revealed their secret plan. We now see that virtually all their promises were lies. Their plan will rapidly bankrupt Medicare, and those over 50 will see massive cost increases, and millions will lose their health care.  They did keep one promise, though. Massive new tax cuts for the wealthy. For that, millions of American families will pay a terrible price.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1960-5.txt,1888,FAIRNESS IN CLASS ACTION LITIGATION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,9.0,March

112,topic-id,14115,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to present H.1301, the Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2017.  In total, this bill provides $577.9 billion in funding for the Department of Defense: $516.1 billion in discretionary funding and $61.8 billion in overseas contingency operations and global war on terrorism funding.  When combined with the funding provided in the continuing resolution supplemental enacted in December, total defense funding for fiscal year 2017 equals $584 billion, consistent with the top line provided in the National Defense Authorization Act, and $10.9 billion more than fiscal year 2016 levels.  Mr.Speaker, strengthening our national security and rebuilding our military starts today, with this agreement,[[Page H1640]]the first step after years of cutbacks. Our Armed Forces and intelligence community are currently operating under a continuing resolution, which denies them stability and predictability, both of which they have not had for many years.  H.1301 provides that stability, removing defense funding from under continuing resolution autopilot, preventing further damage to our national defense and providing additional support for our men and women in uniform and their families.  Our troops serve with honor in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, South Korea, Japan, across the Baltics, the Sinai, and Africa on the ground, in the air, and aboard ships across the globe doing the work of freedom.  Mr.Speaker, this agreement rejects the troop reductions proposed by the previous administration, providing for increased end-strength levels authorized by the NDAA: 1.3 million Active Duty troops and 813,000 National Guard and Reserve troops, all of whom work as one team.  Our bill also fully funds the authorized 2.1 percent pay raise and provides increased funding for Defense Health Programs to ensure full care for all of our warfighters, their families, and military retirees.  This agreement also ensures that our Armed Forces have the training and equipment they need to conduct successful missions. Funding is increased for key readiness programs that prepare and train our troops and that modernize essential military installations. It reverses the previous administration's cuts to procurement, providing for additional production of state-of-the-art aircraft and ships.  In addition, we enhance cyber and ISR programs, or intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance programs, capabilities our combatant commanders badly need.  This reflects congressional priorities. We took into account the views of each and every Member who worked with us throughout the process. This is a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that deserves the support of the  I thank Chairwoman Kay Granger for her efforts in bringing this bill to the floor today and for taking over the leadership of the Defense Subcommittee in  I also thank the subcommittee's ranking member, Mr.Visclosky, for his contributions to this bill and the earlier bill. He has been an excellent partner throughout this process, and I am grateful for our continued strong working relationship.  In addition, I commend Nita Lowey, the ranking member of the full committee, for her partnership and commitment to completing all of our appropriations work.  Lastly, I thank the staff of the subcommittee that is behind me, both minority and majority, as well as our personal offices and the full Appropriations Committee for their tireless work putting this bill together.  In particular, I would like to acknowledge Will Smith and David Pomerantz, the outgoing staff directors for the Appropriations Committee, both majority and minority, in this remarkable committee. Both have made immeasurable contributions to the Appropriations Committee in this institution, and we are indebted for their service. We thank both of them and wish them both the best.  Mr.Speaker, today our Nation faces a dangerous and unpredictable world. At the same time, our Armed Forces are struggling to have our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines fully trained and ready to meet every conceivable threat. That important work to address that critical situation starts with this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I urge support of the agreement, and I reserve the balance of my time. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT SUBMITTED BY FRELINGHUYSEN, CHAIRMAN OF THE          HOUSE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS REGARDING H.1301       The following is an explanation of the effects of this Act,      which makes appropriations for the Department of Defense for      fiscal year 2017. Unless otherwise noted, references to the      House and Senate reports are to House Report 114-577 and      Senate Report 114-263, respectively. The language contained      in the House and Senate reports warrant full compliance and      carry the same weight as language included in this      explanatory statement unless specifically addressed to the      contrary in the bill or this explanatory statement. While      repeating some language from the House or Senate reports for      emphasis, this explanatory statement does not intend to      negate the language referred to above unless expressly      provided herein.              DEFINITION OF PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND ACTIVITY       For the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency      Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-177), as amended      by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control      Reaffirmation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-119), and by the      Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-508), the      terms ``program, project, and activity'' for appropriations      contained in this Act shall be defined as the most specific      level of budget items identified in the Department of Defense      Appropriations Act, 2017, the related classified annexes and      explanatory statements, and the P-1 and R-1 budget      justification documents as subsequently modified by      congressional action.       The following exception to the above definition shall      apply: the military personnel and the operation and      maintenance accounts, for which the term ``program, project,      and activity'' is defined as the appropriations accounts      contained in the Department of Defense Appropriations       At the time the President submits the budget request for      fiscal year 2018, the Secretary of Defense is directed to      transmit to the congressional defense committees budget      justification documents to be known as the ``M-1'' and the      ``O-1'' which shall identify, at the budget activity,      activity group, and sub-activity group level, the amounts      requested by the President to be appropriated to the      Department of Defense for military personnel and operation      and maintenance in any budget request, or amended budget      request, for fiscal year 2018.                         REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE       The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow      the reprogramming guidance for acquisition accounts as      specified in the report accompanying the House version of the      Department of Defense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year      2008 (House Report 110-279). For operation and maintenance      accounts, the Secretary of Defense shall continue to follow      the reprogramming guidelines specified in the conference      report accompanying H.3222, the Department of Defense      Appropriations Act, 2008. The dollar threshold for      reprogramming funds shall remain at $10,000,000 for military      personnel; $15,000,000 for operation and maintenance;      $20,000,000 for procurement; and $10,000,000 for research,      development, test and evaluation.       Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is      directed to continue to provide the congressional defense      committees annual DD Form 1416 reports for titles I and II      and quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports for      Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of      this Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with      guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying      the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The      Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior      approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified      dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or      research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is      less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for      reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments.      Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of      a military personnel (M-1), an operation and maintenance (O-     1), a procurement (P-1), or a research, development, test and      evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the      Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval      reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In      addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval      reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest      items are established elsewhere in this statement.                           FUNDING INCREASES       The funding increases outlined in the tables for each      appropriation account shall be provided only for the specific      purposes indicated in the tables.                  CONGRESSIONAL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS       Items for which additional funds have been provided or      items for which funding is specifically reduced as shown in      the project level tables or in paragraphs using the phrase      ``only for'' or ``only to'' are congressional special      interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming      (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD      Form 1414 at the stated amount, as specifically addressed in      the explanatory statement.                            CLASSIFIED ANNEX       Adjustments to classified programs are addressed in the      accompanying classified annex.                  BUDGET LIAISON SUPPORT TO THE HOUSE                    AND SENATE DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS                              SUBCOMMITTEES       The House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees      rely heavily on offices within the Comptroller organizations      of the military departments and the Office of the Secretary      of Defense to conduct their oversight responsibilities and      make funding recommendations for the Department of      Established in the 1970s in accordance with a recommendation      of the Blue Ribbon Defense Panel, these offices facilitate      the appropriate flow of information between the House and      Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees and the      Comptroller of the respective department or agency. In the      early 1990s, the House and Senate Defense Appropriations      Subcommittees restated the[[Page H1641]]     support these organizations provide to the Committees and      noted that ``while the various offices of legislative affairs      offer great assistance to DoD and the Congress, they do not      provide the expertise and the direct relationship to the      Comptroller organizations which are essential to the      effective communication between DoD and the Committees on      Appropriations.''       Further, the explanatory statement accompanying the      Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2016 echoed the      imperative to maintain the existing liaison structure to      achieve the highest level of communication and trust between      the Department of Defense and the House and Senate Defense      Appropriations       The House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees      repeat this support for the budget liaison organizations and      reiterate previously stated concerns that efforts to      incorporate these organizations into the military and Office      of the Secretary of Defense legislative affairs offices would      be deleterious to the appropriations process and to the      utility of the budget liaison operation. Therefore, the      agreement retains a provision in title II of this Act from      previous years that prohibits the use of funds in this Act to      plan or implement the consolidation of a budget or      appropriations liaison office of the Office of the Secretary      of Defense, the office of the Secretary of a military      department, or the Service headquarters of one of the Armed      Forces into a legislative affairs or legislative liaison      office.                         CYBERSPACE ACTIVITIES       The agreement fully funds the fiscal year 2017 base budget      requirement of $6,734,000,000 for the Army, Navy, Marine      Corps, Air Force, and the defense agencies cyberspace      activities, an increase of $992,000,000 over the fiscal year      2016 enacted level.       While the Service and defense-wide budget justification      material, as well as the Department of Defense classified      cyberspace activities information technology investments      budget justification materials, provide some level of detail,      much of the funding is encompassed within larger programs and      funding lines, which limits visibility and congressional      oversight of requested funding for cyberspace activities      specifically.       Beginning in fiscal year 2018, the Department of Defense      Chief Information Officer is directed to modify the      cyberspace activities exhibit in order to provide increased      visibility and clarity into the cyberspace activities funding      requirements and changes to funding requirements from the      previous fiscal year enacted levels, to segregate civilian      and military pay, and to provide a crosswalk between the      cyberspace activities justification books and the Services      and defense-wide budget justification material.       Further, in order to provide additional clarity and to      enhance oversight, the Department of Defense Chief      Information Officer, in coordination with the Under Secretary      of Defense (Comptroller) and the Service Secretaries, is      directed to conduct a review of the budget justification      material and provide a proposal to the House and Senate      Appropriations Committees not later than September 1, 2017,      for how to clearly delineate the Department of Defense cyber      investment activities requested in the operation and      maintenance, procurement, and research, development, test and      evaluation accounts as part of the budget justification      material beginning with the fiscal year 2019 budget      submission. The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and      the Chief Information Officer are encouraged to consider      establishing a unique cyber sub-activity group for operation      and maintenance accounts and individual cost codes, projects,      or program elements for procurement and research,      development, test and evaluation accounts as part of this      review.       The Department of Defense cyberspace activities table      provided shows the amount of funding provided to each Service      and defense-wide account in fiscal years 2016 and 2017.      Funding appropriated therein may be used only for cyberspace      activities as defined by the classified cyberspace activities      information technology investment budget request for fiscal      year 2017. The Secretary of Defense is directed to use normal      prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funding      out of any operation and maintenance, procurement, or      research, development, test and evaluation accounts as      identified in the table titled ``Department of Defense      Cyberspace Activities'' for any purpose other than cyberspace      activities. The Department of Defense Chief Information      Officer shall submit to the House and Senate Appropriations      Committees two reports not later than May 30, 2017, and      November 30, 2017, which provide the mid-year and end of      fiscal year financial obligation and execution data for      cyberspace activities of each year.

The agreement also provides the funding      necessary to support a 2.1 percent pay raise for all military      personnel, as authorized, effective January 1, 2017.         reprogramming guidance for military personnel accounts       The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit the Base for      Reprogramming (DD Form 1414) for each of the fiscal year 2017      appropriations accounts not later than 60 days after the      enactment of this The Secretary of Defense is prohibited      from executing any reprogramming or transfer of funds for any      purpose other than originally appropriated until the      aforementioned report is submitted to the House and Senate      Appropriations       The Secretary of Defense is directed to use the normal      prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funds in      the Services' military personnel accounts between budget      activities in excess of $10,000,000.               military personnel special interest items       Items for which additional funds have been provided or have      been specifically reduced as shown in the project level      tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ``only for'' or      ``only to'' in the explanatory statement are congressional      special interest items for the purpose of the Base for      Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be      carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as      specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. Below      Threshold Reprogrammings may not be used to either restore or      reduce funding from congressional special interest items as      identified on the DD Form 1414.                             military bands       Military bands honor and celebrate warfighters, promote      patriotism during community events, inspire servicemembers,      and enhance efforts to recruit and retain troops. Band      engagements play an important support role for national      security and joint operations, opening diplomatic doors for      political and military discussions while building trust and      confidence with foreign military and civilian authorities.      However, the activities of military bands must not detract      from the core competencies of the military. The Secretary of      Defense should review opportunities to ensure that only the      critical functions of military bands are supported while      minimizing impacts on funding for essential readiness,      military personnel, modernization, and research and      development activities.

In addition, the      Secretary of Defense should follow prior approval      reprogramming procedures for transfers in excess of      $15,000,000 out of the following budget sub-activities:       Army:       Maneuver units       Modular support brigades       Land forces operations support       Force readiness operations support       Land forces depot maintenance       Base operations support       Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization       Navy:       Mission and other flight operations       Aircraft depot maintenance       Mission and other ship operations       Ship depot maintenance       Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization       Marine Corps:       Depot maintenance       Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization       Air Force:       Primary combat forces       Combat enhancement forces       Operating forces depot maintenance       Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization       Mobilization depot maintenance       Training and recruiting depot maintenance       Administration and service-wide depot maintenance       Air Force Reserve:       Depot maintenance       Air National Guard:       Depot maintenance       Additionally, the Secretary of Defense should follow prior      approval reprogramming procedures for transfers in excess of      $15,000,000 into the following budget sub-activity:       Operation and Maintenance, Army National Guard:       Other personnel support/recruiting and advertising       With respect to Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide,      proposed transfers of funds to or from the levels specified      for defense agencies in excess of $15,000,000 shall be      subject to prior approval reprogramming procedures.            OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS       Items for which additional funds have been provided or have      been specifically reduced as shown in the project level      tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ``only for'' or      ``only to'' in the explanatory statement are congressional      special interest items for the purpose of the Base for      Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be      carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as      specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. Below      Threshold Reprogrammings may not be used to either restore or      reduce funding from congressional special interest items as      identified on the DD Form 1414.                               READINESS       The agreement provides additional readiness funds for the      Services within the operation and maintenance accounts. This      funding shall be used only to improve military readiness,      including increased training, depot maintenance, and base      operations support. None of the funding provided may be used      for recruiting, marketing, or advertising programs. The      funding provided is a congressional special interest item.      The Secretary of Defense and the Service Secretaries are      directed to submit a detailed spending plan by sub-activity      group to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees not      less than 30 days prior to the obligation of these funds.      These transfers may be implemented 30 days after      congressional notification unless an objection is received      from either the House or Senate Appropriations                  ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT       The agreement does not include a provision included in the      House-passed version of H.5293 that referenced the Energy      Independence and Security Act of 2007. It is noted that the      enforcement of section 526 of the Energy Independence and      Security Act of 2007 may lead to higher fuel costs for      federal fleets in the absence of competitively priced new      generation fuels that emit fewer emissions. In carrying out      this statute, the Secretary of Defense and the Service      Secretaries should work to ensure that costs associated with      fuel purchases necessary to carry out their respective      missions should be minimized to the greatest extent possible.                           CIVILIAN PAY RAISE       Although the agreement does not include additional funds      specifically for the civilian pay increase from 1.6 percent      to 2.1 percent, sufficient funding is available within the      appropriations accounts to fully fund the increase due to      assets created by the civilian hiring freeze and the extended      length of H.2028, theFurther Continuing and Security      Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017.                       AQUEOUS FILM FORMING FOAM       The use of the fire-extinguishing agent Aqueous Film      Forming Foam (AFFF) by the Department of Defense has been      linked to elevated levels of perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs)      on military bases and in neighboring communities. According      to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the      National Institutes of Health, PFCs have adverse impacts on      human health. The Navy and Air Force have begun remediation      of PFC contamination. The Secretary of Defense is encouraged      to require all Services to establish procedures for prompt      and cost-effective remediation. In addition, the Secretary of      Defense is directed to submit a report to the congressional      defense committees not later than 120 days after the      enactment of this Act that assesses the number of formerly      used and current military installations where AFFF was or is      currently used and the impact of PFC contaminated drinking      water on surrounding communities. The report should also      include plans for prompt community notification of such      contamination, when the contamination was detected, and the      procedures for timely remediation.

Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming      funds shall remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and      $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation.       Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is      directed to continue to provide the congressional defense      committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports      for Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of      this Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with the      guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying      the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The      Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior      approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified      dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or      research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is      less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for      reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments.      Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of      a procurement (P-1) or research, development, test and      evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the      Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval      reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In      addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval      reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest      items are established elsewhere in this statement.

PROCUREMENT SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS       Items for which additional funds have been provided as      shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the      phrase ``only for'' or ``only to'' in the explanatory      statement are congressional special interest items for the      purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of      these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated      amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory      statement.       JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER BUDGET JUSTIFICATIONS AND CONTRACTING       Throughout the fiscal year 2017 budget review process, the      Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Joint Program Office provided      insufficient justification and incomplete information in an      untimely manner. It is imperative that requested information      is received promptly for proper congressional oversight of      this major defense acquisition program.       It is understood that the Secretary of Defense is reviewing      potential alternative management structures for the JSF      program as directed by the National Defense Authorization Act      for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328). This review will      provide an opportunity to improve communication between the      JSF Program Executive Officer (PEO), the Services, and the      congressional defense committees to ensure the program's      funding requirements are fully understood, communicated, and      justified.       Additionally, there is concern that the number of F-35s      enacted in annual Department of Defense Appropriations Acts      are not being placed on contract by the JSF PEO in a timely      manner. Four F-35s included in the Department of Defense      Appropriations Act, 2015 and 13 F-35s included in the      Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2016 were not part      of their respective low rate initial production (LRIP)      contracts due to the PEO's contracting strategy.      Specifically, only four F-35Cs were included on LRIPs 9 and      10, rather than the ten F-35Cs enacted in the Department of      Defense Appropriations Acts, 2015 and 2016, impeding      production efficiencies. The agreement directs the JSF PEO to      use a contracting approach that would award all aircraft      included in each Department of Defense Appropriations Act on      the respective production contract for that fiscal year. The      agreement includes funding for 74 F-35 aircraft. The JSF PEO      is directed to brief the congressional defense committees not      later than 45 days after the enactment of this Act on the      contracting strategy for these aircraft.

Additionally, the Navy is addressing increasing ballistic and      cruise missile threats through the development and      acquisition of an Air and Missile Defense Radar, which is      planned for integration on the DDG-51 class of ships through      an engineering change proposal, resulting in a new Flight III      configuration. However, a recent Government Accountability      Office report (GAO 16-613) details concerns regarding a lack      of sufficient acquisition and limited detail design knowledge      to support the Navy's current Flight III procurement      strategy. Further concerns remain regarding the full costs of      DDG-51 Flight III destroyers. Therefore, the Secretary of the      Navy should award and complete the additional DDG-51 ship,      fully funded in fiscal years 2016 and 2017, as an additional      DDG-51 Flight IIA ship. The Secretary of the Navy is directed      to expeditiously award this ship construction contract.               polar icebreaker recapitalization project       The Navy and the Coast Guard are collaborating to refine      requirements and an acquisition strategy for procurement of      an affordable polar icebreaker. This collaboration continues      to refine program costs and requirements in an effort to      award a detailed design and construction contract for the      lead ship in fiscal year 2019. The agreement supports this      effort and provides $150,000,000 in advance procurement      funding to buy long-lead time material for the program's      initial ship. The Coast Guard is encouraged to budget for      follow-on efforts.

TH08MR17.137     [[Page H1821]]              REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS       The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow      the reprogramming guidance as specified in the report      accompanying the House version of the Department of Defense      Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110-     279). Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming      funds shall remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and      $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation.       Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is      directed to continue to provide the congressional defense      committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports      for Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of      this Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with the      guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying      the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The      Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior      approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified      dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or      research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is      less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for      reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments.      Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of      a procurement (P-1) or research, development, test and      evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the      Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval      reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In      addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval      reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest      items are established elsewhere in this statement.                           FUNDING INCREASES       The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be      provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the      tables.   RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS       Items for which additional funds have been provided as      shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the      phrase ``only for'' or ``only to'' in the explanatory      statement are congressional special interest items for the      purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of      these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated      amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory      statement.

To limit such transfers and improve      oversight within the Defense Health Program operation and      maintenance account, the agreement includes a provision which      caps the funds available for Private Sector Care under the      TRICARE program subject to prior approval reprogramming      procedures. The provision and accompanying explanatory      statement language should not be interpreted as limiting the      amount of funds that may be transferred to the In-House Care      budget sub-activity from other budget sub-activities within      the Defense Health In addition, funding for the In-     House Care budget sub-activity continues to be designated as      a congressional special interest item. Any transfer of funds      from the In-House Care budget sub-activity into the Private      Sector Care budget sub-activity or any other budget sub-     activity requires the Secretary of Defense to follow prior      approval reprogramming procedures for operation and      maintenance funds.       The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide written      notification to the congressional defense committees of      cumulative transfers in excess of $10,000,000 out of the      Private Sector Care budget sub-activity not later than      fifteen days after such a transfer. Furthermore, the      Secretary of Defense is directed to provide a report to the      congressional defense committees not later than 30 days after      the enactment of this Act that delineates transfers of funds      in excess of $10,000,000, and the dates any transfers      occurred, from the Private Sector Care budget sub-activity to      any other budget sub-activity groups for fiscal year 2016.       The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) is      directed to provide quarterly reports to the congressional      defense committees on budget execution data for all of the      Defense Health Program budget activities and to adequately      reflect changes to the budget activities requested by the      Services in future budget submissions.                 PEER-REVIEWED CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM       The agreement provides $60,000,000 for the peer-reviewed      cancer research program to research cancers not addressed in      the breast, prostate, ovarian, kidney, and lung cancer      research programs.       The funds provided in the peer-reviewed cancer research      program are directed to be used to conduct research in the      following areas: bladder cancer, brain cancer, colorectal      cancer, immunotherapy, listeria-based regimens for cancer,      liver cancer, lymphoma, melanoma and other skin cancers,      mesothelioma, neuroblastoma, pancreatic cancer, pediatric      brain tumors, stomach cancer, and cancer in children,      adolescents, and young adults.       The reports directed under this heading in House Report      114-577 and Senate Report 114-263 are still required.                 PEER-REVIEWED MEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM       The agreement provides $300,000,000 for a peer-reviewed      medical research program. The Secretary of Defense, in      conjunction with the Service Surgeons General, is directed to      select medical research projects of clear scientific merit      and direct relevance to military health. Research areas      considered under this funding are restricted to the following      areas: acute lung injury, antimicrobial resistance,      arthritis, burn pit exposure, chronic migraine and post-     traumatic headache, congenital heart disease, constrictive      bronchiolitis, diabetes, diarrheal diseases, dystonia, early      trauma thermal regulation, eating disorders, emerging      infectious diseases, epidermolysis bullosa, focal segmental      glomerulosclerosis, Fragile X, Guillain-Barre syndrome,      hepatitis B and C, hereditary angioedema, hydrocephalus,      immunomonitoring of intestinal transplants, inflammatory      bowel diseases, influenza, integrative medicine, interstitial      cystitis, malaria, metals toxicology, mitochondrial disease,      musculoskeletal disorders, nanomaterials for bone      regeneration, non-opioid pain management, pancreatitis,      pathogen-inactivated dried cryoprecipitate, polycystic kidney      disease, post-traumatic osteoarthritis, pulmonary fibrosis,      respiratory health, Rett syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis,      scleroderma, sleep disorders, spinal muscular atrophy,      sustained-release drug delivery, tinnitus, tuberculosis,      vaccine development for infectious disease, vascular      malformations, and women's heart disease. The additional      funding provided under the peer-reviewed medical research      program shall be devoted only to the purposes listed above.                    ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM       Concerns remain with the progress being made by the      Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to fully develop,      procure, and deploy an interoperable electronic health record      solution. The two systems must be completely and meaningfully      interoperable, and the Under Secretary of Defense      (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) is encouraged to      focus on the overall goal of seamless compatibility between      the two Departments' electronic health record systems.       For the necessary oversight of this important program, the      Program Executive Officer (PEO) for the Defense Healthcare      Management Systems (DHMS) is directed to provide quarterly      reports to the congressional defense committees and the      Government Accountability Office on the cost and schedule of      the program, to include milestones, knowledge points, and      acquisition timelines, as well as quarterly obligation      reports. These reports should also include any changes to the      deployment timeline, including benchmarks, for full operating      capability; any refinements to the cost estimate for full      operating capability and the total lifecycle cost of the      program; an assurance that the acquisition strategy will      comply with the acquisition rules, requirements, guidelines,      and systems acquisition management practices of the federal      government; the status of the effort to achieve      interoperability between the electronic health record systems      of the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, including      the scope, cost, schedule, mapping to health data standards,      and performance benchmarks of the interoperable record; and      the progress toward developing, implementing, and fielding      the interoperable electronic health record throughout the two      Departments' medical facilities.       The PEO DHMS is directed to continue briefing the House and      Senate Appropriations Committees on a quarterly basis,      coinciding with the report submission. Given that full      deployment of the new electronic health record is not      scheduled until fiscal year 2022, the Department of Defense      is expected to continue working on interim modifications and      enhancements to the current system to improve      interoperability in the near-term. Additionally, the PEO DHMS      is directed to provide written notification to the House and      Senate Appropriations Committees prior to obligating any      contract, or combination of contracts, for electronic health      record systems in excess of $5,000,000.       Additionally, the Director of the Interagency Program      Office is directed to continue to provide quarterly briefings      on standards development, how those standards are being      incorporated by the two Departments, and the progress of      interoperability to the House and Senate Appropriations      Subcommittees for Defense and Military Construction, Veterans      Affairs, and Related In an effort to ensure      government-wide accountability, the PEO DHMS, in coordination      with the appropriate personnel of the Department of Veterans      Affairs, is directed to provide the Federal Chief Information      Officer of the United States with monthly updates on progress      made by the two Departments to reach interoperability and      modernize their respective electronic health records.

Trucker Dukes was not quite 4 years old when he took his last breath this past Friday after a painful battle with stage IV neuroblastoma and 2 years of intense treatment.  Trucker's dad is a firefighter, and like father, like son, Trucker loved fire trucks. When Trucker went to New York for treatment, the New York Fire Department coordinated a very special third birthday party celebration and swore him in as an honorary firefighter.  After Trucker passed away, his parents, Shauna and Joshua, shared this message: ``If there's one thing I hope, it is that you love a little harder . . . a little better. Go home, stop the craziness in your life, and just kiss your loved ones more, tell them you love them more.

56,topic-id,1149,"Mr.Speaker, I am so grateful that our colleagues across the aisle have become so interested in the impact of the national debt on the American people. I only wish that, during their time in control of the White House, we had not doubled the national debt.  I am similarly grateful that Members on the other side of the aisle would say that we should know the impact of legislation before we vote for it because, after all, it was former Speaker Pelosi who said: Let's vote for it so that we know what is in the Affordable Care  Mr.Speaker, I rise today because following an 8-year cycle of abandonment, it is time we do right by our military members and their families. I rise in support of the brave warriors stationed at Eglin Air Force Base, Naval Air Station Pensacola, and all across the globe. The 2.1 percent pay raise we provide in this appropriation is a modest downpayment on what is owed to those who put themselves in harm's way for our freedom.  Our current state of military readiness is not acceptable. Half of the planes in our Navy cannot fly. Pilots are leaving. Marines are harvesting parts out of museums. Soldiers downrange don't have the unrivaled equipment they need to match their unrivaled patriotism.  This $583 billion appropriation is a first step. It means 74 new F-35 aircraft. The F-35 is the most capable aircraft in the sky. Pilots have greater survivability in the F-35. This matters so much to me. In my district, we are training the next generation of F-35 pilots to fight and win against any enemy we encounter in the skies.  This legislation also reflects our values by investing in cancer research and traumatic brain injury research.  Now, some say we cannot focus on defense; we should focus on other domestic priorities. I would simply say our adversaries are not waiting. Our warfighters and military families are tired of waiting and so am  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I appreciated the gentleman from Florida's comments, but I would just ask him: Why is the Republican leadership 5 months late in bringing a defense appropriations bill to the floor?  We could have done this months ago. So if there was this urgency, it seems to escape the Republican leadership.  I want to take issue with the gentlewoman from Wyoming when she says that what is important today and what we are debating today is only this Defense Appropriations bill.  As you know, we are currently debating the rule, and the rule is a tool used to set the House agenda and to prioritize consideration of legislation. For that very reason, this is, in fact, the appropriate time for us to explain to the American people what legislation we would like to prioritize, what is of grave concern to us, and what agenda we would like to pursue in this  The fact of the matter is that, as we are speaking, the House Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee are marking up TrumpCare, which we know, in all likelihood, is going to result in millions of Americans losing their health insurance. We also are concerned that it is going to cost the American taxpayer a boatload of money.  What we are simply saying here today is that the Congressional Budget Office, which we fund and we rely on, ought to be able to give us a cost estimate, ought to tell us how much this is going to add to our deficit, how much it is going to cost the American people, how many people are going to lose their health care.  Why in the world would you rush a major piece of legislation through committee and onto the floor without even knowing what you are talking about?  I mean, this process constitutes mindless legislating. This is not doing your job, and that is all we are requesting.  We can argue over whether or not you like the Affordable Care Act or you don't. But whatever you are going to do, we ought to bring it to the floor with everybody's eyes wide open and knowing what the impacts are going to be.  Talk about lack of transparency, this TrumpCare bill was under lock and key until just a couple of days ago. It was the best-kept secret in the world. For 7 years, my friends have been talking about a replacement bill. No one ever saw it. But all of a sudden, it is brought out before the American people at a press conference and, again, in a way that doesn't answer a lot of questions. It is being rushed through committee, and it is going to be rushed onto the House floor. That is not a good process.  I will remind my colleagues that when the Affordable Care Act was considered here in the House, the House held 79 bipartisan hearings and markups on the health insurance reform in 2009 and 2010. You have held no hearings. There has been no expert testimony, no healthcare professionals, no doctors, no patients, no nurses, no families, nothing. There have been no hearings. The bill went right to markup.  House Members spent nearly 100 hours in hearings, heard from 181 witnesses from both sides of the aisle, considered 239 amendments, both Democratic and Republican, accepted 21 amendments. Again, there have been no hearings.  In markup, the Energy and Commerce Committee adopted 24 GOP amendments. In markup, the Education and the Workforce Committee adopted six GOP amendments. The original House bill was posted online for 30 days before the first committee began their markup and more than 100 days before the tricommittees formally introduced their merged bill in the  House Democrats posted their first House bill online for the promised 72-hour review. The Senate bill voted on in the House was online for 3 months, and the reconciliation bill was online for 72 hours of review before the final vote.  House Democrats heard and answered questions from constituents at more than 3,000 healthcare townhalls and public events. Tens of thousands of emails, calls, and letters were logged in congressional offices to register public comment. My friends are busy trying to avoid public town meetings.  I am just simply saying that we are raising this issue because we are deeply concerned about the prospect of millions of Americans losing health care and about you adding God knows what to our deficit. I don't think it is too much to come together in a bipartisan way to say: Let us know what the costs are going to be, let us know what the impacts are going to be. And if you still want to vote for TrumpCare, you can vote for it, but you ought to know what you are voting for.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

64,topic-id,382,"Mr.Speaker, over the last 8 years, the United States has experienced a sharp rise in the number of military threats from foreign aggressors. Last month, Russia secretly deployed two batteries of new nuclear-capable cruise missiles. North Korea test-launched four ballistic missiles just this week, and China continues to bolster its military presence in the South China Sea, while going toward a naval fleet that may surpass 351 ships by 2020.  Meanwhile, our own Navy is the smallest it has been in 99 years, satisfying only 40 percent of the demand from regional commanders. Fifty-four percent of the Air Force's major weapons systems now qualify for antique vehicle license plates in the State of  The Army, to quote the Vice Chief of Staff, is ``outraged, outgunned, and outdated.''  These are the bitter fruits of defense sequester; defense sequester which must be pulled out, root and branch. To quote Secretary Mattis: ``No foe in the field can wreak such havoc on our security that mindless sequestration is achieving.''  I agree with General I agree that defense sequester is mindless. It is also dangerous. So today, while I speak in support of this rule and this bill, I applaud the Appropriations Committee for its critical work, and I urge my colleagues to support final passage.  This is just the first step. We will not have fulfilled our first and foremost constitutional duty to keep the country safe until we have completely eliminated defense sequester and truly begun the process of restoring peace through strength.  Einstein's words are as true today as they were in 1931, when he said of America: ``The part of passive spectator is unworthy of this country and is bound in the end to lead to disaster all around.''  If we do not act now to rebuild and modernize our military, if we continue to play the role of passive spectator, not only will it lead to disaster, at some point we will no longer be worthy of global leadership.  So to my colleague, I will say that this is our job. This is our most basic job. So let's do what the American people sent us here to do to keep the country safe, restore peace through strength. That is doing our job.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgH1604-3.txt,99999999999999,FAIRNESS IN CLASS ACTION LITIGATION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,8.0,March

Mr.Speaker, in the first 2 years after the ACA's implementation, the rate of uninsured veterans dropped by an astonishing 43 percent. This was largely due to the fact that, through the ACA's Medicaid expansion, 7 out of 10 previously uninsured veterans became eligible for coverage.  The Republicans' so-called repeal-and-replace plan would slash veterans' options by abandoning our commitment to a more inclusive Medicaid program.

228,topic-id,1111,"Mr.President, looking at today's headlines and listening to the news, it may seem as if colleagues from across the country--Democrat, Republican--don't always agree on some things, let alone anything. I think we are starting to see a consensus emerge--a very good, genuine agreement emerge between liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans on at least one matter in Washington, DC, in the Senate: Neil That agreement is on Neil  Neil Gorsuch is an exceptional nominee for the U.Supreme In fact, Judge Gorsuch is, by many extents and by many commentators, arguably one of the most talented jurists we have nominated to the Court in a very long time, at least in modern history.  As the Denver Post in Colorado said: ``Gorsuch is a brilliant legal mind'' who has a reputation for ``[applying] the law fairly and consistently.''  You can't ask for much more than that--somebody who will apply the law fairly and consistently. However, this shouldn't surprise anyone who knows Judge Judge Gorsuch has always enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support. All we need to do to see that is to look back to 2006 when we could see that most clearly in the U. In 2006, when Judge Gorsuch was unanimously confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court, 12 current Democratic Senators, including the minority leader and Senators Leahy, Feinstein, and Durbin, all were in office. It was a nomination in 2006 that was unanimous, a nomination that went by voice vote.  He was so universally appealing to the Tenth Circuit Court that he had an introduction at the Judiciary Committee by both a Democratic Senator[[Page S1662]]from Colorado and a Republican Senator from Colorado, joined by every single person on the floor to vote yes unanimously.  They approved his nomination. And to give you even greater context about this vote, the people who made this vote, the approval of Judge Gorsuch in 2006 to the Tenth Circuit Court came in addition to the 12 people I just mentioned who are here today and who were here then. It also came with the support of then-Senator Obama, Senator Biden, Senator Clinton, and Senator  Approximately 11 years later, now that Judge Gorsuch has proved himself to be a mainstream jurist, a consensus builder, a profound legal mind with an even temperament and affable nature, we have a chance again to put this incredibly brilliant mind on the Nation's highest  Judge Gorsuch is a faithful adherent to the Constitution and the organizing principles of this great democracy. I have no doubt that Judge Gorsuch will--and should--enjoy similar levels of approval among my distinguished colleagues across the aisle.  I also wish for people to learn more about Judge Gorsuch personally and to tell some stories about growing up in It is a story about how a young man from Denver, CO, through his own hard work and academic excellence, rose to the highest echelons of the legal profession and to the nearly universal acclaim of Democrats and  A fourth-generation Coloradan, Neil Gorsuch learned the value of hard work at a young age from his grandfathers. His maternal grandfather, Joseph McGill, began his adult life by working in Union Station, the main railway terminal in From there, McGill put himself through medical school and became a prominent surgeon. With his wife, Dorothy Jean, McGill raised seven children, all of whom he gave a better life to and put through college.  Neil's paternal grandfather, John Gorsuch, was his legal inspiration. After serving in World War I, John Gorsuch put himself through undergraduate and law school at the University of Denver by driving a trolley car. Upon graduation, John built a law practice focusing on real estate law. He also made time to help Denver's welfare department and participate in the Kiwanis Club and numerous other civic organizations. Later, John started what was at one time one of the largest law firms in Denver, Gorsuch Kirgis, where he practiced well into his eighties.  It was this family work ethic that drove Neil to get his hands dirty and pursue blue collar jobs at a young age. In Colorado, he moved furniture, he shoveled snow, he mowed lawns, and he even shoveled some more snow in the great State of It was this work ethic--and a lot of shoveling of snow--combined with his family's appreciation of higher education that helped Neil consistently realize academic excellence.  By now, I think this Chamber is well familiar with Judge Gorsuch's sterling academic credentials, receiving his undergraduate degree at Columbia, law school at Harvard, Ph.at I don't think any of us can forget, nor should we, the fact that he spent a summer at the University of  Intellect alone doesn't get you through the halls of these storied academic institutions. It requires hard work, independence--two values of the West; two values in addition to many other western values that Judge Gorsuch holds.  It is these values, these western perspectives that the Supreme Court desperately needs to grow. Judge Gorsuch is a lifelong outdoorsman. He enjoys fly fishing and skiing. In fact, I have been told that he is a double black diamond skier. His wife, Louise, cares for animals in a small barn on his land.  In addition to his love of the outdoors and his appreciation of nature's beauty, Judge Gorsuch understands the complex legal issues facing westerners and our Western  Since 2006, Judge Gorsuch served on the Federal court that covers the Tenth Circuit Court based out of Denver that covers six other Western States--Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Those States represent nearly 20 percent of the land of the continental United  His service on this court has provided him with a unique understanding of public lands, water, and Tribal issues that many of the other Western States in the region face. Some of the most complex legal challenges in water law and others come before his court as a result. That experience would serve all of our Western States well when utilized from the U.Supreme  Over the coming days, I plan, along with many of my other colleagues, to elaborate on why Gorsuch's western values and perspective make him an outstanding choice for the U.Supreme I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure he gets a timely up-or-down vote. From the highest echelons of the legal field to the Tenth Circuit Court, to the U.Supreme Court, Judge Gorsuch would make us proud, and he would serve this country well.

637,topic-id,2041,"Mr.President, I rise to support the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.Supreme Hopefully, we will see his confirmation in the weeks to come.  As I have come to the floor and talked about before, Judge Gorsuch is a fourth-generation Coloradan who serves on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is the U.circuit court that is housed in Denver, It is the circuit court that oversees about 20 percent of the land mass in the States of Colorado, Oklahoma, and places in between.

He was so popular and so well supported that there was not even a rollcall vote taken in this It was a simple acclamation by a voice vote. In fact, Gorsuch's nomination hearing was deemed so noncontroversial that the last time, Senator Graham was the only committee member to attend.  One may ask oneself what made and continues to make Judge Gorsuch such a mainstream nominee. I do not think we need to look any further than his original Judiciary Committee questionnaire to see that Judge Gorsuch possesses the right temperament and the right view of the role of judges.  I thought it was important that I read this from 11 years ago when Judge Gorsuch was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit The questionnaire he filled out for the Judiciary Committee included then-Neil Gorsuch's--trying to be Judge Gorsuch--response to judicial activism and what it meant to Neil Gorsuch prior to his confirmation to the Tenth Circuit  Here is what he replied to the Judiciary Committee in that committee questionnaire:       The Constitution requires Federal judges to strike a      delicate balance. The separation of powers embodied in our      founding document provides the judiciary with a defined and      limited charter.       Judges must allow the elected branches of government to      flourish and citizens, through their elected representatives,      to make laws appropriate to the facts and circumstances of      the day.       Judges must avoid the temptation to usurp the roles of the      legislative and executive branches and must appreciate the      advantages these democratic institutions have in crafting and      adapting social policy as well as their special authority,      derived from the consent and mandate of the people, to do so.       At the same time, the Founders were anxious to ensure that      the judicial branch never becomes captured by or subservient      to the other branches of government, recognizing[[Page S1717]]     that a firm and independent judiciary is critical to a well-     functioning democracy.       The Constitution imposes on the judiciary the vital work of      settling disputes, vindicating civil rights and civil      liberties, ensuring equal treatment under the law, and      helping to make real for all citizens the Constitution's      promise of self-government. There may be no firmly fixed      formula on how to strike the balance envisioned by the      Constitution in specific cases, but there are many guideposts      discernible in the best traditions of our judiciary.       A wise judge recognizes that his or her own judgment is      only a weak reed without being fortified by these proven      guides.       For example, a good judge recognizes that many of the      lawyers in cases reaching the court of appeals have lived      with and thought deeply about the legal issues before the      court for months or years. A lawyer in the well is not to be      treated as a cat's paw but as a valuable colleague whose      thinking is to be mined and tested and who, at all times,      deserves to be treated with respect and common courtesy.       A good judge will diligently study counsels' briefs and the      record and seek to digest them fully before argument and then      listen with respectful discernment to the arguments made by      his or her colleagues at the bar.       A good judge will recognize that few questions in the law      are truly novel, that precedents in the vast body of Federal      law reflect the considered judgment of those who have come      before us and embody the settled expectation of those in our      own generation.       A good judge will seek to honor precedent and strive to      avoid its disparagement or displacement.       A good judge will listen to his or her colleagues and      strive to reach consensus with them. Every judge takes the      same judicial oath; every judge brings a different and      valuable perspective to the office.       A good judge will appreciate the different experiences and      perspectives of his or her colleagues and know that reaching      consensus is not always easy but that the process of getting      there often tempers the ultimate result, ensuring that the      ultimate decision reflects the collective wisdom of multiple      individuals of disparate backgrounds who have studied the      issue with care.       Throughout the process of adjudicating an appeal, a good      judge will question not only the positions espoused by the      litigants but also his or her own perceptions and      tentative conclusions as they evolve.       And a good judge will critically examine his or her own      ideas as readily and openly as the ideas advanced by others.       A good judge will never become so wedded to any view of any      case so as to preclude the possibility of changing his or her      mind at any stage--from argument through the completion of a      written opinion.       Pride of position, fear of embarrassment associated with      changing one's mind, along, of course, with personal politics      or policy preferences have no useful role in judging; regular      and healthy doses of self-skepticism and humility about one's      own abilities and conclusions always do.  This is the response that then-Neil Gorsuch, prior to his becoming Judge Gorsuch, gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee and in response to a questionnaire about judicial activism and about what makes a good judge in his talking about fidelity to precedent, talking about the ability to reach a conclusion that may be in disagreement with one's own personal opinions, making sure that we respect the different branches of government, making sure that one listens to one's colleagues who are arguing a case and who have spent years in their getting to know the case and its every detail, and scrubbing your mind to question the positions that you thought you had to make sure that they mesh with the law, not with opinion.  Judge Gorsuch, when he was introduced at the White House when being nominated by the President, said that a judge who agrees with every opinion he reaches is probably a bad judge.  The institution we serve has that fidelity to the Constitution that we must preserve, that we must guard. Guardians of the Constitution, which judges represent, is something we confirm. It is our job to make sure the kind of judges we place on courts represent the kind of judge Neil Gorsuch truly is.  It is this temperament, this fidelity to the Constitution, this appropriate temperament, and remarkable humility that has made Judge Gorsuch a consensus pick in the past and, I believe, that could be a consensus pick in the near future.  It is reflected in the fact that, on February 23, Senator Bennet and I, along with the Judiciary Committee, received a letter from Colorado's diverse legal community in support of Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme  The letter reads as follows:       As members of the Colorado legal community, we are proud to      support the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be our next      Supreme Court We hold a diverse set of political      views as Republicans, Democrats, and Many of us      have been critical of actions taken by President      Nonetheless, we all agree that Judge Gorsuch is exceptionally      well qualified to join the Supreme He deserves an up-     or-down vote.       We know Judge Gorsuch to be a person of utmost character.      He is fair, decent, and honest, both as a judge and as a      person. His record shows that he believes strongly in the      independence of the judiciary. Judge Gorsuch has a well-     earned reputation as an excellent jurist. He voted with the      majority in 98% of the cases he heard on the 10th Circuit, a      great portion of which were joined by judges appointed by      Democratic Seven of his opinions have been      affirmed by the U.Supreme Court--four unanimously--and      none has been reversed.       We ask that Colorado's Senators join together and support      this highly qualified nominee from Regardless of      the politics involved in prior confirmation efforts,      including what many consider to be the mistreatment of Judge      Garland's nomination, a filibuster now will do Colorado no      good.

Dear Senator Grassley: I write this letter in strong      support of the nomination and confirmation of Judge Neil      Gorsuch for Associate Justice of the United States Supreme            Judge Gorsuch has been known to me professionally for over      twenty years, and his family even longer. In the mid-     nineties, we were counsel together in successfully      representing co-defendants in a major securities matter      involving class action and derivative lawsuits in several      jurisdictions across the country as well as SEC and      Congressional investigations. Over the course of that complex      representation in the following years, I came to observe      first-hand his considerable lawyering skills, intellect,      judgment and temperament. He was one of the finest trial      lawyers with whom it has been my pleasure to be associated in      my career. We also became personal and good friends which      continued during the following years at his firm, later      during his time at the Department of Justice and since      returning to Denver to serve on the bench.       I was delighted by his appointment to the U.Court of      Appeals for the Tenth Circuit based here in (He      honored me by having me be one of two lawyers to introduce      him to the court at his formal investiture.) Over his years      of service on that court, he has distinguished himself with      his work ethic, keen and thorough understanding of the case      under review, his formidable analytical ability, and the      clarity of his opinions. I have read many of his opinions and      watched him in oral argument. He is engaging, courteous to      counsel and demonstrates a full and unusual appreciation for      the human impact of his decisions on the people involved.      These are the qualities of an outstanding jurist.       Judge Gorsuch has been active and an important voice in the      legal community and academy. He has written extensively,      lectured and taught in continuing legal education seminars      and served on the important federal Rules Committee, among      others. He also has found time to sit on student moot courts      and teach both ethics and federal jurisdiction at the      University of Colorado Law He is regularly regarded      by his students as one of their very best law professors--     effective, challenging and personable.       Judge Gorsuch's intellect, energy and deep regard for the      Constitution are well known to those of us who have worked      with him and have seen first-hand his commitment to basic      principles. Above all, his independence, fairness and      impartiality are the hallmarks of his career and his well-     earned reputation.

But this promise to Melanie, like it was to millions of Americans, was broken. Melanie's premium skyrocketed to nearly $1,000 a month for a plan with a $5,000 deductible. Her monthly premium is now more than their mortgage.  When her husband was laid off, their options were limited: continuing coverage through COBRA or entering the ObamaCare marketplace.

213,topic-id,703,"Mr.President, I rise to oppose the American Health Care This bill will destroy the Affordable Care Act, even though the Affordable Care Act has given more Americans access to quality, affordable healthcare than ever before in our history. It would force middle-class families to pay more money for less care. It would leave more people uninsured by a lot. It would allow insurance companies to charge older Americans with what is essentially an age tax, as if our parents and grandparents don't already pay insurance companies enough for their care.  It would cause many working families to lose coverage from their employers because, under this new bill, companies would no longer have to provide their workers with healthcare, and without a mandate to do so, we know many of them will not.  It would drastically cut Medicaid funding, which would cripple our State budgets and would leave many seniors in nursing homes and lower income New Yorkers stuck without a way to pay for the medical care they actually need to survive. This bill would also take away healthcare for millions of women, including lifesaving healthcare services like breast exams and pap smears.  On top of all of this, as if to add insult to injury, this so-called healthcare plan would give tax breaks to health insurance CEOs who make more than[[Page S1654]]$500,000 a year. How is any of this going to make people in my State or in my colleagues' States healthier?  I am struggling to understand, amid all of the problems we seem to have and all of the problems we need to solve in this Chamber, why this Congress seems to have a singular fixation on taking away access to healthcare from some of the most vulnerable people in our communities. I continue to be amazed by how little empathy there seems to be in this Chamber for the millions of women, older Americans, and lower income Americans who do not have the incredible resources that we have here in Congress and who desperately need the Federal programs this bill will cut.  The legislation is completely out of touch with the actual needs of the people in my It is driven by ideology, as if it is somehow the wrong thing to do to help people in our States live healthy and fulfilling lives.  If someone is diagnosed with cancer and the only way he can afford to see an oncologist and have surgery is through an Affordable Care Act health plan, do you think he cares whether his insurance coverage was made possible by ObamaCare? If your parents or grandparents suffer from dementia and the only way they can afford the constant care and medical attention is if they sign up for Medicaid, do you think they care that Medicaid is a program that is actually run by the Federal Government?  I don't think families care about that. I think they are much more concerned about whether they have access to the insurance plans that actually cover their needs, that actually treat their illnesses, that actually give them the medicines they need, and that allow them to heal and get back to full strength.  That is why the Affordable Care Act has done so many good things for people in our States--because access to healthcare is a human right. Now that millions more Americans finally have it, it is wrong to take it away from them.  I urge my colleagues in this Chamber to think much more about the women in their lives who need access to these preventive healthcare services, to think about all of the hard-working Americans who do not earn a lot, though they work full-time jobs and cannot afford it, and to think about all of the older Americans who are really being disadvantaged through this bill so they will not be able to afford that 24/7 or nursing care they need.

807,topic-id,2845,"Mr.Speaker, it is the end of another week in session.  Mr.Speaker, I want to revisit an important issue. It seems that what some of us were trying to point out for 8 years under the Obama administration fell on deaf ears, that there really are radical Islamists who want to destroy our way of life in the United States, who look at us as infidels, and not just Christians, Jews, secularists, and others, but even Muslims who do not adapt and accept the radical Islamic ways.  That works to the advantage of some because we have seen for 8 years CAIR, Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated groups, groups that were listed as co-conspirators in the Holy Land Foundation trial[[Page H2046]]back in 2008, where the named defendants were convicted of many counts, and they were supporting terrorism. They have ties all over the United States and they have ties to people who constantly had access to President Obama's White House, the State Department, and so many other areas.  We saw time and time again the Obama administration looking the other way as serious matters arose involving radical Islamists, both in the United States and abroad. The Obama administration's approach was: If we can just teach these racist, bigoted, Americans to love all Because they wouldn't point out that some are radicals, as my Muslim friends don't hesitate to point out.  But this administration didn't want to point out that there are radical Islamists, that they are part of Islam, that many of them are experts in Islam, like Baghdadi, who heads up the Islamic He has a Ph.in Islamic studies, so it is kind of difficult to say that he has nothing to do with Islam when that is the basis for everything he said and did.  If one goes and looks at the pleading that the judge declassified from 2008 of testimony given by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in a court at Guantanamo Bay, he makes very clear that he is not insane, that he is very lucid. He files a very impressive document explaining himself.  For everything that he said, for example, about the need to kill Christians and Jews, he had a direct quote, not from the Like where often Members of Congress, if you bring something up on the floor about Islam or the Koran, then it is amazing. It hasn't happened in a while, but Members who bring something like that up, they frequently find themselves being presented a Somebody drops off a  But, as an expert in the field pointed out to me when I showed him the Koran that was dropped off at my House, he says, that is a Koran, it is not a Holy Koran; because what they have done is they have taken what they call the Holy Koran and they have eliminated the verses that support terrorism and the killing of Jews and So if you read from cover to cover this Koran, you don't see any of the verses that the most radical Islamists rely on for their killing, their beheading, their betraying, their lies. And it is okay, they believe, to lie if it ends up supporting the cause of their radical beliefs about  One of the reasons that I contend with so many others here that Egypt ought to be one of our dearest friends is because they have an elected president. Yes, he was a former general, like Eisenhower, like George Washington, like Andrew Jackson, like so many who had been generals before they became They understand warfare.  But the radical Islamists in the United States, so many of them, Muslim Brotherhood-related groups, they pointed out time and again: Look, we know we are going to have to get to violence at some point. But for now, we are making so much progress in taking over the United States without using violence that right now violence distracts from what we are trying to do.  Some of us continue to point out that what the Obama administration constantly used as their fight against, not radical Islam--they couldn't say that like President Trump does--but they would say against violent extremism: We have got to spend millions and millions, and hundreds of millions of dollars fighting violent extremism.  They believed what the often Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated individuals would say: Yes, if we spend that money teaching people to love and accept Islam, then the problem goes away and there is no more violence.  Which is, in and of itself, a complete lie.  So the Obama administration has been spending money on things. I am told by someone who was looking at the ways that the Obama administration spent hard-earned taxpayer dollars paid to the government, and then the Obama administration would turn around and spend it. I am told by someone in Homeland Security--I haven't seen it--but they even had a project spending taxpayer dollars to fight radical Islam by teaching schoolchildren pro-Islamic songs to sing. It is one of the reasons I am so glad we have had a change of  I know that there are so many people across the aisle, not necessarily people here in this body, but across the country, who keep saying: Oh, there is so much prejudice against Muslims, and that is the whole problem. If we can eliminate the prejudice against Islam, against Muslims, there will be no more violence.  There are those that are in this body here who have gone so far to show how open-minded they are and how much they embrace the ideals of Islam, and are in no way bigoted, that they have exposed this body to criminals, to hacking; and who knows just how far the security breaches go.  Mr.Speaker, we brought this up, but it is important to take note that this body--there were no Republicans that hired them, but Imran Awan seemed to be the ring leader, Abid Awan, Jamal Awan, Hina Alvi, Natalia Sova, each making $160,000-plus from the House of The Awan brothers are of Pakistani descent. I am told the leader is now back in Pakistan while they are being investigated, but their immigration status appears unclear right now. They had been hired as IT specialists, computer specialists, to help some of my Democratic friends with their computer systems. And as suspicious activity continued to mount over the last 12 years, it was dismissed.  And I am reading from an article that Luke Rosiak, March 8, from The Daily Caller wrote.                              {time}  1230  I'm reading from an article that Luke Rosiak, March 8, of the Daily Caller wrote:       It was dismissed because these five individuals were being      unfairly picked on because they are  Well, some of us don't care what their religious beliefs are unless their religious beliefs happen to cause them to believe that our Constitution needed to be eliminated and replaced by nothing but sharia law, and our elected leaders needed to be replaced by what they believe is a holy appointment of a caliph or an imam.  This article from March 8 says that congressional staffers suspected of improperly accessing sensitive data allegedly controlled their stepmother with violent threats in a plan to use her to access assets stored in the Middle East in their father's name.  So just when we thought this whole matter could not get any more bizarre, these five, according to one of their employers here in this House, he says--and I have no reason to doubt him--that they are But I know my friends. They don't want to ever be perceived as being bigoted because they are not. But they have gone so far overboard in trying to show how open-minded they are, they have exposed this body to security breaches that are really unbelievable.  I understand from my friend, Devin Nunes, that these individuals were not, best they can tell, ever given access to the classified material in the separate classified system that the intel community has.  Talking about running the Democratic House Members' computer networks, this article says: ``Days before U.Capitol Police told House Members three Pakistani brothers who ran their computer networks may have stolen congressional data, their stepmother called Fairfax County, Virginia, police to say the Democratic staffers were keeping her from her husband's deathbed.''  A relative described her situation as being kept in captivity by the brothers for months while they schemed to take their father's life insurance.  The brothers, as IT professionals--computer experts--for Congress, could read House Members' emails and also had full access to their calendars: who they were meeting with and where they were meeting.  Anyway, the article says they ``allegedly used wiretapping devices on their own stepmother and threatened to abduct loved ones in Pakistan if she didn't give them access to money stowed away in that country.  ``On February 2, House officials banned Imran, Abid, and Jamal Awan from the House of Representatives network as part of a Capitol Police criminal investigation into House computer security.''  But longtime employers, including--and it has been in the news--our friend, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman[[Page H2047]]Schultz, and others are named have stood by these suspected criminals. But they did say they had access to their data.  They say we have `` `seen no evidence that they were doing anything that was nefarious' like steal or hack, and were being unfairly picked on for being  ``But a Fairfax police report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group says that separately from that investigation, on Thursday, on January 5 at 2 p.m., `Samani Galani called police after her stepchildren were denying her access to her husband of 8 years, Muhammad Shah, who is currently hospitalized,' and police responded to the Springfield home she shared with him.  `` `I made contact with her stepson, Abid, who responded to location and was obviously upset with the situation. He stated he has full power of attorney over his father and produced an unsigned, undated document as proof,' officers wrote.''  Then the officer said: ``He refused to disclose his father's location.''  So he didn't even have a signed power of attorney yet continued to assert--and, again, this is someone who is given access to the privileged computer material of people here on Capitol I am told by other IT professionals that do work here that, if you know what you are doing and you have access to even one Congress Member's computer, which means their calendar, their emails, and notes taken and stored on the computer about meetings, then it is very easy--you are good--to access virtually anybody else's information here in  I was told some time back by one of my friends in Intelligence that at one time there was concern about positions I had taken like in support of Egypt against the Muslim Brotherhood and that there were those who were monitoring people that came to my office. I was told that they know everybody that walks into your office.  So when you see these kinds of reports, Mr.Speaker, it is a little disconcerting. It is disconcerting that people are not more concerned here in this body about the potential for the kind of breach that is being stated here.  Anyway the article goes on: ``The father died days later, with his children denying him a final moment with his loved one, and the body was taken to Pakistan, where there were significant assets in their father's name. Galani was shocked to learn that his death certificate''--that of her husband--``listed him as divorced, according to a relative of Galani's. The relative spoke only on condition of anonymity.  `` `They kept their stepmother in sort of illegal captivity from October 16, 2016, to February 2,' the relative said, telling her they were in charge of her life and said she was not allowed to speak to anyone. The fact that she did not speak English made it easy for them to take advantage of her.  ``As Shah laid hospitalized, `they would not let the father communicate with the wife, they would say he'd be meeting her when they said so.'  ``The brothers bugged her house with hidden listening devices and told her `her movements were under constant surveillance and conversations within the house and over the telephone were being listened to. They would repeat what she had told people to prove that they were really listening.'  ```This happened in the United States of America, can you believe it?' the relative asked.  ``Galani obtained a secret cellphone and stood in the yard to communicate with relatives, who encouraged her to call the police. . . .  ``After she did, Abid `threatened her very severely, made her fearful, they told her they are going to abduct or kidnap her family back in Pakistan, and she had to apologize.' ''  Imran is the individual who had done computer work here for so many of our Democratic friends here in the  ``Imran then tried `to manipulate her. She said to him, ``if you say you are my son, then why are you keeping my phone conversations listened to?'' So he said he would remove the devices. He came into the house and she saw him remove a couple,' including under the kitchen counter.''  So it is interesting. We have these guys who Members of Congress said: They don't need a background check. We can trust them. We are open-minded. They are Muslims, but we are not prejudiced. We don't even require a background check because we know we can trust them.  Mr.Speaker, we don't know what they did here in the House, but in their stepmother's house they planted listening devices. Apparently, they knew where to get them, and they knew how to use them in the home. It still leads one to wonder: What all did they do during the 12 years they were working on computer systems here on Capitol Hill?  Still, we know the allegations have been talked about at length in the media about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, but I keep asking: Are these the guys that set up the Democratic National Committee's computers, guys that are good at planting listening devices and who are good at setting up cameras to monitor movement and what is going on? Did these guys help the Democratic National Committee set up their system without any background checks? Are these the guys that made it so vulnerable to being hacked by Russians or most anyone else who cared to try?  ``Galani learned from a life insurance executive that `a few days before the father's death, the beneficiary was changed and Abid became the beneficiary,' the relative said. On top of that, the Springfield house where she lived would go to  ``Galani fled from the brothers and has filed a second police complaint with Fairfax County over insurance fraud and other abuses.  ``Abid did not return a request for comment from'' the Daily  It also pointed out that, after Mr.Shah passed away, these people that were doing computer work for Members of Congress without background checks came into her house. She said that whatever documents were there they stole, along with a couple of laptops that were their father's property, and they left for  Now, I heard somebody that should have known that the ringleader here that headed up the computer company that serviced so many of the--well, this article talks about a handful of Democrats, but I have been hearing that at one time, over the years, over the last 12 years, they may have serviced as many as 80 different Democratic Members of Congress' computers.  But the relatives are coming forward now, according to the article, because Members of Congress have attempted to downplay the brothers' potential crimes and have limited the investigation to just the Capitol Police, who lack the ability to investigate cyber breaches and international crimes, and despite naming the brothers as suspects, have not even arrested them. This is, apparently, a Muslim woman who says that she is fighting to protect the country--talking about the United States--these are very bad people.  This kind of reminds one of the father who came forward to point out that his son had become radicalized and was a terrorist threat because, under the Obama administration, they purged the training documents so FBI agents, State Department officials, and intelligence officials would not know what to look for to spot radical  We know most Muslims are not terrorists.

383,topic-id,1095,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, hardworking Americans are some of the leading victims of frivolous lawsuits and the extraordinary costs that our legal system imposes.  Every day, local businessowners routinely have lawsuits filed against them based on claims that have no substantive connection to them as a means of forum shopping on the part of the lawyers filing the case. These lawsuits present a tremendous burden on small businesses and their employees.  The Innocent Party Protection Act, introduced by Judiciary Committee member Mr.Buck of Colorado, will help reduce the litigation abuse that regularly drags small businesses into court for no other reason than as part of a lawyer's forum shopping strategy.  In order to avoid the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, plaintiffs' attorneys regularly join instate defendants to the lawsuits they file in State court even if the instate defendants' connections to the controversy are minimal or nonexistent.  Typically the innocent but fraudulently joined instate defendant is a small business or the owner or employee of a small business. Even though these innocent instate defendants ultimately don't face any liability as a result of being named as a defendant, they, nevertheless, have to spend money to hire a lawyer and take valuable time away from running their businesses or spending time with their families to deal with matters related to a lawsuit to which they have no real connection.  To take just a few examples, in Bendy v. C.Fleet Company, the plaintiff brought a product liability claim against a national company for its allegedly defective medicinal drink. The plaintiff also joined a resident local defendant health clinic alleging it negligently instructed the plaintiff to ingest the drink.  The national company removed the case to Federal court and argued that[[Page H1969]]the small, local defendant was fraudulently joined because the plaintiff's claims against the clinic were time barred by the statute of limitations, showing no possibility of recovery.  Despite finding the possibility of relief against the local defendant ``remote,'' the court remanded the case after emphasizing the draconian burden on the national company to show fraudulent joinder under the current rules.  The court practically apologized publicly to the joined party stating: ``The fact that Maryland courts are likely to dismiss Bendy's claims against the local defendant is not sufficient for jurisdiction, given the Fourth Circuit's strict standard for fraudulent joinder.''  Shortly after remand, all claims against the local defendant were dismissed, of course, after its presence in the lawsuit served the trial lawyers' tactical purpose of forum shopping. When courts themselves complain about the unfairness of current court rules, Congress should take notice.  In Baumeister v. Home Depot, Home Depot removed a slip-and-fall case to Federal court. The day after removal and before conducting any discovery, the plaintiff amended the complaint to name a local business, which it alleged failed to maintain the store's parking lot.  The court found the timing of the amended complaint was ``suspect,'' noting the possibility that the sole reason for amending the complaint to add the local defendant as a defendant could have been to defeat diversity jurisdiction.                              {time}  1500  Nevertheless, the court held Home Depot had not met its ``heavy burden'' of showing fraudulent joinder under current law because the court found it was possible, even if it were just a tenth of a percent possible, that the newly added defendant could potentially be held liable and remanded the case back to State court. Once back in State court, the plaintiff stipulated to dismiss the innocent local defendant from the lawsuit, but only after it had been used successfully as a forum-shopping pawn.  Trial lawyers join these unconnected instate defendants to their lawsuits because today a case can be kept in State court by simply joining as a defendant a local party that shares the same local residence as the person bringing the lawsuit. When the primary defendant moves to remove the case to Federal court, the addition of that local defendant will generally defeat removal under a variety of approaches judges currently take to determine whether the joined defendant prevents removal to Federal court.  One approach judges take is to require a showing that there is ``no possibility of recovery'' against the local defendant before a case can be removed to Federal court or some practically equivalent standard. Others require the judge to resolve any doubts regarding removal in favor of the person bringing the lawsuit. Still others require the judge to find that the local defendant was added in bad faith before they allow the case to be removed to Federal court.  The current law is so unfairly heavy-handed against innocent local parties joined to lawsuits that Federal Appeals Court Judge Harvie Wilkinson of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has publicly supported congressional action to change the standards for joinder, saying: ``That's exactly the kind of approach to Federal jurisdiction reform I like because it's targeted. And there is a problem with fraudulent jurisdiction law as it exists today, I think, and that is that you have to establish that the joinder of a nondiverse defendant is totally ridiculous and that there is no possibility of ever recovering . . . that's very hard to do,'' he says. ``So I think making the fraudulent joinder law a little bit more realistic . . . appeals to me because it seems to me the kind of intermediate step that addresses real problems.''  The bill before us today addresses those real problems in two main ways:  First, the bill allows judges greater discretion to free an innocent local party from a case where the judge finds there is no plausible case against that party. That plausibility standard is the same standard the Supreme Court has said should be used to dismiss pleadings for failing to state a valid legal claim, and the same standard should apply to release innocent parties from lawsuits.  Second, the bill allows judges to look at evidence that the trial lawyers aren't acting in good faith in adding local defendants. This is a standard some lower courts already use to determine whether a trial lawyer really intends to pursue claims against the local defendant or is just using them as part of their forum-shopping strategy.  This bill is strongly supported by the National Federation of Independent Business and the U.Chamber of Commerce, among other legal reform advocates. Please join me in supporting this vital legislation to reduce litigation abuse and forum shopping and to protect innocent parties from costly, extended, and unnecessary litigation.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1968-2.txt,446,MORNING BUSINESS,2017.0,9.0,March

430,topic-id,487,"Mr.Chairman, the manager's amendment makes several technical changes to the bill, none of which alter its basic policy, but all of which add clarity to the bill where necessary.  First, in the section of the bill governing conflicts of interest, this amendment strikes the prohibition on the use of the same class counsel if the named plaintiff is a present or former client or has a contractual relationship with the class counsel. In some instances, those restrictions may unduly limit the availability of class counsel or class representatives, so this amendment would remove them. It also clarifies that nothing in the conflicts of interest section of the bill applies to securities class actions, which have their own provisions for selection of class representatives and counsel elsewhere in the U.The same exemption for securities class actions is made to the stay of discovery section of the bill because, again, securities class actions have their own discovery stay provisions elsewhere in the U. Second, the amendment makes technical changes to the misjoinder section of the bill, making clear it applies only to civil actions commenced in State court and subsequently removed to Federal court, and that a Federal court can retain jurisdiction over claims that are so related to each other that they form part of the same case and controversy under Article III of the Constitution, and the plaintiff consents to the removal of the claim.  Third, the amendment extends from 30 days to 90 days the amount of time for Federal courts to review the sufficiency of the allegations verification submissions made in the section on multidistrict litigation. The amendment also makes clear that a particular case may not be tried in a multidistrict proceeding unless all parties in that particular case consent--not all parties in the entire multidistrict proceeding. And it also makes clear in the section providing that the claimant shall not receive less than 80 percent of any monetary recovery, that such section does not alter the claimant's obligations to satisfy liens on the recovery--that is, debts owed to the Federal Government or to private insurers--for medical services received by the claimant for the treatment of the injuries alleged in the litigation. So, for example, if a person took a medicine and alleges he suffered injury as a result, a Federal program may[[Page H1984]]have paid for the treatment of the injury. If the person gets a settlement of his claim, it would include money for those medical services that should be paid back to the Federal The revision makes clear that the satisfaction of such liens should come out of the 80 percent received by the claimant. The amendment also makes clear that the authorization for appeals from orders in MDL proceedings is limited to cases seeking redress for personal injury.

Another one of Rubinstein's clients . . . admitted she had      served as a plaintiff for Rubinstein in at least four class      actions over products like Swanson pot pies and lipstick. . .      . Emails and other communications 5-Hour's lawyers uncovered      in their suit showed that Rubinstein belonged to a loose      affiliation of lawyers who ran an assembly-line process of      identifying companies to sue and then helping each other find      plaintiffs.[[Page H1985]]  Lawsuits are supposed to be initiated by truly injured plaintiffs seeking redress, not invented by lawyers who hunt for a plaintiff to assert a supposed injury made up by the lawyer.  Few class members bother to collect the payments available in class action settlements, in large part because they don't feel injured by the supposedly wrongful conduct in the first place.  In too many cases, trial lawyers come up with an idea for a lawsuit and then search for a person who has bought the product, or they send a relative or employee to buy the product so they will have someone who can sue on behalf of a proposed class of all other buyers. No product purchaser has actually complained or feels cheated; it is just lawyers in pursuit of money. That is a major reason why so few class members bother to collect the payments available in class action settlements. They don't feel injured by the supposedly wrongful conduct in the first place.  This abuse of the class action lawyer-driven lawsuits must end. The base bill, therefore, requires lawyers to disclose how proposed class representatives became involved in the class action. Further, it prohibits class actions in which any proposed class representative, that is, a named plaintiff that will be representing everyone else in the class action, is a relative of or an employee of the class action lawyer.  Further clarifications making clear that this provision will not apply to present or former clients of, or those who have had any contractual relationship with, class counsel have already been made to the bill in the manager's amendment. The only prohibition that remains in the bill is the bar on class counsel using a relative or employee as a class representative. Clearly, that shouldn't be permitted.  The class representative is supposed to be representing the class interests, to independently ``be the client'' for the class, and tell counsel what to do. That independence will be gone if the class representative is a relative or employee of the class counsel. This amendment should be defeated.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

443,topic-id,406,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment should be defeated.  Insofar as a class action seeks equitable relief, that is, the nonmonetary relief, including any injunctive relief that seeks to stop the defendant from doing something wrong, the portion of any class action lawyer's fee should be limited to a reasonable percentage of the value of that relief as determined by the court.  This provision won't affect fee awards in civil rights cases because both the monetary and equitable relief attorney's fees provision in this bill are qualified with the initial phrase, ``unless otherwise specified by Federal statute.''  The Civil Rights Attorney's Fee Award Act of 1976 allows a court, in its discretion, to award reasonable attorney's fees as part of the costs to a prevailing party in Federal civil rights lawsuits, including cases brought under 28 U.S.section 1983, the statute most commonly used to assert civil rights claims. Consequently, this bill won't affect attorney's fees in civil rights class actions at all.  Regarding other equitable relief cases that don't involve civil rights claims, Federal courts routinely determine the value of intangible relief such[[Page H1986]]as equitable or injunctive relief for purposes of determining whether the amount in controversy requirement--currently, $75,000 to get into court--is met.  A majority of courts consider only the value of the injunctive relief from the plaintiff's perspective or viewpoint. Some courts determine the jurisdictional amount by evaluating the claim from the perspective of the party seeking Federal court jurisdiction. Others have adopted the ``either viewpoint'' rule, which allows the court to look to either the plaintiff's or the defendant's viewpoint in establishing the amount in controversy in cases seeking some form of injunctive relief.  The bottom line is that, under this bill, Federal courts will be able to use either approach in deciding the value of the injunctive relief provided to class members; and generally speaking, counsel should be paid on the basis of what lawyers actually deliver to their clients.  This base bill, of course, does not alter in any way the relief that would be granted to equitable relief class action members. It only limits the fees attorneys would receive to a reasonable percentage of the value of what the class members actually received. So all this amendment would do would be to put more money in the hands of lawyers and less in the hands of victims.

450,topic-id,575,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, this amendment should be rejected. The discovery process--the pretrial process in a lawsuit in which trial lawyers demand documents and other things from the people they are suing--imposes huge costs on defendants, particularly because of the astronomical costs associated with the discovery of electronic information, such as emails.  Law Technology News has reported that the total cost of electronic discovery rose from $2 billion in 2006 to $2.8 billion in 2009 and estimated that the total cost would rise 10 to 15 percent annually over the next few years. In a more recent case study of Fortune 500 companies, the RAND Institute found that the median total cost for electronic discovery among participants totaled $1.8 million per case.  These costs are asymmetric. While defendants typically are subject to gigantic discovery costs, because they are large organizations possessing large amounts of data, plaintiffs have little information in their possession, and, therefore, are subject to a very small financial burden during the discovery process.  Moreover, discovery conducted before a motion to dismiss is decided is unfair. Why should defendants bear the burden of paying for discovery before a complaint is held legally sufficient, especially when the threat of huge costs may coerce an unjustified settlement?  The reality for most civil litigation is that the defendants' obligation to bear these exorbitant discovery costs incentivizes plaintiffs to serve burdensome discovery requests on defendants with zero downside risk to themselves. As professor Martin Redish has explained: ``The fact that a party's opponents will have to bear the financial burden of preparing the discovery response actually gives litigants an incentive to make discovery requests, and the bigger expense to be borne by the opponent, the bigger incentive to make the request.''  Because defendants seek to avoid these exorbitant costs, discovery is all too often used as a weapon to coerce settlement of claims regardless of their[[Page H1987]]merit. Even the Supreme Court has recognized this problem, lamenting that the threat of discovery expense will push cost-conscious defendants to settle even anemic cases before reaching trial.  For example, assume that a defendant moves to dismiss a class action because it doesn't assert any valid claims. Under current law, the named plaintiff can serve massive discovery requests that force defendants to spend $10 million to collect the requested documents. A rational decision for that defendant is to settle the case for millions, even if 4 months later the court grants the motion to dismiss, finding the class claims to be totally without merit. That is because, without a stay in discovery, the defendants will, in the meantime, have been required to spend all or part of the $10 million costs complying with the discovery requests for, it turns out, no legitimate reason. Trial lawyers pursue discovery in this circumstance primarily in an effort to pressure the defendant to settle invalid claims.  The subsection of the bill entitled ``Stay of discovery'' would stop the use of discovery to coerce unjustified settlements by requiring Federal courts to stay discovery pending resolution of rule 12 motions--that is, motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim--motions to strike class allegations, motions to transfer, and other motions that would dispose of class allegations unless the court finds that particularized discovery is necessary to preserve evidence or to prevent undue prejudice to a party.

455,topic-id,518,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment would subject certain class members to unfair treatment and should be rejected.  The purpose of a class action is to provide a fair means of evaluating like[[Page H1988]]claims, not to provide a means of artificially inflating the size of a class to extort a larger settlement value. Exempting a subset of cases from the bill, as this amendment would do, would serve only to incentivize the creation of artificially large classes to extort larger and unfair settlements from innocent parties for the purpose of disproportionately awarding uninjured parties.  Why should only the claimants covered by the amendment be subject to particularly unfair treatment by being allowed to be forced into a class action with other uninjured or minimally injured members, only to see their own compensation reduced? This does a disservice to those claimants. Yet, that is exactly what this amendment would do.  Regardless of the subject matter, class action plaintiffs are increasingly inclined to include fraud claims in their complaints. If they are suing about an allegedly defective product, they will add fraud claims, alleging that the manufacturer committed fraud by not disclosing the defect. If they are suing for a breach of contract, they will add fraud allegations, saying that the defendant didn't disclose the alleged breach, and so on and so forth.  Thus, this amendment would effectively gut the entire bill, since, to avoid its important reforms, class action lawyers would simply add fraud claims to their complaints, as they are increasingly prone to do in any event.  Regarding the Volkswagen case, some opponents have urged that, if enacted, the base bill would have prevented the filing of the class actions related to the Volkswagen diesel emission controversy. Those assertions are false.  This bill's injury provision would be readily satisfied in the VW cases, as class members presumably would argue that they have been injured by their purchase of vehicles with noncompliant emission systems.  Further, if the scope or type of injury differed among class members, separate class actions could be filed for each group, as actually occurred with respect to differing models in the Volkswagen MDL proceeding.  The bill's requirement about class representative disclosures would be easily satisfied. Many class members are interested in the litigation and presumably ready to serve as conflict-free class representatives who would not run afoul of these provisions.  The bill's ascertainability provisions would pose no obstacles because vehicle registration records would provide reliable class member lists and counsel could easily demonstrate a method to get any relief to class members.  Requiring that payment of counsel fees await distribution of class benefits and that fees reflect a reasonable percentage of benefits actually received by class members would not impede bringing such cases.  The cases would be litigated without resort to issues classes. Disclosure of any third-party litigation funding of the class actions wouldn't preclude such cases. The provision doesn't prohibit such funding. Only disclosure is required. Staying discovery while motions to dismiss are pending also poses no roadblock.

460,topic-id,586,"Mr.Chairman, with great deference and respect to my friend and colleague, the ranking member, this amendment would subject certain class members to unfair treatment and, thus, should be rejected.  First, the bill's provisions on type and scope of injury only apply to proposed classes ``seeking monetary relief for personal injury or economic loss.'' Insofar as civil rights cases do not seek money damages, they are completely unaffected by the bill and would proceed just as they do today.  However, if money damages are sought by a proposed class, then, of course, they should be subject to the procedures in the bill. The purpose of a class action is to provide a fair means of evaluating like claims, not to provide a means of artificially inflating the size of a class to extort a larger settlement value.  Exempting a subset of money damage cases from the bill, as this amendment would do, would serve only to incentivize the creation of artificially large classes to extort larger and unfair settlements from innocent parties for the purpose of disproportionately awarding uninjured parties.  Any claims seeking monetary relief for personal injury or economic loss should be grouped in classes in which those who are the most injured receive the most compensation. Why should civil rights claimants seeking money damages be subject to particularly unfair treatment by being allowed to be forced into a class action with other uninjured or minimally injured members, only to see their own compensation reduced? That does a disservice to those claimants. Yes, that is exactly what this amendment would do.  Further, the bill's provision on attorneys' fees won't affect fee awards in civil rights cases at all because both the monetary and equitable relief attorneys' fees provision in the bill are qualified with the initial phrase ``unless otherwise specified by Federal statute.''  The Civil Rights Attorney's Fee Award Act of 1976 allows a court, in its discretion, to award reasonable attorneys' fees as part of the costs to a prevailing party in Federal civil rights lawsuits, including cases brought under 28 U.S.section 1983, the statute most commonly used to assert civil rights claims.  Consequently, this bill will not affect attorneys' fees in civil rights class actions at all, including, of course, cases brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which has its own attorneys' fees provision.  The conflicts of interest provision reflects a valid concern in all class actions. The courts need to know how the named plaintiffs came to be involved in class actions in all types of cases to ensure there aren't conflicts and that the due process rights of all class members are protected.  The issues class provision won't disrupt the manner in which civil rights cases are normally litigated. Discovery stays while dispositive motions are pending won't disrupt civil rights cases. Like any other case, the plaintiffs need to show they have a facially valid complaint before discovery should commence.  Disclosure of third-party funding is no less important in civil rights cases than in other class actions. The appeals provision benefits both plaintiffs and defendants, giving either side the right to appeal if class certification is granted or denied.  I urge all my colleagues to oppose this amendment, which would set back the just causes of civil rights claimants.

Why would anyone want to single out safe drinking water victims for adverse treatment and deny them the benefits of the base bill that would maximize any recovery they might receive in a class action?  This motion to recommit would do that, and it should be defeated.  In closing, let me say that we know that only the tiniest fraction of consumer class action members ever bother to claim the compensation awarded them in a settlement. That is clear proof that the vast majority--the vast large numbers of class members are satisfied with the product they purchased. They don't want compensation. They don't want to be lumped into gigantic class action lawsuits.

755,topic-id,777,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.720, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, would restore mandatory sanctions for frivolous lawsuits filed in Federal court.  Many Americans may not realize it, but today, under what is called rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, there is no requirement that those who file frivolous lawsuits pay for the unjustified legal costs they impose on their victims, even when those victims prove to a judge the lawsuit was without any basis in law or fact.  As a result, the current rule 11 goes largely unenforced because the victims of frivolous lawsuits have little incentive to pursue additional litigation to have the case declared frivolous when there is no guarantee of compensation at the end of the day.  H.720 would finally provide light at the end of the tunnel for the victims of frivolous lawsuits by requiring sanctions against the filers of frivolous lawsuits, sanctions which include paying back victims for the full cost of their reasonable expenses incurred as a direct result of the rule 11 violation, including attorneys' fees.  The bill also strikes the current provisions in rule 11 that allow lawyers to avoid sanctions for making frivolous claims and demands by simply withdrawing them within 21 days. This change eliminates the ``free pass'' lawyers now have to file frivolous lawsuits in Federal court.  The current lack of mandatory sanctions leads to the regular filing of lawsuits that are baseless. So many frivolous pleadings currently go under the radar because the lack of mandatory sanctions for frivolous filings forces victims of frivolous lawsuits to roll over and settle the case, because doing that is less expensive than litigating the case to a victory in court.  Correspondence written by someone filing a frivolous lawsuit, which became public, concisely illustrates how the current lack of mandatory sanctions for filing frivolous lawsuits leads to legal extortion. That correspondence to the victim of a frivolous lawsuit states: ``I really don't care what the law allows you to do. It's a more practical issue. Do you want to send your attorney a check every month indefinitely as I continue to pursue this?''  Under the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, those who file frivolous lawsuits would no longer be able to get off scot-free and, therefore, they couldn't get away with those sorts of extortionary threats any longer.  The victims of lawsuit abuse are not just those who are actually sued. Rather, we all suffer under a system in which innocent Americans everywhere live under the constant fear of a potentially bankrupting frivolous lawsuit.  As the former chairman of The Home Depot company has written: ``An unpredictable legal system casts a shadow over every plan and investment. It is devastating for startups. The cost of even one ill-timed abusive lawsuit can bankrupt a growing company and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs.''  The prevalence of frivolous lawsuits in America is reflected in the absurd warning labels companies must place on their products to limit their exposure to frivolous claims. A 5-inch brass fishing lure with three hooks is labeled ``Harmful if swallowed.'' A household iron contains the warning ``Never iron clothes while they are being worn.'' A piece of ovenware warns, ``Ovenware will get hot when used in oven.''  And here are just a couple of examples of frivolous lawsuits brought in Federal court, where judges failed to award compensation to the victims:[[Page H2026]]  A man sued a television network for $2.5 million because he said a show it aired raised his blood pressure. When the network publicized his frivolous lawsuit, he demanded the court make them stop. Although the court found the case frivolous, not only did it not compensate the victim, it granted the man who filed the frivolous lawsuit an exemption from even paying the ordinary court filing fees.  In another case, lawyers filed a case against a parent, claiming the parent's discipline of their child violated the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment by the government, not private citizens. One of the lawyers even admitted signing the complaint without reading it.  The court found the case frivolous, but awarded the victim only about a quarter of its legal costs because rule 11 currently doesn't require that a victim's legal costs be paid in full. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act would change that.  I thank the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Lamar Smith, for introducing this simple, commonsense legislation that would do so much to prevent lawsuit abuse and restore Americans' confidence in the legal system.

622,topic-id,839,"Mr.President, the other body spent yesterday and well into the night to vote out bills that would repeal and reform I do not know exactly what is going to[[Page S1712]]happen in the other body on that issue, but I would like to add some thoughts on the issue of repeal and replace.  ObamaCare has been a case of overpromise and underdelivery. People were told that their premiums would go down by $2,500. They have actually gone up by an average of $3,500. They were also promised that if they liked their doctors, they would be able to keep their doctors. Millions of people have had to change doctors. Then they were told that they could keep their healthcare plans, and millions of people have had to change their healthcare plans. In fact, ObamaCare has been a case of overpromise and underdelivery. The reality is much different.  ObamaCare is hurting more people than it is helping. I have heard from many Iowans about the tremendous premium increases and, most importantly, all about high deductibles and high copays that make ObamaCare not worth its consideration.  One farmer said his health insurance premium went from $20,000 to $30,000 in one year. Another family said their ObamaCare premium increased 144 percent over 3 years. The 2017 premium for three people was over $24,000, and families who did manage to purchase ObamaCare insurance found that they could no longer afford to use it because of sky-high deductibles and copays. Another Iowan said that his policy for his family of three increased from $15,000 a year to $23,000 in 1 year, with, more importantly, the policy's value being less because the deductible for that plan is nearly $6,000.  It is quite obvious, as you think of these situations, that very few people can afford some of the prices or afford the deductibles that we hear about. So I think it is a very clear summation to say that ObamaCare is not working.  According to Avalere, one-third of the country will have only one insurance carrier that offers ObamaCare plans next year. Since that analysis by Avalere, another insurance company has pulled out of ObamaCare and has left some parts of the country without any insurance companies whatsoever for the folks to choose from. So many insurance companies have dropped out of ObamaCare that there are places in the country where people have a subsidy, but no insurance plans to buy. That is like having a bus ticket and there is no bus to take you anywhere.  Even those who were strong supporters of the healthcare law, like, as an example, the Democratic Governor of Minnesota, have said--or he said--the ACA ``is no longer affordable to many Americans.''  The problem with ObamaCare is it did nothing to address the underlying causes of the high cost of healthcare; that is, what it costs for a hospital or doctor to purchase and maintain medical equipment, to purchase medicines, to carry malpractice insurance, and things like that. Rather than address the actual cost of care, President Obama chose to bypass real healthcare reform for an unsustainable entitlement and, of course, bureaucratic mandates, which have priced people out of the healthcare insurance market, rather than provide them with affordable and quality coverage.  It is time, then, as the House was working throughout the night, to deliver more accessible, more affordable healthcare to even more ObamaCare has failed on both of these points, with, I believe, 29 million people still not having health insurance.  It is time to reduce the role of the Federal Government in the healthcare system because I think that expanded role is one of the very basic problems we have with It is time to spend less and get better quality care.  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to work across the aisle in a bipartisan way. They know the Affordable Care Act is not serving the purposes that it was intended to serve and is falling apart and, in a short period of time, it may collapse. I think the other side is trying to distract attention from the Affordable Care Act collapse, and they are doing it by using the usual scare tactics. It used to be those scare tactics were applied just to Medicare improvements, but now they are applied across the board of healthcare delivery in  It is time for the other party to step up instead of doubling down because it was their plan passed in March of 2010 that put us in this spiral we are in. It is time for statesmanship, not gamesmanship. It is time for the people who are responsible for ObamaCare to stop defending the un-Affordable Care Act and deliver Americans what was promised.  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues and, of course, our new President to deliver affordable healthcare to more  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Alexander control 10 minutes of the remaining debate time on H.57.

897,topic-id,1866,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to be printed in the Record the concerns of the Summit Agricultural Group regarding three mergers in the agriculture industry. Specifically, this group is concerned with the mergers between Bayer AG and Monsanto, DuPont and Dow Chemical, and China National Chemical Corporation--ChemChina--and Syngenta The paper states that ``the mergers of these international agrochemical and seed giants will significantly reduce competition and innovation in the agricultural sector, and will cause irreparable harm to the American farmer via increased input costs.''  As my colleagues are aware, I have long been concerned about concentration and competition in the agriculture sector. Increased concentration in the industry could significantly reduce choice and raise the price of chemicals and seed for farmers, which ultimately can affect choice and costs for consumers. Moreover, further consolidation could diminish crucial research[[Page S1776]]and development initiatives which drive have innovation and technological advances for the agricultural sector. I have also raised concerns about the competitive advantages that are likely to result from the ChemChina-Syngenta transaction.  I have written several letters to both the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission expressing my concerns and asking that they carefully review these mergers and collaborate, as appropriate, on their analysis of the impact on the agricultural industry. These regulators need to take a hard look at both the efficiencies and the benefits that the merging companies believe will result from these transactions, as well as the concerns raised by independent and small players in the market, farmers, and consumers.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 Executive Summary: Agriculture Mergers       Background: Bayer AG and Monsanto, DuPont and Dow Chemical,      and China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina) and      Syngenta AG have all announced their intentions to merge. The      mergers of these international agrochemical and seed giants      will significantly reduce competition and innovation in the      agricultural sector, and will cause irreparable harm to the      American farmer via increased input costs.       Market Structure: Many view market share in terms of retail      sales; however, the underlying structure should be examined      to determine competitive dynamics. Almost all commercial seed      sold for planting a crop is composed of germplasm      ``genetics'' and transgenic traits, which are genes inserted      to alter the seed, for example Monsanto's Roundup      gene made plants tolerant to Roundup herbicide.      When an independent seed company, say Becks Hybrids, wants to      sell seed they need to acquire a license to both the      germplasm and transgenic trait, and pay the licensor both      germplasm and trait fees on each bag of seed they sell.      Without access to high yielding and performing germplasm, the      addition of the transgenic traits is almost irrelevant.      Plainly stated: If you have a gene that makes a horse that      runs faster, but no horses, it's a problem.       Competitive Issues: Given this, concentration of germplasm      into few companies would give them the ability to bundle      their germplasm, transgenic traits, and chemicals together,      creating significant pricing power. Further, because      germplasm is the building block of the seed it would      significantly reduce incentives for independent innovation--     if a new trait is discovered, what options would a third      party have to combine with competitive germplasm and get to      market? Lastly, independent seed companies would be      irreparably harmed given the need to acquire germplasm from      potentially two companies that control 90% + of all genetics      in the market.       Practical Historical Examples: When the Roundup      chemical came off-patent, Monsanto was able to increase the      Roundup Ready seed trait licensing fee by multiples      to offset the revenue decline. More recently, when Monsanto's      Roundup Ready seed trait was about to come off-     patent they gave it to the market. However, other germplasm      breeding companies had already committed breeding programs to      the new patented Roundup Ready 2 Yield technology.      Given the 5-6 years required to breed a new trait into      germplasm, when farmers had the ability to buy the now      generic Roundup Ready trait, there was and is no      competitive germplasm to put it in. Plainly put, more      consolidation will only serve to increase the prevalence of      anti-competitive actions caused by consolidated ownership of      germplasm, transgenic traits, and chemicals.                Detailed Discussion: Agriculture Mergers       Background: Bayer AG and Monsanto, DuPont and Dow Chemical,      and China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina) and      Syngenta AG have all announced their intentions to merge in      2017. The mergers of these international agrochemical and      seed giants will significantly reduce competition and      innovation in the agricultural sector, and will do      irreparable harm to the American farmer.       Market Share Dominance: Corn is the single most important      grain crop in the U.S., grown on 94 million acres with a      finished crop worth $50 billion. The U.grows 40% of the      world's corn supply, exported 13% of the crop in 2016, and      corn is an important component of the positive U.trade      balance of $35 billion stemming from agriculture. As the      graph at right shows, if these mergers are allowed to      proceed, two companies: Dow-DuPont and Bayer-Monsanto would      effectively control the U.corn market at the most basic      level--the germplasm. Breeding with germplasm for higher      yields and agronomic performance is still the number one      factor for success on the farm.       While industry data shows Monsanto has 36% of the seed corn      market, it uses a licensing model whereby the independent      seed companies (the other 17% in the table below) effectively      distribute Monsanto hybrid seed corn and traits through their      own brands, paying Monsanto two different royalties: one for      germplasm (genetics) and one for the transgenic traits.      Further, Monsanto licenses out different, and many would      argue inferior, germplasm to the independent seed companies      than the germplasm it uses in its own brands. The smaller      independent seed companies receive inferior germplasm to the      larger independent seed companies, and may pay a higher      royalty per unit to do so. DuPont primarily sells its hybrid      seed corn through its own sales channels.       Soybeans are the most important oilseed crop in the U.S.,      planted on 84 million acres, and representing a finished crop      of $35 billion at the farm level in 2016. As with corn,      Monsanto uses a licensing model to distribute soybean      genetics and traits through independent companies. Monsanto      has 90% market share in soybean transgenic traits through      their own brands, independent licensees, and through      licensing to DuPont and       Syngenta and DuPont have paid-up licenses for the Monsanto      soybean transgenic traits, which means the Syngenta and      DuPont germplasm and breeding programs are all on the      Monsanto transgenic trait platform. With the paid-up license      to the Monsanto soybean transgenic traits, Syngenta and      DuPont have a margin opportunity on the transgenic trait      royalty to take market share from the independent seed      companies.       To illustrate the power of the germplasm performance,      Monsanto agreed to give its first-generation transgenic trait      Roundup Ready to the market, as it was coming off      patent. The problem is the other companies with germplasm      breeding programs had already committed their breeding      efforts to the new patented Roundup Ready 2 Yield      technology. Since it takes 5-6 years to breed a new trait      into high performing germplasm, by the time farmers had the      ability to buy the now generic Roundup Ready      transgenic trait, there was and is no competitive germplasm      available to put it in.       Barriers to Entry: Given the costs and timelines for the      development of transgenic traits and plant breeding, new      competition and innovation will be limited. Transgenic traits      have to be integrated into the germplasm without impacting      the crop in other negative ways. As noted in corn, the      germplasm is controlled primarily by two companies: Bayer-     Monsanto and DuPont-Dow, with ChemChina-Syngenta having a      small share. In soybeans, Bayer-Monsanto would control over      90% of the soybean transgenic traits that are contained in      the Monsanto, DuPont, and Syngenta soybean germplasm.       As agriculture is a global market, new transgenic traits      have to be approved in all export countries in order for a      U.farmer to be comfortable knowing there will be a market      for his crop. The current international transgenic regulatory      approval process can take over 8 years and can cost in excess      of $150 million per trait. This international regulatory      burden means that only the largest companies have the means      and capabilities to get a new transgenic trait approved for      use by U.farmers. This limits the ability for any company      with new transgenic traits ever getting them to the market.      Aside from the enormous expense, the control of the high      performing germplasm and required transgenic trait platforms,      almost certainly eliminates the entry of new innovation and      trait technologies by any company other than those      contemplating the mergers. In the past ten years China has      used its regulatory approval process as a trade tool, which      makes the acquisition of Syngenta by ChemChina (a state-owned      enterprise) even that much more unsettling.       Ability to Bundle: Aside from fertilizer, a farmer has to      buy seeds (inclusive of transgenic traits), seed treatments,      and crop protection chemicals (herbicides, fungicides, and      insecticides) each year. Given the vertical integration and      dominant market position of these companies, major bundling      opportunities exist. These companies will have the      opportunity to require farmers to buy seed, seed treatments,      and crop protection chemicals even though superior chemistry      or generic alternatives may exist. Often these bundles of      seeds, traits, seed treatments, and crop protection chemicals      are part of the patent protection these companies have in      place, or in connection with sales promotions and programs.      It is impossible for an independent seed company to compete      with this type of vertical bundling opportunities. Monsanto      has already been accused of bundling its Roundup      herbicide with the access to its seed and traits, even though      a generic version of glyphosate herbicide is readily      available to farmers at a fraction of the price.       International Implications: As the graph on the right      indicates, these companies have significant market share in      crop protection chemicals on a global basis. The same holds      true for their seeds and transgenic traits in the countries      which have approved their cultivation including Argentina,      Brazil, and The impacts on the farmers in these      countries will no doubt be the same as in the U.      Near-Term and Long-Term Negative Impact: If these mergers      are allowed to proceed there will be negative impacts      through-out agribusiness. Research for new transgenic traits      and other biotech innovations will be stifled as the ability      to take such traits to the market in competitive genetics      will be controlled by two companies. The ability to stack any      new traits and/or technology will be controlled by the patent      protections the merging companies hold on their germplasm and      related trait technologies.       In the near-term, the existing independent seed companies      who rely on licensing from[[Page S1777]]     Monsanto for their corn and soybean germplasm and traits to      be sold in their brands will be squeezed given that the new      merged companies will need to increase market share and      profits for their shareholders to justify the mergers.      Independent seed companies cannot compete with the bundling      opportunities and margins that the merged companies will      enjoy with their combined product offerings.       In the longer term, the American farmer will lose as the      remaining oligopoly uses their market power, bundling of      products, and limited competition to increase the costs for      every acre planted. This in turn will increase the costs for      consumers in all markets touched by production agriculture.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-13-pt1-PgS1775-2.txt,457,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,13.0,March

301,topic-id,862,"Mr.Speaker, there is no doubt in my mind that the resistance to this President and his policies is growing in America's heartland. If the 1,200 people who came to my townhall meeting in Chicago on Monday night are any indication, there is a movement in the United States that is standing up to the fear, the racism, the lies, and the divisiveness that comes from the President, his people, and his Twitter account every single day.  The Logandale School auditorium and gym was packed. No, not like The National Mall on Inauguration Day with wide-open spaces and the President's imaginary crowd of 1.5 million people. No, my townhall was actually packed like The Mall on the day after the inauguration for the Women's It was a diverse crowd of people who care about America and defending their country. It was overwhelming.  We had Ahmed Rehab, the inspirational leader of CAIR-Chicago, talking about what was going on in Chicago to resist the President's new and unimproved ban on refugees and He was joined by Equality Illinois, Planned Parenthood, and the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization, talking about how the people of Chicago are coming together to resist the President's attacks on women's health, on LGBTQ rights, on public schools and education, on women's rights, and on the environment.  It was the intersection of all of the communities and the issues that are under attack by President Trump and his co-President This townhall was the mother of all intersectionality events--right there in Chicago, in America's heartland.  No, they were not paid activists. They were ordinary people trying to get answers and defend their community against an unprecedented threat coming from the White House and Republicans in  For more than an hour, I answered questions, and then I stayed in the parking lot for another hour and talked with people who still had questions--and some were heartbreaking.  A public school teacher I have known for years asked me how she can help her students. Her kids are being kept out of school or are losing sleep or are displaying signs of depression because of the fear that they have that they will be separated from their parents if they are deported. She wants to comfort them, but the reality is she cannot.  Individuals asked me how they can protect families who are terrified that they will get separated and destroyed.  Just this week, a mother I have known for years who has a stay of deportation and has been regularly reporting to ICE officials for years told me she is being deported in 6 weeks. She has a U.citizen husband and four U.citizen children, and she has complied with the law and she has complied and reported to authorities, only to be told that, under Trump, the rules have changed and she is now a top priority for deportation--not because she should be deported, but because she can be deported.  This fear is having an impact on families and children. But what came through to me at the townhall meeting is that families, vulnerable immigrants, and millions of children with a birthright to live as Americans are not alone. There are thousands and thousands of allies who are joining together to defend families in Chicago and everywhere else.  At the townhall on Monday, I appealed for help because this is the very same room that this coming Saturday, Mr.Speaker, my office will be holding a citizenship workshop. I asked those who are already citizens to come and help those who are applying for citizenship, and hundreds of hands went up in the air saying they are ready to help.  We scheduled the citizenship workshop because we are unable to satisfy my constituents' huge demand for citizenship information. Some days we have lines out the door at my office on Fullerton Avenue with people wanting to know: How can I become a citizen of the United States of America?

Mr.Speaker, I rise today to debate a rule for a piece of legislation that will, in the final analysis, make it more difficult for hardworking Americans to stand up to corporate malfeasance; a piece of legislation that jettisons a history of legal precedent in the blink of an eye because, well, it helps keep the deep pockets of the ultrawealthy as deep as possible.  I learned this law in law school in 1959, but it was in existence way before that time, and now my friends across the aisle are going to tell us that this legislation is needed because it will protect small businesses. This is a feint, folks. Small businesses--indeed all of us--have been and continue to be protected by the century-old jurisprudential rule that the Republicans come here today to upend. In reality, all this bill will do is make it more difficult for regular folks across this country to bring lawsuits against massive corporations.  I shudder to think what would have happened in the critically important asbestos case had this particular law been in effect; and there are many more.  This bill will make it more expensive both in time and treasure for our fellow Americans to hold corporations responsible in the courtroom, a need all the more prevalent today as my friends across the aisle have been busy gutting regulations at a dizzying pace.  Let me make it clear, after we finish, my colleague from Colorado and I are going to go back to the Rules Committee to discuss some more judicial reform. A lot of it is stuff that is going to harm little people in the courts and to cause them not to have access to the court system, as have many of the regulations that we have already disapproved.  Let us be clear, the American people didn't vote for dirty water, but that is what they got with this Republican majority when it voted to repeal a rule that barred corporations from dumping mining debris into our drinking water, helping powerful mining companies by hurting all of the rest of the people in their near curtilage.  The American people didn't vote to weaken the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that is what this majority did when it passed a bill adding more hurdles to the SEC rulemaking process, making it more difficult for the agency to protect consumers, helping Wall Street while putting our economy at risk. I will make a prediction[[Page H1613]]here. It may not happen right away, but just like we saw the Great Depression that we are just coming out of, we are likely to see that same kind of situation again by virtue of lessening the rules against violations in securities.  The American people didn't vote to drug test Americans on unemployment insurance--degrading the hardworking men and women in this country--but that is what this Republican majority did without delay.  Mr.Speaker, the list really does go on and on. In fact, just yesterday, Republicans continued to chant the corporate clarion call with the unveiling of what I now will call their shameful replacement of the Affordable Care Until there is a resolution, I am going to call it  My colleagues like to tout how short the bill is compared to the Affordable Care Well, the American people will be surprised to find that, in that brevity, Republicans managed to repeal an Affordable Care Act provision that placed a limit on insurance executives' compensation. Let me repeat that. They managed to repeal a provision that placed a limit on insurance executives' compensation. The insurance executives shouldn't be too surprised by this, however. Repeatedly, Republicans have shown they represent corporate interests over the interests of the American people.  But my Republican colleagues didn't stop there. Their so-called replacement, the Trump bill, also claims to have done away with the individual mandate. What they don't tell you is that, instead, their plan calls for funneling money to the insurance companies in the form of a 30 percent surcharge if an individual goes without health insurance.  Let me tell all the older Americans and 80-year-old people like me to get ready because they are going to be able to charge you just exactly what they want to charge you, and all--mine and yours--insurance is going to go up if this particular measure were to become law.  That is right. Under the Republican healthcare proposal, if you, the American worker, goes without healthcare coverage for longer than 2 months--say you couldn't after a new plan between jobs--then Republicans give insurance companies the right to charge you 30 percent higher premiums. That is ridiculous.  Republicans didn't get rid of the individual mandate. They just turned the mandate into a windfall for insurance companies--a windfall that is going to work out great for insurance executives now that Republicans also removed the cap on their compensation tax deductions.  Mr.Speaker, let us not lose sight of the fact that it took Republicans 7 years of undermining the Affordable Care Act to finally come up with this proposal for replacing it.                              {time}  1345  Their plan would kick millions of Americans off their health insurance and force millions more to pay higher premiums. It would take health care away from the poor, give tax cuts to the rich, and pull the rug out from under seniors, families, and children.  In fact, this plan is so bad that Republicans literally hid not only their horrific proposal, but themselves, from their constituents. Many of their Members are seeing it just in the last 36 hours. They did this by callously brushing off townhall meeting after townhall meeting.  Why all the smoke and mirrors regarding something as simple as this measure is in light of the fact that they ran on replacing it? Why hide it and why rush it and why go through this charade that most of us know and several Senators said yesterday will be dead on arrival?  Actually, let me ask the American people. Who do you think the Republican Party is representing, you or corporate America?  Mr.Speaker, we are not even a full 2 months into the Republican-led government and, in addition to the unconstitutional Muslim bans--and notice I said ``bans,'' because the old one is nothing but the new one, and the new one is the old one, minus one, and that is the country of Iraq--we have the Republican denial of clear Russian influence in our most recent election.  Let me be very clear about this particular aspect. All of the intelligence agencies have indicated that there was Russian interference in this last election. I don't understand why we are not totally outraged and why there is not extraordinary emphasis on this kind of action against our fundamental democracy.  It is ridiculous that we are around here doing things that we know are not likely to pass the United States Senate and that we are disapproving regulations, yet we cannot get an independent commission to make a determination of how this impact occurred. And we do know that it occurred. I am outraged, and I would hope more Americans would be as well.  We have also seen the almost immediate recusal of the Attorney General due to his inability to be forthright with our Senate colleagues; wild and baseless claims emanating from late-night Twitter storms from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue or Mar-a-Lago; and we have a Republican Party dedicated to ensuring that their corporate benefactors can rest easy, no matter the harm they cause to everyday working  Are we addressing any of these concerns here today?  I would imagine my colleague, rightly, will come back and argue that all the things that I just talked about are not this particular rule. Well, this rule is not even deserving of that kind of consideration, largely for the reason it is yet another structured rule disallowing Members of this House to have an opportunity to have input into a measure that is getting rid of a century of precedent in our judiciary. No, what we are doing is debating obscure civil procedure rules that date back to the days of President Teddy  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

78,topic-id,339,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I have great respect for the chairman of the Rules Committee and he knows that.  I just heard him say his insurance went up under Mine did, too. I also want to remind him that, if this measure as offered yesterday were to become law, his and my insurance is going to go up again.  So we weren't doing all of the things that you said you were going to do by bringing the price down. In addition, we don't even know what CBO's score is with respect to this matter.  You said that you are reading it to understand it now, yet Members are in the Energy and Commerce Committee, as you explained, marking it up, and they don't even know what CBO's score is. I will get back to that in a few minutes about all these people we pay over there to do that work, and then we are not utilizing them.  I also want to address my friend from Colorado and have him understand that I am not precluded from presenting to the American public what legislation we wish to prioritize.  As the gentleman knows, we are currently debating the rule. This is a tool used to set the House agenda and to prioritize consideration of legislation. For that very reason, this is, in fact, the appropriate time for us to explain to the American people what legislation we would like to prioritize and what agenda we would like to pursue in this I won't reiterate it, in the interest of time.  I will have a previous question that will demonstrably show what legislation we think we should be addressing. I will do that for as long as I am given the opportunity to manage rules. I will come down here and present the position of the Democratic Party so that they understand our priorities and not necessarily am I hidebound by this rule.

85,topic-id,274,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close.  Mr.Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule which would modify the rules of the House to require a cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office before any legislation that would amend or repeal the Affordable Care Act may be considered in committee or on the House floor.  The Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Energy and Commerce are marking up repeal legislation today. Legislation this significant should not advance through the committee process, let alone the House, without first hearing from our nonpartisan budget experts at the Congressional Budget Office on what the cost and overall impact will be.  Mr.Speaker, we have over 200 employees at the Congressional Budget We pay them collectively--and administrative duties--nearly $50 million a year to advise us at times exactly like this.  House rules already require the Congressional Budget Office cost estimates to be included in committee reports. We are simply trying to improve and strengthen this principle of transparency in order to ensure that we know the cost of this repeal legislation before we vote, and that includes the members in the Committee on Energy and Commerce today who are marking this up so as how they would know the cost before they vote in committee today.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

We are a nation built upon the strength of immigrants, of teachers, of doctors, of mill workers, garbagemen and -women, small-business owners, and farmers.

675,topic-id,4282,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak once again on the so-called Affordable Care Act and the ongoing effort to repeal and replace. We all know the House of Representatives has produced a repeal and replace package, and both the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees have been marking it up. We don't know what it is right now. In other words, the endeavor to right the wrongs of ObamaCare is moving steadily forward on the other side of the Capitol, and soon it will be the Senate's turn to act. I commend my colleagues for introducing this legislation and moving it forward. This is an important step, and I don't think I am alone when I say that I am watching the progress in the House very carefully to see how things proceed and what the final House product will look like.  Of course, virtually all Republicans in Congress want to repeal and replace We are in unison there. While there are some differences of opinion on how best to do that, there is generally unanimity on that point. I am confident that whatever differences exist among House Members will be worked out through the House's legislative process.  In addition, whatever passes in the House will be subject to the input and review of the Senate and to the rules of the budget reconciliation process. I want to note that I have heard from a number of Senators who have items they would like to see included when the bill comes before the I actually have several ideas of my own. However, there are limits as to what we can do under the budget reconciliation rule. Many of the proposed policy changes I have heard, although they have merit, would be banned by the rules and subject to the 60-vote threshold. That said, I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the floor to ensure that the[[Page S1731]]Senate process on this bill is productive and that it yields a result we can support.  Long story short: This process is far from over. We have a lot more work to do. It is worth pointing out that the vast majority of the policies at play in this discussion and virtually all of the spending fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee, which I chair. Make no mistake. The Finance Committee is already hard at work and has been for some time. In many respects, I suppose you could say we have been working on this effort since the day ObamaCare was signed into law. However, for obvious reasons, our work has intensified over the past several months.  In working through this process, I have been in constant contact with Chairmen Brady and Walden, who head up the relevant committees in the I have also been working closely with the Speaker's office, and I have been gathering input from Governors around the country. In addition, I have been working closely with the distinguished chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Enzi, who has the chief responsibility of navigating the budget process and shepherding a final repeal-and-replace bill through all the necessary rules and restrictions.  In all of those conversations, we have been talking about the process, and we have been talking about the timing. Most importantly, we have been talking about the substance of the healthcare reforms and how we can best serve the interests of the American people.  Throughout this effort, we have been reminded that Republicans currently control the White House and both Chambers in Congress due, in large part, to our stated commitment to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and we intend to deliver on that promise.  I would like to take a few minutes to talk about some of the policies we will need to tackle as we take up the House healthcare bill in the coming weeks.  Once again, the vast majority of the policies and virtually all of the spending involved in this effort fall under the Finance Committee's exclusive jurisdiction, and I intend to make sure all of my colleagues are well informed on the issues and that in the end whatever version of the bill we pass in the Senate reflects the collective will of a majority of  All told, there are five major policy areas that are addressed in the House bill that fall under the Finance Committee's purview.  First, there are the provisions to repeal the ObamaCare taxes. This is big. If one recalls, I came to the floor a few weeks ago and pointed out how misguided it would be, in my view, to start picking and sorting through the ObamaCare taxes to decide which to keep and which to leave in place. The House bill repeals them, along with the individual and employer mandates, both of which reside in the Tax I have been working with Chairman Brady on this issue. In the end, I believe the Senate version of the bill should do the same, and I am going to continue to push to ensure it does.  Second, there is the issue of premium tax credits. Chairman Brady and I have been working extensively on this issue as well. The House bill replaces the ObamaCare premium subsidies with a refundable tax credit for the purpose of State-approved health insurance, limited to those who do not qualify for other governmental healthcare programs and who have not been offered insurance benefits from their employers. Most major ObamaCare replacement proposals that we have seen contain some version of health insurance tax credits. The House approach represents a significant improvement over the ObamaCare premium subsidies. The Senate, when it takes up the bill, will have to consider how best to implement the tax credits. I will continue to work with my House and Senate colleagues to ensure that the tax credits are designed to help those lower and middle-income Americans who are the most in need.  Third, there are the issues surrounding Chairman Walden and his predecessor, Chairman Upton, and I have been working extensively on this matter. As we know, the vast majority of the newly insured people who the proponents of ObamaCare have cited as proof that the system is working have been covered by the expanded Medicaid  The problem, of course, is that the Affordable Care Act did not do anything to improve Medicaid, which was already absurdly expensive for States, and ultimately unsustainable, not to mention the fact that it provides substandard healthcare coverage.  The House bill draws down the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion and makes a number of significant changes to the underlying program. Most notably, it establishes per capita caps on Federal Medicaid spending, which are intended to give States more flexibility and predictability while also controlling Federal outlays related to the program.  We have received substantial input on this matter from Governors around the country, and virtually all of them agree changes need to be made. Given these concerns and the sheer vastness of the Medicaid Program under ObamaCare, the Senate will have to tackle this issue when it takes up the budget reconciliation legislation in the next few weeks.  I am confident that in working with my colleagues in the House and Senate and with the Governors, we can find the right solution.  Fourth, there is the issue of savings accounts for healthcare costs. I have long been an advocate for the expanded use of HSAs and Needless to say, I was particularly opposed to the ObamaCare provisions that limited the use of these savings accounts and essentially marginalized their usefulness for consumers and patients.  The House bill removes a number of restrictions on these accounts that have been imposed by ObamaCare, and it goes further to remove longstanding restrictions on HSAs in order to expand their use and give patients and consumers more options to pay for health expenses.  I am very supportive of this approach. In fact, the language from the House bill mirrors the legislation I introduced this year--the Health Savings Act of 2017.  Fifth, there are some important transition issues that need to be addressed.  To get at these issues, the House bill creates a Patient and State Stability Program, under the Social Security Act, that would distribute $100 billion to States over 10 years to enhance flexibility for States in how they manage healthcare for their high-risk and low-income populations.  For example, the funds could be used to, among other things, help individuals with cost-sharing. This program was proposed with the idea of giving States an expanded role in the healthcare system, a goal that is shared by most Republicans in Congress and something that almost all of the Governors have told us they want to see.  There are other issues from the House bill in the broader healthcare debate that will demand some attention when we consider the bill in the However, almost all of them fall under these general categories. Once again, the vast majority of them fall under the sole jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee, the primary committee.  There are other critical issues out there which do not involve the Tax Code, the Social Security Act, or Federal health programs. Yet they are extremely important.  The biggest mistake made by those who drafted ObamaCare and forced it through Congress was their failure to address healthcare costs in any meaningful way. After all, cost is the largest barrier preventing people from obtaining health insurance coverage, and the increasing healthcare costs are among the most prominent factors leading to wage stagnation for U.workers. Yet ObamaCare did little to address this problem, and in fact it has made things worse.  If we are going to fully keep our promises to the American people with regard to ObamaCare, we are going to have to eventually address these issues. After all, most people's negative interaction with the Affordable Care Act has come in the form of increased healthcare costs. If we are going to truly right all of ObamaCare's wrongs, we need to tackle the costs head on.  This will mean, among other things, fixing the draconian regulatory regime in our health insurance markets and giving individuals the ability to select only the coverage they want and need.[[Page S1732]]Many of these types of issues fall far outside of the Finance Committee's jurisdiction and are under the watchful eye of the distinguished chairman of the Senate HELP  The House bill also includes some provisions that are intended to address these concerns. I assume our distinguished colleague running the HELP Committee is working tirelessly to address the issues, and others, both through the reconciliation exercise or some alternative means.  Ultimately, if our goal is to place the healthcare system in a better position than it has been under ObamaCare, costs will have to factor heavily into the equation. I am looking forward to receiving guidance and leadership on the HELP Committee on these important market reform issues.  Overall, I believe we can and will be successful in this endeavor to fix our broken healthcare system. The American people are counting on us to do so. At the end of the day, success in that endeavor is, in my view, going to require a robust Senate process that allows this Chamber to work its will.  We have two Chambers in Congress for a reason. The House reconciliation bill needs 218 votes to pass. The Senate will also have to act when we receive the bill, and we will need to produce a package that can get at least 51 votes in this Chamber and hopefully more. That may mean some differences between the Senate and the House versions of the bill, but that is not problematic in my view. It is not particularly novel or unusual for different views and ideas to be resolved through the legislative process rather than simply dissipating when a bill is introduced. It seems to me that is not novel, and I am not the only one who has this view.  Earlier this week, Secretary Price sent a letter to the chairmen of the House Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce The letter commended the chairmen for their work and praised the legislation they unveiled to repeal and replace  The Secretary also noted that this was not the end of the process but that the introduction of the House bill was a ``necessary and important first step'' and that the administration anticipated that the Congress would be ``making necessary technical and appropriate changes'' to get a final bill to the President that he can sign, which reminds us of the other important advocate in this endeavor. President Trump ultimately needs to support the bill that is passed by each Chamber of Congress, and his support for our efforts is paramount.  While, at this point, it may not be entirely clear what the final bill will look like, we do know two things for certain. First, we know that ObamaCare is not working. As the majority leader said yesterday, ObamaCare is a direct attack on the American middle class. Thanks to skyrocketing premiums, shrinking options in the health insurance market, burdensome mandates, and harmful taxes, millions of Americans are dealing with the failures of ObamaCare on a daily basis. We need to act now to fix these problems.  Second, we know that by introducing its bill and moving it through the legislative process, the House has taken significant steps in advancing this effort, and the leaders in the House should be commended for doing so.  Long story short, I have nothing but praise for the leaders in the House this week for the work they have done on these issues. Remember, this is just the beginning. I look forward to working with my colleagues in both Chambers to get this over the finish line so the Republicans can collectively make good on our promises with regard to                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, I rise to speak on the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the U.Supreme  Later this month, Judge Gorsuch will come before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his confirmation hearing. I wish to speak today on what we can and should expect to happen during that hearing.  First, some background. This will be the 14th Supreme Court confirmation hearing I have participated in. I have seen some truly outstanding hearings in which both the nominee and the Senators acquitted themselves well. I have also seen some hearings that have gone far off the rails, in which some Senators hurled unfounded allegations or sought to twist the nominee's clearly distinguished record. I am hopeful Judge Gorsuch's hearing will be the former type.  We have before us a supremely qualified, highly respected, and extremely thoughtful nominee. Judge Gorsuch has had a stellar legal career, and by all accounts, he is a man of tremendous integrity, kindness, and respect. He is the sort of person all Americans should want on the Supreme He does not approach cases with preconceived outcomes in mind. He seeks to apply the law fairly and impartially in line with what the democratically elected representatives who enacted the law had in mind. He will be a truly outstanding  Judge Gorsuch's hearing will focus on his background, his temperament, and his approach to judging. So let's talk a little about what we know about Judge We know he has an outstanding academic record. He graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School and obtained a doctor of philosophy in law from Oxford We know he had a highly successful legal career before becoming a judge.  He clerked for two Supreme Court Justices before entering private practice here in He made partner in only 2 years, which shows how highly his colleagues at the firm thought of him and his work.  Following a decade in private practice, Judge Gorsuch was appointed Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General at the Department of Justice, where he oversaw the Department's antitrust, civil, and environmental tax units.  In 2006, President Bush nominated Judge Gorsuch to the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth circuit--the circuit in which I reside. The Senate confirmed Judge Gorsuch unanimously by voice vote a short 2 months later. At Judge Gorsuch's investiture, then-Senator Ken Salazar, who later served as President Obama's Interior Secretary, praised Judge Gorsuch's ``sense of fairness and impartiality.'' That fairness and impartiality, which was evident to my colleagues even then, was a large reason why Judge Gorsuch won confirmation without a single dissenting vote.  Judge Gorsuch's hearing will also affect us on his temperament and approach to judging. No one can seriously doubt that Judge Gorsuch has an excellent judicial temperament. A recent article in Slate--no rightwing paper, by any means--described the judge as ``thoughtful and fair-minded, principled, and consistent.''  The Denver Post, which twice endorsed President Obama for President and endorsed Hillary Clinton in this past election, also recently endorsed Judge Gorsuch's nomination, saying: ``From his bench in the U.Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, he has applied the law fairly and consistently.''  Clearly, Judge Gorsuch has the right temperament to serve on the Supreme  His approach to judging is also spot-on. Judge Gorsuch's opinions show that he is not only an excellent writer but also that he understands the proper role of a judge in our constitutional system. He consistently explains his reasoning by reference to fundamental constitutional principles. He does not seek to push the law toward the outcomes he favors but instead tries to apply it in harmony with the understanding of those who wrote and passed it. In so doing, he shows a healthy respect for the legislative process and for the democratically elected branches of government.  As Judge Gorsuch said in a speech shortly after Justice Scalia's passing, ``Judges should be in the business of declaring what the law is, using traditional tools of interpretation, rather than pronouncing the law as they might wish it to be in light of their own political views.''  Judge Gorsuch's opinions demonstrate that he understands fundamentally the importance of this principle and that he seeks faithfully to apply it in his own judging.  Against this impressive list of qualifications, Democrats and their liberal allies strain mightily to find plausible grounds to oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination. They misread his opinions, misstate his reasoning, and in[[Page S1733]]general paint a picture of a man who simply does not exist. We can expect more of this at his confirmation hearing. In particular, we can expect to be raised again and again the risible and flatly false claim that Judge Gorsuch is outside the ``judicial mainstream.'' These arguments against Judge Gorsuch are not persuasive--not even close. We see hints of them in the various letters liberal interest groups have sent Congress claiming that Judge Gorsuch is a threat to the Republic--a danger to our very way of life. The over-the-top language these groups use only serves to highlight the weakness of their case against Judge  One such letter called the judge ``an ultra-conservative jurist who will undermine our basic freedoms and threaten the independence of the Federal judiciary.'' The letter goes on to say that there is ``zero evidence that Judge Gorsuch will be an independent check on this runaway and dangerous administration.''  As an initial matter, I would ask: If Judge Gorsuch is such an existential threat to the Republic, where were all these groups 10 years ago when he won confirmation to the Tenth Circuit unanimously? Did Judge Gorsuch spend the first 40 years of his life hiding what a monster he is, revealing his true self only once safely ensconced on the Federal bench?  The outlandishness of these claims against Judge Gorsuch is made clear by the support he has received from prominent liberals, including President Obama's own Solicitor General, Neal In an op-ed published in the New York Times, Neal Katyal praised Judge Gorsuch's fairness and decency and said that he had no doubt that, if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would ``help to restore confidence in the rule of law.'' Katyal further wrote that Judge Gorsuch's record as a judge reveals a commitment to judicial independence, a record that should ``give the American people confidence that he will not compromise principle to favor the President who appointed him.''  It bears mention here that Mr.Katyal is no shrinking violet when it comes to standing up to the executive branch. He rose to prominence in the legal community through his work representing Guantanamo detainees. So when he says Judge Gorsuch will not shy away from holding Federal officials to account, frankly, his words carry weight.  Then there is the phrase we are likely to hear invoked again and again at Judge Gorsuch's hearing and beyond: ``judicial mainstream.'' Liberals will tie themselves in knots claiming that Judge Gorsuch is some sort of fringe jurist, that his views place him on the far flank of the Federal judiciary. Any honest observer will tell you that these claims are complete bunk. President Obama's Solicitor General and liberal publications like Slate would not offer praise for Judge Gorsuch if he were some kind of a nut.  In reality, the claims that Judge Gorsuch is outside the mainstream boil down to three things: a willful misreading of his decisions, a disingenuous attempt to redefine what it means to be mainstream, and an inability to count. On the misreading point, opponents of Judge Gorsuch claim that his decisions say things that they very clearly do not say or stand for propositions that even a generous reading cannot substantiate. They say he favors large corporations over employees, when really he just believes Federal employment laws mean what they say. They say he opposes contraception and family planning, when really he just believes religious liberty statutes should be enforced.  Judge Gorsuch's opponents also cite as examples of his purported extremism decisions that liberal Democratic appointees joined or that a majority of his colleagues agreed with. They will take a case in which more than half--or sometimes all--of the judges who heard the case agree with Judge Gorsuch and say the decision was outside the mainstream. I don't know about my colleagues, but I always thought that being in the mainstream had something to do with being somewhere in the vicinity of your peers or colleagues on a given issue. But, apparently, that is not what the left means.  Rather, in their failing campaign against Judge Gorsuch, liberals have redefined ``mainstream'' to really mean nothing at all. It has become a code word for liberal, for the sorts of results that liberals would like to see. But being in the mainstream and being liberal are not the same thing, despite Democrats' fondest desires. There is such a thing as diversity of thought, which the left used to venerate, at least until the confirmation wars and the rise of the conformity cult on college campuses.  So to my colleagues--and to the American people--I say: Do not be deceived when liberals say that Judge Gorsuch is outside the mainstream. He understands that the proper role of a judge in our constitutional system is to interpret the laws in accordance with the understanding of those who wrote and ratified those laws. This approach to judging leaves lawmaking power to the people's elected representatives and confines the judge's role to implementing the policy choices selected by those representatives. It is an approach consistent with our Constitution, our core values, and democracy itself.  It may be at times that this approach yields results that liberals don't like, but that doesn't place it outside the mainstream. It cannot be the case that the test of whether a judge is in the mainstream is whether that judge reaches consistently liberal results. When the people's elected representatives enact into law a conservative policy, a judge faithfully applying that law may well reach a conservative result. The opposite is true when the people's elected representatives enact into law a liberal policy.  All of this is to say that we cannot judge a nominee solely on the basis of whether we like the results he or she reaches. As Justice Scalia famously said:       If you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have      to resign yourself to the fact that you are not always going      to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all the      time, you are probably doing something wrong.  That is an interesting statement by one of the great judges, whom Judge Gorsuch will replace.  Liberals want judges who will always reach liberal results, but that is not the role of the judge. It is the role of a legislator, and a judge is certainly not a legislator.  So when you hear liberals say Judge Gorsuch is outside the mainstream, recognize that they are talking about results--specifically, liberal results--and recognize that that is not the proper inquiry for a Supreme Court confirmation hearing.  A Supreme Court confirmation hearing should be about the nominee, the nominee's experience, and whether the nominee understands his or her properly constrained role as a judge under our On all of these metrics, Judge Gorsuch is off-the-charts qualified.  When the good judge comes before the Judiciary Committee, listen to the answers he gives. Ask yourself whether what he says is consistent with the separation of powers and the system the Framers designed. Compare his measured demeanor and thoughtful responses to the histrionics you see from his opponents on the left.  I have full confidence that when the hearing is over and the last question has been asked, Judge Gorsuch will have shown the Senate that he is unquestionably qualified and fully prepared to serve our Nation on the Supreme  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor.

975,topic-id,760,"Mr.President, later today, the Senate will vote on H.42, the resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act relating to a Department of Labor regulation on the drug testing of unemployment insurance applicants. I rise to speak in support of that resolution and to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of its passage.  Let's put this resolution and the regulation it would repeal in proper context. In 2012, Congress passed and President Obama signed the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Among many other things, that law included a number of carefully negotiated provisions relating to the unemployment insurance program, including a number of reforms to address program efficiency and integrity issues.  One of those provisions overturned a DOL ban on drug screening for UI applicants. Specifically, the law allowed States to test UI applicants who either lost their job due to drug use or were seeking employment in an occupation that generally required drug tests as a condition of employment.  It did not require States to begin drug testing; it only gave them that option. In addition, the law required DOL to issue regulations to define those occupations that regularly conduct drug tests. States would not be allowed to implement any drug testing policies pursuant to the law until the regulations were finalized. DOL issued its proposed regulation in 2014.  At that time, Members of Congress and stakeholders at the State level argued that the proposal fell far short of Congress's intent. The final rule was issued in August of last year, about 4\1/2\ years after the provision was signed into law. As before, the final regulation defined the relevant occupations so narrowly that it basically makes it impossible for States to implement any meaningful drug testing policy.  So here we are, debating a CRA resolution that would wipe this regulation off the books and give DOL an opportunity to put forward something new that better reflects Congress's intent.  Let's talk about why this drug testing provision is important. The UI Program requires beneficiaries to be able and available to work and be actively seeking work. This is a condition of eligibility for UI benefits. This is what it boils down to. If a worker loses his or her job due to drug use, he or she cannot affirmatively establish that they are fully able to work. Likewise, if an unemployed individual is unable to accept a new job because they cannot pass a required drug test, they are not available for work.  Congress intended to give States the power to withhold benefits in these cases because, by definition, individuals in these situations are not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits.  Keep in mind that, according to recent surveys, more than half of all U.employers require prospective employees to take a drug test. It isn't some fringe or mean-spirited notion that there is a connection between the use of illegal drugs and the ability to obtain and maintain employment.  Furthermore, 20 States already limit UI benefits for applicants who have refused to take or who fail a drug test required by an employer or who have previous employment issues relating to drugs. The next logical step really is to allow States to conduct the tests themselves in order to maintain program integrity and to improve the solvency of their UI trust funds. Once again, that was what Congress intended with the passage of the 2012 statute.  Unfortunately, the Obama administration took it upon themselves to undo congressional intent. We have heard from a number of Governors on this issue--including the Governor of Utah, who will support this CRA resolution--who want to see new and better regulations.  A number of organizations, including the National Association of State Workforce Agencies, have chimed in as well, expressing their strong support for State flexibility in governing their UI programs.  Ultimately, that is what this is about--State flexibility. Do we want States to have the freedom to run their own programs as they see fit, or do we believe that bureaucrats in Washington have all the answers?  It is probably pretty clear where I come down on this particular issue. The law we drafted and passed in 2012--the one that passed with bipartisan support--struck a careful balance on these issues. It was the right balance and the right approach. Hopefully, a majority of our colleagues will share that view and vote today to restore that balance.

16,topic-id,931,"Madam Speaker, today I would like to share a letter I received from Sherry, who lives back in my hometown of Olympia,  Sherry writes to me:       My husband was a veteran. He worked as a civilian with high      security clearance at White Sands Missile Range and later as      a paramedic and firefighter. When I met him, I was working as      a paramedic, also. We were crazy in love. But I lost him to      cancer in 2009, at the age of 56.       Since the day my husband died, we lost his income. I had to      figure out how to raise our son, who was then 6. I sold my      business on the Oregon coast, lost my house in Newport, and      moved to Washington to be with my sister. I found Olympia a      year later and have been here since. I have qualified for      food stamps for the last 8 years. We have depended on the      food bank on and off.       When all this happened, that was before ObamaCare, and the      $1,000 monthly premium for insurance for my family was simply      not sustainable. At first, I was able to keep my insurance      through But after that ran out, we were left to paying      for some cut-rate insurance that provided very little      coverage.       When the Affordable Care Act was enacted, I finally felt      relief. I got covered through the ACA, and that allowed me to      direct some of the money I was paying to insurance toward      food, books, clothing, or tuition. My son is now 13, and 6      foot 1, with a size 14 shoe, so we go through clothes and      shoes for him like crazy.       I still struggle. I still have medical bills and      collections. I still struggle with food and clothes for both      myself and my son. I still go to the Thurston County Food      Bank in downtown But ObamaCare allows me to follow      my health closely and helps me pay for the medical care my      son and I require.       I have a spot on my lung that needs constant monitoring,      and ObamaCare has allowed me to go in for those routine      Preventative services like mammograms are also paid for.       Since my husband died, I have been focused on raising my      son and getting a higher education degree. I went to massage      school, and[[Page H1601]]     then I earned my degree at The Evergreen State I      will graduate with a master's degree in psychology in      Not only will I be employable and be able to help others in      the mental health field, I will also get to start whittling      away at paying old medical bills and my student loans.       Although I will no longer need ObamaCare since I will have      health insurance through my employer, the ACA has forever      changed the insurance marketplace. The insurers can't charge      me more for my preexisting condition like they could before.       If the ACA had been in place when my husband died, I would      have been able to keep my business on the Oregon coast. If      the ACA had been in place when my husband died, I would have      immediately qualified for insurance under the ACA, and I may      have been able to keep our house. I want you to know, I am      not lazy. I am a determined, self-improving mom who is      raising her son alone. Before the ACA, I had to decide      whether to pay for insurance or food.

I heard from many, but still a small portion of the 750,000 Washingtonians who gained coverage through the  The ACA is working for many people across America, and Congress should not reverse the progress we have made under it. That being said, I know there are parts of the ACA that could be improved upon. We all know that. We can and should make improvements in order to make healthcare insurance more affordable and more accessible to more people across our As we began this Congress, I had hope that we could have a productive, bipartisan discussion about the steps we could take to do just that, but I was saddened and, frankly, dismayed by the lack of serious policy efforts from my friends on the other side of the aisle.  Well, the majority finally released their proposed replacement for the ACA, the so-called American Health Care Act, after weeks of hiding this secret bill behind closed doors. Frankly, I am not impressed by the bill. This bill offers no attempts to improve healthcare coverage or insurance coverage, no attempts to reduce healthcare costs or the rate of inflation. This bill allows insurance to charge older people more while, at the same time, reducing the subsidies for many of those very same people. The bill was presented without any indication of how it will affect our budget or how many people will be kicked off their insurance under this plan.  This bill does not address the barriers that prevent working class and middle class people from accessing and securing health insurance. In fact, the bill would likely put health insurance out of reach for millions of Americans who are in the working and middle classes.  Madam Speaker, to earn the label ``American,'' a bill had better be exceptional. The American Health Care Act is a lot of things, but exceptional is not one of them. People like Sherry are exceptional. Let's put Sherry and people in her circumstances first.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgH1600-3.txt,2040,INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY AND A DAY WITHOUT A WOMAN,2017.0,8.0,March

Ever since she defeated cancer, Stacey has taken herself to new heights and translated her strength into action. Her story makes us all proud to call Nevada home.  Stacey Escalante was diagnosed with stage 3 skin cancer over 10 years ago when she was still a news reporter for KVBC, now KSNV-Up until this point, she was a model for health, but as we all know, cancer is a disease of its own. After several medical procedures, constant trips to the doctor, Stacey had to endure years of screenings and follow-up medical procedures before the cancer finally went into remission. During this time, she was forced to take a leave of absence from her job in order to recover. Even worse, she had to spend an extended period of time away from her family and friends.  During this recovery, Stacey wanted to come back home. She knew she would recover if she got to be at home surrounded by her family and coworkers who cared deeply about her. Fortunately, Stacey was able to return home and be with her family and friends; there she continued to fight cancer tooth and nail.  After she recovered, Stacey didn't just go back to work and pick up where she left off. Instead, Stacey became a cancer survivor, willing to stand up for cancer patients and those unware of the dangers that tanning beds can cause to the human body. Stacey also remains incredibly active, a hard-working single mom who is still dedicated to living a healthy lifestyle. Despite time away from her career, Stacey worked through the setbacks and is now a publicist at Orca Communications and continues to have an exciting career in public relations.  Stacey's battle with cancer and getting to where she is today is a testament to her determination. She has a passionate story to tell, and I believe that she will continue to inspire others to do the same. She epitomizes what it means to fight back and go even further by spreading the word about the dangers posed by tanning beds and advocate for other women's health issues. I am truly inspired by her story.  I am both humbled and honored to acknowledge Stacey Escalante for her perseverance and willingness to share her story and get involved to make the great State of Nevada an even stronger, healthier I wish her continued efforts the absolute best.

230,topic-id,1464,"Mr.President, it seems appropriate that we are debating the nomination of Seema Verma to head the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services the same week Republicans in Congress introduce a plan to dismantle the Affordable Care  Over the past 8 years, President Obama and the Democratic Party have been fighting to make sure that everyone in this country has access to affordable, quality health insurance. President Trump and his allies in Congress do not share this commitment. Instead of debating how best to expand access, they are fighting with each other to see just how many people they can kick off insurance rolls--all in a crusade, apparently, to save some people money.  This is not a crusade to improve the lives of as many Americans as possible. It is a crusade to serve their radical antigovernment ideology. In fact, ``ideology over people'' is a useful shorthand to describe the first 2 months of the Trump administration.  The problem with their ideological debates is that people are left out of the debate. Do we really know what it is like to be without health insurance? Under the plan to repeal the ACA, 20 million people in our country will be without health insurance, without healthcare. What if you were one of those people?  This question is not an academic one for me. I know what it is like to live without health insurance. When my mom brought my brothers and me to this country--I am an immigrant--her job did not provide health benefits. My greatest fear growing up as a little girl in this country was that my mom would not be able to go to work if she got sick. If she wasn't able to go to work, where would money for food and rent come from?  That is not the kind of fear we want to impose on millions of children in our country, but we will be doing just that to the 20 million people and their families who gained health insurance under the Affordable Care Act--many, for the first time in their lives. They did not have to be worried every single day that their child or their parents would be sick and would not be able to afford the care that they needed. This is not an academic exercise for any of them. They will be hurt by what we are being asked to do. It is not an academic exercise for the millions more who will lose their insurance coverage under  But no one should be surprised. This administration and their allies in Congress continue to demonstrate a commitment to alternative facts. If you believe their alternative facts, TrumpCare would improve healthcare access for working families, seniors and women, and Americans would have, as the President said, ``much better healthcare for much less money.''  But in reality, TrumpCare will do the opposite. TrumpCare would end by 2020 the ACA's Medicaid expansion that millions of people in our country depend on every day. The expansion not[[Page S1663]]only provided health coverage to millions of people for the first time, but it also helped to keep hospitals in rural and underserved communities from closing down. These rural hospitals exist all across the country. In its place, TrumpCare would change how States receive Medicaid funding, and it would do so in a way that ensures that these programs cannot keep pace with the rising cost of health insurance in their counties and in our country.  Under this new system, States would have less money to spend on Medicaid recipients and face the prospect of tightening eligibility and slashing benefits. This would be particularly devastating in Hawaii, where we saw the number of people enrolled in Medicaid grow by nearly 20 percent under the Medicaid has had a transformative impact on tens of thousands of lives in Hawaii and millions of others across the country.  Anne from Oahu walked into the Kokua Kalihi Valley Clinic 3 years ago. She had no health insurance, and she was pregnant at the age of 15. The doctors at the clinic helped Anne apply for Medicaid, which helped her afford prenatal care, gave her support to stay healthy and, very importantly, to stay in school.  Medicaid helped Anne and her husband Dan, age 17, welcome a healthy baby boy named Today, Anne is a graduate of Farrington High School, works part time, and has plans to become a pediatric nurse practitioner. Anne, Dan, and Joseph now have insurance through Dan's employer.  Reducing access to this critical program is wrong. Trying to convince the American people they would be better off with the results of these kinds of drastic negative changes to Medicare and Medicaid is yet another alternative fact.  I am encouraged that four of my Republican colleagues spoke out forcefully against any bill that would eliminate the ACA's Medicaid expansion. We need more Republicans of conscience to make their voices heard on this important issue.  TrumpCare would also be devastating for seniors in Hawaii and across the country. Under TrumpCare, insurance companies would be able to charge older Americans up to five times more for an equivalent health plan than they would be able to charge a younger person. For a President and a party that professes to hate taxes so much, they don't seem to have a problem with what amounts to an age tax.  TrumpCare's changes to Medicaid would also have devastating consequences for States like Hawaii, where our rapidly aging population depends on Medicaid to pay for nursing home and other care. The President made the American people a promise--that his healthcare plan would not touch But the cumulative effect of TrumpCare's assault on our seniors--our kupuna--would force the Medicare trust fund to go broke 4 years sooner than expected. For reference, the ACA extended the life of the Medicare trust fund by 10 years.  This would have a devastating impact for seniors like Anne and Lanny Bruder from Lanny is 80 years old and working three jobs to make ends meet. He has had two knee replacements and a heart attack. Anne has glaucoma and pays a lot of money out of pocket for her prescription eye drops. They can't afford to pay more for their health insurance, which is exactly what is going to happen under  TrumpCare would also have a profoundly negative impact on women across the country. The President's plan would completely zero out funding for Planned This lifegiving, lifesaving organization would no longer be eligible for Medicaid reimbursements or Federal family planning, which would leave a $500 million hole in their budget.  Republicans continue to claim falsely that community health centers would fill the gap in service left by the demise of support for Planned Parenthood--not true. Most of these community centers, whose resources are already stretched thin, do not provide women's healthcare or family planning services. In other words, they would not be able to replicate the services that Planned Parenthood provides all across the country to millions of women and families.  Planned Parenthood operates two clinics in Hawaii, one on Oahu and one on They are the forefront of innovation in increasing access to family planning services across the They launched an innovative new mobile application that would allow doctors to provide digital consultations to women on neighbor islands for the purpose of prescribing birth control. Recently, Planned Parenthood made their first delivery to the island of Molokai, a largely rural island with little permanent medical infrastructure. This is the kind of innovation we should be encouraging, and it is precisely the type of program that could get cut if Planned Parenthood loses its Federal funding.  I often say that there are people in this country getting screwed every second, minute, and hour of the day. Instead of reducing that number, which should be our goal, TrumpCare would increase the number of people who get hurt in our country. The wealthiest of the wealthy in our country would benefit because--not only would all these things happen under TrumpCare that would be devastating to families, to women, to our seniors--TrumpCare would also give a big tax break, a big tax cut to the wealthiest people in our country. They don't need that kind of tax cut. Do people making over $2 million a year really deserve another $150,000 a year in tax cuts? I don't think so.  TrumpCare would be a disaster for the middle class, I am going to do everything in my power to stop it from being the law of the land. We have come too far in the past 8 years to go backward. The first way we can fight back against this plan is by rejecting the nomination of Seema Verma, who would be in charge of implementing TrumpCare as the head of  ",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgS1651-3.txt,1844,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,8.0,March

311,topic-id,1563,"Mr.Speaker, I just came from the Energy and Commerce That committee, along with the Ways and Means Committee and the Education and the Workforce Committee, is seized of the responsibility to consider the harmful American Health Care Act being offered by the Republicans as a better way. It is anything but a better way.  Mr.Speaker, they don't want the American public to see what they are doing. They met all through the night. They have been meeting now for over 24 hours, without sleep, without rest, without reflection, and with no opportunity, Mr.Speaker, for the American people to see what is going on. In the dead of night, out of the sight of the public, they are hiding their bill and rushing to judgment.  Why? Because they know, as they have seen in town meeting after town meeting after town meeting--that is, of course, those Republicans who have had town meetings--that the American public is extraordinarily concerned and worried they are going to lose the health care that they receive through the Affordable Care  They are concerned about the premiums and deductibles that they have to pay skyrocketing because of the Republican bill that is being proposed. They are concerned that Medicare and Medicaid are going to be decimated and the life of Medicare reduced in terms of its ability to pay the benefits promised.  Mr.Speaker, the President stood at that rostrum and said he had a healthcare bill that was going to give healthcare coverage for everybody--not just some, but everybody--at less expense and greater quality. There is no such bill that the President has provided us with. If there is, and if he has such a bill, Mr.Speaker, I will support it, but it is certainly not the bill that the Ways and Means Committee ended its work on at 4:30 a.m. this morning.  The American people, Mr.Speaker, ought to be asking: What are you hiding? What is the rush? You have had 7 years to consider this bill. That is 7 years. We are meeting tomorrow, we are meeting next week, we are meeting the week after. It is not as if we are going on a summer break and we need to rush to judgment. It is not that we need to keep the American people out of consideration of this bill.  Mr.Speaker, Democrats in committee and on this floor are doing everything we can to slow down this process and to open the doors, open the windows, and keep the lights on so that the people who deserve to know how a Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act will impact their lives and the lives of their family and their children.                              {time}  1030  Houses Republicans are marking up this bill without holding a single hearing--not one hearing--for a bill that gives $600 billion in tax cuts and cuts hundreds of billions of dollars from health care. The tax cuts go to the wealthiest in Perhaps that is why there are no hearings. Perhaps that is why they didn't invite any witnesses. Perhaps that is why they are rushing to judgment before the Congressional Budget Office, which is nonpartisan and will give us an accurate estimate of its cost and who is going to be hurt--Mr.Speaker, apparently they don't want the American people to get those facts before their representatives have to make a decision.  I know they voted for repealing the Affordable Care Act almost 65 times here in this Democrats have voted against that because we believe the Affordable Care Act is working.  Is it working perfectly?  Do we need to join together and make it work better for the American people?  This bill will impact, Mr.Speaker, every single American family and business. If enacted, it will force Americans across the country to pay more for less coverage and fewer benefits. Shamefully, Republicans are hoping they can jam this bill through the House and Senate before Members have to go home and face their constituents in That is why we are having to rush, because they don't want their Members to go home in April and say: This is what we are considering, what do you think? Because they know. Because they have had hearings, town meetings. They haven't had any hearings on this bill, but they have had town meetings, and every American has seen the reporting on that, angry Americans fearful that they are going to lose benefits absolutely critical to them and their families.  They continued marking up this bill through the night, using the very same tactics they claimed we were using when considering the Affordable Care We had over 79 hearings not in the middle of the night, but during the day. We had over 181 witnesses. That is opposed to zero--zero--witnesses on this bill. It gives a lie to the representation of transparency and openness and accountability that our Speaker has said he would operate this House to ensure that those happened.  They used the same tactics that they claim, as I said, that we were considering. In fact, here is what Tom Price, who was then a member of the House of Representatives, now the Secretary of the Health and Human Services, said: ``The negotiations are obviously being done in secret and the American people really just want to know what they are trying to hide.''  He said that on January 6, 2010.  180 witnesses, 79 hearings, a year and a half or more of consideration, yet we have a bill that was introduced Monday night. Today is Monday night it was introduced, and no hearings. Wednesday, deep into the night, and this morning this bill is being marked up.  Kevin Brady, the chairman of the Committee on Way and Means, who held a markup until 4:30 a.m., said this: ``I think there is never a more critical time for the American public to weigh in on an important issue than on health care today and there is a lot about this bill we don't know.''  He said that in a townhall August 10, 2009. Well, now he is chairman of the committee, and apparently he has decided that the American public doesn't need to know now. When we were in charge, he thought the public needed to know, and that is why we had those 79 hearings and 181 witnesses and townhalls, thousands of meetings and townhalls around the country on the Affordable Care But Mr.Brady apparently doesn't think that is applicable when he is in charge of the committee.  Then Speaker, now former Speaker John Boehner said this: ``Can you say it was done openly, with transparency and accountability? Without backroom deals struck behind closed doors, hidden from the people? Hell, no, you can't.''  But now the shoe is on the other foot, and my Republican colleagues are in charge. They are full speed ahead, and the doors are closed, the windows are shuttered, and the blinds are drawn.  The process we had in 2009 and 2010 to write and adopt the Affordable Care Act included, as I said, 79 hearings versus zero hearings on this bill. 181 witnesses that I have referred to. Zero witnesses, zero Americans included from the public in this process. We had a 2-year process that was open and recognized how consequential the[[Page H1955]]legislation would be, ensuring that Americans from all over the country, including doctors, healthcare organizations, providers, insurance companies, average citizens could weigh in.  Now in their rush to pass their repeal, Republicans are doing everything they said was wrong and much more. Republicans are terrified that the American people will find out what is in this bill. The problem they have is a lot of their Members have found out what is in this bill, and they don't like it. Hardly any newspaper in America likes it. We think the public is thinking they are moving too fast and are going to hurt them. They are afraid, however, of having to face angry constituents who will see that this bill will take healthcare coverage away from 20 million Americans and cause out-of-pocket costs to go up for millions more. This bill could destabilize even the employer-based insurance market. That is people who know nothing about the exchange, but they have insurance through their employer. This bill will destabilize their insurance as well.  The point is, Mr.Speaker, we don't know for sure how bad it is. We know it is bad, and that is information we ought to have before being asked to vote on the floor or in committee on such consequential legislation. My Republican friends say, well, we will have a CBO score by the time we consider it on the floor. But they don't want that information out for very long because it is going to be very negative.  Democrats will continue, Mr.Speaker, to do everything in our power to slow down this process and throw back the curtain Republicans have pulled over this bill and this process in an attempt to hide the details of their dangerous plan from the American people. We are ready, as I said, to turn the lights out in this Chamber before we let the Republican repeal bill turn the lights out on coverage and care for millions of our fellow I do not yield my conviction to oppose this bill as strongly, as long as I possibly can.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1954.txt,566,MOTION TO ADJOURN,2017.0,9.0,March

In addition, the House will consider several important bills from the Veterans' Affairs  First, H.1181, the Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act, sponsored by Chairman Phil Roe, which ensures that the Second Amendment rights of VA beneficiaries are not restricted without due process.  Next, H.1259, the VA Accountability First Act, also sponsored by Chairman Roe, which grants the VA Secretary increased discretion to remove or suspend VA employees due to poor performance.  Finally, H.1367, sponsored by Representative Brad Wenstrup, which enhances the VA's ability to recruit and retain highly qualified employees.  The failures of the VA are well-documented and completely unacceptable. These bills are a step in the right direction towards creating greater accountability at the VA, and keeping our promise to Americans' veterans who have sacrificed so much for us.

793,topic-id,1804,"Mr.Speaker, on a less happy collegial note, it comes as no surprise to the majority leader at the height of our displeasure and disappointment as it relates to what is going on, back to the consideration of the reconciliation process for the repeal or modification of the Affordable Care Act with the American Health Care The bill was posted this Monday, this past Monday night, it was marked up on Wednesday, there were no hearings, there were no opportunities for witnesses to come forward. And as the gentleman knows, he is absolutely correct, I like these quotes, but I like these quotes because they point out theoretically what I would have great agreement with in terms of process.  Particularly, I call your attention to a quote of Speaker Paul Ryan: ``Congress is moving fast to rush through a healthcare overhaul that lacks a key ingredient: the full participation of you, the American people.''  That quote was July 19, 2009. That quote was referring to the process involved in the adoption of the Affordable Care  As the gentleman knows, the Affordable Care Act had 79 hearings. As the gentleman knows, there were 181 witnesses who testified about the Affordable Care As the gentleman knows, that process took approximately 1\1/2\ years, 8 months of which was waiting to see whether Senator Grassley would participate in a bipartisan way in forging healthcare reform in this country.  The gentleman is well aware, not only have we had literally hundreds of thousands of people around the country come to townhall meetings, many that his Members have held, and express their deep concern about the loss of healthcare security if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. So there is no doubt that the American public--I am not saying it is 100 percent--but a large number of the American public are very concerned.  The gentleman further knows, I am sure, because I am sure he has seen the letters, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the American Nurses Association,[[Page H2042]]even the Consumers Union, and hundreds of other groups representing providers, patients, even insurance companies, have expressed deep, deep concern about the adverse consequences of the passage of the American Health Care Act that was marked up in the dead of night. We were criticized. The gentleman apparently doesn't agree with that. But the facts are the facts. They are not alternative facts.  You started marking them up on Wednesday morning, there was some delay during the day, as you know, because we were very concerned about how fast you were moving that. Less than 48 hours after it was introduced, it was marked up. No hearings, no witnesses, no ability to read the bill.  As a matter of fact, shockingly, Mr.Brady voted against an amendment which said: Read the bill. Now, what was shocking about that is that was Mr.Brady's amendment that he offered back in 2010. He voted against the amendment that said: Read the bill. I don't think anybody really had much opportunity to read the bill before it was marked up.  Greg Walden, who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said also, in July of 2009:       On a bill of this significance, you would think that we      would at least allow people to come in who are affected by      the extraordinary changes in this bill and have a chance to      let us know how it affects them.  That was Greg Walden, now the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, July 9, 2009. He is now in charge of that committee. Not a single witness testified on the bill that was marked up in his committee. And it was marked up through the dead of the night, if we want to parse our words, because it started in the morning of But it didn't end until the morning, 26 hours later, on Which meant that Mr.Walden kept his members in their seats marking up a bill, except when they were voting coming over here, for 26 hours straight on one of the most consequential bills this House will consider and that the Senate will consider, affecting, as I said, millions and millions and millions of people.  Now, I understand the Budget Committee is scheduled to mark that bill up on Wednesday, just a week later. Again, I don't know whether there are going to be hearings and if those hearings will be open to the witnesses that should be called to testify on a bill of such impact.  Let me do one additional quote, because the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee had an interesting quote as well. He said: ``The Democratic Congress and White House simply aren't listening. Democrats are ramming it through over the public's objections.''  That was on March 17, 2010, some year after the bill had been introduced. Thousands of meetings had been held by Republicans and Democrats around the country on the bill. And, as I said, 79 hearings and 181 witnesses later. That is what Chairman Brady said.  And, of course, Chairman Brady, in less than 48 hours, had a markup. Now, he did not have quite as long a markup. It ended at 4:30 a.m. Thursday morning. So that was the dead of night. Or, if you want to parse words, perhaps, the dead of the early morning. But, nevertheless, most of my public wasn't up watching. I presume even at 4:30, which would have been 1:30 for your public, they weren't up watching.  So this was done out of the sight of the public and is inconsistent, I suggest to my friend, Mr.Speaker, the majority leader, inconsistent with the pledge of transparency, openness, and those three quotes that I just read you that said the American people should have the opportunity to express their opinion on legislation generally, but certainly on legislation of this consequence.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I always look forward to these discussions. I know they are about the schedule, but I always look forward to what quotes you are going to bring up next.  Let me see if I can answer all of those questions that you raised.  First, my friend did inform me, last week and again today, that the Democrats have held 79 hearings over 2 years on Well, we have spent the last 6 years.  I promised you that I would see how many hearings we had. When I went back and checked, the Republicans have held 113 hearings on the ways to repeal and replace We had expert witnesses on both sides of the aisle on everything from the individual mandate and Medicaid sustainability, to the medical device tax, and ObamaCare's failing co-ops.  We have been committed to repealing and replacing this law for years, and I am sure you will find a lot of quotes from almost everybody on this side of the aisle saying that same thing. We have done the work, we have listened to the American people, and we believe now it is time to act.  You did bring up about the committees. You brought up about reading the bill. So what we put forth is we put a website together for the patient-centered healthcare bill, and it is available online at readthebill.gop. Now, this is only 123 pages. That is a difference from your bill of 2,700 pages for  Now, we remember what the Democrats said when they were passing ObamaCare, that you had to pass the bill to see what is in it. So I went back and checked how many people were unable to visit the website. We had over 350,000 visitors visit our website in just 36 hours, and 100,000 downloaded the legislative text.                              {time}  1145  Now, when you talk about dead of night, I was on this floor, you were on this floor, and I know people on both sides of the aisle have used it before, but the dilatory activity on the other side of the aisle to slow this process down put us into nighttime.  And then let's think about how this process went. It was an open process. Why did it go so long? We debated hours of Democrats' amendments because we weren't going to shut it down. We never called the question. We kept going as long as people wanted to go. And we spent hours on one amendment that just wanted to change it to a hashtag of a different name. That was a Democratic amendment to somehow change the bill. We didn't stop with that. We let everybody talk, and we let everybody have their voice because we believe in regular order.  Yes, we spent 27 hours on it because we were not going to deny anybody the ability to talk or offer their amendment. And that is exactly what we did, and that is what the American people expect to have happen.  So, 113 hearings, I congratulate you on your 79; 123 pages compared to 2,700. I believe this is a great first step in three phases. For too long this health care of ObamaCare has failed.  In that 2,700 pages they created 23 co-ops and provided more than $2 billion. In this short amount of time, 18 of them have collapsed. They had the quote that, if you like your health care, you could keep it, but millions of Americans found out that wasn't true. They said your premiums would go down. Millions of Americans have found out that is not true either.  Now, across this country, one-third of the entire country only has one provider. And the very sad part of this, just within the last month, Humana announced that they are going to pull out. That is leaving 16 counties, and I see my good friends from Tennessee, with no provider at all.  We can do so much better. That is why we spent the years; we spent the hearings; we have had the witnesses.  And I know it is your right to come and ask to adjourn so somehow we couldn't get to the bill, it is your right to continue to ask to adjourn so Members can't offer their amendments, but you know what? If we had to spend through the dead of night and stay up so we made sure, even if it is on the other side of the aisle, a Democrat could offer an amendment, just a hashtag to change the name, that is your right, and we would spend the time and do it. And we spent hours at it.  If you ask me, personally, I didn't think that amendment changed anybody's health care in But you have a right to do it, and we made sure we kept that right, and we had regular order.  I thank the gentleman for his quotes.  ",CREC-2017-03-10-pt1-PgH2041.txt,566,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,10.0,March
794,topic-id,1526,"I thank the gentleman for his comments.  Mr.Speaker, we have had, literally, tens of thousands of hearings that have dealt with almost every issue that this[[Page H2043]]House considers. I suppose I should take from the majority leader's discussion that, if we have had those hearings in previous Congresses, in the last Congress, the Congress before that, the Congress before that, and we have a substantial number of new Members in this House, and we have millions and millions of voters who are counting on this, we will just simply tell them: Read the transcript of 2002 or of 2009 or of 2013. That is not regular order, Mr. Regular order is you introduce a bill. It is referred to a committee, which in turn refers it to a subcommittee, and, even if it keeps it in the bosom of the full committee, it has a hearing. It posts the bill. It tells citizens throughout this country: If you have an interest, come in and tell us what your interest is, what your perspective is, what you think the ramifications of this bill are. The subcommittee marks it up, if it was referred to a subcommittee, then the full committee marks it up, and then it is referred to the floor. That is regular order, Mr. To rationalize a procedure which has a bill introduced Monday night and is subjected to 26 hours, straight, of markup on the following Wednesday, less than 48 hours later, no matter how you dress it up, that is not, Mr.Speaker, regular order.  What it is is trying to jam through a bill before the American public has an opportunity to tell us what they think about the bill. What it is is jamming through a bill and not allowing the providers, the doctors, the patients, the insurance companies, all of the stakeholders, to have an opportunity to read that bill introduced about 72 hours ago now--a little more than that, maybe close to 96.  That, Mr.Speaker, is not regular order. And I will tell my friend for whom I have a great deal of respect, I think he puts the best face on it, but nobody believed the Republicans had a bill, Mr.Speaker, until Monday night. Well, actually, I believed they had a bill at the last colloquy, and I looked for it all over this I couldn't find it. It wasn't posted. The ranking member on the committee didn't have it. No committee Democrat had the bill. They couldn't read it.  So to pretend, Mr.Speaker, that hearings on some other bill at some other time in some other Congress suffices for regular order is something, Mr.Speaker, I cannot agree with. And if the situations were reversed, as I have experienced over the last 36 years, that side of the aisle would have torn this place apart. Why do I think that? Because I have seen it.  Yes, we had some delaying, four motions to adjourn, so that we had some time to figure out what this bill was about and some time to hear from the American people. It certainly wasn't enough time. We are going to be hearing more from the American people, I think, Mr. I appreciate the gentleman trying to say that, well, we only had 48 hours. Sometimes, Mr.Speaker, we do that in a hurry. And the reason is because we are about to go on a break. We are about to go on an August break or a recess or something of that nature. That is not the case. These committees didn't have to meet through the night. They could have met They could have met today. They could meet next week. But this bill is being rushed through too fast with too much adverse consequence to the American people.  I would hope the majority leader would slow this bill down. I hope the Rules Committee has full hearings on this bill and that it does not have just attenuated hearings with few witnesses, because there are a lot of people who want to tell us, their Representatives, what their view is of this bill.  I know the Speaker has said there are going to be three phases to this bill, and the majority leader said so as well, and there will be additional legislation. I hope, Mr.Speaker, that my friend, the majority leader, will urge the committees not to consider additional legislation either in the middle of the night or with no notice and no opportunity for witnesses and no hearings.  Previous hearings will not suffice, Mr.Other Congresses had hearings. This Congress has a responsibility to hear from the American people. That is what Speaker Ryan said; that is what Mr.Brady said; that is what Mr.Walden said. They said it at a time when they were in the minority, but it ought to apply when they are in the majority. And if we are in the majority, it ought to apply to us as well. I hope that happens, Mr.Speaker, for the country's sake, for our people's sake.  I will yield to the majority leader, Mr.Speaker, if he would like to speak.  Mr.I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I appreciate the gentleman's comments.  Mr.Speaker, I do want to remind people, when you use reconciliation, what is the process? Well, the process states you have the authorizing committee post and they mark up. We did that. Budget Committee marks up. They will do that next week. Rules Committee will meet, then it comes to the House floor.  I will never apologize for having 113 hearings on repealing and replacing I will never apologize for having all the witnesses in.  And I love that you bring a lot of quotes of people inside that are elected, but I will be very frank. The quotes I love and the quotes I care most about are the ones that come from my constituents.  For some reason, this idea that this is a complex issue but you had hearings before so you are going to forget all about those hearings, why do we have committees? Why do you keep Members on your own side of the aisle on the same committees? To build expertise, to solve big problems. So, no, they don't forget what they learned in those hearings.  But let me read you quotes from a few constituents.  ``Dear Kevin, thank you for your diligence in these disruptive political times. I have several concerns.  ``ObamaCare blew us out of the water. I retired early as an RN due to health problems, so I have to pay for my entire health insurance. I am not complaining about that, but I am tired of having premiums go through the roof. I lost my doctor and my plan.  ``In 2017 there were few options without a $5,000 deductible. If I have to pay that much first, then why pay for insurance? Our income is not huge. We cannot afford this.''  Or from another constituent: ``Dear Kevin, I just wanted to convey that I strongly feel legislative action is needed to fix the  ``My family deductible has increased over $3,000 a year--it used to be $1,000 8 years ago--and I practically only have health insurance in case a catastrophic accident were to occur.  ``Also, my sister-in-law can no longer work more than 29 hours a week since her employer does not want to have to provide insurance. That is ridiculous.''  Or: ``Dear Kevin, I just got my 2017 health insurance renewal notice, $650 per month, up 20 percent. I am 60 years old, have worked and saved all my life, so I don't qualify for subsidies. I can't go without insurance, but I can't pay for it either. Something needs to be done. I am so upset that I am crying right now.''  But my friend, Mr.Speaker, on the other side of the aisle says to wait to help these people. Forget about the 113 hearings, even though it is more than the 70-some that ObamaCare had, or 123 pages is too much instead of 2,700.  I will never apologize for having the wisdom to listen and, now, the courage to lead. But I will promise you this, Mr.Speaker, and my friend on the other side of the aisle: I have never come to this floor to offer to adjourn just to disrupt the process.  And, yes, I had Members on our side of the aisle that would get frustrated that Democrats would offer an amendment that just dealt with a hashtag. No, let's let them have their say. If they feel that is important for American health care, to put a hashtag name change, then let's spend hours on it. Because we believe in the process, we will defend your right to have that process even though it will not help one constituent of mine or yours.  But you want to spend your time doing that? We will do that. And we did do that. That is why we worked through the night. But we will not give up on the American people. That is why we are doing what we are doing, and I thank the gentleman for yielding.

795,topic-id,911,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the remarks of the majority leader. I presume that he has heard from--I don't have the quotes in front of me,[[Page H2044]]but maybe I will bring them next week--the thousands of people who have said their lives have been saved by the Affordable Care Act; the thousands of parents with a child with a preexisting condition that, if the Republicans had succeeded in their 65 votes to repeal it, would not have been protected; the millions of seniors who are paying less for their prescription drugs because of the Affordable Care                              {time}  1200  I could read all those letters.  Why do I read the letters of Mr.Walden, Mr.Brady, and Speaker Ryan?  Because they are in charge.  All our constituents, on either side, had no opportunity to testify on this bill. But Speaker Ryan, Mr.Walden, and Mr.Brady could have given them that opportunity, and they chose not to. They rationalize it apparently because, well, we had hearings in the past.  Does this bill have the subject matter of the ACA?  It does. But this bill was offered just some, as I said, 90-or-so hours ago. And the leader says: Well, that is okay. It is based on all those hearings we had.  The fact is this bill has not been brought forward for the last 7 years while there was a repeal for  Why?  We all know why. Mr.Speaker, it is because the majority could not come to an agreement, and they are not in agreement now. Perhaps, if this bill stands out there a little bit, it is so flawed they won't be able to get the votes on their side of the floor.  I was here--I don't think the majority leader was here--when we adopted the part D prescription drug program. It was called up by the majority, the Republican Party at the evening hour; and we voted from 3 a.m. until 6 a.m. And when I say we voted, that vote was kept open for 3 hours while they opportuned their Members: You have got to vote for this. President Bush wants it. You have got to vote for this.  We voted against it. But the vote was held open 3 hours, I tell my friend. That was not regular order.  Now, our side has held a vote open from time to time--never for 3 hours, but from time to time. That is why it is being rushed. It is not because they had a lot of hearings before, not because witnesses had testified they didn't like the Affordable Care We understand that.  The issue is not whether people like or dislike the Affordable Care It is how are we going to provide what the President has promised: access for everybody to health care at a lower cost and a better price.  I told the majority leader last week--and I repeat my comments, Mr.Speaker, to the majority leader this week--if they bring such a bill to the floor, I will support it. This bill does not do that.  So what President Trump promised during the election and what he promised from that podium just a few days ago is not what this bill represents. It is not what they promised to the American people.  What I asked the majority leader was--they are apparently going to have some additional bills--whether or not they will be also rushed through without hearings on the premise that there were hearings in the past.  I repeat that there are a lot of new Members in this body that didn't have the opportunity to have those hearings and weren't in this body. I don't know how many there are because I don't know how many Congresses we are talking about if we adopted this bill 7 years ago and then there were hearings subsequent.  So I don't know where we are going, Mr.Speaker, but I think the American people expect an opportunity to be heard. Yes, I may quote some next week.  The people who were elected by the American people to do their job have the power to open up the doors and open up the windows and pull back the curtains so that the American people could come in and testify. There were all those witnesses who testified in the last Congress and the Congress before that, but I am talking about the people who testified during a Congress in which we considered the bill. We haven't had an open rule this year, Mr.We have had structured rules. We have had no open rule.  So in terms of the majority leader telling me, Mr.Speaker, that we want everybody to have their opportunity, and he caricatures one amendment that was--I think I would agree with him--more to show that not a single Republican would vote. And Mr.Brady, as I pointed out, didn't vote for his own amendment that he offered when the Affordable Care Act was marked up to say read the bill.  Time was not given to read the bill.  Mr.Speaker, I understand we are not going to come to any conclusion today; but I am hopeful that the process that was perpetrated on not only the minority but also the majority this week will not be repeated, and that the representations that have been made by the Speaker, by the young guns, and by so many others would be a process that is, in fact, open, thoughtful, and democratic.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-10-pt1-PgH2041.txt,566,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,10.0,March

Nearly all the facilities within this project were already transferred to the Arbuckle Master Conservancy District in 2012, after the district finish repaying what it owed to the Federal Government for construction. However, due to some overly narrow language in the legislation authorizing this project, two buildings have yet to be transferred.

992,topic-id,5310,"Mr.President, I think tomorrow President Trump is going--or at least is planning--to sign an Executive order rolling back the Obama Clean Power I will have a lot to say about that, but I think it is important at an appropriate time to discuss the history of this issue. It has been going on a long time.  At the start of the 114th Congress, the Senate voted 98 to 1 in support of the Inhofe-Whitehouse amendment, stating that climate change is real and not a hoax. That is something we can actually agree on; that climate has been changing since the beginning of time, and there is all the archeological evidence, there is the Scriptural evidence, the historic evidence. Climate has been changing and will continue to change.  The hoax is that some on the far left believe man controls changes in the climate. We have endured 8 years of an administration that buys into the alarmist mentality that the world is coming to an end, and it is due to manmade gases. That is what the hoax is. Even though individuals--occasionally you will find some scientists who agree with this, but they will say that there may be some contribution, but it is minimal. It is not even measurable.  The Obama administration has used climate change as justification for taking unauthorized actions, such as the so-called Clean Power Every administrative entity under Obama was forced to embrace his climate change agenda as a top priority and used it as a convenient sounding board.  We have seen agencies such as the Department of Defense divert resources away from their core responsibilities and instead spend them on finding ways to justify statements from the President that climate change is the greatest threat, a greater threat than terrorism.  So other agencies have spared no taxpayer expense in supporting the outcome-driven science in an attempt to bolster their claims. In fact, the Congressional Research Service has reported that the Obama administration spent $120 billion on climate change issues. That is a total waste of money. I don't think anyone can tell me what that $120 billion was spent for. It was not authorized, it was not appropriated, but it was spent.  This comes from the Congressional Research So this is a total waste of money, money needed to defend Despite the administration's efforts, as research and data around climate change continue to improve, the results do not support their claims but instead call them into question. This is especially true for all of the ``hottest month'' or ``hottest season'' or ``hottest year'' in history. This is something that is often claimed by those who are reading the script and trying to make those claims.  So 2014 was previously the warmest year on record, until a reporter pressed NOAA and NASA on the claim and the agencies were forced to admit they were only 38 percent sure that claim was accurate. A December 2015 study from the American Geophysical Union concluded that after analyzing over 1,200 ground-based weather stations: ``The warmest-ever claims by government scientists are inflated due to compromised U.temperature stations impacted by encroachment of artificial surfaces like concrete, asphalt, and heat sources like air conditioning exhaust.''  Because of NOAA's methods, they failed to account for these factors. Additionally, surface thermometers continue to be at odds with satellite data, which shows essentially no warming for the past 18 years, continuing the hiatus the Economist magazine originally wrote about in 2013.  In fact, just a few weeks ago, a whistleblower alleged that a June 2015 NOAA report manipulated data in an attempt to discredit this 18-year pause. Now, the 18-year pause has been agreed to. People understand, this is what they call the hiatus. This is a time when temperature has not changed, but they have done this to influence the public debate surrounding the Clean Power Plan and the Paris climate conference. Conveniently, the computer with the data suffered a complete failure and none of the data was saved.  It is not just the inflated temperature claims that can be called into question. A growing body of scientific study suggests variations in solar radiation and natural climate variability have a leading role in climate change. That is a novel idea, that the Sun has something to do with warming. A number of the incident studies assessing the impact of clouds have even suggested that water vapor feedback is entirely canceled out by cloud processes, as global data shows no increase in the number or the intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods, in spite of what they say on the Senate floor.  Even the IPCC's 2013 report concluded that the current datasets indicate no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century. No robust trends in the annual numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes--major hurricane count--have been identified in the past 100 years in the North Atlantic Basin, but we still hear it over and over again.  When it comes to droughts, the IPCC report indicated that previous conclusions regarding global increase trends in drought since the 1970s were probably overstated.  The increasing observations from scientist Craig Idso suggests a much reduced and practically harmless climate response to the increased amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Further, there are benefits from the increase in carbon that have led to a greening of the planet and contributed to increased agricultural productivity. Now, this shows that the progression that has taken place--the green parts are the part where they have an increased amount of CO2 activity.  The trend is in the annual gross productivity per decade by percentage. This is from 1982 to 2011. So you can see the great benefits. In fact, many people still remind us, over and over again, that CO2 is actually a fertilizer. It helps things grow. But these points were kept out of the Obama administration's press releases, and the media has been more than willing to go along.  None of this is surprising. As I have given a lot of speeches on climate change, my message tends to be one that the alarmists on the far left do not want to hear and do not want to believe, but they have been proven wrong time and time again.  Despite millions of dollars of the Tom Steyers of the world, Americans do care about climate change, but it is not high on their list. Right now, which I will state in just a moment, some of the polling activity that has taken place has surprised a lot of people. This is Tom We keep hearing about the Koch brothers and other people who are putting money in the campaign, but Tom Steyer is the one who has said--that was his statement--that prior to the 2014 races, he was going to put $100 million in there to elect people to promote such things as Obama's plan.[[Page S1801]]  The Environment and Public Works Committee last Congress--and this is when I chaired that committee--held 10 hearings assessing the President's climate agenda, where we heard from a diverse group of expert witnesses who testified to the enormous costs, especially for low-income minority communities, the economic consequences, the legal vulnerabilities, and the miniscule environmental impacts. We had the president of the Black Chamber of Commerce, Harry Alford, come to a hearing. He was the one who talked about how disproportionate the harm is that is done to poor people. He talked about the Blacks and the Hispanics who are at risk. I will elaborate on that in just a moment.  Taking committee action is a further step that Democrats and Republicans in both Houses of Congress rejected Obama's and the radical left's key climate regulations. Then, in February of last year, the U.Supreme Court put a stay on the so-called Clean Power Plan because they too had significant legal questions surrounding the validity of this.  Well, needless to say, there is a well-documented, substantive rejection to Obama's climate actions across the institution designed to keep the executive branch in check.  I have not attended one of the United Nation's climate conferences since 2009, when I was kind of a one-man truth squad in Let me mention what this is. The United Nations, they are the ones that started the whole thing in the very beginning in talking about global warming, talking about all the problems that were out there. We have a pretty documented case. In fact, there is a book that was written--I will not mention the name of the book--that comes to the conclusion that the United Nations was right in the middle of this whole discussion as far back as 1972. So what the United Nations does is every year they have a big party. This is the big party of the year. It is in They have had 21 in 21 consecutive years.  What they do is invite everybody to come in who says that we will voluntarily reduce targets for CO2 emissions. Of course, most of them who come in are coming in to get some of the billions of dollars they say they are going to be distributing. This is really interesting because these parties--I can remember one time I was talking to someone I know from Benin in West In fact, the Chair knows this individual too. I saw him at one of these meetings. I said: Now, you don't go along with all of this.  He said: No, but this is the biggest party of the year.  So they have these every year. That is what I think is important for people to understand. Anyway, I hadn't gone to any of these since the big event in Copenhagen, but the message I carried to the international bureaucrats then is exactly what happened: Congress did not then and does not now support the radical climate change actions, and the U.role in any associated international agreement will be limited accordingly.  The outlook for environmental activists and climate change alarmists is grim. With the significant losses in the White House, the Congress, the Supreme Court, and a persistently skeptical public, their political leverage and relevance has dwindled.  For the past 8 years, the Obama administration and the American economy have suffered under the effects of the climate agenda. That era is over, and President Trump is already delivering on his campaign promises.  Just a few weeks ago, I was at the White House when President Trump signed an Executive order instructing the EPA to roll back the waters of the United States rule. This is the rule that would have allowed the EPA to regulate waters in the United I think most people know this has always been regulated by the States, but the true liberals, they want to have regulation taking place not by the States but in  A guy named Tom Buchanan is the Oklahoma Farm Bureau chairman. He was talking about all the problems farmers have throughout America, farmers and ranchers. The biggest problem they have is overregulation by the Do you know what he singled out as being the most onerous of all of these regulations? It was the regulation on water. Of course, I was in there when the President did away with that particular rule.  As I previously mentioned, President Trump has also committed to rolling back the Clean Power Plan and its $300 billion pricetag. This rule would lead to dramatic increases in energy prices and reduce the reliability of the grid. These two rules are examples of major expansions of Federal power and a departure from the core functions and responsibilities provided by Congress to the  The steps taken by the Trump administration will return the rules of those agencies to their statutory intent. We have seen great successes in our air and water quality based on the EPA operating within its statutory limits. I can remember the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Right now, our pollution has dramatically dropped down. This is at a time when vehicle miles have actually doubled. So we are doing some things that are successful, and I look forward to continuing that success.  That is the end of my prepared remarks. I want to visit just a little bit about what is going on and what we have been doing over the last quite a few years now. I think it is important. People ask me: What are the motives of those individuals who are promoting all of these regulations that are on greenhouse gases? There has to be a motive for that.  I suggest, and this will surprise a lot of people, you go back originally--and I can remember when Koyoto first came out. Koyoto was the first regulation--they tried to get all the countries to join in. In fact, that was at a time when Clinton was President of the United States, and they were trying anxiously to get this thing--to join in the Koyoto treaty.  The ones who originally were involved in it--and I could go back to people who have forgotten about this. The former European Union Minister of the Environment, Margot Wallstrom, said: ``Kyoto is about the economy, about leveling the playing field for big business worldwide.''  Then the French weighed in; that was President Jacques He said during his speech at the Hague in November of 2000 that Kyoto represents ``the first component of an authentic global governance.''  You know, it hadn't really changed that much. Christiana Figueres was the one in charge of the Paris convention that took place where they were talking about the great successes they had there, and she said the real goal was ``to change the economic development model''--in other words, redistribute wealth among the nations.  So let's keep in mind that is what the original motivation was.  Then the United Nations weighed in. This goes all the way back to 1972. In 1972, the United Nations held a conference on human environment in Stockholm, Fifteen years later, in 1987, the U.published the report ``Sustainable development: Our Common Future.''  ``Sustainable development'' is a word that they changed--a phrase, because it is easier to sell to the public. That was 1987, and then you go forward to 1992 and the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, They announced their intention to pursue sustainable development through the Kyoto  It is kind of interesting because Reuters wrote an article in 2012 that said:       The ``sustainable'' branding for this year's summit, rather      than climate, is by design, said Ambassador Andre Correa do      Lagos, who headed Brazil's delegation to the U.climate      talks in Durban and will be a chief negotiator for Brazil in       That is behind us now, but this is an article that came out in 2012.       Sustainable development is an easier sell globally than      climate change, even though sustainable development is a way      of tackling global warming and other environmental issues, he      said.  He said the end goal is not about the environment but about the redistribution of wealth.  Again, if anyone doubts that he was accurate in that statement, the Secretary General of the United Nations at that time was Ban Ki-moon, and he proposed how the challenges must be addressed. In talking about what they were going to do at these annual meetings, he said:       More than $2.1 trillion a year in wealth transfers from      rich countries to poorer ones, in the name of fostering      ``green infrastructure,'' ``climate adaptation'' and other      ``green economy'' measures.[[Page S1802]]  So there again, after all these years, it is still about the same thing.  Now we go into more science and the different weather events. I notice when people come to the floor and they talk about all the bad weather and the hurricanes and the tornadoes and the fires and that all that is as a result of these events, I would like to remind people that George Mason University reported that 63 percent of the weathercasters believe that any global warming that occurs is a result of natural variation and not human activities.  Here is another one too. The Democrats will like this because Martin Hertzberg was a lifelong liberal Democrat, a retired Navy meteorologist with a Ph.in physical chemistry. He also declared his dissent of warming fears in 2008. This is a quote from this guy. He said:       As a scientist and life-long liberal Democrat, I find the      constant regurgitation of the anecdotal, fear mongering clap-     trap about human-caused global warming to be a disservice to      science.       The global warming alarmists don't even bother with data!      All they have are half-baked computer models that are totally      out of touch with reality and have already been proven to be      false.  That is coming from a very liberal  So you start looking at some of the things they say are linked to NOAA, the scientists, rejected the global warming link to tornado. NOAA said that no specific consensus or connection between global warming and tornadic activity exists.       According to NOAA, hurricanes have been in decline in the      United States since the beginning of records in the 19th      century. The worst decade for major . . . hurricanes was in      the 1940s.  Journal of Geographical Research: Since 2006, global tropical cyclone energy has decreased dramatically to the lowest levels since the 1970s. Global frequency of tropical cyclones has reached a historic low.  On droughts, the same thing: Severe droughts in 1934 covered 80 percent of the country, while the one they talk about in 2011--it was just 25 percent.  On sea level, the Journal of Geographical Research: There is no statistically significant acceleration in sea level rise over the past 100 years.  Again, these are the people who know, and we are talking about in this case the Journal of Geographical  So enough of that. That is something that is a fact in terms of the weather events.  The other thing I want to mention here, going back to my notes on Antarctica, this is kind of interesting because in September, according to NASA and the data on the National Snow and Ice Data Center website, Antarctic ice hit a new record high in recorded history as it has increased to more than 19.4 million square kilometers. That was happening in terms of the data center information.  In January of 2010, Time magazine talked about the Himalayas melting. I remember people on the floor of this Senate standing up and talking about how the Himalayas are going to melt because of global warming. The article in Time magazine said: ``Himalayan Melting: How a Climate Panel Got It Wrong.''  Glaciergate is a black eye for the IPCC and the climate science community as a whole.  Sometimes some humorous things do happen. They were trying to build their case back in 2013. This was a research expedition to gauge the effect of climate on the It began actually on December 24. There was a Russian ship carrying climate scientists, journalists, tourists, and crew members for the expedition until it became trapped in deep ice up to 10 feet thick. Now, here they were going up there to show that things were warming in The whole crowd was wanting this to happen. They got stuck in ice. Well, they were stuck there for 6 days. Then an Australia icebreaker was sent to rescue the ship, but efforts were suspended due to bad weather. On January 2, they were still there. A Chinese icebreaker sent out a helicopter and airlifted the 52 passengers from the Russian ship to safety on an Australian icebreaker. The Chinese vessel was also stuck in the ice, along with the Russian vessel. There were 22 Russian crewmembers onboard the Russian ship, and an unreported number of crewmembers remained on the Chinese ship. Finally, the U.Coast Guard came along, and they were able to get in there and pull them out. The ship was called Polar  I remember when that happened because they were going there with the express purpose of explaining to the world the problems they have in the  Let's talk about bears. You don't get people talking about this without dancing out the polar bears and talking about what is happening to polar bears.  It is kind of interesting because when we look at the bear populations, they say that in the Davis Strait, they have flourished despite the shrinking Arctic Sea ice since the 1970s. In fact, in 2007 they escalated up to 2,158 bears, and they only had 1,400 in 1993. Another way of looking at it is, when Al Gore was born, there were 5,000 polar bears. In 2005, that number grew to 22,000. Today, there are 30,000 polar bears. So don't worry about the polar bears. If there is a serious problem there, it is because of overpopulation. But it looks so good. It is such good theater to dance out the polar bears and say the polar bears are all going to disappear.  When Climategate happened, I was convinced that this whole issue was over.  I can remember when we had Lisa Jackson before the committee that I chaired. This was actually in 2009. In 2009, we had sent over all of these people to tell the 192 people at the U.meeting in Copenhagen that the world was coming to an end, that they needed to all join in and sign an agreement on what they were going to do about So the day before I left for Copenhagen, Lisa Jackson happened to be in our committee. On tape, with live TV, I asked the question--I said: Well, Madam Administrator, I am going to leave town. I have a feeling that when I leave town, you will have an endangerment finding. For you to get the authority to do something about global warming, you have to have an endangerment finding. An endangerment finding has to be based on science. What science are you going to use?  She said: Well, the  That is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate That is the United They set it up for that purpose.  So as luck would have it, it happened in a matter of days after that, after she said everything is put on the science of the IPCC, the worst scandal--some people say the greatest scientific scandal in history--took place. It took place at the University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit located in the It revealed the scientific fraud. They have tapes and emails of individuals who were saying: We are going to have to rig this in order to come up with some facts to show that there is warming taking place.  These were the scientists of the It was such a scandal that one of the UN scientists resigned, and he said: The result is not scientific.  Here is a good one. Clive Cooke of the Financial Times said:       The closed-mindedness of these supposed men of science,      their willingness to go to any lengths to defend a      preconceived message, is surprising even to me. The stink of      intellectual corruption is overpowering.  Then we had Christopher Booker of the UK Telegraph say: ``This is the worst scientific scandal of our generation.''  So I had thought that since everything was based on that particular science, that would do it in, but it didn't happen.  If you look at all the damage that has been done in the last 8 years by the concentration of all these issues, the defense is one that took the biggest hit. A lot of people don't really believe or don't understand or don't appreciate what has happened to the defense during the time Obama was In fact, we have been watching very carefully what our new President is going to do to try to undo the damage--what I call the disarming of America--the damage that was done to our military.  They will say: Well, wait a minute, the Obama budget for the military was the same as the budget was before that, so it isn't any great reduction.  The difference is, they changed the function of the military. How many people are aware that despite all of the problems, they wasted money on the Green Remember the Green Fleet? They were actually paying $59 a gallon for biofuel to try to convince[[Page S1803]]people that we could use the military to experiment for other more pleasing sources. Twelve million dollars for operation and maintenance to exercise painting ships, printing hats, and transforming fuel to show off the Green Fleet at the foreign military show, and $3.7 billion in solar panels and wind power. Why should the military be paying that? We have a Department of As I read the function of Energy, that is what they are supposed to be doing.  Then we have Tom The reason I bring this up is because we keep hearing about the Koch brothers. And yes, the Koch brothers are in production. Their job is to try to find energy to run this machine called America, and they have done a very good job of it. But they get criticized all the time. So I think it is important that people realize that there are a lot of liberal billionaires who have made pledges. In this case, this individual, Tom Steyer--I am sure he is a fine guy. He actually made a commitment of $10 million personally to try to promote the message that Obama had. Here is something interesting that we just found out or I just discovered: Even though this man is trying to kill fossil fuels, he made his money in fossil fuels. Since 2003, Steyer's hedge fund, Farallon Capital Management, has played a pivotal role in financing the tremendous restructuring and growth in thermal coal production in Jakarta and All of this took place under Mr.Steyer's tenure as founder and senior partner of The coal mines that Mr.Steyer has funded through Farallon produce an amount of CO2 each year that is equivalent to about 28 percent of the amount of CO2 produced in the United States each year by burning coal for electricity generation. So it is worthwhile to note that he now is putting huge investments out to defeat the very people who were the source of his wealth.  The other question I get quite often is, Why aren't more people talking about this? I have made an accumulation of various threats. There are two groups of people out there. We have those who are for the whole program that President Obama had, and they are the ones who are questioning and talking about the various science, and then we have threats coming from people such as James Hansen, who said that these are ``high crimes against humanity.''  Robert Kennedy, Jr., said: ``This is treason and we need to start treating [people] as traitors.''  Barone: ``The warmists have `a desire to kill heretics'--Calls for capital punishment for `global warming deniers.' ''  So it is not fun, and there are a lot of threats out there. If they don't have logic on their side and don't have science on their side, then the threats are what people use.  We talked about cap-and-trade legislation. They tried for a long period of time to get legislation through, and when that didn't work, we might remember the first bills that were introduced were the McCain-Lieberman bills in 2003, 2005, and 2007. The first of those bills was a cap-and-trade bill that was defeated in this Chamber by 43 to 55. Two years later, they tried it again, and it was defeated by 38 to 60. Each year, the margin went up. President Obama came along and decided: Well, if we can't pass this stuff through legislation, let's do it by regulation. So we had cap-and-trade regulation.  I have already talked about going to Copenhagen after Obama, Pelosi, Barbara Boxer, and John Kerry had gone there to a big United Nations party in 2009 and went with the idea of convincing everyone that we were going to pass legislation over here, and, of course, we didn't do it.  In 2010, Japan under no uncertain terms refused to extend the Kyoto They dropped out when they said: If we don't have India and China, we are not going to be a part of it. Canada finally went through. Canada was one of the first countries to join in on the Kyoto Protocol, but they dropped out in 2011 and 2012.  That brings us to the Paris party that they had. They tried to make it look as if it was a success, when in fact it was a miserable, dismal failure. Our President said that we would reduce our CO2 emissions by 27 percent by 2025. Obviously, we couldn't do it. We even had a committee hearing asking how were we going to do that? We had the EPA in, and they admitted that it couldn't be done.  Then they talked about the commitment that China made at the Paris conference. China has actually produced more--this diagram gives you an idea of where China is going. They are building a new coal-powered generation plant every 10 days, and they are not about to try to restrict their They said: Ok, we will do it. Let us increase our CO2 emissions until 2025, and then we will agree that we will do a waiver. That is the extent of the regulations that have not worked.  The polling and the truth are coming out. The polling is now different than it was at first. I can remember when global warming was one of the first--either in first place or second place in the polls as to the dangers that face Look at the polling today. The FOX News poll last week said that 97 percent of Americans don't care about global warming when they stacked it up against terrorism, immigration, healthcare, and the economy.  The Washington Post-ABC News poll just found that fewer Americans think climate change is a serious problem.  On March 12, 2015, the Gallup poll said that climate change came in dead last of national problems of concern to Shortly after that, the Gallup poll did their annual environmental survey, and global warming came in dead last in terms of environmental issues--15th out of 15 concerns. So I am stating that the people of America have caught on. It is something that people are aware of now.  When we stop, look, and think about the cost of the Clean Power Plan, that is what this whole thing is about. I think that tomorrow the President is going to come up with a plan to do away with the Clean Power The compliance costs would be between $29 and $39 billion a year, up to $292 billion over 12 years with double-digit electricity price increases in 40 It would be an absolute disaster, and it is not going to happen.  What is worse than that is not just the cost but how it is hitting the most vulnerable people. Harry Alford, who is the president of the National Black Chamber of Commerce, found that the proposed Clean Power Plan would increase Black poverty by 23 percent, Hispanic poverty by 26 percent, reduce Black jobs by 200,000 and Hispanic jobs by 300,000, with a cumulative job loss of 7 million for Blacks and nearly 12 million for Hispanics by the year 2035. I have to state also that the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association found that high energy costs force seniors to forgo meals, medical care, and prescriptions in order to comply.  I am very proud of the He is keeping his commitment. He is not going to allow our most vulnerable citizens to be taxed, and I thank him for his help.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

304,topic-id,674,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to TrumpCare, the Republican plan to privatize Medicare, penalize working families, and prioritize the wealthy.  The Republican majority is in denial about the tremendous gains of the Affordable Care Act in covering tens of millions of people across this  In my home State of Washington, Mr.Speaker, because of the Affordable Care Act, the average annual premium increases have dropped from 18.5 percent, before the passage of the ACA, to 6.7 percent in 2017. The growth of individual enrollment reached nearly 320,000 people in 2015; and with Medicaid expansion in Washington State, the decline in the uninsured plummeted to 7 percent in 2015, from over 13 percent in 2009. 605,000 Washingtonians also gained coverage through Medicaid expansion.  All of these gains, Mr.Speaker, are in jeopardy as TrumpCare threatens to strip 20 million people, many of whom voted for Mr.Trump, of their health care. Across the Nation, older Americans will be forced to pay premiums five times higher than what others will pay for health care.  Four hundred of the wealthiest families in America will be handed a tax break worth $7 million a year, all on the backs of working families. According to the Tax Policy Center, under TrumpCare, the top 0.1 percent of earners would receive an average tax cut of $197,000, while older Americans would face increases of almost $7,000 each.  Under TrumpCare, many employers will stop providing coverage, letting their employees fend for themselves with a tax credit. Compared to the subsidies that Americans have today, the tax credits will end up being a tax hike.  Not only does TrumpCare impose radical new restrictions on a woman's right to comprehensive health coverage, it defunds Planned Parenthood, robbing women with nowhere else to turn of essential preventative care and affordable contraceptives.  Mr.Speaker, these are sad, sad facts. But the stories from hundreds of my constituents are even more heartbreaking. Lynn told me:       If I were to get a bad illness, it would kill me      financially. And the stress alone from having my health      insurance taken is causing me health problems already.  Luke wrote to tell me that when his wife needed emergency gall bladder surgery while he was a student, the bills would have been crushing. He said:       Without the ACA, we would have been saddled with nearly      $40,000 in hospital bills, ER, one surgery, and one overnight      stay.  Kristy shared:       Without contraceptive care that is covered in the ACA, I      would never be able to afford my I might have an      unwanted pregnancy, and I wouldn't be able to afford another      child. This means so much to me as a woman, a mother, and as      a human. I am able to have power to make decisions about my      family, and this means the world to me.  The lessons and stories like this, Mr.Speaker, are what we should be incorporating into our legislative deliberations, not cynical attempts to penalize people for wanting to have basic health insurance coverage for themselves and their families.  What is worse, the Republican majority seems intent on obscuring the real cost of this misguided proposal. Mr.Speaker, the majority deserves this They are cut from the same cloth and relying on the power of obfuscating the truth.  Since President Trump is not being forced to be transparent about his taxes or his financial entanglements with foreign interests like Russia, the Republican majority doesn't think that they need to ask the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to offer the true picture of how many people will be hurt by their bill and how much it will cost the American people. This is simply no way to govern.  At the most fundamental level, health care is a human right and not a luxury, as our Republican colleagues would have us believe; a healthy population is a healthy workforce; a healthy workforce is a healthy economy; and a healthy economy is a healthy nation.  TrumpCare puts all Americans at risk. Let's work together to protect and expand our health care and put this mess behind us.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1952-2.txt,2354,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,9.0,March

Our country has long recognized the importance of affording legal protections to whistleblowers. Under the protection and umbrella of these laws, whistleblowers have helped expose corruption, government waste, fraud, unconstitutional practices, and abuses of the public trust. They have risked, in many cases, their livelihoods to do what is right for this country and defend our democracy.  It should not be our objective to create barriers that will stop people in good faith from coming forward by subjecting them or their representatives to mandatory sanctions, but that is exactly what this bill is designed to do.

There are so many examples of waste, fraud, and abuse, it is time that we in Congress realize that it is not in our best interest to stay there for 16 more years. We have already been there 16 years. And, you know, you get to a point that you just wonder. And so many of our young men and women who have fought for our country in Iraq and Afghanistan are special heroes to all of us, and we know that. This is about the policy of the Congress, not the military policy.  Recently, I read an article that the former President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, has actually been meeting with the Russians and asking the Russians to come back to Afghanistan, and he, Hamid Karzai, will set up meetings with the But sometimes you just wonder who in the world is watching this absolutely wild crazy world of  Then this past week, there was another article, and I will read the title of the article, Madam Speaker: ``Chinese Troops Appear to Be Operating in Afghanistan and the Pentagon is Okay With It.''  Again, I repeat myself: after 16 years of war in Afghanistan, hasn't the American soldier done enough? Hasn't the American taxpayer paid enough for goats and paying ghost soldiers? 200,000 Afghans who don't even exist are getting paid, so that means that the money ends up in the hands of the Taliban or the village leaders.  You know, if the Chinese want to spend 16 years in Afghanistan, so be it. Let them have it.  Think about the history of Afghanistan, Madam Alexander the Great was the first, and then we had the Brits that went in. In fact, Winston Churchill was a young reporter when they were in Afghanistan and he was very disillusioned with that world. Then the Russians went in for 10 years and then they left, and now we have been there 16 years. Afghanistan is a graveyard of empires.  It is time for us to start looking at the sensibility of what we are doing there and does it make any sense, which is a better way of saying it.  I think that at some time, Afghanistan being the graveyard of empires, there is probably a headstone that says ``Russia.'' After 16 years, maybe there will be a headstone that says ``USA.'' And who knows? If the Chinese go and stay 16 years, there might be another headstone that says ``China.'' At that time, maybe the ghost soldiers can take the $6 million goats out to the graveyard and let them eat the grass or something.  I don't know, Madam It gets a little bit crazy. It really does. It is time for this Congress to debate whether our policy is to stay in Afghanistan or to come home from  I close with this. These two little girls from my district are Eden and Stephanie Their daddy, Kevin Balduf, was a sergeant from Camp Lejeune, which is in my district. He and Colonel Palmer, from Cherry Point Marine Air Station, which also is in my district, were sent to Afghanistan to train Afghanis to be policemen.  These two little girls are at the funeral of their daddy. Their daddy, Sergeant Kevin Balduf, emailed his wife the day before he was shot and killed, along with Colonel Palmer, and said: I don't trust them. I don't trust them. I don't trust any of them.  So I say to these two little girls, your United States Congress needs to debate whether we need to stay in Afghanistan longer than the 16 years we have been there, or is it time to say we have done our job and it is time to come home.[[Page H1598]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgH1597-4.txt,612,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1301, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE",2017.0,8.0,March

I had no complaints because I had other good committees, but I was told in December that, for this Congress, I would be added to the committee, and I am thrilled to serve on it.  When I found that I was going to be added to the committee, I knew one of the first issues we would be tackling is what to do about the Affordable Care So I have started to pay visits around the State to as many stakeholders as I can, including patients, doctors, medical students, hospitals, behavioral health facilities, allied health training programs in regions all across the State, military families in Hampton Roads just last Friday, as well as patients and their families in Chesterfield County last In all of these visits, my question has been: We are going to be tackling the Affordable Care Act; tell me what works, what doesn't work, and what we can do better. That has been the goal.  Today's committees in the House, two committees, are considering a plan that House Republicans have put on the table and are touting as a replacement of the Affordable Care I just want to talk about what it would mean, if passed, to Virginians and  This plan will reduce the number of Americans with insurance. We dropped the uninsurance rate to a historic low, but the gains that we made would be reversed and the numbers of Americans with insurance would go down.  It would raise healthcare costs, particularly on seniors, which I will discuss in a minute.  It would dismantle the Medicaid Program at the service of tax cuts for the wealthiest.  It is not an adequate replacement; in fact, it would be a dramatic retreat, and it would be a retreat that would violate promises that had been made by the President and other leaders.  Republicans--and I will get into this--have made a number of promises about what a replacement would look like, but this plan falls far short of that. That is why, within 36 hours of it being put on the table, stakeholders across the spectrum, including the American Hospital Association, AARP, the American Medical Association, nurses, nursing homes, and Republican Governors have come out to either dramatically and flatly oppose this plan or suggest significant concerns with it.  The bill has yet to be scored by the Congressional Budget Office, but the House is trying to push it through committee, and even through the floor, if they can, before the CBO tells the American public what this plan would cost and, every bit as importantly, what it would cost Americans in terms of the number of people who would lose their health insurance.  A very poignant comment about the plan that was in the paper this morning was from the Republican Governor of Nevada, Brian Sandoval, who said: We Republican Governors have talked to Congress and said please pay attention to what we have to say. States bear a huge burden on these programs, especially He said: We gave ideas to the leadership, to the majority about the replacement, but none of our ideas are in this plan.  Without a CBO score, the American public and this body are completely in the dark about how many people will lose coverage and about how this will affect the American economy. Why would we move forward? Why would we try to push a vote even in a committee, much less on the House floor, before the CBO has given us this score? We don't serve the American public well by doing that.  What does the replacement bill do? One, it ends the expansion of Medicaid that was a core component of the Affordable Care Act--the expansion that has been embraced by more than 30 Then, it takes the traditional Medicaid Program and really dismantles it, instituting a per capita fee for enrollees, and moving it more towards a block grant program. That is the first thing it does.  Second, with respect to seniors, this plan would repeal a provision in the Affordable Care Act that says seniors cannot be charged more than three times the premium of a young person; it would repeal that, and it will allow insurers to charge older customers five times as much as younger customers. It would also give States the ability to set even more unfavorable ratios for seniors. This will have a significant impact on the premium of older  Third, the plan repeals the income-based subsidies, premium assistance, and cost-sharing reductions in the current Affordable Care Act and substitutes less generous tax credits that will not be adjusted to average costs of plans in particular markets. So if you are a middle-income individual in a high-cost market, you are really out of luck with this plan.  Let me give an example of how insurance would be affected in particular communities all over Virginia if the House plan were adopted. If you are 60 years old and you make $30,000 per year, under the House plan, here is[[Page S1655]]what happens. First, the cost of your insurance can be dramatically raised because you are not, at age 60 now, limited to three-to-one over a young person's premium; they can charge you five-to-one over a young person's premium. So the premium cost, if you are a 60-year-old making 30,000 bucks, goes up significantly.  Now, you get a tax credit, just as right now you get a subsidy, but the tax credit is much less generous. So the cost of your policy goes up, but here is what happens in communities all over Virginia--tax credit compared to the subsidy they currently get.  In 2020, in Augusta County, VA, in the Shenandoah Valley, the tax credit you get is worth only about half of the subsidy you would get if we continued the Affordable Care So the price is up, but your tax credit is less generous by half of the current subsidy.  In Fairfax, your tax credit is 41 percent less than the subsidy; in Bedford, 51 percent less than the subsidy; in the city of Norfolk, 51 percent less; in Rockingham, 50 percent less; Pittsylvania, 49 percent less, and Pulaski County in far Southwest Virginia, 54 percent less.  So if you are a senior, your costs go up, but the assistance you get in the tax credit is dramatically less generous than the assistance you currently get with the premium subsidy.  The bill establishes a penalty if you don't have continuous insurance. An insurer can charge you 30 percent more in premiums if you go 2 months or more without insurance. So if you are unemployed, you lose your insurance. If you forget to pay a premium for two months, you lose your insurance. If you have any gap of 2 months, that is an opportunity for insurers to come in and sock you with a massive penalty.  The bill repeals funding to a healthcare provider of choice for millions of American women: Planned It is really important to be specific about this. There is not in the Federal budget a line item that says Planned Parenthood gets axed. What Federal funds go to Planned Parenthood? Well, first, the Hyde amendment says no Federal funds can go to any organization for the provision of abortions--Planned Parenthood or anybody else. Planned Parenthood receives Federal funds because it provides healthcare to women who are eligible for So when Planned Parenthood treats a woman who is Medicaid-eligible for a medical service that is eligible for a Medicaid reimbursement, then Planned Parenthood is able to bill Medicaid just like a doctor's office is. And Planned Parenthood is the healthcare provider of choice for millions of American women to do annual checkups, pap smears, cervical cancer tests, and all kinds of basic healthcare provisions. But under this bill, Planned Parenthood will be disbarred from the Medicaid Program, even when they are providing services to Medicaid-eligible women--services that are covered by  The one thing about this bill that I would say--if you were going to say: Well, who is a guaranteed winner in this bill because there are a lot of losers, and I have tried to summarize them--the guaranteed winner is that this bill overwhelmingly repeals the provisions that raise revenue. This bill is a big tax cut bill.  The biggest revenue raisers in the Affordable Care Act were tax cuts on the wealthiest citizens. There is a tax increase for nonwage income by the top earners in the United States and an additional hospital insurance tax that also affected individuals of high income.  What this bill does is cut taxes that almost exclusively benefit the wealthy, while the bill is taking away these coverages and provisions that protect middle and lower income The tax cuts in this bill would save the top 0.1 percent of earners in the United States about an average of $195,000 a year. So if you are in the top 0.1 percent and this bill passes, you are going to get an average of a $195,000 tax break.  Millionaires get 80 percent of the value of the high income tax cuts in the House bill, with the elimination of the hospital insurance tax on high earners and the Medicare tax on investment income. In fact, a family who is going to do incredibly well under this bill is the family of our President, Donald As high earners, they are going to get a huge tax cut with this bill.  I have to ask: Is this bill a healthcare bill or is it basically a tax cut bill? You could look at this bill as basically being that the driver of it is who benefits from it. It is a tax cut on the wealthy, paid for by slashing Medicaid, slashing healthcare coverage, slashing Medicare's trust fund, slashing Planned Parenthood, taking protections like preexisting conditions that really matter to people and reducing them. So I have a real question about whether this bill is a healthcare bill at all or whether, under the guise of a repeal and replace of ACA, it is a tax cut for the wealthiest, financed by slashing the healthcare safety net.  Let me read to my colleagues what certain Republican leaders have said about this bill in the past. The deputy leader here in the Senate--a friend--from Texas, Senator Cornyn, said to Republican Governors--Governors have a lot at stake in this. I was a I know how much Governors depend on Medicaid and healthcare programs. Here is what he said on January 19, 2017: ``Nobody is going to lose coverage.''  No exception, no qualification. ``Nobody is going to lose coverage.'' That is what he said to the Republican  We were awaiting the CBO score suggesting potentially how many millions will lose coverage. Many people will lose coverage. That is not what was promised.  But, more importantly, probably, what did the President say? When the President was campaigning as a candidate, this is what he promised the American people: ``I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.''  That was the test that he set for himself about an ObamaCare replacement--that no one would be worse off and that many would be better off. This does not meet that promise. It fails that promise.  At a December press conference the majority leader, Senator McConnell said: ``Surely, we can do better for the American people,'' and ``we will work expeditiously to come up with a better proposal than current law.''  Again, the promise was, we will take where we are right now and we will make it better. Nobody will lose coverage; everybody will be taken care of better. We will come up with a better proposal than the current law.  This is not that proposal. Turning Medicaid from a Federal guarantee to a per capita cap on spending doesn't mean everyone is covered; it means cuts to the States that would force States to cut eligibility, reduce benefits or provider payments. That is why providers, like the hospital associations and nursing homes, and the Republican Governors, like Governor Sandoval, are deeply opposed to this particular version. It is not better for the American people.  Protecting people with preexisting conditions, which the current bill does, but only if they have continuous coverage--that is not better for the American people because what if you lose your job or you can't afford benefits or you have a break in coverage for two months, and then you suddenly find that you are not protected, and your preexisting condition can be used against you to bar you from insurance for the rest of your life.  If you are unemployed and have a break in coverage, how do you afford a 30-percent surcharge on health insurance premiums like this plan proposes that insurance companies can sock you with? That is not better for the American people.  In closing, I will repeat something that 13 Democrats put into a letter to the Republican leadership in January: We want to work together to try to make healthcare better. We are willing to sit down at a table. We have ideas for how to improve not just the Affordable Care Act but prescription drug prices under Medicare Part D, something our citizens are deeply concerned about. We need to work together on affordability. We need to work together to make sure small businesses are able to afford coverage. We have to bring prescription drug pricing down. I know Republicans have ideas about how to do that and Democrats do too. The time is now to sit down and try to figure that out.[[Page S1656]]  Passing a precipitous repeal, trying to rush it through before the CBO scores it--a precipitous repeal that would take health insurance away from many, that would jack costs up on seniors, that would punish so many Virginians by reducing the subsidies they get now and replacing them with a less-generous subsidy--that will break a promise the President made. That will break a promise other leaders have made.  We had a HELP Committee hearing recently where we had witnesses who had been called by Democrats and Republicans before us, talking about things we need to do to fix and improve the Affordable Care They all agreed we needed to find improvements and fix it--all of them. Democrats, Republicans, Independents, they all agreed we need to find improvements. They all agreed a repeal of the Affordable Care Act would be a catastrophe.  There were four witnesses. I asked them this question: If we need to make improvements, what is the best way to do it? Should we do it fast, carelessly, and secretly or should we do it slowly, deliberately, and publicly transparently?  They all said: Of course, there is only one answer to that question. We are talking about people's health. We should do it deliberately, carefully, and transparently, rather than fast, carelessly, and secretly.  We are proceeding right now in the fast, careless, and secret mode. This particular plan comically was locked in a room and nobody was able to see it last week. One of our Senate colleagues went over and tried to get in to see what was in the plan--a Republican colleague, the Senator from Now that the plan is out in the light of day, I think we can see why they were hiding it--because it has so many elements that are frightening so many people.  We can get this right. We can get this right by sitting down and having a discussion about what I have been talking to my constituents about: in the healthcare system right now, what works, what doesn't work, and what we should change. If we bring constituents around the table--individuals, hospitals, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, businesses that are trying to buy insurance, doctors and nurses--if we get people around the table, they will break us out of the ``them versus our'' thing. We listen to them. We ask them those questions--what works, what doesn't, what can be fixed. We will find a path to meet the promise the President made, to meet the promise Senator Cornyn made, which is not make anything worse but taking the system as it is right now and making it better. We will only do that if we engage in a dialogue rather than trying to rush. That is what I encourage my colleagues to do.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

In Virginia, it is estimated that 36,000 cybersecurity jobs remain unfilled.  Beginning in 2001, DOD funded the Information Assurance Scholarship Program, IASP, vhich boosts the Nation's cyber workforce through scholarship and capacity-building grants to colleges and universities designated by the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security as Centers of Academic Excellence, Scholarship recipients are required to fulfill a service obligation by working in a cyber security position at DOD upon graduation.  According to a DOD report from February 2015, the IASP Program had employed 593 students and awarded 180 capacity-building grants to However, due to budget constraints, DOD reduced funding for the IASP beginning in 2013 and stopped recruiting new students. The IASP received its peak funding level of $7.5 million in 2005--for fiscal year 2017, it received $500,000.  Today, I am pleased to introduce with my colleague Senator Rounds, the DOD Cyber Scholarship Program Act of 2017. The DOD Cyber Scholarship Program Act of 2017 would reinvigorate the IASP to boost our Nation's cyber workforce. The bill would rename the IASP as the DOD Cyber Scholarship Program and express the Sense of Congress that the program is an important tool for boosting our cyber defense workforce.

Associate's degree programs could provide a valuable source of technical personnel, at a lower cost, to The bill would require that at least 5 percent of scholarship funds go to 2-year program students.  The DOD Cyber Scholarship Program Act would authorize the DOD Cyber Scholarship Program to receive $10 million in fiscal year 2018. At its peak in 2005, the IASP received $7.5 million. Since then, the cost of tuition has increased considerably and the need for skilled cyber professionals has never been greater. Ten million dollars is an appropriate funding level to reinvigorate the program, expand it to associate's degree recipients, and allow for manageable program execution from DOD and the National Security  The DOD Cyber Scholarship Program is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that would help students succeed in today's economy and strengthen our national security. There are good-paying jobs in Virginia and across the country in the cyber field that are going unfilled, and it is clear we must make it easier for students to access the programs that prepare them for these roles.

1006,topic-id,509,"Mr.President, the development of a skilled workforce is essential to maintaining a robust economy and driving forward innovation throughout society. Investments in education remain more important now than ever. Today the United States is 12th in the world in the percentage of 25- to 34-year-olds achieving post-high school degrees. We need to make changes that help keep students engaged in their futures while also ensuring our educational programs are adequately preparing students for the jobs of the 21st century. I firmly believe that a strong congressional commitment to strengthening career and technical education, CTE, throughout the country will help us achieve this goal.  Career and technical education programs provide students with a valuable educational experience that benefits them during high school and throughout their careers. Student participation in CTE programs is linked to greater levels of student engagement and higher graduation rates. The U.S.[[Page S1807]]Department of Education announced that the average U.high school graduation rate is 83 percent, while the graduation rate for students in CTE concentrations is higher than 90 percent. Eighty-one percent of high school dropouts say real-world learning opportunities would have kept them in school. CTE programs prepare students for fulfilling careers in a number of high-growth, skill-intensive industries including information technology; science, technology, engineering and math; human services; transportation; and architecture and construction, among others. Through a combination of academic enrichment and job-specific training, CTE programs are developing postsecondary and workforce-ready graduates equipped to meet the needs of employers in current and emerging industries.  The Carl Perkins Career and Technical Education Act is a major source of Federal support for the development of career and technical skills among secondary and postsecondary students. Last reauthorized in 2006, the Carl Perkins Career and Technical Education Act needs to be modernized to meet the demands of the 21st-century workforce and ensure that students have access to the highest-quality CTE programs.  This is why I am pleased to introduce with my colleagues, Senator Portman, Senator Baldwin, and Senator Young, the Educating Tomorrow's Workforce Act, which would amend the Carl Perkins Career and Technical Education Act to raise the quality of CTE programs. The bill allows States and localities to use Perkins grant funding to establish CTE-focused academies. The legislation defines what constitutes a rigorous CTE curriculum and requires Perkins grant recipients to incorporate key high-quality elements in their programs including credit-transfer opportunities; academic and technical skills assessments; training tools that align with today's industries; CTE-focused professional development for teachers, administrators, and counselors; and CTE curriculum alignment with local, regional, and State workforce demands. Additionally, the bill improves links between high school and postsecondary education to help ease attainment of an industry recognized credential, license, apprenticeship, or postsecondary certificate to obtain a job in a high-demand career field and promotes partnerships between local businesses and other community stakeholders to create pathways for students through work-based learning opportunities.  I am proud to introduce this commonsense, bipartisan legislation to raise quality and access to CTE programs so that students develop the skills they need to meet the needs of 21st-century employers.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-14-pt1-PgS1806-2.txt,2176,FAIRNESS IN CLASS ACTION LITIGATION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,14.0,March

The issue before us is far more basic than one's view on the Affordable Care I recognize that there is a philosophical difference about the Affordable Care Act: on our side of the aisle, we think it is good legislation; on the opposite side of the aisle, they have concerns.

Now, here is the irony: the Speaker of the House, the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin, made his entire career demanding that we know numbers behind legislation. That was his mantra in his time of service in the  You talk to Doug Elmendorf, who was the former Congressional Budget Office Director, and he said that the one thing he respected about the Speaker is that he would actually insist on the numbers, that he would want to know how much we are adding to a $20 trillion deficit. That is why it is incomprehensible to me that, in this Congress, under this Speaker, we would ever be asked to vote on legislation without knowing the financial impact of that legislation.  These are basic issues:  How much is the repeal legislation going to add to our deficit?  How much is it going to finance tax cuts for the wealthy?  How many people will it leave out of insurance or how many people would it add to insurance?  There just ought to be a transparent discussion.  Now, it is not just Democrats who want this transparent discussion; actually, a Republican, the gentleman from Ohio, a founder of the Freedom Caucus, has expressed similar concerns. He has expressed concerns that this repeal legislation will balloon the deficit and explode the deficit, and he wants to know the numbers.  We can have as much respectful disagreement about how to cover people and whether the Affordable Care Act is[[Page H1608]]a good piece of legislation or not, but what we should not be debating is the public's right to transparency. That is why I urge my colleagues to reject the previous question so that we can hold an immediate vote on requiring the Congressional Budget Office to score the repeal legislation and provide the American people with the basic financial costs of the legislation.                              {time}  1300  ",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgH1604-3.txt,2356,LAWSUIT ABUSE REDUCTION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,8.0,March

474,topic-id,634,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  My motion to recommit is quite simple. It exempts class action lawsuits that are brought to protect public water supplies.  I know some of you have heard me speak of this. I am from Flint, Michigan, and we know, in my community, what happens when we fail to protect drinking water.  In the course of the day, most Americans take for granted that water that comes from the tap is safe. But for my community of 100,000 people, that is not true. It hasn't been true for years. Since the State government switched to a corrosive water source, the Flint River, they have not been able to drink water out of the tap.  This terrible decision poisoned the city's water supply with corrosive water, resulting in high levels of lead leaching into their water system, going into their pipes, into their homes, into their bodies, 100,000 people, 7,000 children under the age of 6. Nearly 3 years later, those same families are still reeling from this crisis. It is unacceptable. It is an injustice.  Lead is a potent neurotoxin. There is no safe level of lead. Lead exposure can lead to serious health effects felt for years.  But the impacts are not limited just to health. Those high levels of lead also damaged Flint's infrastructure, and we now have to remove thousands of pipes in order to provide safe water.  Thankfully, this Congress, Democrats and Republicans, came together to provide necessary help for my hometown to fix those pipes. But Flint residents will continue to suffer. That was important, but not enough. There are lots of health effects.  Just recently we learned that many cases, in fact, many deaths that we thought were attributable to pneumonia, were, in fact, Legionnaires' disease, traceable to the bacteria caused by this terrible crisis. A dozen people have already died as a result of Legionnaires' disease, and others, whose deaths may be reclassified, could bring that number much higher.  The corrosiveness of that water not only had health impacts, but it literally destroyed people's homes from the inside out. So, in addition to those service lines, people's plumbing in their homes, their water heaters, their washing machines destroyed, ruined, and their lives potentially ruined as well.  So where does the support, where does the funding come for those losses experienced by residents of my hometown?  It comes from the justice system. This bill would create more barriers for people in my hometown to access that justice system, to seek justice for what happened to them. They have suffered a terrible crisis, and they should be able to seek justice and restitution.  Unfortunately, this bill could prevent people from Flint, and other Americans, from seeking justice, and that is what my motion intends to correct.  In order to receive justice from the harm that they have experienced from this public water source, residents have filed class action suits. This bill severely curtails their access to the courts to seek redress, to seek that restitution. This bill would weaken their access to justice.  My motion is simple. It would allow lawsuits that are brought to protect our precious public water supplies to be exempt from the additional hurdles, from the additional barriers that this underlying bill sets out.  Having safe drinking water is a human right, and the access to that and the access to justice related to that basic human right ought to be completely unfettered. My motion to recommit would assure that, and I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this motion.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

222,topic-id,1641,"Madam President, I rise to address the bill that has been recently--and I emphasize the word ``recently''--introduced in the House of I believe it was introduced It is having not a hearing but a markup today, and may be on the House floor as soon as tomorrow or early next week.  As the President said recently, healthcare is complicated. To me, to introduce a bill that was not available to any Members of Congress before Monday, mark it up in committee 2 days later, attempt to pass it on the floor of the House, and then I understand it may come directly to the floor of the Senate without any committee consideration, it just seems to me is a disservice to the process and a disservice to the traditions and practices of this institution.  This is complicated. It is difficult. The ramifications and implications of this bill, just as any other major change in our healthcare system, are incredibly important. This is not about ideology. This is about people. This is about the impact on people. I want to talk about the impact of this bill, as we have thus far been able to assess it, on the people of When I look at a piece of legislation down here, I start with How will it affect the people who live along our coast or inland, in the small towns, and particularly people who are above the age of 50?  Maine happens to be the oldest State in the country. Therefore, anything which negatively impacts seniors doubly negatively impacts the people of my I feel this bill is a disaster for seniors. I define seniors in this case as anybody over 50 because it does several things. One of the things it does, and there should be a great deal of discussion about this, under the Affordable Care Act, which recognizes the fact that seniors and people who are older tend to have more medical needs than those who are younger, it caps differential at three times. In other words, a senior can only pay three times what a younger person pays, and even that is burdensome in many cases.  This bill changes three to five. It will be a very substantial increase in the payments and the costs of insurance and healthcare to senior citizens. Now, the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is, I find, the most nonpartisan and informative source of information on all of these issues, has created a handy tool on their website, where you can put in information, such as family income and age, and determine what you would have paid under the Affordable Care Act and what you would pay under this new bill.  What they found was--I wanted to look and see what somebody in my State will pay. If you are a 60-year-old in Aroostook County Maine with an income of $30,000, the subsidy--the support for the premium for individual insurance--would fall by 70 percent. The support for your insurance policy under the Affordable Care Act would fall by 70 percent.  Throughout our State, the average decrease would be 48 percent--almost half. So we are talking not about some theoretical, ideological, political thing here, we are talking about people's ability to afford health insurance. It is about as clear as it could be. That is why it is frustrating to me that we collectively--the Congress--are going to be asked to consider this bill with literally no hearings, no input from the public, no discussion of how all the pieces fit together or don't fit together. Yet we are going to be asked--I believe, my understanding is, we are going to be asked to vote on this bill sometime on the floor of the Senate, without any committee consideration, in the next week or so.  This is too important to people's lives to give it such short shrift. It is just not right to make changes of this magnitude that are so vital to people's well-being and literally their health and their survival in some cases. It is unthinkable to me that we would do this without a round of hearings and discussions and the regular order that we supposedly honor around here as to how major legislation is to come to the floor.  I received a letter just recently: ``Hi, Angus.''  I like it when my correspondents say ``Hi, Angus'' instead of ``Senator.''       Hi, Angus [he says]. I have worked in the pulp and paper      industry for close to 30 years. It was a good industry up      here, supported middle-class families in northern But      we have had layoffs and closures of our mills. After every      closure, I had to obtain health insurance for my family on my      own. Before ObamaCare, this was a disaster. I could only      obtain catastrophic insurance from one of two providers.      There was no way I could pay $1,500 a month for a decent      plan. After ObamaCare, I could obtain decent insurance at a      decent price. While there may have been problems for some, it      was a godsend for my family. Please help ensure we don't go      back to the old days. We are self-employed by our small      business and would not be able to pay more for less.  That is what the bill that is in the House would do, pay more for less. By the way, how does the money work in this bill? Well, one of the things the bill does is, my understanding, and, again, I am only operating on what we have seen in the last 24 hours because of no hearings, but one of the things it does is eliminate a tax on people who make over $250,000 a year in order to cut coverage for people who are not making that kind of money.  It is a tax cut, and shifting the cost to our citizens, particularly our seniors. The pattern is, shift and shaft. Shift the cost, and shaft the people who need the coverage. This is supposed to be a substitute. It is supposed to be coverage for everyone. You have to be careful. When people talk about access, they are talking about: Yes, you can buy it, but if you can't afford it, that is not really access. This bill dramatically decreases the support for health insurance premiums through the Affordable Care  The reality is, and I hear a lot of talk about how ObamaCare is collapsing. It isn't. More people signed up this year than last year. Yes, it is true the rates went up, but that was because younger people were not signing up in significant numbers. We need to deal with that issue because that makes the risk pool older and sicker and therefore more expensive.  I have been told by insurance officials that if something like this bill that is in the House passes and the subsidies disappear and the Affordable Care Act goes away, the private health insurance market for individuals, the so-called individual market, will essentially collapse. The reality is, the uninsured population of this country has fallen virtually in half since the passage of the Affordable Care Twenty-two million people have coverage now who did not before and we can take it away.  The other piece I don't like about this bill is it phases things out so the impact will not be felt until after the next election or sometime in the future. Well, the future comes. In this case, the future is going to be pretty desolate for people who have health insurance now and are not going to have it 2, 4, or 6 years from now. It is just not right.  I am one who has been saying, since I entered this body now 4-plus years ago, that there are problems with the Affordable Care We should be working on those problems. We should be working on repairing it, not destroying it. We should not be talking about taking healthcare coverage away from people in this country.  I am sure I and many others will be addressing more comprehensively the provisions of this bill as it becomes more clear, even though we are going to have to ferret those provisions out because we are not going to have the benefit of expert testimony and views from a variety of points of view of how this is actually going to work.  The reality is, I don't think there is much question that this proposal will hammer Maine and my people. I can't stand for that. I hope the House will have a more vigorous process, they will understand what the implications are, and take a more judicious approach so we are not tearing insurance out from under people, we are not going to make the cost be driven up, we are not giving a tax break to people who make over $250,000 a year, and at the same time taking coverage away from people who make $30,000 a year.  That is wrong. We should be repairing, not repealing. I think this bill is not the right place to start. I stand for the people of I stand for the people who are going to be harmed by this, whether they are seniors or working people or self-employed people or people who have been able to start businesses because they could get, for the first time, insurance under the Affordable Care  I believe that is our obligation.

This bill would force local governments to raise property taxes or deny health care.  We need healthcare solutions that improve care and strengthen our economy at the same time.

58,topic-id,700,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the rule for H.1301, which will fund our national defense for fiscal year 2017. This bill is a vital first step as we begin to work on rebuilding our military. The best way to look at defense spending over time is as a percentage of U.gross domestic product.  Since World War II, we have spent an average of 5 percent of our GDP on defense during peacetime. Despite a world that has gotten more dangerous, the defense drawdown in recent years cut defense spending from 5 percent of GDP to 3 percent of And in a $17 trillion economy, that is real money.  Meanwhile, since Vietnam, we have spent an average of 21 percent of the Federal budget on defense. Today, we spend well below that, about 15 percent of the overall budget.  Things are so bad today--and I don't have time in 2 minutes to go into all the details--that we are actually at risk of losing more American lives than we should in the event of another war.  The next step is to pass a robust defense supplemental and then to fund defense for fiscal year 2018 at a minimum level of $640 billion. Anything less will not keep Americans safe and will not allow us to rebuild our military as we desperately must do.  Congress must deal with sequestration. Trying to fund defense at BCA levels is like trying to put a size 10 foot into a size 7 shoe. It simply doesn't work and it is dangerous for our own security and it is dangerous for the world.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to say to my colleagues on the other side: I know you don't like me talking about health care. If I were you, I wouldn't want to talk about health care either. This is a serious matter, and it is a matter of security for millions and millions of Americans in our country.  Again, maybe somebody over there can tell me: How much is this new TrumpCare bill going to cost? How much is it going to add to the deficit? How much are the American taxpayers going to have to pay for it? Does anyone know how many people will lose their coverage? Hello?  I guess I would ask the questions: Why do we have over 200 employees at the Congressional Budget Office, who we pay $50 million a year to be able to give us these estimates, if we are not going to utilize them? Why are we doing this?  It seems to me that before we do something that could harm millions of people in this country, before we could do something that could result in an increase in our deficit, why don't we ask the experts? And we all acknowledge that they are experts and we pay them lots of money. Why don't we get their advice?  This whole process seems backwards. You ought not to be marking up bills when you don't know what their impact is going to be.  Part of our job as Members of Congress, in addition to holding hearings and listening to experts and listening to citizens tell us their perspective--which, again, has been totally ignored in this process of the repeal of the healthcare bill--is also to make sure that when we are voting, we know what the impact is going to be, we know whether or not it is going to have a positive impact or whether it is going to have a negative impact.  Again, one of the reasons why I want to defeat the previous question is so that we can vote in a, hopefully, bipartisan way to get a CBO score so we know what is what.  I get it. I know my colleagues don't want to talk about health care. They would rather talk about something we should have done months ago. That is what we are doing now, we are doing old work now. This should have been done 4 or 5 months ago. I am just baffled why you don't want to do your job.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

294,topic-id,1090,"Mr.President, in December of 2015, President Obama signed the Every Student Succeeds Act after it passed this body with overwhelming bipartisan support--85 of 100 Senators supported the bill. The Wall Street Journal called the Every Student Succeeds Act ``the largest devolution of federal control to the states in a quarter-century.'' It also had the support of Governors, State legislators, chief State school officers, school district superintendents, local school boards, principals, and teachers unions, who all agreed on the need to replace No Child Left  The core of the education reform in the Every Student Succeeds Act was to restore local control to the States--not just control for them but that they would have the responsibility and the authority for things such as school accountability, teacher evaluation, student evaluation. It is very clear. In fact, the Every Student Succeeds Act says things very specifically. States are solely responsible for choosing which standards to adopt. The Secretary cannot mandate, direct, or control State standards. The Secretary of Education cannot require, coerce, or incentivize States to adopt common core State standards. States are responsible for choosing which assessments to adopt. The Secretary of Education cannot mandate, direct, or control State assessments for education. States design their own system for holding schools accountable and decide which schools to identify for school intervention and support. The Secretary cannot add new requirements or criteria on State accountability systems that are not in the law. States and local school districts decide what strategies they will implement to help fix identified schools without Federal interference. The Secretary of Education cannot prescribe how States and local school districts improve those schools.  Congress passed that clear education law to take power out of Washington, DC, and from the Department of Education and the Secretary of Education and hand it back to the  Five months after the bill was signed, the Obama administration changed their mind and released regulations to take back school decisionmaking and accountability, in direct violation of the law.  Eighty-five of one hundred of us agreed that our passion is for every school district, every parent, every State to take care of every child; that no child would be left behind by switching to local control rather than Federal centralized control. But when this new rule was put out by the Obama administration, they reinterpreted that clear law. Let me tell you what they said in the rule.  In the rule, they dictate to States the consequences for schools that don't annually test at least 95 percent of their students.  They prescribe to the States and school districts how they would intervene and improve schools that don't exit from this identification process of being an underperforming school.  They limit how States may measure school quality or student success based on 4-year graduation rates.  They define how much weight States must afford to non-test-based indicators in their accountability systems.  This regulation prescribes the long-term goals and measurements of progress that States would use for their student subgroups.  This new regulation prescribes when schools may exit from comprehensive support based on improvement.  This new regulation mandates that States comply with specific Washington, DC, created requirements instead of letting the school districts or the States determine how best to proceed on those requirements.  This new regulation limits how States award school improvement funding to school districts and schools.  This new regulation adds a new and burdensome reporting requirement every 4 years on States and local school districts that will drive up compliance costs and will divert resources away from students in the classrooms, in direct violation of what we passed.  This new regulation requires States to establish a statewide definition for ``infective teacher,'' requiring a statewide system of evaluation controlled by  This new regulation limits how students are scored when they have exited from special education.  This new regulation controls how the school report cards are created and how long they are.  This is what we were exiting from with No Child Left We said in that vote for Every Student Succeeds that Washington, DC, should not do this. This rule directly violated the spirit and the letter of the law and will put the new Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, in charge of school evaluation, teacher evaluation, and student success. That is not her role or the intent of this law when we passed it, regardless of who is the Secretary of Our intent was to provide maximum flexibility for the States and the parents. The rule is central control from Washington,  It is essential that we stop this rule right now. While some of my colleagues have said: Let's just wait, and we will do regulations, and we will unwind some of this--they are basically admitting that the Trump administration will fix the Obama administration overreach. I understand that statement. I think there will be some unwinding of regulations, but here is why it must be done right now--two reasons. One is, when we do this right now with a Congressional Review Act, we settle this forever, that no administration ever, as long as this law is in place, can repromulgate a rule and turn right back around and say Washington, DC, is going to control teacher evaluation, student success evaluation, and school evaluation. This ends that forever.  The second thing is, right now schools in Oklahoma have already diverted resources in their administration, and they are filling out forms that are due to Washington, DC, in April to fulfill this new requirement that was put down by the administration. If we don't end this now, the districts in Oklahoma and in all of the States represented by this great Senate--their administrators will be working on forms for Washington, DC, rather than educating children at home. Let's get those folks back in the classroom, working on things that matter, not some form that no one in Washington, DC, will read anyway. Why don't we allow our schools to focus on educating kids instead of filling out forms for the Secretary of Education? That is the reason we passed the Every Student Succeeds  I encourage this body to support H.57 when it comes up.

867,topic-id,2779,"Mr.President, there are a couple of issues that I will speak on, but I was asked earlier this morning about what President Trump has tweeted, basically charging former President Obama with having spied on him in a way that would be plainly illegal. Of course, President Obama's advisers have denied any such thing happened. If it did happen, of course, it would be a grave constitutional issue, and if such a thing did happen, it would be criminal conduct. Now, many people are saying: Well, is it true or not? Was Mr.Trump telling the truth in the tweet or not? There is a very simple response on this. There is one person who knows whether it is true or not, and he has been totally silent on this.  They asked Attorney General Attorney General Sessions made it very clear in his confirmation hearing--well, he said a number of things in his confirmation hearing, but one was, of course, that he would be independent. President Trump has leveled very serious charges against former President I happen to feel the charges are false, but let's have a definitive voice. The Attorney General should have the courage and independence to simply say whether Mr.Trump is telling the truth or not. It is a very simple matter. I would hope that the press and everybody else would keep asking because eventually somebody has to answer that question, and the Attorney General can.                      Nomination of David Friedman  Mr.President, the Senate will soon consider the nomination of David Friedman to be U.Ambassador to Unlike several of President Trump's other nominees, we know a great deal about Mr.Friedman's views on the challenges he would confront if he were confirmed. Unfortunately, this is because he has made a career of disparaging and inflammatory statements about U.policy in the Middle East, about former U.officials, about the Palestinians, even about American Jews who have views that differ from his own.  We have all had the opportunity to read articles Mr.Friedman has written. We have heard the outrageous, unfounded verbal attacks he has launched against those who disagree with him. He has written falsely that President Obama and Secretary Kerry engaged in ``blatant anti-Semitism,'' that the liberal American Jews are ``far worse than kapos,'' and that they ``suffer a cognitive disconnect in identifying good and evil,'' that the State Department has a ``hundred-year history of anti-Semitism,'' because diplomats appointed by both Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents have not always seen eye-to-eye on every issue with Israel's leaders. He has said that Israel's policy of ``criticizing disloyal Arab citizens while simultaneously bestowing upon them the benefits of citizenship simply isn't working.''  Well, those comments alone should disqualify him for this sensitive position, and it is no surprise that tens of thousands of Americans have signed petitions circulated by pro-Israel groups opposing his nomination.  Mr.Friedman has also raised millions of dollars for Israeli settlers, and he has bragged about the effort to remove the two-state solution from the Republican Party's platform, even though Democratic and Republican Presidents have supported it. Regarding the two-state solution, he wrote: ``It is more of an illusion that serves the worst intentions of both the United States and the Palestinian Arabs,'' in one of the many articles he has written for a rightwing Israeli media outlet. That unequivocal renunciation of longstanding U.policy should also by itself disqualify him from the job of Ambassador to  These statements and actions not only indicate his rejection of decades of Republican and Democratic policy. They are the words of someone who makes a mockery of the term ``diplomat'' and who has demonstrated no ability to be objective and constructive on sensitive issues of immense importance to U.security.  Our diplomats are supposed to be representing the American people and the policies of the United States first and foremost. They are not sent to a foreign country to represent the government or people of that country in a[[Page S1757]]manner that is inconsistent with U.policies and U.interests. They are there to represent us.  Mr.Friedman is certainly entitled to his own views as a private citizen, even if they are offensive and counter to U.interests and values. But can anyone honestly say that this nominee is qualified or suited to represent the American people in Israel?  Five former U.Ambassadors to Israel who served under Republican and Democratic Presidents--from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama--are among the thousands of Americans who say that the answer to that questions is no.  We are being asked to reconcile Mr.Friedman's record, his personal views, and his deep ties to extreme factions in Israel with his responsibility to objectively advance and defend U.interests. Unless one believes, as he has repeatedly made clear he does, that the interests of the United States are always identical to Israel's, there is no way Mr.Friedman should be confirmed.  For as long as I have been in the Senate--and I note that is longer than anybody who is serving here now--I cannot recall a time when we were not at a critical point in our relations with Israel, not because of doubts about the enduring value of the relationship but as a reflection of the importance of the deep partnership between our governments and our people--a deep partnership that we have all supported and that Republican and Democratic Presidents have supported. Most importantly, it is a result of our conviction that security, stability, and prosperity in Israel and the wider region are important to our own national security.  That is why President Obama signed a memorandum of understanding with Israel that included the single largest pledge of U.military aid to any country--to any country anywhere in the world, ever--and why both Democratic and Republican administrations have put so much effort into pursuing peace between Israelis and  An alliance as longstanding as ours with Israel, which has far-reaching consequences for the entire Middle East and beyond, requires effective daily management by an experienced diplomat who has not only knowledge of the region but the necessary temperament and appreciation of our country's short- and long-term interests.  I was here when President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin negotiated what was a very difficult peace agreement between the two of them, with both of them putting the interests of the region first. That agreement has lasted. I also remember when Prime Minister Rabin and King Hussein of Jordan--who had fought against each other--personally negotiated a peace agreement, and the United States strongly supported that. In fact, I was privileged to be there when they signed the agreement at Aqaba, as I was present when Prime Minister Begin and President Sadat signed their agreement.  I do not see how anyone could conclude that Mr.Friedman possesses the requisite temperament, nor am I convinced that he appreciates the critical distinction between the interests of our country, the United States, and the parochial interests of an extreme constituency in Israel who he has fiercely advocated for over the course of his long career.  Indeed, it is telling that the spokesman for Beit El, the Israeli settlement that Mr.Friedman has supported financially for years, said its inhabitants would regard him as their representative in the United These are Their representative in the United States is the Israeli It is not the role of a U.Ambassador to represent another country, but that is how Mr.Friedman is perceived in Israel because that is the way he has behaved.  Every U.President has understood the importance and the heightened sensitivity of this post, and they chose their nominees accordingly--both Republican and Democratic Presidents--until now. That is why every previous nominee to be Ambassador to Israel has been confirmed by a voice vote or by unanimous consent, while Mr.Friedman was voted out by a narrow 12 to 9--largely party line vote--in the Foreign Relations  Mr.Friedman's confirmation hearing provided him the opportunity to assuage concerns about his divisiveness, including the many disparaging remarks he has made and his close identification with and support for the Israeli settler movement.  During the hearing he renounced his undiplomatic language, suggesting it was delivered in the heat of the election cycle and in his capacity as a private citizen. In fact, he recanted so much of what he had said--which far predates the election cycle--that Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Corker asked why he was willing to disavow so much of his past record in order to earn the committee's support.  In response, Mr.Friedman described the role of the U.Ambassador to Israel as ``the fulfillment of a life's dream, of a life's work, of a life of study of the people, the culture, the politics of Israeli society.''  I would say two things about that. One, I recall a nominee for another position who, when asked questions about extreme positions he had taken for years, started disavowing them all, and I finally asked him: Are you having a confirmation conversion? That nominee--the nominee of a Republican President--when he came before the Senate, was defeated because of Republican votes, as well as Democratic votes.  I always worry about a confirmation conversion. When a nominee rejects years and years of deeply held beliefs during those 2 or 3 days of the confirmation hearing, I wonder how long it will last.  There is an important distinction between knowing and respecting a country's history and people and believing that one's own personal ambition and that country's interests are inextricably linked. Mr.Friedman's remarkable confirmation conversion falls far short of convincing evidence that changing his title to ``Ambassador'' will cause him to divorce his life's work and objectively serve the national interests of the United  If Mr.Friedman is confirmed, he should immediately untangle his business and personal interests in Israel and commit to being the representative of all Americans--conservative and liberal Jews, conservative and liberal non-Jews--and being a genuine partner in efforts to promote security and stability for Israelis and Palestinians alike, not just because it is in their interests, but because it is in the interest of the United  We all want what is best for the American people. We also share a desire to find a viable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that protects the rights and security of both peoples. Neither goal can be achieved by pursuing policies that further inflame tensions in the region and erode the role of the United States as an honest broker for peace. There are a large number of qualified Americans from both parties who could capably support that role. Mr.Friedman is not among them.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, on another matter, this week is Sunshine It is a time when we rededicate ourselves to transparency in government. It is important to all of us. We celebrate one of our Nation's most defining characteristics: that a government of, for, and by the people does not operate in secret. Our democracy depends on an informed public, and it is critical that public officials be truthful with the American people; yet we are not even 2 months into this Presidency, and it is clear that the administration is not meeting that standard.  The Attorney General has yet to come forward and tell us whether the President was telling the truth when he accused President Obama of breaking the law and spying on him, and the President's nominees have shown a real and stunning indifference to the truth. His nominees to lead the Treasury Department, the EPA, HHS, and the Justice Department have all misled Congress while testifying under oath.  I am disturbed that Senate Republicans continue to look the other way. At some point, they must put country over party. But as these new officials take control of their agencies, I remind them that our laws demand an open and transparent government. Last year, Congress took a strong step to reaffirm our commitment to an open government. We passed the FOIA Improvement Act, which is a bipartisan bill. I coauthored it with the deputy Republican leader, Senator Cornyn of It was the most significant reform to the Freedom of Information Act in[[Page S1758]]over 50 years. It codified the ``presumption of openness.'' It put the force of law behind the notion that sunshine, not secrecy, is the default setting of our government. Given what we have seen thus far from this administration's nominees, transparency, accountability, and open government are more important than ever.  I hope next week, when the President's Supreme Court nominee will appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he provides transparent, truthful answers to Senators' questions.  I will insist on real answers from Judge Neil Gorsuch because there are real concerns about his record and his judicial philosophy. Judge Gorsuch went to some of the world's best universities--Columbia, Harvard, Oxford--so it is not surprising that he knows how to make a good impression, but that cannot be the standard for a Supreme Court nominee. The U.Senate cannot simply rubberstamp a nominee because he went to the right schools and looks good on  Neil Gorsuch has been a judge for over 10 years, and it is clear from his writings on and off the bench that he has a well-developed judicial philosophy. He appears to strongly identify as an originalist, in the mold of Justice Scalia or Justice It has been more than 25 years since an originalist was nominated to the Supreme Court, so I expect that Senators will want to understand how Judge Gorsuch would apply his philosophy to the cases that would come before him, if he is confirmed to the Supreme Would he rule in the same way as originalists like Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Judge Bork, who have been deeply hostile to the individual rights and liberties protected by our Constitution? I want to hear directly from him on this important question.  It is one thing for legal academics to debate their preferred theories, including originalism. But the Supreme Court is not a debating society that deals in abstractions--its decisions affect every one of us. Our Federal courts are where Americans go to have their rights vindicated, whether against big corporations or the government itself. Our Federal courts do not exist so that judges have a place to propound their particular philosophies.  I want to make sure that Judge Gorsuch understands that distinction, and I want to understand just how his philosophy would have been applied to important cases. For example, how would someone with his philosophy have ruled in cases upholding fundamental rights, such as Miranda rights, a woman's right to make her own medical decisions, and marriage equality?  We also cannot ignore the fact that Judge Gorsuch was nominated by President Trump only after being vetted by extreme interest groups who did all of that in secret. They are certainly not transparent. It is alarming and unprecedented for a President to outsource the nomination process in this way. The President's top adviser then assured attendees at a conservative conference that they knew Judge Gorsuch has ``the vision of Donald Trump.'' That is the same Donald Trump, of course, who called the media the ``enemy of the American people.'' The President could not be more wrong.  As we note during Sunshine Week, our Constitution provides for the freedom of the press because a democracy cannot survive without it. Citing James Madison, the Supreme Court in New York Times v. Sullivan described the ``public discussion of the stewardship of public officials'' as ``a fundamental principle of the American form of government.''  It was Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, a staunch believer in open government, who famously said that sunlight is the best disinfectant. It is often the press that shines the sunlight in dark corners where we need it most. It serves as a critical check on our government. It shines a light on corruption, exploitation, and excess. My parents owned a weekly newspaper before they started their printing business. I was brought up to believe in the importance of the First I question whether a Justice with ``the vision of Donald Trump'' would uphold the freedom of the press.  Sunshine Week's emphasis on transparency will not be just this week; it should continue into the hearings next week. The Supreme Court has been the least transparent part of our government, and these hearings will be one of the only opportunities for the American people to get a glimpse into the institution that protects their most essential rights. There are real questions about the kind of Justice Neil Gorsuch would be. He needs to answer them openly and honestly, not with the kinds of dodges and misrepresentations we have heard from other Trump nominees.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The voices raised in opposition to these executive orders cross the spectrum. I want to include in the Record some of those voices: students at Rutland High School, some of whom have formed the New Neighbors Club, to help welcome refugee students who will attend Rutland City Public  Emma writes: ``I am a 9th grader from Rutland High We should continue to support immigration in Vermont and the United These people deserve a good life and don't deserve what they have to go through.''  Carolyn writes: ``I'm from Rutland, Vermont, and I believe that refugee resettlement is an important issue. We have the opportunity to make a change in these people's lives and make new relationships and bonds in our lives. They need a support system so why can't that be us?''  Lea writes: ``This immigration ban is a big problem to me. I don't like that our country is stopping people from coming to our country. I know many people are afraid of what could happen to us. But we are all human and they are humans looking for safety.''  Lily writes, ``Everyone deserves the same amount of respect and understanding that we afford to anyone. The refugees obviously need our help and we are completely capable of building a community that is ready and willing to accept the refugees.''  Jessica writes: ``I can understand these fears, but they also clearly come from an inhumane and misinformed point of view. Without immigration in the past, no one would be here, and it is simply un-American to deny freedom from persecution to refugees and other immigrants.''  Emma writes: ``With all of the recent stigma regarding the Refugee Resettlement Plan, Rutland's program has recently gone static. At Rutland High School, we have a club that helps raise money and eventually welcome the refugees. Please make all the movement possible to make these people feel welcome in our state. We don't want to be stuck on the wrong side of history.''  Victoria writes: ``I feel that it is incredibly important for us to help refugees who are in desperate need of a second chance at life. As a global superpower of a country, it seems absurd to me that we are accepting so few refugees to our communities, as we could be helping with the global refugee crisis a whole lot more by actually trying to mitigate it.''  Ian writes: ``The refugees should come to Rutland because we are devoted to helping integrate them into our community. Several of the students here are devoting every Friday to getting together and coming up with great ideas on how we can incorporate them.''  Kjersti writes: ``As a citizen in the United States, I believe the diversity is what makes this country beautiful, and the fact that someone is exempt from the freedom and is turned away because of their diversity is not what this country stands for.''  Noah writes: ``I believe we should let people immigrate to Vermont because the people in these countries are living in terrible living conditions. Everyone in this world is equal so there's no reason not to let them in. They just want a chance at a safe life.''  Ashleah writes: ``We should continue to support immigration for the Syrian refugees into our community. This is such a great opportunity for Rutland to experience more diversity and more culture. Our small city would benefit greatly from allowing refugees to come and live with us.''  Kelsey writes: ``People who are safe and living comfortably should do their best to help those that need it. I feel by turning them away and denying them help we are being inhuman and cruel.''  Caitlin writes: ``I believe immigration should be accepted in all areas of this country. I strongly support the idea of people wanting to make a better life for themselves. I choose to take a stand against anti-immigration for I believe it is essential to make America better.''  Greta writes: ``These Syrians are people who have gone through atrocities and deserve our help. They will also promote understanding and diversity in our community amidst this political climate of fear mongering. Welcoming Syrian refugees will only be beneficial for Rutland and United States, and is upholding the value of America and human rights.''[[Page S1775]]  And Elizabeth writes: ``I am disappointed with how our current administration is portraying our nation to the rest of the world. I think the people of the United States are stronger, more loving, and kinder people than what is being shown, and I think we need to take individual action in order to show this.''  The voices of these young Vermonters are emblematic of what I hear from Vermonters across our We all want to keep our country safe; of that, there is no question. But President Trump's travel ban ignores the clear fact that refugees are the most stringently vetted travelers to the United His Executive order provokes and plays on fear. It does not make us safer.  Benjamin Franklin once famously said, ``Those who give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.'' I hope all Senators will listen to the words of these young President Trump's Executive order does little to enhance our security, but does great damage to the freedoms that are the cornerstone of our good and great                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-13-pt1-PgS1774-2.txt,1383,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,13.0,March

127,topic-id,323,"Mr.Speaker, first, let me thank Mr.Visclosky for yielding. I also thank him for his tremendous leadership as our ranking member, and giving us all an opportunity to really voice our opinions and put our points of view forward in a very fair way.  I rise in opposition to this bill, however.  I offered two amendments to this bill, the fiscal year 2017 Defense Appropriations bill, and I am really disappointed to once again see that my amendments were not made in order. I want to explain these two amendments because this is the only chance that we will have to talk about this.  The first amendment, which I have offered several times on a bipartisan basis, would prohibit the funding for the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, the AUMF, beginning on September 30, 2017. And mind you, that 6-month window provides Congress ample opportunity to draft and debate a new AUMF and to vote it up or down.  Clearly, Congress is required to act. This amendment would require Congress to finally debate and vote on nearly a 3-year-long war that is raging in the Middle East, a war that has already claimed the lives of several brave servicemembers. The House simply cannot continue to abdicate its constitutional responsibility to give the American people a voice in matters of war and peace.  I offered another amendment, which would prohibit funding for United States combat troops in  Mr.Speaker, this amendment was really simple, but, once again, I am sad to say that it was not made in order. This amendment would use the power of the purse to prevent funding for combat operations in Syria, unless the purpose is to rescue or protect members of the Armed Forces from danger.  We can all agree that ISIL must be degraded and dismantled, but Congress continues to be missing in action from this debate.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

129,topic-id,186,"We know that the 2001 authorization was specific to 9/11. And I voted against it because I knew it would be broadly interpreted, which it has been. Sadly, it is a blank check for war. Actually, the Congressional Research Service provided us a declassified report saying--and this was last year--it had been used over 35 times. Nothing related to 9/11. So this blank check needs to be repealed.  We also know that ISIL didn't even exist in 2001. Every day, more bombs fall and the battlefield expands. We have already spent billions of dollars against this unauthorized war.  Congress needs to show up for work, muster its courage, exercise its constitutional responsibility for debate, and vote on the ongoing war in Iraq and We owe nothing less to our brave men and women who are in harm's way.

961,topic-id,1034,"I thank Senator The Senator's question really cuts to the heart of the issue. It cuts to the heart of the very reasons why we have an independent judiciary and exactly why it is that our system of government that operates under the U.Constitution depends so critically on individuals just like Judge It depends on people like Judge Gorsuch sitting on the Federal bench.  There are, I believe, two fundamental differences between the judiciary on the one hand and the two political branches on the other hand; that is, the two branches in which people serve after being elected to office, meaning the legislative branch where we work, and the executive branch headed by the  First, the legislative and executive powers sweep far more broadly than does the judicial power. Article I enumerates a list of lawmaking powers that are granted to Congress, and article II vests executive power in the By comparison, the judiciary's power is far more circumscribed. It is far more limited.  The judiciary has the power to decide only a limited and defined set of disputes--those that qualify as cases and controversies under article III of the To be clear, in the context of deciding a particular case, the judiciary has the power to invalidate an act put in place by the elected branches of government--the power to say what the law is, as Chief Justice John Marshall explained it in the landmark case Marbury v.  But that power is limited. It is limited, among other things, by article III of the Constitution and by jurisdictional requirements like standing and mootness and ripeness as explained in greater detail by Supreme Court precedent.  The judiciary's authority to say what the law is points to the second major difference between the courts on the one hand and the political branches on the other. While the function of the judiciary is an exercise in reasoned judgment, the functions of the executive and legislative branches are exercises of power.  There are many ways in which the Constitution and the political theory underlying it limit the exercise of that power. The Constitution protects minority rights, and it conditions the exercise of legislative or executive power on winning elections, and that, in turn, means winning the trust of the American people--of the voters throughout the country.  These twin ideas--the consent of the governed and the protection of minority rights within an essentially majority-rule system--are pillars of our constitutional order. But make no mistake, coercion underlies the laws that we make in this body and their enforcement by the executive branch.  By contrast, the judicial function is ultimately an exercise in reasoned judgment. As Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 78: ``neither Force nor Will, but merely judgment'' are exercised by the judiciary. This is the essential difference between the judiciary and the other branches: The judiciary exercises judgment while all the rest of us exercise will.  The Framers, of course, understood this well. And as Hamilton continued in his explanation of Federalist 78:       Courts must declare the sense of the law, and if they      should be disposed to exercise Will instead of Judgment, the      consequence would equally be the substitution of their      pleasure to that of the legislative body. The observation, if      it proves anything, would prove that there ought to be no      judges distinct from that body.  Put another way, a judge who chooses to exercise will instead of judgment is no longer acting as a judge. That person is instead functioning essentially as a superlegislator.  It should be clear to all fair-minded people that Judge Gorsuch is someone--and has established himself as someone--who understands these distinctive features of the Federal judiciary. When you read his opinions, you see that his only agenda is to understand the governing law and then to apply that law to the set of facts in the case before him.  As we will see next week during his confirmation hearings, his opinions carefully analyze the statutes and applicable precedents to determine the outcome of each and every case. In some cases, that means Judge Gorsuch reaches results that Senator Gorsuch or President Gorsuch or King Gorsuch probably wouldn't choose, were he deciding cases in any of those capacities. But Judge Gorsuch understands, of course, that he is a judge and not a king and not a President, not a Senator, not a Congressman, and he understands that this means his only job is to adjudicate cases based on the law according to the facts before him. As he said the night he was nominated: ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge--stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.''  When you examine his record, you see that one of the defining characteristics of Judge Gorsuch is his independence--his judicial independence. That is distinctively the hallmark of a good judge. You see that he decides cases based on the law, not based on the parties before him and not based on his own political or ideological preferences.  In the coming weeks, some of our colleagues may try to argue that Judge Gorsuch hasn't done enough to prove his independence since being nominated to the Supreme If this criticism is raised against him, it will be a weak one. It will be one that doesn't apply here. The fact is that Judge Gorsuch has spent his entire career as a judge, and as a lawyer before that, proving his independence.  To his would-be critics, I would say, read and analyze his opinions. They speak for him. They speak for themselves. They speak for the rule of law. Study his approach to judging. Listen to what he says about judicial independence and, just as importantly, look at his actions. His actions prove his independence.  I have done these things. I have examined Judge Gorsuch's record. And on that basis, I am confident that he will not hesitate to apply the law appropriately in every case. There is absolutely no reason--no reason that I can find anywhere in his record--to prove otherwise.  I think I have only scratched the surface here today. I look forward to hearing Judge Gorsuch's testimony before the Judiciary Committee next week.  ",CREC-2017-03-14-pt1-PgS1784-3.txt,1501,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2017.0,14.0,March

782,topic-id,669,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  As has been amply discussed, the mandatory sanctions and fees in this bill would have a chilling effect on cutting-edge litigation. One type of cutting-edge litigation to suffer would be citizen lawsuits seeking enforcement of the foreign Emoluments The amendment proposed in this motion would exempt civil actions that implicate foreign emoluments.  Article I, section 9, clause 8 of the Constitution says: ``No person holding any office of profit or trust . . . shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.''  Why did the Founding Fathers write this? Concern that foreign governments might try to control They wanted to make sure that nothing--no gifts, no payments, no advantages of any kind--could be received by officers of the United States, including the President, unless Congress approved it. They wanted to make sure that loyalty was completely to America, not divided by obligations to foreign powers. So receipt of emoluments is a serious breach of the requirements of the Constitution unless Congress approves the payment.  Congress has not voted to approve payments by foreign governments to our Some Americans are considering legal action to protect America from a Presidential violation of the Emoluments  President Trump took the symbolic step of resigning from his businesses, but he still gets the income. Letting his family run his businesses doesn't solve the emoluments violations.  Here are some of the potential problems:  In February, China gave provisional approval for 31 new trademarks for The Trump Organization, which have been sought for a decade, to no avail, until he won the election. This is a benefit the Chinese Government gave to the President's business.  At Trump Tower in New York, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's large tenant, the United Arab Emirates, leases space, and the Saudi mission to the U.makes payments. Money from these foreign countries goes to the  The President is part owner of a New York building carrying a $950 million loan, partially held by the Bank of He literally owes the government of  The Embassy of Kuwait held its 600-guest National Day celebration at Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C., last month, proceeds to  The President has deals in When he announced the Muslim ban, Turkey's President called for President Trump's name to be removed from Trump Towers His company is currently involved in major licensing deals for that property.  Shortly after the election, the President met with former U.Independent Party leader Nigel Farage, to get help to get the view from his golf resorts in Scotland resolved. Both golf resorts he owns there are promoted by Scotland's official tourism agency.  Foreign government-owned broadcasts in several countries air the President's television program ``The Apprentice,'' resulting in royalties and other payments from these governments.  There may be many more business violations to the Emoluments Clause that are unknown due to the President's refusal to disclose his tax returns.  Congress could move to approve these questionable payments and benefits under Article 1, section 9 to solve the constitutional violation, although, in my view, that would not resolve concerns about divided loyalties.  But Congress has done nothing--neither enforce the clause nor authorize the payments. That is why patriotic citizens are returning to the third branch of government to defend the Constitution and the country.  America has never faced this situation before, and any litigation will, of course, be breaking new ground and, therefore, be more susceptible to the mandatory rule 11 fees required by the bill.  Citizens who seek a President free from foreign influence by bringing actions in court should not be penalized with the mandatory fees required by this bill.

117,topic-id,325,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen, Chairwoman Granger, and Ranking Member Visclosky for their hard work and cooperation. Today's bill is the product of good faith bipartisan and bicameral negotiation.  Each Member of this body will need to determine whether positive aspects of this bill outweigh uncertainty about the prospects of 10 other critical funding bills languishing without a clear path forward. Unlike the Defense Appropriations bill passed by the House last June, this bill keeps faith with existing caps on discretionary spending. It does not use a budget gimmick to create a mid-year shortfall in funding, which would have affected salaries and mission support for men and women serving bravely in harm's way.  I thank the chairman for increasing cybersecurity operations by nearly $1 billion; fully funding the European Reassurance Initiative in response to Russian aggression; investing in the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance resources combatant commanders clamor for; and assisting men and women in uniform by increasing pay by 2.1 percent, adding $25 million for sexual assault prevention and response, and providing $33.8 billion for the Defense Health  Despite these positive attributes, I would be remiss not to remind this body that the 2017 appropriations process can be described as nothing but a failure that continues to this day, more than 5 months into the fiscal year. The Defense bill that we consider today could have and should have been finished in September 2016. The majority chose to punt the deadline for this and 10 other appropriations bills until April for entirely political reasons.  All Americans know we must ensure our Armed Forces are staffed, trained, and equipped to meet the challenges they face. We must fulfill that responsibility without neglecting the critical services and investments funded through the 10 other unfinished appropriations bills.  I am very concerned that the House Republican leadership is proposing to[[Page H1937]]move one bill forward without any indication that the other 10 will see the light of day.

278,topic-id,1874,"Mr.President, I rise again today to share the story of this beautiful young lady, Jessie She is a West Virginian who passed away a year ago last week, and she was only 30 years old. She was a bright young lady with a great future ahead of her.  After years of struggling with heroin addiction, she had been doing very well. She had been sober since August of 2015. She had surgery for an infection related to a running injury and died a day after leaving the hospital.  Her story of addiction is known to many. We have told it many times here. Her father David, a former West Virginia State legislator who served with me, a friend of mine, shared their family struggle with addiction when President Obama traveled to West Virginia to bring attention to the growing opiate epidemic that we are all encountering in all of our  West Virginia has been hit the hardest by the opioid epidemic, where drug overdose deaths soared by more than 700 percent from 1999 to 2013. More than 600 lives were lost last year--just last year alone--to prescription drug overdose, legal prescription drugs.  Jessie's story and her family's pain are all too common in West Virginia and throughout this As I said, we lost 627 West Virginians to opiates last year alone.  When you think about it, this is a pill, this is a product that is manufactured by some of the most regarded institutions, pharmaceutical manufacturers in the country. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which basically says what we can use and what we should consume should be safe for us.  It is then prescribed by the most trusted person who is not in our family--and next to our family is a doctor. You would think that this is something that should be helpful for us, that should be part of the healing process. Instead, it has been part of the killing process. It has no home. It is a silent killer. We kept our mouths shut; we didn't say anything for many years, and now we have an epidemic on our hands, which we are trying to control.  We had 61,000 West Virginians who used prescription pain medications for nonmedical purposes in 2014. This includes 6,000 teenagers. As I have said, our State is not unique. The Presiding Officer's wonderful State of North Carolina is facing the same challenges we are.  Every day in our country, 91 Americans die from a prescription opiate or heroin overdose. Since 1999, we have lost almost 200,000 Americans to prescription opioid abuse.  Jessie's story deeply impacted President Obama, and I spoke with him about her death and the pain her family is going through. He reached out to David and Kate and the entire Grubb family. It is horrific.  When President Obama came to Charleston, Jessie was in a rehab facility in Michigan for the fourth time. Before her life was taken over by addiction in 2009, Jessie's future was bright. She was the beloved daughter of David and Kate Grubb, a beloved sister to her four sisters, and a beloved friend to so many.  She was an excellent student, scoring in the 99th percentile on all of her tests since she had been in education. She was a cheerleader at Roosevelt Junior High School, and she was an avid runner, an athlete.  At the time of her death, she was looking forward to running in her first marathon. She had been training for that. The only trouble she had ever gotten into at school was when she protested the Iraq war, and she was on the right side of that one.  Needless to say, she was a natural-born leader. After graduating from Capital High School, she was thrilled and looking forward to her bright future at the University of North Carolina at  She was sexually assaulted during her first semester, which caused her to withdraw from school and return to The traumatic event that caused Jessie to turn to heroin to escape the pain was that horrific experience.  Over the next 7 years, Jessie would battle her addiction. She would overdose four times and go into rehab four[[Page S1692]]times. Until her death, she had been sober for 6 months and was focused on making a life for herself in All of her hard work was ruined because of a careless mistake.  I introduced this piece of bipartisan legislation; everybody has been so kind on that. It makes so much common sense. I introduced it almost a year ago. At the time, I told David, Kate, and the family: This is something that should be a no-brainer. This is something we should easily pass. It was called Jessie's Law, after this beautiful young lady.  I will explain how the events unfolded, and then I will go into the bill. Her parents, David and Kate, traveled to Michigan for her surgery. They traveled to Michigan, and they told her doctors and the hospital personnel that she was a recovering addict. Jessie confirmed it. She said: Yes, I have struggled. I am clean. I am proud, and I want to get healthy. I want to get my leg injury fixed, and I want to run that marathon.  After Jessie's surgery, the discharging doctor, who said he didn't know she was a recovering addict--the parents were there when she was admitted. She told him. You would have thought they would have asked: Do you have any allergies, penicillin?  You would have thought they would have flagged it: I am a recovering addict.  They sent her home with a prescription for 50 oxycodone--50 oxycodone--because they did not know, because her records had not been properly identified, that she was very prone, being a recovering addict, to any type of opiate. There are other ways of treating pain. Not knowing, the doctor went ahead and released her with what a normal person would get for pain relief.  Needless to say, she should never have gotten that prescription--no way, shape, or form. We must ensure this never happens again. That is why today I am reintroducing Jessie's  Let me tell you what I ran into. David and Kate accompanied her as the parents. They were with their beautiful daughter. They both confirmed that she had an addiction problem and she was recovering: Please, we want you to notify anybody who handles, anyone who dispenses, anyone who is working with Please know what we are dealing with is very fragile.  I said: We will write the legislation. And we did; we wrote the legislation. If you have a consenting guardian, parent, and a consenting patient, it should be flagged. Because of privacy laws, we know we are very concerned about that. For some reason, I cannot get past the bureaucracy of getting this bill to the floor to be voted on because they are saying there is objection to the privacy laws with the parents' being involved. So guess what. I finally called David, and I called Kate, and I said: I know you would think it makes common sense that, basically, we should be able to pass legislation the way we would like to pass it--where the parents acknowledge it and the patient, who is their child, acknowledges it. They both are cooperating, and it should be done.  In order to try to get this piece of legislation passed as quickly as possible, we are taking off the parents. It is only the patient herself. Jessie comes in and says: I want you to know I am a recovering addict. Please make sure that everybody who handles my case knows that. That is all we are asking for. I am hopeful, Mr.President, that you and others will be able to join me because we don't want anybody in North Carolina going through what we have gone through in West Virginia or what the Grubb family has gone through, losing this beautiful, bright, talented young lady. It should never happen in this country.  Even the healthcare providers are saying: We need this legislation to go forward so we can identify that, so we can mark that, hotline that, redline that, and so that anybody who is handling Jessie from the beginning to the end, especially when they are discharged, is going to have knowledge. In no way, shape, or form will anybody prescribe an opiate or any type of addictive painkiller that they are going to be affected by, because their life has been changed by it already.  The bottom line is that we need to go at this problem from every angle with the help of everyone: family assistance, counseling programs, drug courts, consumer and medical education, law enforcement support, State and Federal legislation. We need everything. This is a fight we can't lose.  This is the first time in my lifetime that my State has fallen under 50 percent of adults of working age not working. We are down to 49.6 percent. We have always had the reputation of having some of the greatest workers--hard workers--giving you a good hard-working day for good hard-working pay. They have always been there. We just have too few of them. There are three things that keep you out of the workforce, basically: a lack of skill sets, if you are addicted or you have a criminal record, or a combination. Addiction has taken over and has basically changed the lives of Americans, changed the lives of West Virginia, and it is ruining families.  There is no way that her sisters and David and Kate, her parents, are ever going to get over losing There is no reason they should have lost Jessie and no reason you should lose another North Carolinian--none of us. As to the situation where they are go in and they are identified by all the professionals with the help they need in the systems they are asking for, we owe that to every person in America, and we owe it to  So I am asking for the cooperation of all my colleagues--the continuous support, tireless work that everyone has done. Jessie's death is heartbreaking and reminds us all that this is one death that could have been prevented and one death that should never happen again because of a lack of legislation that prevents us, because of the privacy laws, to identify a person that is in need.  If you are looking at addiction and happen to be looking at addiction as an illness, an illness needs care. If they need care, then we are going to give them the care to protect them while they are getting that care. That is all this does. I hope it is something we can do as quickly as possible. We will be forever grateful. In Jessie's memory, her parents are going to be forever grateful. Basically, Jessie's life will not be in vain. That is exactly why I am here. I am not going to sit still and lose a beautiful person who could contribute to society the way this young lady was going to contribute to society and say there is nothing we can do. We can do it and do it in her honor.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgS1691.txt,1983,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,8.0,March

248,topic-id,1677,"Mr.President, I rise to join my colleagues in this important conversation on the Senate floor and, once again, to demand answers to the many questions raised about Russia's interference in our elections.  Not so long ago, I came to the floor to speak out against a belligerent act from an adversarial nation, an attempt to undermine American democracy and foment chaos and uncertainty on the world stage, an effort that we now know from our own intelligence community's assessment was ordered by President Putin himself, a campaign that senior intelligence officials have concluded ``blend[ed] covert intelligence operations--such as cyber activity--with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users, or `trolls,' '' to undermine our 2016 Presidential elections.  In recent weeks, the American people have been confronted by a daily drumbeat of headlines regarding Russian interference with our elections and possible ties to President Trump's campaign. They have learned that the President's former National Security Advisor, LTG Michael Flynn, was not truthful about the nature of the conversations he had with the Russian Ambassador shortly after President Obama sanctioned Russia for meddling in our elections.  They learned that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the highest law enforcement officer in the land, did not fully disclose at least two meetings he had with the Russian Ambassador during his nomination hearings.  They have learned, through reporting in the news media, that U.law enforcement continues to investigation Russian agents' contacts with President Trump's inner circle.  Yet despite these revelations, the American people now face more questions than answers. Has anyone else on the President's team been in contact with the Russian Government? What were the nature of these conversations? How credible are reports of business dealings between Russian oligarchs and the Trump organization?  But here is the reason I came to the floor today, as serious as those questions are. Getting answers to these questions, whether it be through a special prosecutor, or an independent commission--on which Senator Cardin has legislation and which I strongly, strongly support and believe it is the ultimate vehicle--or the Senate Intelligence Committee's own investigation--those efforts are not about President It is about the American people. It is about protecting our free and democratic way of life and our time-tested system of self-governance. It is about showing our constituents that, when the stakes are high, when the allegations are this startling, when the implications are this alarming, we are capable of setting politics aside and getting to the truth.  Time and again, the President has dismissed the significance of Russia's interference in our elections, and he derides reports about his financial interests and campaign contacts with Russia as ``fake news.'' Well, this isn't fake news. On the contrary, these are real threats--real threats from a real foreign adversary; real threats that undermine the integrity of our elections and, therefore, the security of our country; real threats from a brutal leader who sees the erosion of Western democracy as a strategic imperative for Russia's future.  So let's be clear about why these threats matter. Vladimir Putin's rise to power in Russia has been marked by the suppression of the freedom of the press, the oppression of the Russian people, the murder of political opponents, and the transfer of wealth and assets from the Russian people to a handful of powerful oligarchs.  President Putin sees the spread of Western democratic values that we enjoy here in our country and others in the Western world--like freedom of speech, the rule of law, and human rights--as a threat to his power. So Russia has embarked on a systematic campaign to undermine the democracies that uphold the international order established after World War II and that has been the bedrock of peace and tranquility, generally speaking, since then. These threats must be taken seriously.  Russia's aggressive behavior reaches back years and extends to this day. We saw it in 2008, when Russia backed illegal separatist forces in Georgia, declaring South Ossetia and Abkhazia independent states. We saw it in March of 2014--when I was in Ukraine--when Russia authorized the use of military force to annex Crimea, blatantly violating the sovereignty of the Ukrainian people and the Budapest Memorandum, a memorandum that we--the United States, Russia, and others--signed, saying that we would observe the territorial and sovereignty rights of Ukraine if they gave up the nuclear weapons that had been left to them after the collapse of the Soviet  They did just that. They did just that, and what happened to them afterwards? Their territory has been annexed and invaded. Today, Putin continues to break ceasefires, sow discord, and incite violence throughout eastern Ukraine--an effort that to date has claimed 10,000 lives and displaced 2 million people.  Unfortunately, Russia's interference in our 2016 Presidential election is not an isolated instance. According to U.intelligence reports, these efforts are only the most recent manifestation of[[Page S1677]]the Kremlin's ongoing campaign to undermine Western democracy.  In recent years, we have seen Russian oligarchs funnel money to fringe political movements across Europe, and Russian operatives conduct sophisticated disinformation campaigns. After the revelations that Russia interfered with our own elections, Putin has shown no signs of slowing down. On the contrary, just weeks ago, Russian's Defense Minister announced that the Kremlin will begin using troops to enhance their information operations, emphasizing that ``propaganda must be smart, competent, and efficient.''  Again, Russia's end goal here is no mystery. Putin aims to undermine European unity and fracture the transatlantic alliance--an alliance that has served as a bedrock for international security, peace and stability, and economic cooperation between the United States and Europe for the past half century.  In the Middle East, President Putin continues to disregard international norms. He aligns Russia with Iran, the world's leading state sponsor of terror. He aids Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in his atrocities against innocent civilians. In Aleppo, Russian bombs fall on homes; Russian bombs fall on schools and hospitals; Russian bombs fall on aid convoys that only seek to feed starving, trapped families, and rescue children from the rubble.  Just last month, Russia violated the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty when they illegally launched a cruise missile, showing no regard for an agreement that has been a hallmark for nuclear security cooperation for nearly four decades. That is not an insignificant act.  The United States cannot ignore such destabilizing behavior. That is exactly why Senator Graham and I introduced 78 just 2 weeks ago, recognizing 3 years of Russian military aggression and calling on Russia to respect its obligations to the international community. Our resolution should serve as a reminder to this administration that the U.sanctions imposed on Russia for violating the international order should remain in place until Russia starts respecting and returning to that international norm.  Nor can we let Russian efforts to undermine Western democracies continue unabated. That is why I joined my colleagues in the Countering Russian Hostilities Act of 2017. This bipartisan bill codifies the sanctions imposed by President Obama for Russia's annexation of Crimea and interference in the U.elections into law.  It is the same type of proposition we had with the Iran agreement. We want a congressional opportunity to voice ourselves and make sure that those sanctions aren't lifted arbitrarily, capriciously, without Russia paying the consequences and coming back into the international order. At the same time, the legislation authorizes $100 million for the State Department and other agencies to counter Putin's propaganda.  The time for action--and for answers--is now. We can get to work immediately by holding hearings in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to ensure that the United States has a strategy in place to protect the security of our democracy and promote stability abroad. From the spread of extremist propaganda across Europe and the denial of Ukrainian sovereignty, to the bombing of civilians in Aleppo and the cyber attacks against the Democratic National Committee, Putin's intentions are not up for debate.  Russia's destabilizing behavior should make it absolutely clear to the President of the United States that the Russian Federation is not our friend. But when the President hesitates to acknowledge this reality or fails to address such aggressive behavior, it is up to Congress to act. There can be no hesitation when it comes to protecting the security and sanctity of our elections.  But to take action we need answers. That is why we need an independent investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 elections. What President Trump fails to realize time and again is that this investigation is not about whether or not Russia successfully swayed the American elections. This investigation is not about him. This investigation is about the American people. It is about ensuring that our elections are free, fair, and secure so that our government that we elect is responsive and accountable to the people. It is about understanding Russia's tactics in cyber space and preparing for future attacks. It is about standing with our allies, preserving peace and avoiding war, and preventing the need to send our sons and daughters into harm's way. It is about ensuring that, when the President of the United States faces tough decisions, the American people can trust that he puts their interests--their interests--ahead of any other interests he has abroad.  It is time to protect the integrity of our elections and to secure our democracy against the cyber threats of the 21st century--whether they come in the form of election machine tampering, or paid propaganda on social media, or targeted hacks on political and public officials.  Russia poses a real strategic threat to the United States, to our core values, and to the international order. I call on the President to treat these threats with the seriousness they deserve.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to protect the integrity of our elections here at home, to defend democracy abroad, and to ensure that the transatlantic alliance, so vital to international security and stability, remains strong for generations to come.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgS1666-2.txt,791,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,8.0,March
323,topic-id,565,"Mr.Speaker, the month of March is when social workers throughout the country celebrate Social Work I am here today to honor a special group of social workers who work in one of the most important institutions in our society: our schools.  To honor the vital role school social workers serve in our communities, I am proud to introduce H.171, to recognize the many contributions of school social workers and to designate this week, March 5 through 11, as School Social Work  School social workers are critical members of a school's educational team. They strengthen partnerships between students' homes, schools, and communities as they work to ensure student academic success. School social workers are uniquely trained and specially equipped to mentor students who face emotional, academic, and behavioral barriers to learning.  Their expertise guides students through serious life challenges, including poverty, disability, sexual and physical abuse, addiction, bullying, and various forms of familial separation such as military deployment, divorce,[[Page H1958]]and incarceration. We now understand how these adverse childhood experiences and chronic exposures to the stressors affect the developing brain, particularly in a school setting where the academic demands are high and the social pressures can be life changing.  We must better support these students to overcome these barriers to success. We now have the science and research to inform our policies so that we are not just funneling these children out of a school system and into a prison system. We must prioritize the economic benefits of effective and preventive solutions and provide the necessary supports.  School social workers provide these services in our schools by connecting students and families to available resources in the community, particularly in areas that have been hit hardest by poverty. School social workers improve the success rate of children coming from a disadvantaged background, lending a much-needed hand in our efforts to create a more equal society. Families and communities want these services for their children. School districts should prioritize and invest in staffing models and programs that offer mental health services.  Research tells us that individuals who suffer from mental illness will have developed these symptoms by age 14. The Centers for Disease Control finds that behavioral disorders are increasing in youth and presenting themselves at younger ages. Fewer than one in five of these children will ever receive needed mental health services.  We also know that suicide is the second leading cause of death for young people ages 10 through 24. School mental health programs provided and enhanced by school social workers are critical to early identification of mental health problems.  Research indicates that school mental health programs improve educational outcomes by decreasing absences, decreasing disciplinary referrals, and improving academic achievement. Our students deserve the support. Our students need school social workers to help them succeed.  Unfortunately, there are often not enough school social workers available in school districts to meet the many, many needs of at-risk youth. The 1-to-250 maximum recommended ratio of school social workers to students is exceeded in almost all school districts in the United States, with some experiencing ratios as high as 1 to 21,000.  As we seek to improve our educational opportunities, maximizing the new opportunities and flexibility of the Every Student Achieves Act, let us use this week to recognize the contributions of school social workers and the vital role they play in helping our children reach their fullest potential.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1957-2.txt,1676,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,9.0,March

We have now introduced in this Congress the Cuba Trade This is legislation which would lift the trade embargo to allow farmers and ranchers and small businesses and other private sector industries to freely conduct business, to sell products--agricultural products in particular--to the nation of Cuba and to its people.  Last month, I spoke about the terrific difficulties our farmers in Kansas and across the country are facing due to low commodity prices. The farm economy has fallen by nearly 50 percent since 2013, and that decline is expected to continue in 2017, making this perhaps, if not the worst, certainly one of the worst economic downturns in farm country since the Great  In 2016, harvests in our State and across much of the country were recordbreaking yields and historic in their magnitude, in fact. What that means is there are still piles of wheat, corn, and other grains all across Kansas just sitting on the ground next to the grain mill bins that are already filled to capacity. To sell this excess supply, our farmers need more markets to sell the food and fiber they produce.  Approximately 95 percent of the world's customers live outside U.borders. Markets in the United States will continue to grow, and they will evolve and will continue to meet the domestic consumer demand, providing the best, highest quality, safest food supply in the world, but in order to boost prices for American farmers, we need more markets. We need them now, we need them in the future, and we need to be able to indicate to our farmers that hope is in the works in global markets.  We have talked about the importance of trade, of exports from the United States, and particularly for the citizens of That is particularly true for an agricultural State like ours where, again, 95 percent of the consumers live someplace outside of the United Cuba is only 90 miles off our border. They offer the potential for increased exports of all sorts of products but especially Kansas wheat.  In fact, while we are introducing this legislation now, we started down this path to increase our ability to sell agriculture commodities, food, and medicine to Cuba back when I was a Member of the House of I offered an amendment then to an appropriations bill that lifted the embargo--the ability to sell; it would allow the ability to sell those foods, agricultural commodities, and medicine to Cuba for cash, up front. That bill was passed. It was controversial then. This issue of what our relationship ought to be with Cuba has always been contentious. But I remember the vote was about I think 301 to 116. A majority of Republicans and a majority of Democrats said it is time to do something different with our relationship with  This was a significant step in opening up the opportunity to the products of American farmers and ranchers to that country. No longer were food, medicine, and agriculture commodities prohibited from being sold. And it worked for a little while, but unfortunately, in 2005, the Treasury Department changed the regulations, and it complicated the circumstances related to the embargo.  Cuba imports the vast majority of its food. In fact, wheat is Cuba's second largest import, second only to oil.  A point I would stress is that this is a unilateral sanction. Keep in mind that when we don't sell agricultural commodities to Cuba, somebody else does. While our unilateral trade barriers block our own farmers and ranchers from filling the market, willing sellers such as Canada, France, China, and others benefit at American farmers' expense. When we can't sell wheat that comes from a Kansas wheat field to Cuba, they are purchasing that wheat from France and Canada and other European countries. When the Presiding Officer's rice crop can't be sold to Cuba, it is not that they are not buying rice; they are buying it from Vietnam, China, or elsewhere.  It costs about $6 to $7 per ton to ship grain from the United States to It costs about $20 to $25 to ship that same grain from the European However, we lose this competitive advantage because of the regulations in place that drive up the cost of Cuban consumers dealing with the United  To understand what we are missing out on in Cuba, consider our current trade relationship with the Dominican The DR is also a nearby Caribbean nation with a population comparable to Income levels and diet are similar. Between 2013 and 2015, the Dominican Republic imported an average of $1.3 billion of U.farm products. During that same time span, Cuba imported just $262 million--over $1 billion in difference. That is right. That is $1 billion of exports that U.farmers are missing an opportunity on because of the U.trade restrictions on This example helps illustrate the substantial potential that exists for increased sale of agriculture commodities to  The Cuba Trade Act I just introduced simply seeks to amend our own country's laws so that American farmers can operate on a level playing field with the rest of the world. While boosting American exports remains the primary goal of lifting the embargo, I also think there is an opportunity for us to increase the reforms and to improve the lives of the Cuban people as well.  I have often said here on the Senate floor and on the House floor and back home in Kansas we often say: We will try something once. If it doesn't work, we might even try it again. Maybe we will try it a third or a fourth time. But after more than 50 years of trying to change the nature of the Cuban Government through this kind of action, through this embargo, many Kansans would say it is time to try something else.  The Cuban embargo was well-intentioned at the time it was enacted. Today, however, it only serves to hurt our own national interests by restricting Americans' freedom to conduct business with that country. In my view, it is time to make a change, and we ought to be able to sell wheat, rice, and other agricultural commodities from the United States for cash to This legislation would allow that at no expense to the American taxpayer.                            Kansas Wildfires  Mr.President, there is a lot to be proud about in being a We have lots of challenges in our State, and we are undergoing serious ones at the moment. For those who have noticed on the news, although it is not particularly a story here in the Nation's Capital, Kansas is ablaze. Fires are devastating acres and acres. In fact, nearly 700,000 acres of grasslands in our State have been burned. Fires have started. We have had winds for the last 3 days of 50 to 60 miles an hour, and dozens of communities and counties have been evacuated. Lots of places have been hard hit. My home county of Rooks experienced those fires. Hutchinson, a community of 50,000 people, had to evacuate 10,000 people in what we would consider in our State a pretty big place. So they have been rampant and they have been real, and there have been significant consequences to many lives in our  As people know, Kansas is an agriculture place. We raise lots of crops, but we are certainly a livestock State, and our ranchers are experiencing the significant challenges that come from loss of pasture, the death of their cattle, and the burning of their fences.  On my way over here, I was reading a couple of articles that appeared in the Kansas press that I wanted to bring to my colleagues' attention. There is nothing here that necessarily asks for any kind of government help, but it does highlight the kind of people I represent.  There is a farm in Clark The county seat is It is on the border with Eighty-five percent of the county's grassland, 85 percent of the acres in that county have been burned. This means the death of hundreds, if not thousands, of cattle in that county. That is the economic driver of the communities there. Ashland, the county seat, has a population of[[Page S1719]]about 900 or 1,000--the biggest town in the county--and its future rests in large part upon what happens in agriculture.  There are lots of great ranch families in our One of those is the The Gardiner Ranch is in Clark Their story is told a bit in today's edition of the Wichita They are known as some of the best ranchers in the country. For more than 50 years, they have provided the best Angus cattle. They have customers across the country. It is a family ranch. This is multigenerational, and three brothers now ranch together. It is not an unusual way that we do business in  In addition to the economic circumstances that agriculture presents in our State, it is one of the reasons I appreciate the opportunity to advocate on behalf of farmers and ranchers. It is one of the last few places in which sons and daughters work side by side with moms and dads, and grandparents are involved in the operation. Grandkids grow up knowing their grandparents. There is a way of life here that is important to our country. Our values, our integrity, and our character are often transmitted from one generation to the next in this circumstance because we are still able to keep the family together, working generation to generation. The Gardiners are an example of that, but there are hundreds of Kansans who exemplify this.  I would like to tell the story of Mr.Gardiner, as reported by the Wichita Mr.Gardiner said that he was slowly driving by some of his estimated 500 cattle that had died in this massive wildfire, and he complained on their behalf that they never had a chance. The fire was so fast. His ranch, as I said, is one of the most respected. The quality of the family's Angus cattle has been a source of pride and national attention for more than 50 years.  Like others, the Gardiners have endured plenty of bumps--and this is him telling their story--over five generations of ranching. The drought and dust of the 1930s was tough, he said, and there were even drier times in the 1950s. About 5 years ago, there was another drought in our State that was so devastating. He said his family lost 2,000 acres when they couldn't make a payment to the bank. Blizzards in 1992 killed a lot of cattle.  My point is that nothing is easy about this life, but there is something so special about it. The point I want to make is that people are responding to help, and I thank Kansans and others from across the country who are responding to the disasters that are occurring across our State throughout this week and into the future. This isn't expected to go away anytime soon.  Mr.Gardiner said that more hay is on the way, and the process of rebuilding fences will begin, hopefully, within a few weeks. He said he was sent word that Mennonite relief teams were coming from two Eastern States to work on his fences and to do so without pay. Truckloads of hay are already en route and rolling in. This story indicates that many of those truckloads of hay are coming from ranchers who in the past have bought livestock from the  Mr.Gardiner's veterinarian, Randall Spare, said that the Gardiners have long been known for taking exceptional care of their customers. The veterinarian says, ``Now it's their turn'' for the customers to repay them. ``The Gardiners are the cream of the crop, like their cattle. I'm not surprised so many people [from so many places] are wanting to help them.''  The reporter says that while he was talking to Mr.Gardiner for this interview, Mr.Gardiner answered his cell phone as his pickup slowly rolled across a landscape that now looked so barren. The reporter said that many of the calls were from clients who just called to send their best or to be brought up to date and to ask the Gardiners how they could help and how the Gardiners were holding up.  Mr.Gardiner said:       It's really something [special], when you hear a pause on      the other end of the line and you know it's because [the      person who called is] crying because they care that much. It      gets like that with ranching. It's like we're all family.  That is a great thing about our It is like that with We are all a family. But the fact is that his family is still alive. He tells the story of not knowing whether his brother and his wife were alive. The fire swept around them, but they found a place that avoided the fire, a wheat field where the wheat was still green and so short that the fire didn't intrude. But he stopped his truck to think a bit and, the story indicates, to sob a bit.  He watched as his brother Mark and his wife Eva disappeared behind a wall of fire as they tried to save their horses and dogs at their home. Ultimately, the house was destroyed. Mr.Gardiner, the one the reporter was talking to, said:       I had no choice but to turn around and drive away, with the      fire all around me. For a half-hour I didn't know if my      brother and his wife were dead or alive. I really didn't.  He said that then his brother and his wife and some firefighters gathered in the middle of that wheat field. It was so short and so green, it wouldn't burn. He said:       It was so smoky I didn't even know exactly where we were      at. But then a firefighter came driving by and told us      everybody made it out. That's when I knew Mark and his wife      were alive. That's when I knew everything would eventually be      all right. I am telling you, that's when you learn what's      really important.  So today I come to the Senate floor to express my gratitude for the opportunity to represent Kansans like the Gardiners, farmers and ranchers across our State but city folks, as well, who know the importance of family, who know that living or dying is an important aspect of life but that how they live is more important, and to thank those people--not just from Kansas but from across the country--who have rallied to the cause to make sure there is a future for these families and for the farming and ranching operations.  It is a great country in which we care so much for each other, and that is exemplified in this time of disaster that is occurring across my I am grateful to see these examples, and I would encourage my colleagues that we behave the way Kansas farmers and ranchers do--live life for the things that are really meaningful and make sure we take care of each other.

257,topic-id,3536,"Mr.President, I want to talk about an upcoming CRA that will be on the floor potentially this week that would cancel out an important regulation that is designed to build upon this country's history of making sure there is a marriage between civil rights and education to make sure that children in this country, regardless of their race, regardless of their learning ability, regardless of their religion, regardless of their income, get an equal chance at education.  Frankly, the whole reason the Federal Government is involved in the question of education is due to civil rights. This used to be a purely local concern, and the Federal Government stepped into the question of local education because Black kids throughout the South were not getting an equal education. They were living in segregated schools and getting an education that was of far lesser quality. So the Federal Government has always been involved in education because it is a matter of civil rights.  I want to talk about this issue through the prism of one individual. I am going to call him James, but this is a true story--a story, frankly, that could be told millions of times over across the country.  James went to school in an urban district in He was a 10th grader. At the beginning of James's 10th grade year, he had a habit of walking out of class. In the middle of class, he would just get up and walk out after 10 or 15 or 20 minutes, and he would wander the halls of this big, urban high school until inevitably he was met by a security officer or a teacher or an administrator. They would bring him down to the office, and they would call his grandmother, as he lived with her. He would get suspended for a couple of days, and then he would come back.  It played out so often--this cycle of James walking out of class, being brought down to the principal's office, being suspended--that somewhere around the end of October, during his sophomore year, he had been out of school more days than he had been in school.  One day, though, James goes through this cycle again. He is in the hallway, and he runs into an assistant principal. He is sort of sick and tired of this story playing out over and over again. He raises his voice. He has some words. James has never hurt anybody in his life, no history of violence, but the assistant principal decides to call the police. The police come and they arrest James for disorderly conduct, essentially for having words with an assistant principal. Now James, at 16 years old, has a criminal record. At the time, he was treated as an adult in Connecticut, so he has an adult criminal record.  It turns out that James was walking out of class every day because he couldn't read, and he was mortified. He was embarrassed because he had been socially promoted through the years. He had a learning disability that was going untreated, and he was in the 10th grade with the ability to only read at an elementary school level. No wonder he was walking out of class every day. He literally couldn't follow along. It was embarrassing. He didn't want to be called on by the teacher so he left. Nobody ever figured that out until he got arrested and finally got a legal aid lawyer, who happened to be my wife, who identified his disability and the fact that it was being unaddressed.[[Page S1684]]  The fact is, a big part of this story is tied up in the fact that James was Black, and he was a big kid. So the police got calls maybe because he appeared to be threatening in a way that he simply was not. I can say that because the data backs up the fact that Black kids and disabled kids are treated very differently in schools today. Wherever you are, whether in Connecticut, in North Carolina, or in California, Black kids--especially Black boys--are suspended and expelled at a rate that is twice that of their White peers for the exact same behavior. Take mouthing off to a teacher. When that happens, Black kids, Black students, are twice as likely to be suspended for mouthing off to a teacher than a White student.  James's story is not unique. It is not unique because it happens in every State across the country, and it is not just in suspension and expulsion rates, it is also in achievement rates as well. We know the statistics. The graduation rate for African-American students is 16 percent lower than their White peers. I can go down the line and tell you about the different story when it comes to achievement and treatment of African-American students as compared to White students.  Racism isn't gone in this country. It might not be overt. Sometimes it might not even be conscious, but it is still there. Discrimination against kids who are different, whether they be poor or disabled, didn't vanish. It is still all over.  John Lewis is a civil rights icon. We celebrate him every day, Republicans and Democrats, in the U.He got mercilessly beaten over the head simply because he wanted to vote. John Lewis is still alive, but you know what, so are the people who beat him. We are only a generation removed from an era of open, unapologetic racism in this country. To think that we don't need civil rights protections for kids any longer is to deny reality. Racism doesn't look the same as it used to. Discrimination against kids who are different isn't as overt as it used to be, but the data is the data. It is still there.  No Child Left Behind got a lot wrong, but one of the things it got right was that it shed a light on this disparate treatment, these disparate outcomes between Black students, Hispanic students, disabled students, and their peers, because it forced States--and this was a Republican and Democratic accomplishment at the time--it forced States to disaggregate results. So you had to look at how were disabled students doing, how were Black students doing, and if they weren't measuring up and if they weren't getting closer to the performance of their nondisabled or White peers, then you had to do something to turn those students around, turn their performance around.  Now, the part that No Child Left Behind got wrong is big and significant. Part of it is that it required every single one of those kids to hit the 100-percent proficiency mark, when progress is important to measure as well. It also told States exactly what to do to turn around the experiences of those kids. It is not the same in Connecticut as it is in North Carolina, and it is not the same in an urban district as it is in a suburban district. So when we got together on this floor and passed, in a bipartisan way, the new Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we did something really important. We preserved those requirements to disaggregate results for Black kids and for Hispanic kids and for kids with disabilities, but then we left it up to States to decide what proficiency is, and we left it up to States as to how they would turn around the experience for these kids if they weren't meeting those State-set goals. We gave an enormous amount of discretion and flexibility to States, but we preserved the basic expectation that our education policy was still going to be civil rights policy: Pay attention to how those vulnerable populations with a history of discrimination levied against them performed and require States to pay attention to the interventions.  That was a bipartisan achievement, and when we did it, we knew the regulation was going to be needed because, as with many education statutes, they are very vague. Republicans and Democrats understood that there was going to have to be a regulation to provide some clarity to States on how you build these locally driven accountability systems.  So the regulation we are talking about here today was not one of these that came out of left field. It was not one of these regulations that was political in nature; no, it flows from a bipartisan act that preserved accountability requirements for kids.  It is important for a variety of reasons. One, it is important because there are some really vague terms in the statute that do need clarification. For instance, one of the things we voted for, Republicans and Democrats, is we voted to say you have to show that you are providing improvement for African-American students, let's say, and if they are not showing continuous improvement, then you have to have a turnaround plan. By the way, that turnaround plan is totally yours to decide; no sanctions from the Federal Government if it is not X turnaround plan or Y turnaround plan. That is the old law. The new law says it is yours to decide.  ``Continuous improvement'' is a super vague term. It is one of those obvious terms that has to have some regulatory guardrails put around it because what if the State said ``continuous improvement'' is improvement over 20 years. Well, kids come in and out of schools in 2 or 3 or 4 years and a 20-year period of looking at a particular subgroup's performance is meaningless to kids.  So the regulation says continuous improvement means 2 years; look at how a kid does over 2 years. And then it says, if 2 years doesn't work for you, you can make it longer but just tell us why. That is an important protection, and it still preserves enormous flexibility for  States want this regulation because it also gives them other types of flexibilities. An example is, when you are looking at performance, the statute suggests that you can have students who are meeting goal or students who are not meeting goal. The regulation recognizes that is, frankly, a really arbitrary way to look at performance. So the statute says: Yes, that is what the regulation says. The statute says: Meeting goal and not meeting goal, but you can get extra credit for students who are close to meeting goal, who have shown growth. You can get credit for students who are way above goal, your high-achieving students. You don't have to measure your schools just based on how many students meet goal. That is flexibility States want, that they likely don't have without the regulation.  Another example, for English language learners, proficiency goals should vary based on where you started. If you start here with no English skills, then your proficiency target should be different than if you started with a pretty advanced understanding of the language. The statute just says you have to have a proficiency goal. It is unclear whether you can have different ones for different levels of learners. The regulation makes it clear: Give States that flexibility.  So that is why States didn't ask for this This is different than these other States didn't ask for this All of the educational groups we listened to--teachers, superintendents, principals--they weighed in on this regulation. They didn't love every piece of it, but they were ready to implement it. None of these groups were coming up to the Congress asking for this regulation to be withdrawn. Would they have liked it to be fixed or tailored? But here is what they understood, and here is why I am really concerned.  Secretary DeVos could fix the things she doesn't like or Senator Alexander doesn't like through the regular notice and comment period. I think there is 80 percent of this regulation that everybody agrees on, that just dots the i's and crosses the t's on a bipartisan commitment to accountability, and maybe there is 20 percent or 10 percent that Senator Alexander and some other Members think goes a little bit too far, but when you pass a CRA, you don't allow for a regulation to be passed in the future that is substantially similar to the entirety of the regulation. The courts aren't going to look, or, frankly, even know, what parts of the regulation you didn't like and the 80 percent of the regulation you wanted to preserve.  The Department of Education can't pass anything that is similar to this[[Page S1685]]ever again. So one of the things the regulation says is that you get a 1-year delay because it is just too quick to come up with accountability systems for this coming school year. That is gone. When this CRA passes, every school district in the Nation has to develop an accountability system for this calendar year because without the regulation, you don't have that flexibility.  So what makes me, frankly, so disturbed about this CRA is that it could happen another way, which would preserve the pieces of the civil rights protections that all of us agree on, which is the majority of the regulation. To my mind, it violated the spirit of our agreement when we passed this law. Here was a really amazing achievement; that we were able to rewrite the No Child Left Behind law--essentially repeal it and replace it with something better--that Democrats and Republicans could agree upon. In my mind, that agreement was predicated upon the Department being able to enforce maybe the most important part of the law for big constituency groups in this country--the accountability section, the civil rights protections.  By passing this CRA, we are essentially making it impossible for any regulation ever again to be passed to implement the accountability sections and the civil rights protections in this law. Why? Because you can't pass anything that is substantially similar--substantially similar to the parts you like, substantially similar to the parts you don't like. This isn't like these other CRAs where Republicans didn't like any part of it, where Republicans didn't see any need for the regulation to go forward. This is different. We agree on 80 percent of this one, but the 80 percent is likely gone by passing this.  I guess part of what disturbs me here is that we worked, locked arm in arm, in passing this law. I really do believe that by passing this CRA, Republican leadership--HELP leadership--is violating the agreement we had to make sure this law went into force and effect in the way we all intended.  It happened in the context of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that isn't working this year like it used to work. I have such great respect for the chairman and the ranking member of that committee. They pulled off some big bipartisan wins during the time of their tenure, including the Workforce Investment Act, the rewrite of the No Child Left Behind Act, and some other smaller wins that people didn't necessarily think as much about, and leading up to the end of last year, the passage of a major new commitment to reforming mental illness and mental health in this country.  That spirit of bipartisanship, which was present in the HELP Committee in a way that it wasn't present in other committees, is disappearing before our eyes. We were mad that we only got 5 minutes to question Betsy DeVos because it felt like the committee was hiding her from public view. Democrats were asking for more time to ask more questions, and we didn't get it. That rarely happens in that committee, where the minority party is just asking to be heard and is shut down.  We begged for the CRA not to come before this body because there was another way to get it done that didn't violate the spirit of our agreement around the rewrite of the No Child Left Behind law, but we were denied in that request. Now we are voting on a CRA that is potentially going to be devastating not just for kids out there who need protection but also for States that want this flexibility.  Finally, we are on a schedule, according to the majority leader, that is going to bring a healthcare bill that will rewrite the rules for one-sixth of the American economy to the floor of the Senate without any debate in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, without a single hearing on the bill, without a markup, and without any ability for amendment.  I listened for 6 years to my Republican friends tell me that the healthcare bill, or the Affordable Care Act, was rammed through Congress and that the biggest problem was the fact that it was done outside of the public view for expediency's sake. Now, I was there in the House of Representatives, and let me express the unbelievable irony of those complaints now that there will be no process for the committees to consider the replacement to the Affordable Care  The House and the Senate had hundreds--hundreds--of meetings and hearings. The HELP Committee alone--I don't have the numbers in front of me--considered hundreds of amendments and adopted over 100 Republican amendments in the markup process. The Senate's session was the second longest in the history of the Senate, in for more than 20 days debating that bill. The reason there was so much tempest out in the American public over the Affordable Care Act was because it was open for debate for so long.  The Finance Committee had a full process. The HELP Committee had a full process. The Ways and Means Committee had a full process. The Energy and Commerce Committee had a full process.  None of that is happening here. This bill is being jammed through, as we speak, the Ways and Means and the Energy and Commerce This bill is going to be jammed onto the floor, perhaps without any committee process, in the The target is from introduction Monday to passage in the House in 3 weeks and perhaps just a few more weeks before it passes the So spare me the complaints about the Affordable Care Act being rushed into place when this process is going to make that look laborious in comparison.  What pains me is not just this CRA, which is unnecessary, but it doesn't have to happen this way. What pains me is a committee process that when I got here had a reputation for being truly bipartisan, for being one of the more functional, if not the most functional, committee processes. That is being blown up most significantly by the rush job--the rush job on the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, which nobody in the American public is going to have enough time to look at it and see it.  I ask my colleagues one more time to reconsider their votes on this We are at our best when we come together around the idea that every kid in this country should have a chance at a quality education, no matter what color their skin is, no matter what their learning ability is. I know my colleagues have a couple problems with this regulation. I get it. But by passing this CRA, the regulation is gone and never coming back, and the States that want the flexibility, that are begging for the flexibility, won't get it.

There are so many great teacher prep programs across the country that are supplying our teaching students with the tools they need to succeed in the classroom, but there are also teacher prep programs that are struggling and need support to make sure they are producing great teachers for our schools.  This rule ensures that students can make informed decisions about teacher preparation programs and that they have access to this information before they take out massive amounts of student debt. It gives States information about the schools that are struggling so States can provide those schools the tools and resources they need to improve their teaching preparation programs.  Finally, eliminating this rule will give Secretary DeVos more power over our higher education programs--a risk we should not be willing to take without learning more about Secretary DeVos's vision for our higher education system.

243,topic-id,1745,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today on behalf of students, parents, teachers, and communities around the country to urge my colleagues to support our bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act and to oppose this resolution today.  This resolution will roll back a rule issued by the Department of Education that is critical to the effective and intended implementation of the Every Student Succeeds Act, or  I am urging my fellow Senators to vote against this resolution for the following reasons, and I will go through each one of them: First of all, this legislation will throw our States and[[Page S1671]]school districts into chaos just as they are beginning to implement our new law. Secondly, it will give Secretary DeVos a blank check to promote her anti-public school agenda. Third, passing this resolution would be a retreat from the bipartisan law President Obama called a Christmas miracle, one that takes us down a strong partisan path instead, which could undermine ESSA's civil rights protections and guardrails.  But before I go into that, I want to remind my colleagues of what we are working on here and what this resolution would unwind. As many of my colleagues remember well, in 2015, the senior Senator from Tennessee and I came together, with so many others in this body, to fix No Child Left We both agreed--in fact, nearly everyone in the country agreed--the law was badly broken. No Child Left Behind relied too much on high stakes standardized testing. It gave schools unrealistic goals but failed to give them the resources to meet those goals. And it included a one-size-fits-all punishment if those goals weren't met.  We knew overhauling our public education law was not going to be easy, but we took the time to listen to teachers, to parents, and to students around the country, to make sure their voices were heard. And I am proud that we were then able to break through the partisan gridlock in Congress, find common ground, and pass the Every Student Succeeds Act with strong bipartisan support.  After a major law like the Every Student Succeeds Act passes, Federal agencies usually issue rules to implement and clarify that law. The Every Student Succeeds Act maintains the Secretary's authority to issue rules and clarifications that are consistent with the law. This rule before us today is consistent with ESSA, and it provides important clarity to States, school districts, and schools.  Using such a blunt instrument like this resolution to overturn the entire rule will be a retreat from bipartisanship. Here is how: This resolution would roll back a critical Department of Education rule that gives States more flexibility in key areas while at the same time maintaining strong Federal guardrails to ensure our most vulnerable children don't fall through the cracks. This rule provides clarity on accountability, on reporting requirements, and State plan requirements. It helps ensure that no student, no matter where they live, can fall through those cracks. In other words, this is a rule that gets at the heart and soul of what we are trying to accomplish with our bipartisan law.  The Department of Education did not simply come up with this rule on its own. It incorporated over 20,000 comments from education stakeholders, State chiefs, and district superintendents, many of whom--including the State chiefs and superintendents--applauded the Department of Education for listening to their concerns and incorporating those comments into the final rule that was then released last fall.  During the debate around the Every Student Succeeds Act, there was some division about what accountability should mean in the law, but the final law showed that we can balance flexibility with strong Federal guardrails, until this point, when Republicans now want to tear down the rule that ensures those guardrails go into effect.  Now I want to get into some of the challenges that would be created if this resolution passes and this rule was eliminated. One important thing this rule did was clarify State submission plan requirements and set deadlines for the submission of those plans. Based on this, States have been working now with the Department of Education for months on their State plans. Approximately 18 States and the District of Columbia intend to submit their plans in the beginning of April, but if this rule goes away now, if the rug gets pulled out from under these States, there could be chaos and confusion and the undermining of confidence in this new law.  By the way, we are already seeing this start. In February, Secretary DeVos sent a letter to our State chiefs suggesting a new template for their State submission plans would be ``coming,'' even before the Senate voted on this resolution, and that the new template would be available less than a month before State plans are due. This could force those impacted States to abandon their plans and start from scratch, and it does not allow enough time for the stakeholder review process that is required in the law.  So that is the first reason we should oppose this legislation because there is simply no reason to insert more chaos into a system that is finally settling into our new law. The second reason is, passing this legislation would then give Secretary DeVos a blank check over implementation of the Every Student Succeeds Act to promote her anti-public school agenda.  As we saw in her confirmation hearing, Secretary DeVos, we know, has dedicated her career to privatizing public education. She has a long record of fighting to cut investments in public schools and shift taxpayer dollars toward private school vouchers. In her hearing, she showed a lack of even basic understanding of key concepts in public education policy, and she has openly questioned the role of the Federal Government in protecting our most vulnerable students.  After her hearing, millions of people across the country stood up, made their voices heard, and called on the Senate to reject her confirmation. Although she squeaked through with a historic tie-breaking vote from Vice President Pence, it was clear people across the country rejected her anti-public school agenda. Instead, they want the Department of Education to stand with students and with our schools.  One month into her tenure as Secretary of Education, Secretary DeVos has not done a lot to reassure parents who had serious concerns. She has made mistake after mistake, from grossly misrepresenting the origins of the HBCUs to failing to protect transgender students in schools, proving what the American people saw at her confirmation hearing; that her lack of understanding of public education is hurting our students. We cannot, in good conscience, provide Secretary DeVos another potential tool to implement ESSA, our bipartisan bill, with her anti-public education slant, and that is exactly what passing this resolution would do.  If this resolution passes, make no mistake, I will do everything I can to ensure that Secretary DeVos implements ESSA, as Congress intended.  Let me be clear. Congress did not intend that DeVos or any future Secretary of Education could use this law to encourage, prioritize, or even require States to incentivize private school choice. We will work to ensure that she does not take advantage of the chaos that will follow, if this rule is overturned.  Providing Secretary DeVos a blank check would absolutely be the wrong way to go in the early stages of this law's implementation. So that is the second reason.  The third reason is, at its heart, the Every Student Succeeds Act is a civil rights law, and the rule that this resolution would eliminate reflects that reality. We know from experience that without strong accountability, kids from low-income neighborhoods, students of color, kids with disabilities, and students learning English too often fall through the cracks. Now it is up to all of us to uphold the civil rights legacy of this law and its promise for all of our students.  I was proud to work with my colleague, the senior Senator from Tennessee, on this law. I know he is proud of what we accomplished, but I am disheartened to see my Republican colleagues jamming this partisan play through in the same fashion they did with Secretary DeVos's nomination.  Voting for this resolution will ruin the bipartisan nature of our Every Student Succeeds Act, and it will hurt our students, but by voting against this resolution, we can make sure ESSA works for all of our students, regardless of where they live, how they learn, or how much money their parents make.  Finally, I want to make one more point. Even people who had concerns with the final rule do not--do not--want to see it overturned. In fact, the American Federation of Teachers, civil rights groups, and the U.Chamber of Commerce--groups that aren't always actually on the same side of education issues--are all speaking out against rolling back this rule, and parents,[[Page S1672]]teachers, and community leaders are all on the same page.  In a letter to the Senate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers union said: ``Repealing these regulations now would not just be counterproductive and disruptive but would demonstrate a disregard by Congress of school districts' operation and timelines.''  In a letter to my colleagues, Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer, the U.Chamber of Commerce and various education groups, including the National Center for Learning Disabilities, wrote that rolling back this rule ``will cause unnecessary confusion, disrupting the work in states and wasting time that we cannot afford to waste.''  So if unions, business, and civil rights groups, disability advocate organizations, and the States are not asking for this, we must ask the questions, Why are my colleagues jamming this resolution through? What perceived problem are we trying to solve?  Millions of students, parents, and teachers have made their voices heard about the importance of public education. They want us to work together to uphold and build on our bipartisan law, not for it to become just the latest partisan exercise that only hurts our students.  A vote against this resolution is a vote for our students, it is a vote for our schools, it is a vote not to give Secretary DeVos power she can abuse, and it is a vote to keep working together to build on this bipartisan law, not tear it apart.

626,topic-id,1039,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to once again urge my fellow Senators to vote against this resolution, which will weaken our bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act and will hurt students and schools across the country. I wish to quickly run through the reasons why passing this resolution will hurt our students.  First, voting for this resolution will throw States and school districts into chaos just as they are beginning to implement this law. Secretary DeVos has already sent a letter to State chiefs suggesting that a new State template for plan submission would be coming, less than a month before approximately 18 States and the District of Columbia intend to submit their plans. This timeline will not allow enough time for the stakeholder review process that is required in the law and may force States to reopen their plans and delay implementation of the law.  Secondly, the Every Student Succeeds Act is a civil rights law at its core. We know from experience that without strong accountability, kids from low-income neighborhoods, students of color, kids with disabilities, and students learning English too often fall through the cracks, and now it is up to all of us to uphold the civil rights legacy of the law and its promise for students by voting against this resolution.  I wish to spend a little more time on the third reason. It should concern all of us that if this resolution passes, it will give Secretary DeVos a blank check to promote her anti-public school agenda. During her confirmation process, my colleagues and millions of Americans saw that Secretary DeVos lacks a basic understanding of key concepts in public education policy, and even more concerning, she has openly questioned the role of the Federal Government in protecting our most vulnerable students.  After her hearings, millions of people across the country stood up, made their voices heard, and called on the Senate to reject her confirmation. Although she squeaked through with an unprecedented tie--the breaking vote from Vice President Pence--it was clear that Democrats, Republicans, and people across the country rejected her anti-public school agenda. Instead, they want the Department of Education to stand with students and with schools. We cannot in good conscience, through this rule, give Secretary DeVos another tool to promote her anti-public school agenda in ESSA implementation, and that is exactly what passing this resolution will do.  My colleagues across the aisle--the senior Senator from Tennessee made a number of claims in his remarks yesterday about this rule, and I want to go through a few of them because I believe they were off base on a number of levels.  First, the way my friend talked about what the law allows, or doesn't allow, in terms of rulemaking is absolutely wrong. Major laws like the Every Student Succeeds Act allow for and depend on Federal agencies to issue rules that help implement and clarify said laws. The Every Student Succeeds Act maintains the Secretary's overall authority to issue[[Page S1713]]rules and clarifications that are consistent with the law. This rule before us today is consistent with ESSA, and it provides important clarity to our States, our school districts, and our schools.  Secondly, the senior Senator from Tennessee misrepresented how this rule requires States to rate schools. While the Department's initial rule did require States to provide schools with a ``summative rating,'' my colleague across the aisle, as well as a number of education stakeholder groups, requested that the Department provide States more flexibility. The Department listened and took this out of the final rule which we are talking about today. In fact, the Council of Chief State School Officers, one of the groups who was concerned with the summative rating, said in a statement in response to this rule: ``It is clear the U.Department of Education listened to the feedback from state education chiefs across the country and made several important changes to ensure the accountability provisions in the Every Student Succeeds Act can be implemented in all States.'' And now the final rule only requires States to comply with ESSA in this area.  Finally, I want to say that my colleague was simply wrong in the way he talked about the impact of this rule on schools that are struggling. ESSA provides guardrails to make sure that grant sizes are sufficient to meet the needs of students, but it provides States with the flexibility to allot smaller grants to smaller sized districts and schools if that is what works best for them. But this rule in no way limits State decisionmaking in this area.  Those are just a few of the ways this rule was mischaracterized over the course of the debate. There were many others. I just have to say that it is disappointing because Democrats and Republicans worked together on this law. I thought there was a clear understanding of what the law intended. I assumed my colleagues understood what the Department was doing to implement our law in an open and collaborative way, and it is very concerning to me to hear such partisanship and false representations of our bipartisan law.  This rule does not dictate what States have to do in struggling schools. Instead, it balances the goals of ESSA--flexibility with Federal guardrails--and provides important clarity for our  A vote for this resolution is a vote to run away from the bipartisan nature of the Every Student Succeeds It is a blunt instrument and a significant step in the wrong direction, and it will have a serious impact on our students, our schools, and our districts across the country.  I am disheartened to see that my Republican colleagues are jamming this partisan play through in the same fashion they did with Secretary DeVos's nomination.  Over the past few months, millions of students, parents, and teachers have made their voices heard about the importance of public education to them. They want us to work together, and they want us to build on the bipartisan law. This resolution does exactly the opposite.

We are talking about large, corporate defendants. We are not worried about their emotions. Their litigation departments are quite capable of handling the emotions.  This bill will clog the Federal courts, drain judicial resources, upset well-established law, and delay justice for plaintiffs seeking to hold businesses accountable for the injuries they cause. It is yet another attempt by the Republican majority to stack the deck in favor of large corporations.  This bill is the opening salvo of this week's series of bills by the Republicans to close off access to the courts to ordinary With every step they take, whether it be to remove more State cases to Federal courts, to make class action suits more difficult to bring, or to reclassify more lawsuits as frivolous and subject to mandatory sanctions, they are limiting access to court help for ordinary  The so-called Innocent Party Protection Act would upend the century-old doctrine of fraudulent joinder, in which a defendant from the same State as the plaintiff is improperly added to a case in order to defeat diversity jurisdiction in Federal court, and, therefore, keep the case in a State court. Under current law, a defendant claiming fraudulent rejoinder has the burden of showing that there is ``no reasonable basis'' for a claim against the instate defendant, and, therefore, the case should remain in Federal court.  This bill would turn that process on its head by placing the burden on the plaintiff to show that there is a ``plausible'' claim against the instate defendant and that the plaintiff has a ``good faith intention'' to pursue a claim against that defendant. Both standards are undefined in the bill, but it is likely that many plaintiffs would find these hurdles impossible to overcome at the initial stages of litigation before discovery.[[Page H1971]]  Furthermore, defendants will use this forum shopping bill to delay justice by routinely challenging jurisdiction. It will drain court time and allow corporate defendants to force plaintiffs to expend their limited resources on what should be a simple procedural matter. Under this bill, the preliminary determination of jurisdiction would become a baseless, time-consuming mini-trial before a second time-consuming trial on the merits. While large corporations could easily accommodate such costs, injured workers, consumers, and patients cannot.  The practical effect of this bill is to force cases based on State law, which should properly be heard in State courts, to be considered in our overburdened Federal courts instead. Large corporations generally believe that Federal courts are a friendlier forum, especially since they are overburdened and they can afford to wait whereas the plaintiffs cannot, and they believe that they have a better chance of escaping liability for their actions in the Federal court.  There is no evidence of a systemic crisis of fraudulent joinder, nor is there evidence that the courts cannot properly handle whatever issues may arise under current law. There is certainly no evidence that what wealthy corporations need are greater advantages in the courts. Yet, this bill hands them yet another gift from the Republican majority, and it is ordinary consumers and injured workers who will suffer.  Mr.Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this legislation.

415,topic-id,549,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.985, the so-called Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency  This outrageous legislation would severely limit the ability of injured consumers and workers to obtain relief through class action lawsuits. If that were not bad enough, the bill also contains a totally unrelated measure to violate the privacy of asbestos victims, and subject them to potential discrimination. Together, this legislation is just one more measure in the Republican parade of bills this week to further tilt the playing field in favor of wealthy corporations over ordinary people.  Class action suits are an essential tool to enable victims of corporate wrongdoing to be compensated for their injuries and to deter future misconduct. Plaintiffs often seek to band together as a class when the potential damages they could receive individually are too low to make it practical to hire a lawyer and bring a lawsuit alone. But, as members of a class, they have the power to secure relief from a multimillion-dollar company and put an end to its illegal practices.  That is exactly why the big corporations oppose them. It makes it harder for those companies to operate with impunity from the law, with little regard for the injuries they may cause.  It was class action lawsuits that helped uncover years of corrupt practices in the tobacco industry and began to turn around a public health disaster, not to mention recover billions of dollars. It was class action lawsuits that revealed contamination of groundwater that cause certain forms of cancer. It was class action lawsuits that revealed fraudulent pricing practices and misleading advertising by drug companies, widespread employment discrimination, and predatory payday lending practices. Class action lawsuits also helped expose and bring down the sham university peddled on winning victims by the current occupant of the White  But this bill includes a range of provisions that would make such class action suits practically impossible. For example, it would require each member of a class to suffer ``the same type and scope of injury'' as the named class representative. What this means is that if two people use a defective product, but one suffers first-degree burns while the other person suffers third-degree burns, they cannot join together in a class because their injuries are of a different scope. Or take a company with a pattern of racial discrimination. If some workers are being paid less than others for doing the same job while other workers find themselves repeatedly passed over for deserved promotions, they cannot join in the same class action because they would not be deemed to have suffered the same type of injury--one having been paid less, the other having been passed over for promotions--despite being victims of the same discriminatory policies.  This is just one of a host of unnecessary and onerous requirements placed on victims by this bill that makes it virtually impossible to form a class. When added together, it amounts to a giant bailout for wealthy corporations at the expense of injured consumers and workers.  Mr.Chairman, we do not want the Federal courts to be simply collection agencies to large corporations. We need justice for the small, ordinary person.

758,topic-id,536,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.720, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction This bill is supposedly aimed at preventing frivolous litigation, but it would, in fact, generate a whole new set of litigation, further clogging our overburdened Federal courts.  Under rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court may impose sanctions on a party that files a frivolous case or motion. A party subject to a rule 11 violation has a 21-day safe harbor period to withdraw or correct its filing, and sanctions are purely discretionary. This rule serves a vital role in maintaining the integrity of our legal system without creating a chilling effect on presenting novel claims. Judges, when they see frivolous suits, can sanction them and do.  This bill, however, would restore a failed version of rule 11 that was enacted by the Judicial Conference in 1983, but which was repealed 10 years later because it led to disastrous results. Under this bill, sanctions would be mandatory whenever a court rules that rule 11 has been violated. The safe harbor period, when filings can be withdrawn or corrected, would be eliminated.  We do not have to speculate about what would happen as a result of this bill because we have a decade of experience that shows us how catastrophic it would be and was. Under the 1983 rule, which this bill would restore, rule 11 battles became a routine part of civil litigation, affecting one-third of all cases. Rather than serving as a disincentive, the old rule 11 actually made the system even more litigious.  In the decade following the 1983 amendments, there were almost 7,000 reported rule 11 cases, becoming part of approximately one-third of all Federal civil lawsuits. Civil cases effectively became two cases, one on the merits and the other on a set of dueling rule 11 allegations by both parties. The drain on the courts and the parties' resources caused the Judicial Conference to revisit the rule and adopt the changes that this bill would now have us undo.  More troubling was the 1983 rule's impact on civil rights cases, which are often based on novel claims that require significant discovery to establish. A 1991 Federal Judicial Center study found that whereas civil rights cases made up 11.4 percent of Federal cases filed, they constituted 22.7 percent of the cases in which sanctions were imposed. If we return to the old rule, we could see a chilling effect in which untested, but no less valid, civil rights claims are never brought for fear of sanctions.  The courts have ample authority to sanction conduct that undermines the integrity of our legal system. But this legislation is not just a solution in search of a problem. By taking us back to a time when rule 11 actually promoted routine, costly, and unnecessary litigation, this bill is a cure worse than the disease.  Given that we already know this bill will be a failure, one wonders how it would survive its own rule 11 motion if Congress had such a thing. The courts, having tried it for 10 years with disastrous results, rightly rejected this approach 20 years ago, and we should reject it again. I urge a ``no'' vote.

You would be putting a bunch of money in a wall, but you are losing the security of the border over here on the oceans.  The 42,000 member-strong Coast Guard plays a vital role in protecting our Nation from narcoterrorism, combating human smuggling, preventing and responding to maritime environmental disasters, and protecting lives and property at sea.  By the way, in other foreign parts of the globe, the U.Coast Guard is assisting the U.military in our military operations.  If securing our borders and supporting our military is a true priority for the administration, then it ought not be slashing the Coast Guard's budget. Instead, we should be supporting the Coast Guard's ongoing and much needed fleet recapitalization program, including the design and construction of the new offshore patrol cutter and the continued production of the new fast response cutter. These are desperately needed assets for the Coast  This Senator has personally visited dozens of Coast Guard units all around, not just in my State of Florida but in Alaska, the Great The job the Coast Guard does is amazing. What I have witnessed firsthand is what they do in service to our country.  The constant theme I have heard from my visits is the need to modernize and become increasingly more nimble, given the host of threats that could be delivered from our maritime borders. Let me give just one example.  In the Caribbean, it is a Coast Guard admiral who heads up the task force that has all agencies of government participating as we look to protect the southern borders in the Caribbean, as well as the southern Pacific, from anything that is coming to our borders--drugs, migrants, terrorists, whatever. It is all agencies involved, but if, for example, there are U.Navy ships in the area or Air Force assets in the air that might pick up one of these threats coming toward America, they work hand-in-glove with the Coast Guard because it is the Coast Guard that has the legal authority as a law enforcement agency to stop, apprehend, and board that vessel.  We are doing all of this border protection with cutters that have an average age of 45 years old. The average age of a Coast Guard 210-foot medium endurance cutter is 48 years old. The Coast Guard's high endurance cutter average age is 45 years. These are just two classes of ships that the Coast Guard uses for interdiction and rescue missions, and they do it worldwide.  As you may expect, with assets this old, the Coast Guard struggles with major, mission-debilitating casualties, which result in severe losses of operational days at sea and drastically increases maintenance costs. To correct that, the new offshore patrol cutters and the fast response cutters will give the Coast Guard an effective coastal and offshore interdiction capability in order to meet objectives. What are they? Combating transnational organized crime networks, securing our national maritime borders, safeguarding waterborne commerce, and safeguarding life and property at sea.  Looking at the administration's second target to pay for the wall, what is the second target? Believe it or not, FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management That agency comes to the aid of millions of Americans during any kind of natural disaster, and they are singling that out for cuts? That doesn't make common sense, and it certainly is not going to be a popular thing to do in the eyes of those who have to turn to FEMA after a natural disaster to try to get their lives back on track.  Last year, just taking 1 year as an example, two major hurricanes hit Florida, in addition to many other devastating natural disasters that struck nationwide and resulted in many deaths and billions of dollars of damage. FEMA was critical to people's survival and recovery in each of those events. Just think of what we hear on the news all the time. There are storms, tornadoes, earthquakes. Remember the mountain that erupted out in the State of Washington decades ago, not to mention hurricanes.  For the sake of people's safety and that of our country, we simply cannot use FEMA as a piggy bank to pay for the administration's trillion-dollar spending programs.  The administration's third target--this has just been reported. What is the third target? You are not going to believe this. It is TSA, the Transportation Security If we target TSA for budget cuts--is that really what we want to do in a threat environment? Every time we go through an airport, TSA is on the frontlines of protecting our country from terrorist attacks. That is its security mission at airports across the country--and, by the way, with the air marshals who fly on our flights. Need I remind the administration why TSA was created? It was after the September 11 attacks in 2001.  Funding is vital to ensure the success of TSA's mission. In fact, just last year Congress responded to concerns over insider threats and security at airports, such as the bombings in Brussels and Istanbul, with the most extensive security-related measures in years. Specifically, what we did, particularly in the Commerce Committee when we formulated the FAA bill, is we included bipartisan provisions enhancing the background and vetting requirements for airport employees and expanded the random and physical inspection of airport employees in secure areas.  Remember the case at the Atlanta Airport? For several months, people had a gun-running scheme going from Atlanta to New They didn't drive up Interstate 95 to take the guns; they had an airport employee in Atlanta[[Page S1673]]who could get into the airport, without being checked, carrying a sack of guns. That airport employee would go up into the sterile area where passengers are, go into the men's room, and would exchange knapsacks with a passenger who had come through TSA clean, and that passenger took the sack of guns on the airplane flight from Atlanta to New The New York City Police Department couldn't figure out how they were getting all those guns on the streets of New That was a gun-running scheme over several months. Thank goodness they were criminals and not terrorists. And you want to cut that kind of security?  Do you want to cut the strongest security we have at an airport when screening passengers who are going through? It is the nose of a dog, the VIPR teams. The trained dog teams and their handlers are the most efficient way to screen passengers. It is amazing what those dogs can sense. When we did the FAA bill last year, we doubled the number of VIPR teams, the dog teams, and you want to cut this? That was all done in a bipartisan manner. We doubled the number for the protection of the American public.  In that bill, we also expanded the grant funding to assist law enforcement in responding to mass casualty and active-shooter incidents, which is very important. Another tragic example of that is the recent shooting in Fort Lauderdale at the airport.  To counter the issue of long lines, which I know we all had to go through last spring, the legislation included provisions to expand TSA Precheck and require the TSA to evaluate staffing and checkpoint configurations in order to expedite passenger security screening.  Does that sound like a bunch of administrative mumbo jumbo? Let me tell you that it works and that all of it is designed to protect Americans going to airports and getting on airplanes.  None of this is possible without continued funding and, in fact, even more funding. Any cuts are certainly going to impair the TSA's ability to keep our country safe.  The bottom line here is that we must do whatever is necessary to keep our country safe and our citizens secure. Slashing the budgets of the U.Coast Guard or FEMA or the TSA is only going to make us less secure.  Need I say more about these proposals to pay for some of these other things, like a wall, by slashing these kinds of budgets?  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Gardner).

984,topic-id,917,"Mr.President, I want to talk about In my State of Florida, there are nearly 2 million people who are covered through the Affordable Care Act, through healthcare.gov. The State of Florida leads the way with the highest ACA marketplace enrollment numbers. In my State, there are another 9 million people who get their health coverage from their employers.  This group also benefits from the ACA's protections, like prohibitions against lifetime limits on insurance and discriminating against people with preexisting conditions. In our State, almost 8 million people have preexisting conditions, which includes something as common as asthma.  Before the ACA, people undergoing lifesaving cancer treatments were being told by their insurance companies they would no longer cover those treatments. Now, under the current law, the ACA, insurance companies can no longer discriminate against preexisting conditions, and your children are going to be able to stay on your family policy until they are age 26. By the way, that is another 4 million people in the United Four million young people up to age 26 now get health insurance who didn't get it before the  What has come out of the House of Representatives--what I will refer to as TrumpCare--called the American Health Care Act--has some very troubling provisions. The House plan would mean 14 million people would lose coverage next year. That number, according to the CBO, would rise to 24 million people who have healthcare coverage now and would lose it--24 million people.  TrumpCare would also mean an end to Medicaid as we know it because it comes in and caps It shifts the cost of Medicaid from the Federal Government to the State governments. If you happen to be a State that has not expanded Medicaid--as is allowed under the ACA, expanding it up to 138 percent of poverty--and if you are one of the 16 States, like my State, that hasn't expanded it, you are going to get a double whammy. You are going to have your Medicaid amount from the Federal Government, called the block grant, capped, and it is going to be capped at your level instead of the higher level because you hadn't expanded your  The TrumpCare out of the House of Representatives is going to get rid of the financial assistance that has helped so many get health coverage. The bottom line is--and this is what the CBO says--folks are going to pay more, and they are going to get less. They are going to get less coverage.  What else does TrumpCare do? In fact, it cuts the taxes for the wealthy, and it shifts the financial burden of healthcare more to the poor. It would allow insurance companies to charge seniors up to five times more than younger Now, the existing law--the ACA--has age done in three groups. You can only charge an older person on their premiums, according to their age, three times more than you can charge a younger person. Under TrumpCare, out of the House of Representatives, they will be able to charge seniors five times more than young people in their health insurance premiums.  It would scrap Medicaid expansion and fundamentally change the Medicaid According to CBO, the Republican House TrumpCare bill will cut Medicaid by $880 billion over 10 years. They are saying it will reduce the deficit by some $330 billion over 10 years. That is a good thing. But, oh, by the way, it cuts Medicaid by $880 billion over 10 years. It is my understanding that as to the capping of Medicaid, you have to pay for it someplace. If the Federal Government is not paying for it, as it is under the ACA, it is going to shift the cost to the States, or else the State is not going to provide the Federal-State And what does that mean? That means poor people go without healthcare. I don't think we want to do that.  Obviously, the ACA isn't perfect. Instead of its being repealed, it ought to be fixed. But there doesn't seem to be an appetite over in the House of They want to repeal it and create something new called TrumpCare, all of which I have just described.  The problem before was that poorer people could not afford health insurance, or they couldn't get it because of a preexisting condition. If you did have coverage and you got sick, your insurance company just could drop you. People who didn't have coverage were avoiding going to the doctor until their condition got so bad that, when they were in an emergency, they would end up at the most expensive place--emergency rooms--at the most expensive time. So they hadn't done the preventive care and, therefore, the emergency occurred.  The ACA isn't perfect, but it was needed to fix a system that was broken. We need to focus on fixing things that need to be fixed, while preserving[[Page S1800]]so many of the parts that are working--that now 24 million people in this country get healthcare who otherwise will have it taken away from them. That is not right. That is not the right thing to do. We don't want to treat our fellow human beings that way.  To recapitulate, what does the House of Representatives' TrumpCare plan do?  It cuts It has higher costs and less coverage. It cuts taxes for the wealthy, and it increases costs to seniors.  I think we want to do exactly the opposite of what it does.  I yield the floor.

528,topic-id,606,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend for his leadership on this issue this evening and throughout this year. I also want to thank him for the opportunity to address the House of Representatives on this very important issue that we are dealing with right now.  Mr.Speaker, throughout my time representing the good people of central Washington State in the U.Congress, constituents from across my district, the Fourth District, have shared with me their deeply personal stories. These are personal stories about the struggles and the hardships that they have experienced and that they have faced since the passage of the Affordable Care  So let me just relate to you a couple of those because I think they are very important and help illustrate exactly what it is that we are trying to correct.  In late 2016, a gentleman from the city of Yakima wrote to me in distress, as his insurance provider was pulling out of Yakima  He told me: My wife and I are losing our healthcare coverage. Our financial lives are about to be radically changed and a literal risk to our health is upon us. The challenge to find affordable, acceptable healthcare insurance will be immense.  That is not unlike another story that I heard in early 2015. A young woman from Grandview wrote to describe her dire situation being forced on to the Affordable Care Act exchange.  She told me: I was paying $231 a month for a policy that had a $500 deductible with a $10 copay.  However, under the ACA, she said her healthcare costs have skyrocketed.  She continues: I now pay $475 a month for a policy that has a $5,500 deductible. This is not affordable health care.  It is the middle class American who has worked hard to have a good retirement who is being hit hard by this.[[Page H2014]]  Another gentleman from West Richland recently pleaded that the many middle class workers like him must not be forgotten as we repeal and replace this broken law.  He says: Do not forget us when fixing. We liked our plan, and we lost it.  Just last week, a farmer from Moses Lake called my office and said that, before the ACA, he was paying less than $200 a month for a catastrophic plan that provided coverage for his family. Now he is forced to pay $1,000 a month with high deductibles that discourage his family from even being able to use and access the healthcare insurance that they are paying for.  These are just some of the many stories of the dozens, the hundreds that I have been hearing from over the last couple of years since I started representing the good people of central  Like I said, these are true stories, personal stories of the struggles that people are facing on a daily basis and have pleaded with us to take strong action to deliver them from this situation that they find themselves in. I think it is similar across the country. As you hear tonight from other Members speaking about their districts, you are hearing similar stories.  So that is something that, I think, as we debate the best way to repeal and to replace the Affordable Care Act, I am committed to ensuring that we protect the most vulnerable.  I am also committed to providing relief for the majority of everyday, middle class Americans who have been devastated by this misguided and broken law.  Let me just say: I hear you, I will not forget about you, and I will keep your stories at the forefront of my mind as we work to fix this failed system.

384,topic-id,1092,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, we have seen a number of bills this session which are designed to shut the door on victims of corporate misfeasance and negligence and to nail the door shut. H.725 is part of this wave of legislation.  Like most other bills we have seen this session with brazenly Orwellian titles, the so-called Innocent Party Protection Act of 2017 has nothing to do with protecting innocent parties. Rather, it is just the latest attempt to tilt the civil justice system dramatically in favor of big corporate defendants by making it much more difficult for plaintiffs to pursue State law claims in State courts under the system of federalism designed by our  Again, this is a familiar experience because the bill addresses a completely nonexistent problem. If there had been a real problem, the Judiciary Committee might have held a hearing in which we could have invited groups to come forward who support tort victims. They could have come and testified about why it was so important for the interests of civil justice for us to pass this legislation.  But there was no hearing at all. We didn't hear any witnesses, much less the testimony of those groups that represent victims of mass toxic torts, asbestos poisoning, lead poisoning, sex discrimination lawsuits--none of it.  In fact, the groups that we would have called, if we were interested in the testimony of victims and people seeking civil justice, oppose this legislation overwhelmingly: the Alliance for Justice opposes it; the Center for Justice and Democracy opposes it; the Consumer Federation of America opposes it; the National Association of Consumer Advocates opposes it; the National Consumer Law Center opposes it; the Natural Resources Defense Council opposes it; Public Citizen opposes it; the Sierra Club opposes it.  Under current law, a defendant may remove a case, alleging State law claims, to a Federal court only if there is complete diversity of citizenship between all plaintiffs and all defendants. If the plaintiff adds an instate defendant to the case solely for the purpose of defeating jurisdiction, this constitutes fraudulent joinder today; and in such circumstances, the case may be removed directly to Federal court.  In determining whether a joinder was fraudulent, the court considers only whether there was any basis for a claim against the nondiverse defendant. The defendant must show that there was no possibility of recovery or no reasonable basis for adding the nondiverse defendant to the suit.  This very high standard has guided our Federal courts for more than a century and it has functioned well, and the bill's proponents offer no objective evidence to the contrary. And again, we have had no hearing. For a new Member of Congress like me, who comes from the Maryland State Senate, I am absolutely astonished and amazed that we would think of overturning a standard fixture in our civil justice system without so much as a hearing as to what the problem is.  H.725 would replace a time-honored standard with an ambiguous one that would dramatically increase the costs and burdens of litigation on plaintiffs in Federal courts. It would try to strip our State courts of their basic powers to hear cases relating to their citizens. This is an assault on federalism.  The measure would require a court to deny a motion remanding to the State[[Page H1970]]courts unless the court finds, one, that it is ``plausible to conclude that applicable State law would impose liability'' on an instate defendant; two, that the plaintiff had a ``good faith intention to prosecute the action against each'' instate defendant or to seek a joint judgment; and three, that there was no ``actual fraud in the pleading of jurisdictional facts.''  This gauntlet of hurdles suddenly shifts the burden and creates a presumption that a Federal court should hear the case, making it far more expensive and difficult for plaintiffs to have their cases heard in State court.  H.725 would effectively overturn the local defendant exception, which prohibits removal to Federal court even if complete diversity of citizenship exists when the defendant is a citizen of the State where the suit was filed.  The bill's radical changes to longstanding jurisdictional practice reveal the authentic purpose behind the measure. It is simply intended to stifle the ability of plaintiffs to have their choice of forum and, possibly, even their day in court.  In addition, H.725 would sharply increase the cost of litigation for plaintiffs and further burden the Federal court system. For example, the meanings of terms like ``plausible'' and ``good faith intention'' are ambiguous and will spawn substantial litigation over their proper interpretation and application, further postponing decisions and justice.  Additionally, these standards would require a court to engage in a mini-trial during the early procedural stages of the case without any opportunity for the full development of evidence. Again, this would sharply increase the burdens and costs of litigation for ordinary citizens, for plaintiffs, which appears to be, to my mind, the only possible contemplated result of this legislation.  Finally, we need to focus on the fact that this bill offered by the majority raises profound federalism concerns, which I would have hoped they would be attentive to. Matters of State law should be decided by State courts, subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the  It was our constitutional design that matters of civil dispute and conflict go to State courts, State judges, and State juries, all of them closer to the people themselves, unless you have a Federal question, a matter of Federal statutory law, a matter of Federal constitutional law, or you have got diversity jurisdiction.  H.725 bulldozes this key federalism constraint and casts a shadow, unnecessarily and improperly, over State courts, the courts of the people. By applying sweeping and vaguely worded new standards to the determination of when a State case must be remanded to State court, the bill denies State courts the ability to decide and, ultimately, to shape the unfolding of State law. This is completely contrary to the design of the Founders, many of them Virginians, like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and George Mason, who wanted the State courts to be the central arena for the resolution of civil conflicts and tort disputes.  Simply put, H.725 tramples State sovereignty and our basic constitutional structure. For these reasons and for the fact that nobody has demonstrated there is a real problem, I urge the House to resist this unnecessary and flawed legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

391,topic-id,569,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I think that we are actually progressing in our discussion of the issue because we presently have a law against fraudulent joinder. They simply want to make it far more difficult for plaintiffs to get justice in State courts. The law already makes it impossible to fraudulently join someone.  So in the case offered by the distinguished gentleman from Georgia, I could very much see an out-of-State corporate behemoth that owns nursing homes across the country saying that all of this should be in Federal court because the person who actually committed the sexual assault instate is judgment-proof because they don't have any money and that is not really a plausible opportunity to recover, and, therefore, it should stay in Federal court.  The grand irony here, Mr.Chairman, is that the party which sings lullabies about federalism and states' rights is in the business of stripping our State courts and our people of the opportunity to get into State court. All of this is about forcing everybody into Federal court. I remember a President who recently said in his inaugural address that the whole sum and substance of his administration is to give power back to the States and back to the people, but this legislation is designed to wreck federalism and to force everybody into Federal court where the big corporate defendants and the fancy lawyers have every conceivable advantage over people who are just trying to get justice when they have been injured in their  Mr.Chairman, the substantive issues at stake here are obviously complex, and I would invite all Americans to try to research what is going on. But if you don't have the time to actually study the more than a century in which we have had current fraudulent joinder rules and you don't have time to go and examine the bill as submitted by the majority, then just consider the procedure that has gotten us to this point.  There has been no hearing on this bill, there has been no call for this bill by anybody who has been injured in a civil tort case, and all of the groups that try to stand up for citizens against the largest corporations who are bankrolled by billions of dollars and are trying to force everybody these days into arbitration and to shut the courthouse door, all of those groups are opposed to the legislation because they understand what it is going to do.  It is going to make it far more difficult for people to prosecute civil[[Page H1972]]claims when they have been injured in something like a sexual harassment case, a sexual violence case, a discrimination case, an asbestos poisoning case, or a mass toxic tort. It is going to be far more difficult for people to get justice in their State courts.  Apparently, the interests of the large corporate polluters and inflictors of injuries--tortfeasors--are so important that we are willing to trample the basic principles of our constitutional design which is that these kinds of cases go into State court for State resolution, we reserve the Federal courts for complicated questions of Federal law and real cases of diversity jurisdiction, not phony cases of diversity jurisdiction where they try to eliminate the instate defendant, but real cases of diversity jurisdiction where nobody else is involved.

412,topic-id,977,"I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.985, the so-called Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claims Transparency Act of 2017.  I want to thank my distinguished colleague from Texas for his presentation and for also making clear that the overriding purpose here is really to give the class action mechanism the guillotine. Now, this doesn't formally abolish the class action mechanism. It is not the guillotine, but it is a straitjacket. Let's be very clear, the whole purpose of this legislation is to make it virtually impossible for class action lawsuits to be brought by groups of citizens who share a common injury from things such as consumer rip-offs, pharmaceutical drug mistakes, faulty product design, sex discrimination, sexual harassment, poisonous breast implants, asbestos poisoning, lead poisoning, and so on--all of the billions of dollars worth of tort actions, nothing fraudulent about them, all of them already determined by courts and by juries to have taken place against our citizens, and they want to make it virtually impossible for people to proceed in court under the class action mechanism.  I began with a very important process observation which I noted before, Mr.There has been no hearing on this legislation. There have been[[Page H1976]]no calls for this legislation from people allegedly suffering the horrors of the reviled class action lawyers. I notice that while my thoughtful colleague from Texas uses much of his time to deplore the work of plaintiffs' lawyers, he says nothing about defendants' lawyers, who have defended guilty parties in all of the cases we have mentioned before--all of the mass toxic torts, all of the drug injury cases, all of the environmental crimes and torts, all the asbestos poisoning and so on--and they have got a right to do that. They are simply doing their job. But the plaintiffs' lawyers have a right to do their job, too. That is how our system works.  I find it fundamentally disturbing that anybody would be out denouncing lawyers for representing people who have been injured in a tort case. But I oppose this misguided legislation because it sends another huge Valentine and wet kiss to large corporate polluters and tortfeasors but gives the finger to millions of American citizens who suffer injuries from these defendants.  This legislation would shield corporate wrongdoers by making it far more difficult for them to get together to obtain justice in a class action lawsuit. So whether it is by making it almost impossible for Americans to pursue their day in court through the class action vehicle or threatening the privacy of asbestos victims, it is clear that H.985 wants to give corporate polluters and tortfeasors the power to play hide-and-go-seek with their victims in Federal court whenever they want to.                              {time}  1600  And it raises the broader question of who rightfully should hold power in a representative democracy like ours. Should it be large, private corporations, who are seeking rightfully their own profits? Or should it be the people, who are supposed to be sovereign?  I say it is the people.  This bill only favors the interests of the already powerful, to the detriment of the vast majority of the American people.  In cases seeking monetary relief, the bill requires a party seeking class certification to show that every potential class member suffered the same type and scope of injury at the certification stage, something that is virtually impossible to do. This requirement alone would sound the death knell for class actions, which are the principal means we have in court for consumers to hold wrongdoers accountable, without having to engage in multiple duplicative actions all over a State or all over the country, piling up the expenses for courts.  Most importantly, class actions make it feasible for those who have smaller but not inconsequential injuries to get justice. These injuries include diverse matters like products liability, employment discrimination, sexual harassment, and so on.  It is already very difficult to pursue class actions. Under current law, the courts strictly limit the grounds by which a large group of plaintiffs may be certified as a class, including the existing requirement that their claims raise common and factual legal questions, and that the class representative's claims must be typical of those of the other class members.  Finally, title II of H.985 gives asbestos defendants--the very entities whose products have injured millions of Americans--new weapons with which to go out and harm their victims. This part of the bill would require a bankruptcy asbestos trust to report on the court's public case docket--which is then made immediately available on the internet--the name and exposure history of each asbestos victim who gets payment from a trust, as well as the basis of any payment made to that victim.  As a result, the confidential personal information of asbestos claimants, including their names and entire exposure histories, would be irretrievably released into the public domain. Imagine what identity thieves, reporters, insurers, potential employers, lenders, and data collectors could do with this sensitive information.  The proper title of this section of H.985 should be the alternative fact act, not the FACT Act, because it penalizes the victims while favoring the perpetrators.  The bill requires the trusts to make intrusive disclosures of victims' personal information, but it makes no comparable demands on asbestos manufacturers, some of which intentionally concealed the life-threatening dangers of their products not just for months or years, but for decades, the result of which millions of unsuspecting workers and consumers were exposed to this toxic substance.  Essentially, this bill re-victimizes asbestos victims by exposing their private information to all of the world--information that has absolutely nothing to do with compensation for asbestos exposure.  Accordingly, I must oppose also this highly flawed provision of the legislation.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

427,topic-id,571,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We obviously have a different vantage point on what is taking place in the civil courtrooms of America today. On our side, we look out over America and in the courts and we see millions of our neighbors, our fellow citizens who are suffering the effects of asbestos poisoning, which is real, not imaginary; lead poisoning, which is real, not imaginary; and manufacturing defects by large automobile manufacturers and others.  They look at it and all they see is fraud, and they want to put the class action mechanism in a straightjacket to make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for people to pursue class actions. They want to put the names of asbestos victims up online for the whole world to see.  Obviously, we have got a division of opinion within the legislative branch. What about the judiciary itself?  Well, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the policymaking arm of the Federal judiciary, and the American Bar Association both strongly oppose H.985. The conference report that has been studying class actions for 5 years has considered many of the issues addressed in H.985. It strongly urges Congress not to amend the class action procedures found in rule 23 outside the Rules Enabling Act process.                              {time}  1630  Likewise, the ABA observes the many problems of advancing comprehensive class action reform without a hearing to examine all the complicated issues involved with so many rule changes.  Mr.Chairman, the other side invoked some hearings. I was astonished to hear it because I have been here for several months. I just joined I didn't have any hearings. It turns out I understand they were referring to[[Page H1980]]hearings that took place last year, perhaps the year before, where I understand--but all of it is hearsay to me because I wasn't here--that actual victims of asbestos poisoning were not permitted themselves to testify. It was a completely one-sided, lopsided process, and I will try to get to the bottom of that in order to determine it.  This is what happens when they are moving legislation through this body at lightening speed, but really in the thick of darkness because we don't have any meaningful, transparent communication about what the underlying issues are.  Well, I restate my opposition to this. The class action mechanism has been a central vehicle for justice for Americans for many decades. And now without so much as a hearing, without the mobilization of any proof that this should be done over the objections of the Judicial Conference of the United States, over the objections of the American Bar Association, and over the objections of every consumer group and worker group that has written in that I have seen, they are purporting to be acting in the name of the American people. In fact, what they are doing is they are pulling the rug out from underneath the class action vehicle.  Class actions have been so central to vindicating the rights of people who have been victimized by corporate polluters and toxic contaminators and automobile manufacturers who knowingly put defective instruments into cars, leading to people's deaths and injuries, and they want to make it more difficult for people to pursue justice in the courts.  I urge all of my colleagues to study this legislation the best they can and to reject it.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

432,topic-id,457,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to the manager's amendment to H.985 with all due deference to the chair of our committee.  Although the amendment makes a number of mostly technical amendments to the bill, it still fails to address the numerous fundamental flaws that we have identified in the underlying legislation, which is a dagger pointing at the heart of class action lawsuits in  The major substantive change that I noted under the manager's amendment was that class certification would still be prohibited when a named plaintiff or class representative is a relative or employee of the class counsel, but made some other changes narrowing the scope of the conflict of interest provision slightly. The amendment still fails to address the fundamental problem with that provision, which is that there is no justification for concluding that the specified relationships are, per se, problematic or that class certification should be denied just because such a relationship exists.  The general problem pervading the legislation remains. The first is a procedural problem, which we have identified.  I was delighted that the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Farenthold) responded to our complaint that we had had no hearings on the bill. In response to that, he directed my attention to a hearing that took place in 2011, 6 years ago.  There are nine members of the Judiciary Committee who just joined this year and many dozens of Members who have joined the House since 2011. It is true that we could go back and read it within the 24 hours we had to do that before the markup took place. We could also go back and just read at that point the Constitution of the United States, which guarantees to everybody a jury trial which attempts to establish civil justice in  What we are getting instead is an attempt to put class action lawsuits and civil liability into a straitjacket. It is an attempt to make it far harder for people to see their rights vindicated when they have been violated by an auto manufacturer, someone who is putting asbestos into materials that are being used near servicemembers, those who are selling poisonous breast implants, and so on.  I am rising in opposition to the amendment simply because it does nothing to answer the many massive objections leveled against this legislation by consumer groups like the Consumer Federation of America, by groups defending civil justice, like the Alliance for Justice, and indeed by the Judicial Conference of the United States and the American Bar Association, both of which strongly oppose this legislation because they do not think it is warranted. They don't think that it responds to any problems that are really out there.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1974.txt,2332,1330,2017.0,9.0,March

515,topic-id,791,"Mr.Speaker, I am going to yield to my colleague from Minnesota, Mr.It was 7 years ago in March 2010 that President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law extending access to affordable health insurance coverage to more than 20 million previously uninsured  Insurance companies under the new law could no longer deny you insurance because you had a preexisting condition, and, surely, that makes sense. The fact that you have a preexisting medical condition should be the reason that you get health insurance, not the reason you get denied health insurance.  Also, under the new ACA, young people up to age 26 could stay on their family plans, which helps families like mine because I have got a 22-year-old, a 20-year-old, and a 25-year-old. And believe me, they would not have health insurance if not for the Affordable Care Act, and I think my situation is that of millions of people across the country.  But today, the ACA is in mortal danger. The House GOP finally unveiled their plan for repealing and replacing the ACA with something else, which I call the unaffordable care act, that will cost millions of people their health insurance, increase everybody's premiums, reduce everybody's coverage, and bring incoherence and chaos into the system.  Mr.Speaker, I am going to yield to Mr.Ellison in just a moment to talk about what is going on with this legislation. But I do want to say something about the process by which we arrived here, because back when the Affordable Care Act was being debated--and I[[Page H2007]]wasn't in Congress then, so I approach this just as a historian--there were multiple complaints from the GOP Members about how fast things were going, how the legislation was being rammed through.  For example, our now-Speaker Paul Ryan said about the ACA: ``Congress is moving fast to rush through a healthcare overhaul that lacks a key ingredient,'' he said, ``the full participation of you, the American people.''  Greg Walden, the Energy and Commerce chairman from Oregon, said: On a bill of this significance, you would think we would at least allow people to come in who are affected by the extraordinary changes in this bill, and have a chance to let us know how it affects them.  And the Ways and Means Committee chairman today, Kevin Brady, said: The Democratic Congress and White House simply aren't listening. The Democrats are ramming it through over the public's objections.  Well, let's go back and look at how long it took the Democrats to get the Affordable Care Act passed and how much public participation and debate there really was.  Here in Congress, there were 79 hearings--I repeat, 79 hearings--on the Affordable Care  There were 181 witnesses, both expert witnesses and members of the public, citizens coming to testify about the need for expanded health insurance coverage for the American people because of the high expenses of health insurance and the rip-offs of various insurance companies.  There were multiple scores that were received from the Congressional Budget Office during that time, as there was constant attention to the budgetary and fiscal implications of the Affordable Care  Now, fast-forward to today. We took a year-and-a-half to get to the Affordable Care How about them? Well, let's see.  The Republicans introduced their bill on They passed their bill in the dead of night, at 4:30 in the morning, 3 days later. There have been no hearings on the bill. There have been no witnesses to testify on the bill. There have been no expert witnesses. There have been no witnesses from the public.  There is no analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on how much the bill will cost American taxpayers, American citizens, on their plans or how many Americans will lose their health care at all.  In other words, the party that complained about how fast the Affordable Care Act came into being, which was over the course of a year and a half with dozens of hearings, and dozens and dozens--more than 100 witnesses and lots of public debate where we went back to our districts and had townhall meetings, where there was orchestrated opposition against the plan, but we still stood there and we engaged in the dialogue, and we stood up for the Affordable Care The people who said that that was too fast are now ramming through, at unprecedented, breakneck, lightning speed, a bill that will wreak devastation on the healthcare rights of the American people.  That is what is taking place. If you have got a contaminated, clandestine, secret, closed process, it will produce a terrible, undemocratic, and unhealthy result. That is what we are going to describe to you tonight.  I am delighted to yield to my colleague from Minnesota (Mr.Ellison.)  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH2006-4.txt,2332,VECCHIO,2017.0,9.0,March
517,topic-id,1785,"Mr.Speaker, I hope the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.Ellison) will stick around. I want to salute him and congratulate him on his new position, not only as a leading Member of the United States House of Representatives, but now as vice chairman of the Democratic National  All of your colleagues are beaming with pride about your accomplishments and about your national political leadership, and we are delighted that the rest of the country is going to get to share in your leadership now in your new aggressive role out organizing opposition to what is taking place in Washington today.  I want to take a little break from railing about this unaffordable care act that is going to drive everybody's rates up and throw millions of people off their health insurance.  I want to say a couple of good things that President Trump said as a candidate because he attacked ObamaCare, but he said he wanted a system that covered everybody. He's been quoted many times speaking in favor of a single-payer plan that would cover every citizen. Now, that talk has completely dried up. It has vanished and disappeared.  I urge President Trump to go back to his original instinct, which is that, if you are going to repeal and replace ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act, as he keeps saying--let's replace it with the kind of system they have in Canada, they have in Europe, and just cover everybody. That would be the direction to go in. But to go backwards to throw millions of people off their health care is precisely what the American people don't want.  Now, here is another proposal that President Trump mentioned in passing when he stood in this Chamber the other night. He said: Let's repeal the special interest lobbyist provision that was snuck into Medicare part D, saying that the government could not negotiate for lower drug prices with the pharmaceutical companies.  Again, that was a very popular talking point for Donald Trump when he was running for He campaigned like Williams Jennings Bryan, but he is governing like William McKinley; that is, a cabinet filed with CEOs and billionaires. He did mention that. That was one tiny crumb, a remnant of the populist campaign he ran.  I urge my Republican colleagues to throw this terrible bill that they are going to waste everybody's time on, that cannot pass, which their Freedom Caucus is totally opposed to; and, instead, focus, at least, on something we can agree on, which is that the 25 or $30 billion that that special interest provision is costing us should be saved. We should allow the government to negotiate for lower drug prices in the Medicare program the way we are allowed to negotiate for lower drug prices in the Medicaid program and in the VA program.  So we can work together in a bipartisan basis. However, we are not going to allow anybody to throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance plan while driving up everybody else's rates and bringing the whole healthcare system to the brink of ruin.  When I got elected to Congress, I went down to the basement of the Longworth House Office Building after I was sworn in to sign up for my health care because we get health care as part of our jobs as Members of We pay for it through the local ACA healthcare exchange in the District of Columbia, but we are guaranteed the right to get that because of the Affordable Care  When I went down that morning, I was signing up and I was looking[[Page H2009]]through the memo about what we would be doing during my first week in Congress here. Sure enough, I saw that the GOP leadership had put on there a procedural proposal to set the stage for the dismantling of the Affordable Care  I looked up to see a line of my new colleagues waiting to come and sign up for their health care. Some of them I recognized as my Democratic colleagues, and some of them I recognized as my new distinguished Republican colleagues. And I said to myself: Wait a second. Please tell me that we are not going to have new Members of Congress come in here and sign up for their own health care that they get as part of their job as Representatives in the United States House of Representatives and then go upstairs to this floor to vote to strip millions of people of their health care.  Surely that is not what democratic representation means in the 21st century; that we get to have health care through our jobs, but we are going to take away the health care that other people have. But, my friends, I am sorry to say that is the reality that we are in this week.  Congressman Ellison is right, we are not taking the position that the Affordable Care Act is perfect. Far from it. I wasn't in Congress then. I don't know if the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.Ellison) was. I wasn't in Congress then. But had I been in Congress, I would have been fighting for a single-payer plan.  I am on legislation this session to support a single-payer plan. In other words, the Affordable Care Act, for me, doesn't go far enough in guaranteeing that everybody has health care and in dramatically reducing the role of the insurance companies so we can spend more money on health care and less money on red tape and bureaucracy.  So the Affordable Care Act, which I support with all of my heart right now against all the attacks to dismantle it, was a compromise. It was a very carefully crafted compromise. Remember, we had more than 100 witnesses come and testify about it. They had zero on their crash-and-burn legislation this week. We had dozens and dozens of hearings where we had witnesses come and testify about it. They have had zero on their crash-and-cash legislation--crash the system and give cash to the insurance companies and the wealthiest people in the country. So we had an open process, and it was a compromise.  I remember very clearly as a State senator in Maryland watching President Obama on TV saying, if we are starting from scratch, he would be in favor of a single-payer plan. He said that would be the logical way to go. It is what they have in It is what they have in Canada and  He said we are path dependent. We are on a particular path. We understand the role that the big insurance companies play, and they have got a lot of political power, and we have got everybody on the GOP side screaming and shouting for the insurance companies. So he said let's figure out a plan where we keep the insurance companies involved.  Guess what? That plan was hatched at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, much beloved and revered by the GOP Members of this body. It was the exact same plan that Governor Mitt Romney, their standard bearer running for President a couple of elections ago, put into place in  The Affordable Care Act was the compromise. Now everybody is on their case because they are hiding under their desks, they are running away from their constituents, and they are canceling their townhalls. Nobody could get a plan out of them.  Suddenly they pull a plan out of their sleeve in the middle of the night. They rush it through this body. They voted on it at, I think, 4:30 in the morning after a 27-hour hearing. Everything is meant to be under the cloak of darkness, and people are making fun of them about how silly it is.  I sympathize with them because there is nothing they can do because the Affordable Care Act was the compromise. Now, they wanted to name it ObamaCare, of course, because they couldn't stand the idea that President Obama would get the political credit for bringing tens of millions of Americans health insurance. So they had to name it on him and then make up all of these stories about how terrible it was.  Guess what? They wake up today. Nobody is calling it ObamaCare anymore. President Obama is doing his own thing. They are calling it the Affordable Care Act, and people are defending it all over the country in 50 States in every congressional district.  You have got indivisible groups that have grown up all over the place, and my dear colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle are afraid to face their own constituents. They are canceling their townhalls, they are hiding under their beds and behind their office sofas, which, in many cases, are the exact same pieces of furniture because they sleep in their offices here. They don't want to face the people and the fact that we do not want to turn the clock back and go backwards and wreck this system. It is a lot easier to destroy things than to build things.  So we urge the GOP: If you want to meet to make real substantial improvements, expansion of the Affordable Care Act to include more people, to reduce the cost of the bureaucracy, let's do it. But your plan is a terrible plan. Your plan is one that is going to throw millions of people off of their health insurance. Your plan is one that is built around a huge tax break and transfer of wealth upwards in the country--one of the biggest transfers of wealth in the country ever to go in the northward direction.  It is an amazing thing that that is how they have designed their plan.  So it is a huge tax break to the insurance companies and to the wealthiest people, and millions of others are thrown off of their insurance plans. Everybody else's premiums are going to be soaring, and the whole system is likely to come crashing down.  If a foreign government like Russia, for example, were trying to do this to us, we would consider it an act of aggression, an act of war against the American people in our health care. But this is, instead, coming from what used to be one of our great political parties, the party of that President who talked about government of the people, by the people, and for the people.  We have, instead, a wrecking ball targeted right at you, the American people, coming after your health insurance, your health care, your ability to participate as a citizen in our healthcare system. That is a remarkable thing to be taking place in 2017.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the thoughtful gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.Ellison).  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH2006-4.txt,2332,TRIBUTE TO ROBERT K.

520,topic-id,1480,"Mr.Speaker, I just want to tie up some loose ends by exploring a few of the points that Mr.Ellison raised. But one of the very messy features of this legislation that is barreling through Congress this week is that the GOP leadership understood how popular the ban on denial of coverage for preexisting conditions is. That is going to be a mainstay of American life.  People should not be denied health care because they have a preexisting condition. That is the reason they should get health care, because they have a preexisting condition and they need it.  So they don't want to get rid of that. They understand that that is politically toxic. But they don't want to have the mandate for individuals to have to purchase insurance under the Affordable Care That has been the major problem they have with the That is their major anathema. They can't stand that.  But guess what? You can't have one without the other. And if they believe in economics and they are being honest, they will have to concede that. Why?  Well, if I am a healthy young person, as I used to be, I will say to myself: Wow, an insurance company has got to cover me, even if I have got a preexisting condition, and I am perfectly healthy now, and I don't have to buy the insurance. So I am just going to go on my merry way, la-di-da, until maybe 1 day I have got a problem, I am in an accident, or I get some kind of diagnosis. At that point, I go to an insurance company, and they are going to cover me.  So they have kept the preexisting condition provision of ObamaCare, which is wildly popular in the country now. They are terrified to touch it now, although they were opposed to it before. But their proposal gets rid of the individual mandate, and it doesn't work. It will bankrupt the entire system. It is not going to work.  Now, another thing is that they are ignoring the extraordinary success of the Affordable Care With whatever flaws it has got, it has been extraordinarily successful. It has dramatically reduced the number of uninsured people. It has insured more than 20 million people who did not have insurance before, and, therefore, it has dramatically reduced the number of people[[Page H2011]]showing up at the hospital in the emergency room with no insurance, and the hospitals have been obligated to see them.  And who pays for that? Guess who pays for it? You do, I do, the American public does when people show up without insurance. But the Affordable Care Act reduced, in a very significant way, the number of people showing up like that.  Now, in my home State of Maryland, we have seen extraordinary reductions in the numbers of people showing up in the emergency room without insurance because of the We have cut the uninsured rate by more than one-third in We had a rate of 10.6 percent. Now it is down to 7 percent since the ACA was implemented.  All of the people who run the hospitals and our healthcare system are terrified that, if the GOP bull in the china shop wrecks the Affordable Care Act, what is going to happen is we are going to have hundreds of thousands of more visits every year in emergency rooms by people who are not covered by insurance, which means that the taxpayers get stuck with the bill again.  Now, let me tell you about my congressional district, the beautiful Eighth Congressional District, of which I am very proud. Everybody loves their district, but I do have the most beautiful, the most extraordinary district in the country. In Montgomery County, Maryland, in Frederick County, Maryland, and in Carroll County, it is gorgeous. Please come out and visit us in Bethesda, in Rockville, throughout Carroll County, throughout Frederick Come to Middletown, go to Thurmont, check it all out. It is beautiful. Come and visit us.  Look what has happened in the Eighth Congressional Well, as I said, we have reduced the uninsured rate by a third. We have 444,600 people in the district who have health insurance that covers preventive services today, like cancer screenings and flu shots, without any copays, without any coinsurance or deductibles, and they now stand to lose this access if the majority succeeds in eliminating the ACA provisions requiring health insurers to cover preventive services without cost-sharing.  We have got more than a half a million people in my district with employer-sponsored health insurance who are at risk of losing important consumer protections like the prohibition on annual and lifetime limits, protection against unfair policy rescissions, and coverage of preexisting health conditions if the ACA is entirely or partially repealed.  We have 21,400 people in the district who have purchased high-quality marketplace coverage, who now stand to lose their coverage if the marketplaces are dismantled.  We have 16,000 people in the district who got financial assistance to purchase marketplace coverage in 2016, who are now at risk of coverage becoming unaffordable, if they have their way and they eliminate the premium tax credits, and so and so forth.  Everything is dismantling the protections you have, making your premiums go up, throwing millions of people out of health insurance, and transferring lots of wealth upwards through the tax breaks that they want to give to wealthy people and insurance companies.  By the way, as I understand it, there is a provision that they want to repeal which capped the tax deductibility of insurance company executive salaries beyond a half a million dollars. They want to repeal that, so that would continue to be tax deductible. You could pay them millions of dollars, and they get the tax break because, of course, that is going to be their first priority, making the wealthiest executives in the health insurance companies whole.  Who cares what happens to everybody else, whether they lose their insurance, their premiums go sky-high? They know exactly where their bread is buttered. And that is just the icing on the cake.  Mr.Speaker, I don't think that their legislation can pass because the American people are too smart for it and will not stand for it. I don't think it will pass.  The President is already distancing himself from it. We all started calling it The word went out that he didn't want it called We think he knows that it is not going to pass, or, if it does pass, it is going to be a debacle of historic significance and moment.  None of them want it to be named after them. We have offered RyanCare, we have offered None of them want to be associated with it.  I don't think it is going through. I understand that the Freedom Caucus, which thinks that there should just be a total free market, is going to vote against their plan, which they say is worse than ObamaCare, which they hated from the beginning. Although they are ideologically opposed to it, they know that ObamaCare is working, and they know that lots of people are being covered on it. And now they are going to be throwing millions of people off of ObamaCare, but they don't get what they want, which is a total free market.  Of course, a free market in health care doesn't work because health care is not a social domain where the market operates.                              {time}  2030  If you get sick or if you get injured, then you are just taken to the hospital. You don't have a lot of time to shop around for the best hospital or the best doctor. You just need to go in, which is why the civilized countries of the world that can afford it have gotten to the point of a single-payer plan. But they want to take us from the Affordable Care Act backwards. They want it to be a dog-eat-dog medical care system.  The American people are not going to accept that. They don't have a majority in Congress to do it, and it is the job of the minority in Congress which represents a majority of the people. Remember that the Democratic candidate for President received 1.9 million votes more than the Republican candidate for So it is the job of the minority which represents the majority of the American people, and it is the job of the people of the United States to say that we reject this sloppy, terrible plan that they are trying to rush through If they want to have discussions about actually improving things, we are very happy to do it.

908,topic-id,761,"Mr.President, I am reintroducing the PCAOB Enforcement Transparency Act along with Senator This bill permits the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, PCAOB, to make public the disciplinary proceedings it has brought against auditors and audit firms earlier in the process.  Over 10 years ago, our markets were victimized by a series of massive financial reporting frauds, including those involving Enron and In response to this crisis, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs conducted multiple hearings, which produced consensus on a number of underlying causes, including weak corporate governance, a lack of accountability, and inadequate oversight of accountants charged with auditing public companies' financial statements.  In order to address the gaps and structural weaknesses revealed by the investigation and hearings, the Senate passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in a 99-to-0 vote. Among its many provisions, this law called for the creation of a strong, independent board, the PCAOB, responsible for overseeing auditors of public companies in order to protect investors who rely on independent audit reports on the financial statements of public companies.  To conduct its duties, the PCAOB, under the oversight of the U.Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, oversees more than 1,500 registered accounting firms, as well as the audit partners and staff who contribute to a firm's work on each audit. The board's ability to initiate proceedings to determine whether there have been violations of its auditing standards or rules of professional practice is an important component of its oversight.  However, unlike other oversight bodies, such as the SEC, the U.Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the U.Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and others, the Board's disciplinary proceedings are not allowed to be public without consent from the parties involved. Of course, parties subject to disciplinary proceedings have no incentive to consent to publicizing their alleged wrongdoing and thus these proceedings typically remain cloaked behind a veil of secrecy. In addition, the board's decisions in disciplinary proceedings are not allowed to be publicized until after the complete exhaustion of an appeals process, which can often take several years.  These PCAOB disciplinary proceedings create a lack of transparency that invites abuse and undermines the congressional intent behind the PCAOB, which was to shine a bright light on auditing firms and practices, and to bolster the accountability of auditors of public companies to the investing public.  Over the years, some bad actors have taken advantage of this loophole to shield themselves from public scrutiny and accountability. PCAOB Chairman James Doty has repeatedly stated in testimony provided to both the Senate and House of Representatives over the years that the secrecy of the proceedings ``has a variety of unfortunate consequences'' and that such secrecy is harmful to investors, the auditing profession, and the public at large.  For example, an accounting firm that was subject to a disciplinary proceeding continued to issue no fewer than 29 additional audit reports on public companies without any of those companies knowing about its PCAOB disciplinary proceedings. Disturbingly, investors and the public company clients of that audit firm were deprived of relevant information about the proceedings against the firm and the substance of any violations.  In addition to the reasons I have already provided, there are other reasons why the board's enforcement proceedings should be open and transparent.  First, the incentive to litigate cases in order to continue to shield conduct from public scrutiny as long as possible frustrates the process and requires the expenditure of needless resources by both litigants and the  Second, agencies such as the SEC have found open and transparent disciplinary proceedings to be valuable because they inform peer audit firms of the type of activity that may give rise to enforcement action by the regulator. In effect, transparent proceedings can serve as a deterrent to misconduct because of a perceived increase in the likelihood of ``getting caught.'' Accordingly, the audit industry as a whole would also benefit from timely, public, and nonsecret enforcement proceedings.  Our bill will make hearings by the PCAOB, and all related notices, orders, and motions, transparent and available to the public unless otherwise ordered by the This would more closely align the PCAOB's procedures with those of the SEC for analogous matters.  Increasing transparency and accountability of audit firms subject to PCAOB disciplinary proceedings is a critical component of bolstering and maintaining investor confidence in our financial markets, while better protecting companies from problematic auditors. I hope our colleagues will join Senator Grassley and me in supporting this legislation to enhance transparency in the PCAOB's enforcement process.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-03-13-pt1-PgS1780.txt,1982,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2017.0,13.0,March

871,topic-id,2058,"Madam President, I rise today to speak about the historical and unprecedented wildfires that burned through southwest Kansas last week. We had fires in 21 of our Kansas counties, roughly one-fifth of our High winds and dry conditions caused fires of the highest classification that blazed across central and western Kansas some 30 to 40 feet high, burning more than 700,000 acres of land, making this the largest wildfire in our State's history. The Kansas Division of Emergency Management has said it could take weeks to determine the full extent of devastation from the fires. Clark County, KS, officials--that is the county that was the hardest hit--estimate a devastating loss of anywhere from 3,000 to 9,000 head of cattle. That is just in one county. As I indicated, Clark County was the hardest hit by the windblown fires, with over 85 percent of the land in the county consumed by these prairie fires. This is hundreds of thousands of acres in one county and over 700,000 in regard to our  On Friday, I drove south from Dodge City, KS, through range and ranchland I didn't even recognize. What used to be gently rolling prairie, dotted with herds of cattle and crisscrossed by fencing, is now reduced to blackened dust. Friends of mine lost their ranch when a 40-foot wall of fire roared out of the valley over the bluff and burned out their operation. We have unimaginable damage to land and property, but also heart-wrenching scenes of cattle and wildlife burned, wounded, and wandering.  Many Kansans lost everything. According to Sheriff John Ketron of Clark County, 31 houses and over 440,000 acres were burned there. We have longtime friends there, John and Carol We have known them for years. John said with tears in his eyes: ``Pat, it took me 43 years to build up this operation, and it took about an hour to take it all down.'' Riding with Sheriff Ketron, we were assessing the town of Ashland, where a volunteer firefighting force managed to save the town when it became surrounded in flames. Some volunteers were fighting fires elsewhere in the area and learned their own homes had been engulfed and lost.  I met with brave people in the towns of Englewood and Ashland, KS, in the heart of Clark County, who had just come through frightening experiences fighting the unpredictable and unstoppable fires. Some were out driving cattle away from the fires and had become separated from loved ones. When the flames turned, they were left to pray for their safety.  Kylene Scott, with the High Plains Journal, calls it ``the worst day of her life.'' She wrote a courageous and honest account of the day. I will read her words now:       I think I had them going the right way, then the wind      switched. Now I just don't know. When I heard the crack in my      husband's voice yesterday afternoon, I knew it was bad. He is      normally the calm, cool, collected one.       A family friend alerted him to the fire in Clark County      very near the Scott farm after we'd returned home from      burying my Dad yesterday.  Coming back from a funeral.       When they said the closest neighbor was being evacuated he      went as quickly as he could fearing for the cattle herd he'd      worked the last five years to build following the death of      his own I stayed behind with the boys at our house 40      miles away.       When the wind switched at my house from south/southwest to      the north, I began to worry even more and called him. At this      point he was waiting out the fire and smoke in the wheat      field, helplessly watching the house and barn burn. I wanted      to be at the farm so bad, but there wasn't much that could be      done. When he made it home unscathed I was pretty happy, but      sad at the same time. Knowing there was nothing we could do      to fix what it took for Mother Nature mere minutes to      destroy.       Fifty-two cows are on the farm, with about half or \3/4\ of      them with young calves. Most are accounted for. All the grass      is gone, as is the hay stockpile. He went and hauled water to      the cows this morning and some are scorched and others have      udders with burns. One cow was bawling for her missing calf.      ``Those poor mommas,'' was my text reply to him this morning.       I made my way early this afternoon to see the farm or      what's left of it with my own eyes. As bad as I wanted to be      down there, a piece of me dreaded the drive. The closer I got      to the farm, the worse it got. Blowing dirt, darkening skies      because of the dust and awful winds. I pulled in the drive,      like I had done a hundred times in the nearly 20 years I have      been part of the family, and I had to stop my vehicle. The      tears came and the heartbreak overwhelmed me.       I thought of the old white farm house with the wonderful      front porch, where my husband spent a large majority of his      childhood in and around. My fondest memory is when we'd stop      and see my husband's Grandma She'd always have      something sweet to eat and a cold drink at the kitchen table.      The home had been around for 100 years and still had a large      portion of the family momentos in it. It was reduced to ashes      and rubble. All that's standing is the chimney.[[Page S1762]]       I couldn't see the barn around the trees, but I again had      to stop and sit when I pulled around the corner. The barn.      The old barn with its red siding. I remember when my father-     in-law had it painted and how proud he was because it looked      so good. I remember when he laid the brick in front of the      tack room and built a new door for it. My boys explored every      inch of it when we worked calves last fall. You could      ``almost'' hear the horses munching in the stalls decades ago      when you stood in the center alley. Now it's just a charred      pile of tin.       I realize the house and barn are just buildings. Things can      be replaced. But dang, it's so hard to see it all reduced to      ashes and rubble. To see part of the Scott family history,      more than a hundred years, just be gone. Just like that. It's      hard.       We've had incredible friends and family offering help, hay      and feed, and it's heartwarming to know how much people care.      Like I heard an Ashland, Kansas resident on the news this      morning being interviewed, it's just what southwest Kansas      people do. Help and survive.  Here is a picture that was taken on Kylene and Spencer Scott's wedding day in 2009 up here. It is a beautiful sight. Off in the distance is the Clark County It is rolling hills, cattle country, cattle, and grass. Looking at this picture now, it is not hard to wonder how this land will come back to provide for so many, as it has for generations of Kansas farm and ranch families whose sweat and blood have produced for Kansas, our Nation, and, yes, the world, as well.  There is the other picture. They got married here. It was the happiest day of their life. They saw this, and that became just about the worst day of their life. And yet, having seen this devastation firsthand, I don't wonder about Kansas and our ability to rebuild. It is in our State motto: Ad astra per aspera--to the stars through difficulties.  In one of the emergency management centers I met Joyce When I asked her what I could do to help, she just said: ``The Lord will provide.'' She had lost virtually everything. I think that pretty well sums it up. The faith of Kansans gives us courage to rebuild--the courage to come through fire. Ashland banker Kendall Kay emotionally said:       Senator, we are going to need help. We really don't want      it, but we are going to need it.  I am so proud of the people of my State who have come in with that help before they were even asked. I had been in contact with all of our producer groups in Kansas--the Kansas Livestock Association, the Kansas Farm Bureau--who along with our State agencies had been leading the voluntary relief effort. I commend them for their efforts in collecting hay for cattle, as well as monetary donations, coming in from all parts of the United States, and volunteer coordination for repairs to property and fencing.  With Congressman Roger Marshall of the First Congressional District, and my colleague here and friend in the Senate, Jerry Moran, we have been in touch with the Department of Agriculture with regard to assistance that should be available to farmers and ranchers in counties that have suffered losses.  Here is what we are trying to fix. This fellow is walking across here to that bluff that overlooks that valley that Spencer and Kylene looked over, and this fellow here is Chad Tenpenny, my top guy in That is me with my hands in my pockets. It is pretty rough to see ground like this that was grass and to look at the utter devastation. Folks, when that wind blows and when that dust starts up again, we could be in for even more trouble. So cleanup is under way, but we are trying to get help to cut through the redtape and get a disaster declaration.  I talked to the Governor this afternoon. Primarily, it is the Emergency Conservation Program, the Livestock Indemnity Program, and Environmental Quality Incentives Program, or EQIP, that are the key programs. It won't make people whole by any means, but it will give them hope. So cleanup is under way.  Kansas is a bootstrap It is not just about building new fencing. We have families who have lost the farmhouse and all the equipment they need to rebuild. Many livestock producers have had the gruesome task of euthanizing cattle that have been badly burned. We have to remove the carcasses. We have to find land for the survivors to graze. And we have a lot of uncertainty. How long will it take for the grasses to come back? When can we get rain to avoid a dust bowl? It is really too soon to tell. But we have been through disasters before. Almost 1 year ago, we had the Anderson Creek fire, and we have come through tornadoes and ice storms. Recovery from disasters of this magnitude, however, requires us to cut through the redtape. It requires getting the right information to producers so they know how to apply for aid and then to expedite it. Yes, it requires us to look at our programs to see where we can improve them.  Now, this fire has not received much attention in the national media. You see, we are a flyover All we do is produce food and fiber for Kansas and our Nation and for a troubled and hungry world. But I do want to commend members of the press in Kansas, especially photographer Bo Rader of the Wichita Eagle, who took this photo of my State Director Chad Tenpenny and me walking through rangeland outside of  The Wichita Eagle has gone out of their way to show the world what this fire looks like to real people. The Hutchison News, the High Plains Journal, and the Dodge City Daily Globe have all told and are telling this story. The same is true for the TV and the radio crews who have helped get the news of town evacuations safety notices to our people. This is what they do.  Rest assured that, as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I am committed to the Kansans I serve. They know me. I know them.  I know that Clark County and the other 20 counties will come back. We will ensure they get the help they need. Ad astra per aspera--to the stars through difficulty.

234,topic-id,2144,"Mr.President, I rise to restate my support for H.58, a resolution to overturn the Obama administration Department of Education's rule regulating future teacher preparation programs from Washington,  This teacher preparation mandate actually assumes that Washington bureaucrats are competent to micromanage teacher training programs across There are 27,000 such programs, by the way, and this micromanagement is absurd. We all agree that education matters, that teachers matter, that teacher training programs matter, and that kids are the future of our country, but I ask my colleagues to acknowledge the expertise and to respect the reforms already begun at the district and State levels and to reverse this misguided Federal regulation of teacher preparation programs.  I would like to close by reading several quotations from those who would have been affected by this regulation had it gone into effect.  This first quotation comes from the American Federation of Their public statement on the final rule, on October 12, 2016, reads as follows:       It is, quite simply, ludicrous to propose evaluating      teacher preparation programs based on the performance of the      students taught by those program's graduates. Frankly, the      only conceivable reason the department would release      regulations so out of sync with the Every Student Succeeds      Act and President Obama's own call to reduce high-stakes      testing is they are simply checking off their bucket list of      outstanding issues before the end of their term.       The final regulations could harm students who benefit the      most from consistent, high-quality standards for teacher      preparation programs. The regulations will create enormous      difficulty for teacher prep programs and place an unnecessary      burden on institutions and states, which are also in the      process of implementing  My second quotation comes from the comments of the provost and the chair of the Department of Education at Creighton University in Omaha, NE, dated February 2, 2015, of the comment period:       As stated earlier, the regulations represent a significant      financial burden to institutions, local school systems, and      states. In the state of Nebraska, there are over 500      individual teacher preparation ``programs'' subject to the      complexities of these regulations.  Again, these regulations are 700 pages.       Even as a system is developed, issues regarding privacy,      low numbers, and student demographics would impact results      unfairly and result in decisions unlikely to improve teacher      preparation programs and student learning at PK-12 schools      [in Nebraska].  My third and final quotation comes from the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Nebraska, and they wrote the Department of Education about this rule as follows:       [T]he budgetary impact of this regulation is significantly      understated, if not laughable. No financial support for      states, school systems, or institutions of higher education      to implement the requirements is proposed. The regulations      create new requirements for colleges, schools, and states to      track and report on candidates and teachers for many years.      Those systems are not in place. The cost estimates make      inaccurate assumptions that colleges and states already have      the systems in place for collecting, analyzing, reporting,      and utilizing data (federally-mandated data which may or may      not be valid or reliable for the purposes for which it is      intended to be used). It also provides a timeline that is      unworkable for most states and institutions.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the following statements and letters be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From www.aft.org, 12, 2016]      AFT's Weingarten on Teacher Preparation Programs Regulations       Washington--Statement from American Federation of Teachers      President Randi Weingarten on the Department of Education's      final regulations for teacher preparation programs.       ``It is, quite simply, ludicrous to propose evaluating      teacher preparation programs based on the performance of the      students taught by a program's graduates. Frankly, the only      conceivable reason the department would release regulations      so out of sync with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) and      President Obama's own call to reduce high-stakes testing is      that they are simply checking off their bucket list of      outstanding issues before the end of their term.       ``The final regulations could harm students who would      benefit the most from consistent, high-quality standards for      teacher preparation programs. The regulations will create      enormous difficulty for teacher prep programs and place an      unnecessary burden on institutions and states, which are also      in the process of implementing       ``Instead of designing a system to support and improve      teacher prep programs, the regulations build on the now-     rejected high-stakes testing system established under NCLB      and greatly expanded under this administration's Race to the      Top and waiver programs. It's stunning that the department      would evaluate teaching colleges based on the academic      performance of the students of their graduates when ESSA--     enacted by large bipartisan majorities in both the House and      Senate last December--prohibited the department from      requiring school districts to do that kind of teacher      evaluation.       ``Teacher prep programs need to help ensure that teachers      are ready to engage their students in powerful learning and      creating an environment that is conducive to learning. These      regulations will not help achieve that goal. These      regulations do not address ways to help the current status of      the teaching profession: the shortages, the lack of diversity      or the high turnover.       ``While the department has made minor tweaks, the flawed      framework remains the same. The regulations will punish      teacher prep programs whose graduates go on to teach in our      highest-needs schools, most often those with high      concentrations of students who live in poverty and English      language learners--the exact opposite strategy of what we      need. As we brought up in January 2015--in our comments to      the department's proposal--if programs are rated as the      department proposes, teacher prep schools will have incentive      to steer graduates away from assignments in our toughest      schools, and that will only make matters worse.       ``If we want to get it right, we should look to countries      like Finland, where prospective teachers receive extensive      training in their subject matter and teaching strategies      combined with clinical training. Finland has no alternative      prep programs. Programs are highly selective and free of      cost; their graduates go on to work in supportive,      professional environments with strong unions, fair pay and      benefits, and without high-stakes testing.''                                  ____                                            Office of the Provost,                                          Creighton University                                      Omaha, NE, February 2, 2015.     Re Docket ID ED-2014-OPE-0057.     Arne Duncan,     Secretary, U.Department of Education,     Washington,       Dear Secretary Duncan: We would like to introduce      ourselves. Our names are Edward[[Page S1665]]     O'Connor, Provost, and Debra Ponec, Professor and Chair in      the Education Department at Creighton University, which is      located in Omaha, We are responding to the U.     Department of Education's proposed regulations for teacher      preparation programs released in the Notice of Proposed Rule      Making (NPRM) on December 3, 2014.       Like other teacher preparation programs in institutions of      higher education throughout the nation, the Education      Department at Creighton University embraces accountability      for our work. The faculty are eager to learn more about the      effectiveness of our graduates and seek continual program      improvement to ensure their profession-readiness in the      classroom. Our preparation programs currently employ      accountability mechanisms such as these:       National and state accreditation       Praxis II testing       Survey data from graduates and employers       Feedback from PK-12 school partners and Advisory Boards       Continuous Review of Programs       The institution's teacher preparation programs also undergo      continual reform influenced by the effective practice,      feedback from our K-12 partners, local and national workforce      demands, new requirements from our legislature and state, new      professional standards for preparation, and funding to      support new initiatives. The Education Department at      Creighton University has developed partnerships with public      and private schools where instruction and clinical practice      are on-site; integrated ``best practices'' into evidence-     based teacher preparation; placed students in high need,      diverse settings for clinical practice throughout the      program; and provided data on the impact of our programs on      our website. Our programs have a documented high placement      and retention rate for our graduates. Our teacher preparation      program actively supports accountability mechanisms that are      fair, transparent, valid, reliable, feasible, and useful for      program improvement. The proposed regulations initiated by      the Department of Education do not meet these criteria.       Overall, if these proposed regulations were adopted, they      would draw energy, funding, and attention away from      innovative reforms, proven accountability initiatives, and      overall program improvement currently under way in teacher      preparation programs across the country. Some of the specific      areas of concern are as follows:       The specific requirements outlined in the proposal usurp      the rights of the state and higher education institutions to      determine what indicators identify proficiency of teacher      education graduates and their preparation programs. This      unfunded mandate represents a significant financial burden to      institutions, local school systems, and states. The costs of      implementing these regulations have been woefully      underestimated with the understanding that no federal funding      would be available to move the proposed regulations forward.      The proposed regulations require data systems to track and      report on teacher education candidate effectiveness for      multiple years. Many states do not possess the technology      capacity to develop highly sophisticated data collection      systems which will collect, analyze, report, and utilize this      data in a meaningful manner.       The proposed regulations have generally not been tested for      validity and reliability, and attaching high-stakes      consequences at this point is of significant concern. For      example, using PK-12 student academic achievement and growth      to evaluate teacher performance is questioned by leading      research organizations and education scholars as having      questionable validity and reliability for making teacher      effectiveness decisions. Utilizing this approach of      evaluating teacher performance to his/her teacher preparation      institution is an even weaker link given the largely unknown      impacts such as implications of time and place of employment      and teacher preparation influence. The lack of a      scientifically acceptable basis for using student achievement      as a rating for program performance, even if the cost and      burden were low, makes this indicator unreasonable. In      addition, evidence that ACT/SAT/GPA scores are a reliable      indicator of teacher effectiveness is equally questionable.      Capstone assessments, which are being implemented in very      limited ways are still inconclusive in their outcomes as      measuring teacher quality.       As stated earlier, the regulations represent a significant      financial burden to institutions, local school systems, and      states. In the state of Nebraska, there are over 500      individual teacher preparation `programs' subject to the      complexities of these regulations. Even as a system is      developed issues regarding privacy, low numbers, and student      demographics would impact results unfairly and result in      decisions unlikely to improve teacher preparation programs      and student learning at PK-12 schools.       The regulations focus on placement, retention, and      performance with PK-12 students has significant potential to      become a disincentive to encourage candidates to seek      placements in areas of high-need. This ideal conflicts with      our mission statement and preparation which seeks to lead      students to work with the underrepresented, disenfranchised,      and poor. Our teacher preparation candidates are well-     prepared, however, the potential of a teacher preparation      program being rated on test scores of high-needs students      will cause any institution pause. With lack of control of the      experience of the teachers once employed and no assurance of      resources to provide the supports for candidates in high-need      schools, it is unreasonable to compare these candidates with      candidates in non high-need situations.       The proposed timeline is unreasonable and unrealistic.      Those states piloting connecting teacher effectiveness to      student achievement are still under development and are      experiencing many ethical and legal challenges as they seek      to implement the requirements. Attaching outcomes to national      accreditation is also problematic in that the new CAEP      accreditation standards are not fully implemented and      accreditation processes using the new standards will not      officially be required until the Fall of 2016. The timeline      presented in the proposed regulations would include piloting      additional reporting requirements for the 2016-17 academic      year which is unrealistic to meet significantly increased      reporting elements, creation of new data systems, delivery of      in-service and technical assistance systems for institutions      and schools, and lack of new resources with which to      accomplish the unfunded mandates.       The proposed regulations do not consider or support the      philosophy that quality education requires a systemic      approach. Factors such as student demographics, preschool      learning opportunities, poverty and other social factors are      not controlled by PK-12 schools or teacher preparation      experiences. Other quality indicators such as equitable      funding, strong curriculum standards, focus on providing      opportunity--access--success for all students, and quality      assessment which all contribute to PK-12 student learning are      not controlled by teacher preparation programs. Therefore      equating PK-12 student performance to the quality of a      teacher preparation program is unfair and unreasonable.      However, dedication to strong commitments and collaborative      partnerships by educator preparation programs and school      systems impact the development of exemplary educators for the      future.

963,topic-id,1645,"I thank Chairman Grassley for that question and the invitation to join him in the colloquy. As two of the only non-attorneys on the Judiciary Committee, it is important that we, on behalf of the majority of Americans, who are non-lawyers, do reclaim the separation of powers as a basic American inheritance. So I thank the Senator for the chance to discuss it here today.  Starting the morning after President Trump's victory last November, there has actually been something of a renaissance of separation of powers talk among many folks around this body, and that is a good thing. After 8 years of legislative atrophy, many on the other side of the aisle are now remembering the old ``Schoolhouse Rock'' distinction among the three separate and coequal branches, and this is good news for Americans' civic health.  If Democrats are serious--frankly, if all of us are serious, for we in this body have taken an oath not to a political party but to a constitutional structure of limits where power is intentionally separated and divided because our forefathers and foremothers were skeptical of the consolidation of power--if we take this seriously and we would like to reclaim some of the Congress's responsibility and ability and authority to check and balance the other two branches, the debate around Judge Gorsuch's nomination and the hearings we will have beginning in the chairman's committee next month are a great place to start. So I wish to offer a little bit of what I think is an important historical backdrop for this debate.  Any discussion of the separation of powers must be rooted in a solid understanding of what we mean and what the Founders meant by the phrase ``the consent of the governed.'' Historically speaking, this is still a bold idea which must be constantly defined, reclaimed, renewed, and passed on to the next generation, for over the course of human history, we can put every form of government into one of two categories: You are ruled either by people you didn't choose or by people you did choose.  One of these groups has taken many forms through the centuries--Kings, elites, political parties, and technocrats. Indeed, most governments throughout human history fit this mold, where the people were ruled by a form of government that they had no say in and that they didn't choose. But there is another group, and these are people who rule themselves through the leaders they have chosen and continually get to choose. When the leaders fail to serve the will of the people, those leaders can be removed. This describes our form of government and its historical anomaly. We should recognize that, and our kids should understand what a special blessing it is to live under this form of government.  The point is elegantly simple: Either people are ruled, or the people are ultimately and fundamentally the rulers. Why does this matter? This isn't a question to take flippantly but, rather, each generation of Americans should reexamine and reclaim and reteach it. So why is it so important that ``the people'' are actually the rulers in their government? It comes down to a profound truth about human dignity. Human beings cannot thrive when they are stripped of basic liberties. Human flourishing requires the freedom to make basic choices about how you will live your life in community: Who are your friends? Whom will you marry? Where will you work? What do you believe? Whom do you worship? How do you worship? These are the things the Founders meant when they said that we are all born with the right to life, to liberty, and to the pursuit of happiness.  Notice that the Founders were not referring to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as a bunch of vague platitudes or as aspirational pleasantries for a bumper sticker; they were talking about rights. These are not given to us by any other man or woman. They are rights we have from God via nature, and so they can't be taken away from us by some other mere man or woman.  Here is what is great about this idea: We are all born equals in the eyes of God and history, and we have certain rights. As a group of equals, it requires people to get permission to serve for a time--for a limited time--as our rulers. This equality is what the Founders called the self-evident truth--something so obvious that it didn't need to be proven; a truth so true that denying it would be denying something essential and true about human nature itself. Once we understand this, our expectations of our government begin to change. We expect responsiveness and transparency. We expect equality before the law.  Government's primary purpose is not to solve every human problem, like a King or some all-powerful technocrat; rather, the government's job is to provide a framework for ordered liberty so that we can live our lives in our communities, in our families, in our businesses, and in our places of worship. Government's job is to secure the rights of a free and sovereign people.  But what does this have to do with Judge Gorsuch? What does this have to do with the confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court next week? What does this have to do with separation of powers?  As Americans, we secure our rights by separating the functions of government into what our Founders called the three different departments: There is a Congress to write the laws, and this is article I of the Constitution; there is a President--or Presiding Officer, as he was first called--to execute the laws; and there is a court to decide the controversies under the law. This system of checks and balances keeps too much power from falling into any one set of hands, and it keeps the American people in charge.  We sometimes talk euphemistically about judicial activism, and that is a big problem, but we don't attack it enough. A judge who takes it as his or her job to do anything other than settle cases is not just being an activist, they are becoming an untouchable, unfireable ruler. They are becoming a lawmaker who is not accountable to the people because our judges have lifetime tenure. A judge who uses his or her position to write the law fundamentally undermines the foundation of government, which is that the will of the people should rule.  That is why I am so strongly supporting Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the next Justice on the U.Supreme He fully understands the place in the government and his place in the government as a servant of the people, not as some unchosen ruler with lifetime tenure.  When you listen to Judge Gorsuch, when you read his speeches, when you read his opinions, it is clear that he is not interested in making laws. He knows that is not his calling. He is interested in interpreting law. He is interested in upholding and defending the He is not interested, when he has his robe on, in specific policy outcomes; he is interested in justice. He is not interested in the laws that he as a private citizen might want; he is focused on the laws that are actually written in the books. He is a judge's judge, and that is exactly what the Constitution calls for.  In closing, I wish to read three quotes from Judge Gorsuch into the Record to demonstrate how he conceives of his job. Again, this is Judge Gorsuch paying tribute to Justice Scalia:       Tonight I want to . . . suggest that perhaps the great      project of Justice Scalia's career was to remind us of the      differences between judges and legislators. To remind us that      legislators may appeal to their own moral convictions and to      claims about social utility to reshape the law as they think      it should be in the future. But that judges should do none of      these things in a democratic society. That judges should      strive (if humanly and so imperfectly) to apply the law as it      is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to the text,      structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at      the time of the events in question would have understood the      law to be--not to decide cases based on [a judge's] own moral      convictions or the policy consequences they believe might      serve society best.  Again, he is saying a judge is not a superlegislator. If a judge wants to be a legislator, that is a completely fine thing to do. Take off your robe, resign your position, and run for office so the[[Page S1789]]people can decide whether to hire you or fire you. But a judge who has lifetime tenure doesn't get to make their policy preferences the will of the people somehow.  The second quote:       When the political branches disagree with a judicial      interpretation of existing law, the Constitution prescribes      the appropriate remedial process. It's called legislation.      Admittedly, the legislative process can be an arduous one.      But that's no bug in the constitutional design: It is the      very point of the design.  Third and finally:       To the founders, the legislative and judicial powers were      distinct by nature and their separation was among the most      important liberty-protecting devices of the constitutional      design, an independent right of the people essential to the      preservation of all other rights later enumerated in the      Constitution and its amendments.  If my colleagues in this body are serious, if the hundred of us are serious, if we want to defend our role as legislators, if we are serious about doing our job as lawmakers, if we are concerned about overreaching Executives, if we are concerned about the lack of accountability in the administrative bureaucracies of the government, if we honestly want to make Congress great again, we should start by confirming Judge Neil  ",CREC-2017-03-14-pt1-PgS1784-3.txt,2289,COASTAL EROSION,2017.0,14.0,March

968,topic-id,1270,"Mr.President, what should we call it? What do we call this new bill the Republicans are rushing[[Page S1793]]through to take away healthcare from millions of Americans? Is it TrumpCare? Is it RyanCare?  It is important to remember that both Paul Ryan and President Trump are branding experts. The President put his name on a line of steaks. He put his name on a magazine, on hotels. Then, here is the Speaker of the House, who has worked pretty hard to be thought of, at least in this town, as a policy wonk and serious thinker, who has branded everything he has worked on from the Ryan budget to ``A Better Way.'' Yet neither leader of the Republican Party wants to own this thing. That is because TrumpCare is one of the worst pieces of legislation I have ever seen.  The process has been a total mess, and this is despite the fact that the Republicans had 7 years to work on a plan. At first, they were thinking about doing this without getting a score from the Congressional Budget Office, the Then they realized that even their own Members--even their loyal soldiers--did not want to vote on something without knowing how much it would cost or how many people would lose healthcare.  Now they are saying the score either does not matter or it is wrong except for the areas in which they like the score. They spent the last 48 hours trashing the CBO, when there is plenty of evidence that for the last 8 years, they referred to the CBO as an expert source when it fit their needs.  Look, the legislative process requires hearings, expert testimony, and that is not a mere formality. That is how you get a decent product. For all of the complaints about the way the ACA was passed, they did have hearings; they had discussions. It took over a year. President Obama, himself, even went to the Republican retreat and personally engaged in policy.  Moving this fast without having hearings is the kind of thing you do when naming a post office or doing some other noncontroversial measure, or it is the kind of thing you do for something that you don't want people to look at very closely because, with every moment that passes, this coalition frays, if it ever existed in the first place.  Now you have criticism from literally the left, right, and center. That is, in part, because no one saw this coming. No one expected a bill that would look like this because during the campaign this administration promised not to cut It promised that everyone--every single American--would have health insurance, but here we are. If TrumpCare becomes law, 14 million people will lose their healthcare next year. Let me repeat that. In just 1 year, 14 million Americans will no longer have the health insurance they were promised.  I want to talk about what that means, what will it mean if people no longer have healthcare.  This week, the Washington Post featured the stories of people in a single county whose lives have changed for the better because of In McDowell County, WV, Medicaid has helped thousands of people get access to physical therapy and immunizations. It has allowed them to see counselors for mental health problems and opioid addiction. It has helped them to afford the medication they need instead of relying on free samples from clinics.  These services do not just benefit the individuals, they benefit the whole community by making sure people are healthy enough so they can work and contribute to the economy. They allow us to save money by focusing on prevention instead of treatment. This is what is at stake. These are the services that will go away because TrumpCare is going to cut Medicaid by $880 billion.  Here is another thing. TrumpCare is also going to impose an age tax that will allow insurance companies to charge older people more money for health insurance--a lot more. I want to be clear. We are not just talking about senior citizens here, we are talking about people who are pre-Medicare; in other words, anyone under the age of 65 but not exactly young. For example, a 64-year-old will be charged up to five times the amount a 21-year-old will be charged. Starting at age 25, the older you get, the more money you will get charged. That is why AARP has come out against this bill, because every year you get older they will charge you more. This is an age tax. This is a penalty for getting older.  There is an important point to be made about process, and that is this: This is actually not a healthcare bill. That is not a political statement. That is not a rhetorical flourish. Here is what is going on. If this were a healthcare bill, it would be new legislation. In order to pass legislation, under the rules of the U.Senate, which were agreed upon by both parties over many years, you need 60 votes. The reason we are working this through reconciliation is, they have nowhere near 60 votes.  So what can you do within the reconciliation process? They are basically stuck with dealing with taxes and subsidies because they only require 51 votes. That is all they can do. This is a tax vehicle.  Then, the question becomes, Who is getting money, and who is getting charged more money? On that count, this tax bill is one of the biggest wealth transfers in American history. It is a transfer from working-class Americans to rich That is what this bill does. It takes money from the people who need help the most and gives it to the very wealthy.  Here we are in 2017, just a few months out from an election in which income inequality was one of the driving issues on both sides of the aisle. What the Republicans in the House seem to take from that experience is that their mandate is to go in and reduce taxes for insurance executives who make more than $500,000 a year and for the investor class in order to cut Medicaid by $880 billion. It is like they were asleep all of last year or maybe they were never very serious about income inequality. We do not need another election to know this is not what the American people expect from the They expect bipartisan compromise. They expect results that will make their healthcare better.  My own view is, we can work together on healthcare, but it requires three things: first, good faith; second, bipartisanship; third, legislative hearings. Frankly, we have seen none of these things because the process has been a mess. We need to have a conversation in the light of day and let the American people weigh in. What is the rush?  There is no doubt there is plenty of room for improvement in the existing healthcare law, but TrumpCare makes it much worse. It will cause chaos in the American economy and in 24 million Americans' lives. That is a threat to the progress we have made over the last 7 years. It is a threat to one-sixth of the American economy. Most of all, it is a threat to at least 24 million Americans who stand to lose their healthcare.  These threats are the reasons the Senate needs to come together and say: Slow down. Let's work together. Let's work on forming a bipartisan foundation. Let's have hearings. Most importantly, let's not impose this catastrophe in a hurry on the American people.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-03-14-pt1-PgS1784-3.txt,2173,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT,2017.0,14.0,March

205,topic-id,905,"Mr.President, the House Republicans have finally unveiled their healthcare plan after nearly 8 years without a plan of their own.  TrumpCare is finally public, and each hour that goes by brings a new set of concerns and new groups that oppose the bill, from all places along the ideological spectrum. Even a growing number of conservatives are expressing their distaste for the legislation.  The fact of the matter is that TrumpCare is a mess. It will mean higher costs and less care for most When you look at the details, you can see that TrumpCare amounts to two separate systems of healthcare in America: cheaper healthcare for the rich, more expensive healthcare for everybody else.  Under TrumpCare, if you make more than $250,000 a year, you will get a huge tax break. The average is $200,000 a year, because most people are way above that $250,000. If you are in the middle class, the cost will increase by $1,500 annually, and by 2020, over $2,000 a year.  Let me repeat that. If you make over $250,000, your average tax break is $200,000. If you are in the middle class, your average increase in costs is $1,500 up. What kind of plan is that?  Donald Trump has talked about helping working The plan he has embraced, TrumpCare, helps the rich and hurts the average That is not surprising given all the other things they are doing the same way. This administration continues--and healthcare is part of that--to talk like populists but act like those helping the wealthy special interests time after time.  Let me repeat that. Under TrumpCare, if you make more than $250,000, you will get a tax break on average of $200,000 a year. If you are in the middle class, the cost will increase by about $1,500 annually, and after 2020, by $2,000 a year.  TrumpCare is a healthcare handout for the wealthiest Americans and fake healthcare for everybody else. Under TrumpCare, if you are a member of the Trump Cabinet--stocked with billionaires--you are going to get a tax break, but if you are 60 years old, on the cusp of retirement but still waiting because you are not yet eligible for Medicare, TrumpCare would allow insurers to charge you more simply because of your age--discrimination against the elderly, against those 50 to 65, who have worked so hard but don't yet have That is wrong.  If you are between 55 and 64, the total cost for you will increase $5,269 a year. Let me repeat that. If you are between 55 and 64, the total cost would increase by $5,269 a year. That is only the next 2 years. By 2020, it goes up to $6,000 a year.  For a working family, they can't afford that. What is this all about? They said it would be better care and cost less. It is worse care and it costs more.  How about this? Under TrumpCare, a wealthy insurance executive making over $500,000 a year is allowed a tax break. If you are struggling to make it into the middle class with an income of 250 percent below the poverty line, your costs are going to go up by nearly $3,000 a year, and by 2020, $4,000 a year--once again, helping the wealthy special interests, in this case insurance executives, and hurting those struggling, climbing the ladder to get into the middle class.  If you are a working mother and you get healthcare from Planned Parenthood, too bad, TrumpCare cuts all Federal funding for Planned Parenthood for a year.  I am wearing my red tie today to honor the Day Without Unfortunately, TrumpCare is the healthcare bill that forgot about women. Women are an essential part of our workforce in They ought to be able to go to the doctor or provider of their choice, even if that is Planned  When you look at the fine print of this bill, it has jagged edges. TrumpCare shifts the costs and burdens from the wealthy to the poor, from the insurance executive to the middle-class family.  The more Americans hear about this plan, the less they are going to like it. They were already against repeal before this plan came out. Can you imagine what is going to happen now as they read the details? I believe the Congressional Budget Office, when they score it, will ultimately show America everything America needs to know--how this bill would likely hurt overall coverage numbers and affordability and, at the same time, explode the deficit.  You are getting worse healthcare and increasing the deficit. What kind of combination is that? No wonder the Republican leadership in the House is trying to rush through the bill even without a score. They don't want the American people to see it. I don't think they even want their own Members to have a chance to study it because it is a near certainty that this bill will cause millions to lose insurance as well as blow a gigantic hole in the Federal budget.  In conclusion, it is reckless for Republicans to make Congress vote on this mess of a plan before we have those answers from Simply put, TrumpCare is a mess for the American people. We Democrats will fight it tooth and nail.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

617,topic-id,2124,"Mr.President, I just came from speaking with several Americans about how TrumpCare would affect them. Universally, these folks were scared. They are worried their costs will go up. They are worried their benefits will go down. One of the concerns that came up, an issue that is on the minds of many Americans, was the high cost of drug prices.  During the campaign, the President talked the talk on drug prices. As President-elect, he said in December he would ``bring down drug prices.'' In January, he said pharmaceutical companies were ``getting away with murder.'' He repeated the refrain in his joint address to Congress last week. ``We should,'' he said, ``work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.''  Well, the immediate is here. TrumpCare, the repeal and replacement of the ACA, has been introduced. TrumpCare does absolutely nothing to address the high cost of drugs. In fact, drug prices might start going up faster. Once again, the President is talking the talk, talking like a populist, but not walking the walk, not helping average He is helping the wealthy, special interests but not the average folks he was talking to during the campaign.  The President met with a couple of Congressmen yesterday and talked about drug prices. Why not put something in TrumpCare? Why not let them negotiate, bring down costs? Instead, TrumpCare does the opposite. TrumpCare eliminates a current requirement that insurers actually give patients the value of the health insurance they are paying for. Under the ACA, insurers had to pay at least 60 percent of the cost of care provided--for some plans, more. That requirement would be gone. So that, again, hurts average folks.  That provision in TrumpCare is a blank check to insurers to cover less and charge more out-of-pocket for a whole host of services. Most experts agree that insurers could charge much more for its prescription drugs or even rationed care.  TrumpCare takes the shackles off the insurance companies and lets them decide how or if they are going to cover your prescription drug costs. Letting the insurance companies decide what to charge and cover has never been, and never will be, a recipe to bring down prices. So on drugs as well as other issues, TrumpCare: higher costs, less care.  What is particularly galling, of course, is the fact that the President talks about reducing the cost of drug prices and negotiating but does nothing.  He said he would do it immediately. The immediate is here. TrumpCare is here. TrumpCare makes it very likely that the cost of drugs could go up for average It is just another example of this President doing one thing but saying another. He promises the Moon and the stars, but his policies make them even further out of reach.  He says: ``I'll bring drug prices down.'' His bill does the opposite, and it is just another way in which this is a healthcare handout for the insurance companies and the wealthy but a raw deal for average  TrumpCare is really just a tax break for the rich. It is not really a healthcare program. Its 1 motivation is to reduce taxes on the top 0.01 percent. If you make above $250,000, your prices are going to come down. If you are in that 0.01 percent, your average reduction in taxes is $200,000--more than most Americans make. So this bill is not going to help average Americans; it is going to hurt them, unless you are in the top 0.01 percent.  As more and more people read the bill, the louder the chorus of opposition grows. The AARP, a very cautious organization--usually they don't like to take political stands--a few weeks ago, they had ads on TV praising President Trump for saying he will not cut Social Security or They came out strongly against the bill yesterday. Why? Because it would hurt seniors. They believe seniors--many average seniors whose income is $15,000--could pay up to $8,400 more. The people who might be hurt the most with this bill are average Americans between 50 years old and 65 whose costs inevitably will go up, whose healthcare will not be as good.  The AMA, another cautious organization, not known to be a big Democratic organization, came out against the bill. Doctors know how bad this will be for their patients and for  The Club for Growth, on the other side, has also opposed the bill. Hospitals, doctors, senior citizen groups have all come out against the bill. The hard right comes out against the bill, as do more moderate and liberal groups. That is because this bill is one big mess, done quickly in the dark of night. It is no wonder Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell don't want a lot of debate. They are embarrassed. This bill is an embarrassment to those who put it in because it doesn't do what it is supposed to do. That has led even Republican Governors such as John Kasich of Ohio and Brian Sandoval of Nevada to express concern over the destruction of the Medicaid As we know, it is shifting the costs to the  Governor Kasich said that TrumpCare ``puts at risk our ability to treat the drug addicted, the mentally[[Page S1709]]ill, and the working poor.'' It is almost certain that under this bill, treatment for opioids will be less available because Medicaid is going to be cut and Medicaid helps pay for it. It is almost certain that if you are a young person, a young family--say you are 30 or 40 years old, but you have mom or dad in a nursing home; Medicaid has been paying for most of that, and it is going to be cut. What are you going to do? Maybe they will have to move in with you. That is not so easy in a growing family with kids. Maybe you will have to pay a lot of money out of your pocket. So this bill hurts Americans up and down the line.  The ideological fervor of ``TrumpCare must cut back the role of government, whether it hurts people or not'' is motivating this bill. That in the abstract would be fine, but it hurts It hurts middle-class Americans who are young, it hurts middle-class Americans who are middle-aged, and it hurts maybe most of all middle-class Americans who are 50 to 65 years old. As people learn about this bill over the next few weeks, there will be rebellion in the land of  So I tell my friends on the other side of the aisle to listen to the voices of the average Americans whom I met today, who care about bringing down the unreasonable cost of drugs. They should listen to the voices of experts who say just about the only winners in this bill are the very wealthy, and they should listen to the voices coming from their own party who say this bill will hurt their States and hurt the country.  TrumpCare is a mess. If this Congress, if this House, if this Senate is smart, they will defeat TrumpCare, keep the ACA, and then we can work together on making it better--plain and simple.                       China and Trump Trademarks  Mr.President, on another matter, I am concerned about a recent report that the Trump business interests have been granted approval on a number of trademarks in  The President spent most of his campaign talking tough on He said China was ``ripping us off . . . and killing our companies.'' He promised to label them a currency manipulator, a cause near and dear to my heart, on day one. The President promised many times over, saying: We are going to label China a currency manipulator. There is nothing stopping him from doing it. He could have done it with a stroke of a pen.  My views on trade, particularly with respect to China, might be closer to the views President Trump expressed in his campaign than those of either President Obama or President But since the election, President Trump has been remarkably soft on  As the Acting President pro tempore knows, I was the original person--Senator Graham and I--who came up with the idea that China was manipulating its currency. We discovered it. I did, when I went to Crucible Steel near Syracuse and they told me how their business was being hurt by China manipulating its currency. At first, when Lindsey and I talked about it, people said: Oh, no, it is not happening. I was sort of proud of the fact that in those days both the New York Times, liberal, and the Wall Street Journal, conservative--their editorial pages both stated that China doesn't manipulate its currency; Schumer is off base. Now, of course, everyone knows they do. President Trump in his campaign said over and over again he was going to label them a currency manipulator which would have consequences to them on day one, the first day he took office. Now he has backed off his threats. He has been in office more than a month. He has not labeled China a currency manipulator.  Amazingly enough, in his first week he said he was no longer going to honor the One China policy. He was sending a shot over the bow to Beijing, that they can't keep getting away with what they have been getting away with in trade, in geodiplomacy, in cyber security, stealing our intellectual property, and everything else. When he did that, I was pretty pleased. Now he has backed off.  On the two issues where the President could have been really tough with China, currency manipulation and backing off on One China, he reversed himself within the last few weeks. Now, all of a sudden, we learn that China has granted preliminary approval to 38 new trademarks, allowing the Trump brand to market several different business ventures there, including hotels and golf clubs. Before he assumed public office, Donald Trump had been working to get trademarks from China for a decade without success. These particular trademark applications, filed during the campaign, just sailed through earlier this week.  It raises troubling specific questions: Did the Chinese Government and the Communist Party, who likely had a hand in granting these approvals, see some type of benefit from doing so now that Donald Trump is President? Did the President and his network of businesses personally gain from his office, and will that incline the President to make policy decisions that benefit China and hurt American workers?  We don't know if there is a link between the two. We don't know what was in the minds of the Chinese Government or the Communist Party when they all of a sudden granted these 38 licenses. It surely raises troubling questions.  It raises a bigger question. The wisdom of our Founding Fathers proves true day in and day out. Over 220 years after they wrote the Constitution, their wisdom is coming through now with President Trump because they wrote in the Constitution that anything of value--any emolument--to U.officials from foreign governments should be prohibited. U.officials should not be allowed to accept anything of value from any foreign government. In those days, one of the greatest worries of the Founding Fathers was that they wanted to prevent foreign governments from trying to curry favor with the United States by offering potential financial gain to our officials. This issue has been largely forgotten for a century or so, but the wisdom of the Founding Fathers is shining through now because President Trump, unlike just about any other President I can remember in recent history, has failed to completely separate himself from huge financial interests.  Now the questions arise. Is there a relationship? Are foreign governments seeking to curry favor? Is it affecting Donald Trump's decisionmaking? No one knows the answers to these questions, but the fact that the questions can be asked is extremely troubling.  The President has flouted all tradition and precedent, and I worry if the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution has been broken when President Trump retains a financial interest in his business empire. It leads to troubling questions like the ones raised by these trademarks.  As my colleague from Connecticut, who is an expert on this issue, a brilliant lawyer, Senator Blumenthal, said yesterday: I think the circumstances surrounding the approval of these trademarks ought to be looked into by this Congress for a potential emoluments clause violation. He is right, and I am glad he is going forward.  Thank you, Mr. Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that time consumed during a quorum call be charged equally to both sides.

860,topic-id,1574,"Mr.President, as the House continues to rush through its plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, I just want to point out once again how different this bill is from what the President has promised. For a while now, I have spoken about how the President talks like a populist and promises one thing but governs from the hard right, delivering something entirely different.  President Trump talked tough on Wall Street but appointed Wall Street insiders to his administration and started to try to roll back Wall Street reform. He said he would stick up for working people, but just about an hour after his inaugural address where he said that, one of his first actions as President made it harder for average families to afford a mortgage.  The President plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and that is the most recent and most glaring example of this trend where the President speaks one way and does another. There is a stunning gap between how the President talks about healthcare and what his bill TrumpCare would do. The bold promises of better care for everyone at lower costs come from an alternative reality to his legislation, which studies show will cover fewer people at higher costs--higher costs, less care.  Like much of his administration thus far, TrumpCare is another game of say one thing, do another: Say you will protect the working people of America and then go forward in ways that hurt them and hurt them severely.  Let me offer a few examples about TrumpCare and how the words the President has stated are so different from the reality. During the campaign, the President said he was not going to cut Medicaid ``like every other Republican.'' He tweeted that he was ``the first and only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.'' These are President Trump's own tweets.  He said on his tweet that he will be the first and only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid; however, directly contrary to the President's promise during the campaign, TrumpCare takes an ax to Medicaid, which covers 68 million Instead of having the Federal Government match a percentage of each State's Medicaid costs, which can rise and fall according to how much the State actually needs, TrumpCare would give States only a fixed amount of money per enrollee each year. If costs are higher than expected, TrumpCare wouldn't cover the gap. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, this change would amount to a $370 billion cut to Medicaid over 10 years. The President said he was the first and only GOP candidate to promise not to cut His bill cuts it by nearly $400 billion.  Nearly two-thirds of Americans in nursing homes rely on This cut goes right after seniors and could make it more difficult if you are a 45- or 50-year-old with a parent in a nursing home. You would be faced with a horrible choice: Take your parent out of the home and not give them the care they need or shell out huge amounts--thousands and thousands of dollars out of your own pocket, which you may not have. So much for the President not cutting Medicaid; it is a broken promise to so many poor people, elderly people in nursing homes, and their children.  The President also said we are going to have a much better healthcare plan for much less money, but studies have shown that if you are in the middle class, TrumpCare will cost you about $1,500 more a year. If you are an older American between 55 and 64, your costs would increase by over $5,000 a year. The 55- to 64-year-olds may be the most vulnerable. Their healthcare costs tend to be higher than others, and their costs would go up by $5,000 a year. That is another promise by President Trump broken when it comes to  The President also said: ``We are going to have insurance for everybody.'' Those are his words, not mine. ``We are going to have insurance for everybody.'' Some estimates of TrumpCare suggest that it will kick roughly 15 million Americans off the insurance rolls. The CBO will likely have a more definitive estimate this evening, putting an exclamation point on what we already know: TrumpCare will cost millions of Americans their health insurance--another promise by Donald Trump broken.  The President spoke repeatedly on the campaign trail about expanding treatment for Americans suffering from opioid addiction, but TrumpCare would end the Affordable Care Act's requirement that addictive services and mental health treatment be covered under Medicaid in the 31 States that chose to expand The President promised more help for those suffering from opioid addiction. The President's action in TrumpCare cuts it.  Even on drug prices, the President says one thing and does another. Just a few weeks ago, he stood in the well of the House of Representatives and said: ``We should work to bring down the artificial high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.'' So you would think TrumpCare would have something that does that. Unfortunately, it does not. TrumpCare does absolutely nothing to address the high cost of drugs. In fact, drug prices might start going up faster.  TrumpCare eliminates a current requirement that insurers actually give patients the value of the health insurance they are paying for. This is a blank check to insurers to cover less and charge more out-of-pocket for a whole host of services. Most experts agree that insurers could charge much more for prescription drugs or even ration care. So that is another Trump promise broken. He was going to work on getting costs lowered immediately, but not in his bill he introduced a few weeks later. It might, indeed, raise prices for the cost of drugs for average Americans.[[Page S1755]]  In a broader sense, TrumpCare violates what this President promised to working He promised to be a champion for working He promised to be their voice. That is how he presented himself in his inaugural address. But TrumpCare would hurt working Americans the most, making them pay more for less care.  It seems the only people who really benefit, the only group who benefits financially--if you are in the top 0.1 percent of earners, TrumpCare gives you a nearly $200,000 tax break, on average. This is the group who benefits. They may not be the only group, but they are the group who benefits the most, far and away. If you are in the middle class, if you are struggling to make it into the working class, if you are older or from a rural area, your costs are going to go up by thousands of dollars a year. So many of these people voted for Trump for President, but the only people who get that huge tax break of an average of $200,000 a year are the top 0.1 percent. In a very real sense, Donald Trump is giving a huge tax break to the wealthy and then making working Americans, average Americans, pay for it. To some, it might seem that the whole purpose of TrumpCare is to give that huge tax break to the wealthy.  In his inaugural address, President Trump spoke of an America where for far too long a small group has reaped the rewards of government, while the people have borne the cost. TrumpCare seems designed to fulfill that vision, not alter it. It makes it even easier on that small group, shifting even more costs onto the people.  So the first few months of the Trump administration have been broken promise after broken promise to working families. Trump's words: We are going to help working America, middle-class Trump's action: Take the burden off the shoulders of the top 1 percent and put them on the shoulders of all other  TrumpCare might constitute the greatest broken promise of them all. That is why I expect our Republican leadership in the House is rushing this bill through the They don't want the American people to see it and learn what is in it. I don't think they want their own Members to have much time to consider it. That is why it was released on a Monday and a vote in committee was scheduled just a few days later. Already the bill has gone through one committee markup in the House without a score from  After years of criticizing Democrats for rushing through healthcare, after chanting ``read the bill'' over and over again, Republicans are trying to pass their healthcare plan in 2 months, when Democrats took almost a full year to debate and pass the Affordable Care  Even Republican Senators like my friend from Arkansas, Mr.Cotton, are telling their colleagues in the House to pause and start over. The Republicans in the House ought to listen because this mess of a bill will badly hurt millions of Even though we disagree on the substance, I would echo my friend from Arkansas, Senator Cotton, in saying to House Republicans: Stop and think about this. You can drop ``repeal'' and come talk to us Democrats about reasonable fixes to the Affordable Care Act instead of blindly moving forward with this sham of a bill. That would be a much better way for your party and for our country.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-13-pt1-PgS1754-4.txt,1036,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,13.0,March
883,topic-id,296,"Mr.President, one final point on another matter. Today, the Democratic leadership of the Senate sent a letter to Leader McConnell and Chairman We, of course, laid out our concerns about the budget and reiterated the guiding rules that helped us pass a budget for the first time in a while last year. We believe that we should stick to the spending levels that were agreed to in December, that we should maintain a parity between defense and nondefense, and that there should be no poison pill riders.  It is rumored that one of those poison pill riders might be a supplemental added to the CR that would call for paying for President Trump's wall. That will not stand.  The President wants a wall but has not answered so many questions about it. What about eminent domain and the procedures to acquire land from private landowners? What is the design of the wall? Where is it going to be located? How is it going to be paid for, and how much will it cost? Don't you think we ought to give the President some time to have Mexico pay for the wall? That is what he said throughout his campaign, that Mexico will pay for it.  That is why both Democratic and Republican Members of Congress who represent the border States object to this wall. It will be inappropriate, in our judgment, to insist on the inclusion of such funding in a must-pass appropriations bill that is needed for the Republican majority in the control of Congress to avert a government shutdown. It is truly a poison pill. We would urge our colleagues not to allow the President to include this in a must-pass bill that avoids a shutdown of the government.

966,topic-id,1329,"Mr.President, I want to first thank my colleague from Michigan for her outstanding presentation. It was succinct. It was on point. It showed all the problems with I hope we will see a lot more not only of her speaking about this--and I know we will--but those great charts she put together.  I, too, rise this afternoon again on the Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care There has been some confusion about what to call it. Speaker Ryan, one of the principal authors of the bill, doesn't want it called President Trump doesn't want it called President Trump slapped his name on buildings, ties, steaks, hotels, and golf clubs, but not on a bill that he says he supports. If it is so good, why doesn't any Republican want to put their name on it? I think the reason is because every single day, as we learn more and more about the bill, more and more Americans are turning against it. Doctors don't like it. Patients don't like it. Hospitals don't like it. Women don't like it. Millennials don't like it. Seniors don't like it. More and more Republicans don't like it. And Democrats are totally united against it.  So I just want to ask one question. TrumpCare has been public for 1 week now. Is there any group left in the country who actually likes it? I am not sure there is. So Republicans have resorted to their usual talking points.  They like to talk about access to healthcare. That is what Price said over and over again. He didn't talk about people getting healthcare, just having access to healthcare.  They say they want universal access to healthcare. Well, every American has universal access to a You can walk into the Lamborghini showroom and say: I would like to purchase one. The proprietor says: Well, that will be a couple hundred thousand dollars. And you can't buy it. Access is not enough. Access is not enough.  Every single American would like a huge mansion worth $10 million. They have access. They can go to a real estate agent and say: Show me a list of $10 million mansions in my community. That is access, but they can't afford it. We know when Price and others talk about access, they are trying to actually verbally trick the American people because people can't afford this healthcare. They will not have the healthcare, but they can inquire about it. That is all access is.  Americans are smarter than that. They know having good health insurance is what leads to affordable healthcare. Access to care will not make us well and will not save our lives if we can't afford it.  So what is the real effect of this TrumpCare bill? Last night the Congressional Budget Office made clear that 24 million fewer Americans will have health insurance if TrumpCare becomes the law of the land. It is one of the biggest broken promises that this President has made, and he has broken a lot of them. In an interview with the Washington Post, here's what the President said: ``We're going to have insurance for everybody.'' President Trump: ``We're going to have insurance for everybody'' that is ``much less expensive and better.''  Well, the CBO report confirms that TrumpCare does not even remotely come close to that pledge. The President was off by only 24 million That is more than the population of my entire  Seniors will also get crushed with higher premiums. Americans of all ages will have to pay more out-of-pocket costs with deductibles and copays. Let me give you one example from the CBO report. A 64-year-old American not eligible for Medicare who makes maybe $26,500 a year would have to pay a premium of $14,600. That is more than half of that senior's entire income. How is that even possible? If there were ever a war on seniors, this bill, TrumpCare, is it.  The CBO report also showed that TrumpCare spends more on tax breaks for the very wealthy and for insurance companies than it does on tax credits to help middle-class Americans afford health insurance. In the final tally, TrumpCare would erase more than $1 trillion from programs that help poor and middle-class families in order to fund an almost $900 billion tax break aimed largely at the wealthy and corporations. That would constitute one of the greatest transfers of wealth from the middle class and the poor to the very rich in the last few decades. As my friend Leader Pelosi said this morning: It is reverse Robin Hood, taking from the poor and giving it to the rich. I would say that this bill, TrumpCare, is reverse Robin Hood on steroids.  Rather than going back to the drawing board to solve these problems, what are our Republican friends doing? Attacking CBO, the messenger. There is just one problem: This messenger they are attacking is their own messenger. Who appointed Hall as the head of CBO? Who was the person most responsible? None other than Secretary Price, now the head of HHS, handpicked him.  Hall has great conservative Republican credentials. Not only was he picked by Tom Price, but he worked at the Mercatus Center, which we all know is funded in good part by the Koch brothers. He is a man chosen by one of the most conservative Republicans in the House, who is now HHS He taught at an institute funded by the Koch brothers, the leading funders of the hard right, and they are attacking him. They don't like his honest answers.  Republicans are attacking the referee because they are losing the game, plain and simple. Everyone from second grade on was taught by their parents not to attack the referee because it is unsportsmanlike. In this case it is a lot worse. It has life and death consequences, unlike a softball game for a second grader.  If we look at the CBO's score, it is hard to call this a healthcare bill. A healthcare bill actually intends to provide insurance to more Americans; this bill results in 24 million fewer Americans with health insurance. A healthcare bill would help people afford health insurance; this bill would likely increase costs on middle-class and working families while making it cheaper for the top 1 percent and much cheaper for the top 0.1 percent. They get the biggest benefit. They get a huge tax break. A healthcare bill would seek to protect older and sicker Americans who need health insurance the most; this bill jacks up the price on older Americans the most. A healthcare bill would make it easier for Americans to shop for health insurance, but the CBO says that under this bill, plans would be harder to compare, ``making shopping for a plan on the basis of price more difficult.'' That is their quote.  By no measure can we call TrumpCare an actual healthcare bill. The only thing this bill makes healthier is bank accounts for the wealthiest People who make above $250,000 would get an average tax break of $200,000. People who make $1 million would get an average tax break of $57,000. That is what this bill is all about.  Our Republican friends have cut taxes on the rich. That is what their tax reform bill will be about. That is what this is all about. At a time when Donald Trump was campaigning to help the middle class, the working people, he gets into office, and boom: The first big, big, big proposal reduces taxes on the wealthiest people. This is not going to play well in Peoria, Brooklyn, or  We Democrats are going to stand strong, stay united, and fight tooth and nail against TrumpCare until our Republican friends drop their repeal efforts for good.

I would also like to thank the gentleman from Florida, a member of the Rules Committee, for not only coming down to offer his argument against the facts of the case as they reside today on this important piece of legislation, but I also want to acknowledge that I know the frustration.  I know there is a lot of frustration. There is a lot of frustration from our colleagues who have lost the House, the Senate, and the They are in the middle of what might be called wandering, as they have called it, in the darkness or in the doldrums of being deep in the minority.  With that said, there is an agenda that is being laid out before the American people. It happened, Mr.Speaker, directly as a result of what we call an election--an election where all these issues, or most of them that have been discussed by the gentleman, were fully debated not only in a theater near you, but directly in congressional contests, in senatorial contests and the debates for the President of the United  The facts of the case are really pretty simple. The Republican Party will be talking about all the issues that the gentleman brought up today right before our eyes. Probably on C-SPAN, trying to compete against us, is a hearing in the Energy and Commerce  The gentleman, Greg Walden, the chairman of the committee, over the weekend released the text of the chairman's mark, the ``bill'' of the Republican Party of how we are going to look at health care.  It is true that we have Chairman Devin Nunes of the Intelligence Committee looking at the issue that was[[Page H1614]]brought up of We have forthrightly, over the weekend, said: All right. We are being asked to look at this. Just so you know, media, American people, we are going to do that. We are going to do what you have asked because we believe it is the right thing to do: open hearings, open debate, acknowledgement of the issues, and a certainty that we will go look into it, and we are going to let you know what we find. That is really where we are.  This morning, at 8 a.m. in my office, I cohosted with the gentleman from Florida an opportunity for the American Bar We brought in, from across this country--I didn't bring them in; they came into my office from across the country--a number of well-established, thoughtful, and articulate people. We didn't ask: Are you Republican? We didn't ask: Are you Democrat? We said: You represent your organization, and we want to hear from you.  This is the kind of leadership that I believe not only myself but also the gentleman, Mr.Hastings, wants to be associated with. We want to be associated with listening to the American people, trying to be thoughtful about what we do and have equal participation.  The gentleman knows that at the Rules Committee yesterday we had a very thoughtful person representing the Republican The gentleman from Iowa (Mr.King) came up. We had Mr.Buck, who was able to come and talk about this issue today.  In fact, it might be an arcane issue to the American people, but it consumes a lot of time, and it has a deliberative effect on the outcome of important cases in Federal courts and State courts across the country. We feel like it is worthy of an afternoon, an afternoon at the Rules Committee, to fully vet the legislation and an afternoon here on the floor of the House of  But like any other good majority, we have a lot of other things going on, and we are looking at the Affordable Care Act, how it worked and how we might thoughtfully replace it. We are looking at the issues related to We are looking at the American Bar  Members of Congress are extremely busy, but, Mr.Speaker, I think, with great respect, we should give the author of the bill, Mr.Buck, his time to come and thoughtfully explain why we are doing what we are doing.  I am just a dadgum chairman of the committee. I just do the things that I hope are necessary to look at every single item and being fair--being fair in the ability that people have to come and bring their ideas and trying to be fair in trying to bring them down here.  So I want to thank the gentleman for acknowledging this body is busy. This body is engaged in, as we speak, a public, open debate about what direction health care should go.  What I would like to offer is my evaluation of where we are going to be. We are going to be at a point where we do not have to scare people about where we have been or why we are going to a place.  I am on what is known as As a Member of Congress, I am legally required to be on ObamaCare for health care. But, Mr.Speaker, it is twice as expensive as what I had before; and it is not working for me, it is not working for my family, and it is not working for a lot of people.  So we are trying to look at how we might carefully, thoughtfully, artfully work with the American people, so we put the bill up and let you see it. We don't have to pass it to find out what is in it. We are trying to read the bill and understand it first.  Mr.Speaker, it is not a pledge. It is a hope that every single Member of this body will understand what is in the bill before they can respectfully, whether somebody disagrees or agrees with it, explain the bill for what is correct.  What is correct about the bill is this: if you like your own doctor, you can keep your own doctor. If you like your own healthcare plan, even if it is ObamaCare, you can do that, too.  The Republican Party is open about what we believe. We are trying to be thoughtful with the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I believe, with the leadership that we have of Paul Ryan who has attempted to work through a difficult issue, the American people will understand why Republicans not only won the election, but why Republicans have better ideas in health care, too.

Indeed, for more than seven decades, Congress has stood strong on a bipartisan basis, first against the Soviet Union and now against Russian threats against the United States and our European allies. Working across the aisle in Congress, we have supported the NATO alliance. Beginning after World War II with the Marshall Plan and continuing to this day with the European Reassurance Initiative, we have helped to build the richest economies and the most robust democracies the world has ever seen, protected in large part in Western Europe by  Today we face new and unprecedented threats from an increasingly aggressive Russia continues to illegally occupy territory in Georgia and It is on the march in Syria, and it is building up its military presence and making threatening moves toward the Baltic States and in the  There is growing evidence that it is actively interfering to spread disinformation and manipulate the outcome of elections this year in France, Germany, and across In fact there is evidence to suggest that they were involved in the Brexit vote and in the Dutch referendum last year.  Right here in our own country, Russia has used brazen cyber attacks and other measures to aggressively interfere in our Presidential election last fall. This was an attack on our sovereignty, on our democracy, and on the American people, and it was unprecedented. It requires the strongest possible response, short of armed force, to demonstrate to Vladimir Putin that this behavior will not be tolerated and it must not happen again. That is exactly the purpose of these comprehensive sanctions.  I agree with Senator Cardin, the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee, that the Foreign Relations Committee should play a pivotal leadership role in both our legislative and oversight capacities in pushing back against Russia's aggression in all its forms. By all means, this includes making the case that the skills and experience of our State Department and USAID professionals are more important than ever.  In Eastern Europe, in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, and all across the world, they are working to increase the resilience of our allies by strengthening democratic institutions, fostering the rule of law, and fighting corruption. These initiatives have played an indispensable role in helping the United States prevail in the Cold War, and they are every bit as important today as we oppose Russian aggression.  We had the opportunity in the Armed Services Committee to hear from an expert talking about Russia and about Russia's strategy. One of the things he pointed out is that, just as Russia is building up its military might, just as it is expanding its propaganda initiatives through television broadcasts like ``Russia Today'' and ``Sputnik,'' it is also looking at how it can undermine Western democracies as a way to interrupt the transatlantic alliance--the alliance between the United States and Europe that has been so important to stability in the world for the last 70 years.  That is Russia's real goal. They want to undermine They want to undermine the West and the United One of the ways they are trying to do that is by disrupting our elections. We can't allow this kind of aggression to go unpunished. If we do, we will surely face further attacks from an emboldened Russia looking to disrupt our democracy. Indeed, I think this attack should be answered with the most punishing economic and financial sanctions that we can muster, and we need to work even harder to[[Page S1683]]shore up our European allies who are facing Russian aggression and interference.  As we look at the upcoming French and German elections, there is no doubt that Russia is trying to interfere with those elections, as well, with the goal of undermining our democracy. When one begins to mess around with our elections, they strike at the heart of a democracy that is the foundation of this country.

288,topic-id,1302,"Mr.President, on this International Women's Day, we celebrate the remarkable social, economic, and political achievements of women around the world, but we also take stock of the barriers that continue to prevent hundreds of millions of women from contributing their talents as equal members of the human family.  As in years past, this year I am again joining with Senator Susan Collins in submitting a bipartisan resolution commemorating International Women's Day and highlighting its goal of advancing the equality and empowerment of women all across the globe. I especially appreciate Senator Collins'[[Page S1696]]unwavering support in working with me on this resolution.  It has been said that no nation can get ahead if it leaves half of its people behind, and in the 21st century, wherever women are respected and treated as equals, we excel, as the Presiding Officer knows, as legislators, as scientists, as entrepreneurs, artists, inventors, warriors, and in every other field. But the harsh reality remains that women make up some 51 percent of the world's population, yet we account for an estimated 70 percent of those living in poverty and two-thirds of those denied even a basic education.  So on this International Women's Day, we celebrate women's achievements, and we rededicate ourselves to achieving an equal voice, equal participation, and equal rights for all women. We also acknowledge that we still have much difficult work ahead of us.  Research tells us that women and girls' equality can be transformational for their communities and for entire countries, yet in some of the poorest parts of the world--and even in some wealthier countries--women and girls continue to be held back by injustices such as child marriage, sexual and domestic violence, denial of education, and lack of access to contraception and maternal healthcare.  In recent years, we have learned more about the intersection of so many of these issues that affect women. When girls are forced into early marriage, when women are denied contraception and have children at a very young age, this typically ends any chance to gain an education and income-earning employment. This lack of economic influence means that women remain powerless within their families and, too often, within their communities. And this, in turn, can lead to violence against women and the denial of women's most basic human and civil rights.  The good news is that this same interconnectedness can work to empower women and to lift up communities. When women and girls' rights are respected, when we have access to education and family planning services, this unleashes women's ability to participate equally in the community, in the workplace, and even in the political arena.  Indeed, we can now quantify so many of the positive ripple effects. For example, each additional year of education increases a woman's income by 25 percent. We know that children born to educated mothers are twice as likely to survive past the age of 5. By mobilizing the talents of the previously neglected half of the population--in too many places--we create more stable societies and more rapid economic development.  For decades, the United States has been a world leader in advancing and protecting the rights of women and girls around the world, including their access to contraception and family planning. In particular, I want to applaud the excellent work of the State Department's Office of Global Women's I am sponsoring legislation in this session to give this office permanent authorization, with an ambassador leading it.  However, on this International Women's Day, we must also acknowledge actions to abdicate America's leadership role in advancing women's rights. Indeed, both at home and abroad, the Trump administration has exhibited a dangerous obsession with rolling back women's reproductive rights. President Trump has promised to nominate Supreme Court Justices who will overturn Roe v. He has joined with some of the Republican leaders in Congress in pledging to terminate funding for Planned  In one of his first official acts, the President signed an Executive order reinstating and expanding the Mexico City policy, also known as the global gag rule. This rule prohibits U.financial aid to many international organizations that offer contraception and comprehensive family planning services to women.  As if the reinstatement of this policy weren't bad enough, the administration's Executive order dramatically expanded the policy to apply to all U.S.-funded global health programs--so not just family planning and counseling programs. But we believe that this expansion will include our HIV/AIDS program, known as PEPFAR, which has been so positive in saving so many lives in It was started by George We also think it will affect initiatives that fund the fights against the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, and this puts at risk 15 times more funding and millions more women and their families around the world.  Taken together, all of these actions by the new administration I believe amount to an assault on the safety and well-being of women and girls across the globe.  I have joined with Senator Susan Collins, Senator Lisa Murkowski, and 45 other Senators in introducing bipartisan legislation to permanently repeal the global gag rule. I believe--and it is well documented--that this is a misguided policy that ignores decades of research.  We shouldn't allow extreme ideology to triumph over the urgent practical needs of women across the world. The facts make clear that when family planning services are accessible and contraceptives are affordable, rates of unplanned pregnancies and abortions go down.  According to the World Health Organization, there is an estimated 225 million women in the world who would like access to family planning services, and we know that makes a difference. Here in the United States, the abortion rate has dropped to the lowest level since 1943, a success that is directly attributable to the reduced cost sharing for contraception under the Affordable Care I can attest to that because in New Hampshire, we have one of the lowest incidences of teen pregnancy in the country.  In January, we saw millions of women, men, and children, turn out for marches in Washington, New York, London, Nairobi, Tokyo, in my home capital of Concord, NH, and in dozens of other cities across the country and around the world. I think we can look at that as an early celebration of International Women's Day because what we heard from those marching was that we were marching in defense of the rights of American women, of Muslim women, of women of color, and of all women and girls across the globe.  The world heard our message loudly and clearly. We will not allow our reproductive rights and our human rights to be taken away. We will not allow women to be targeted for discrimination. We will not be taken backward.  That was our message in January, and it is our message on this International Women's We have fought long and hard for equal rights and equal treatment here in the United  We are also celebrating women here in the United We have many women who have taken the day off to recognize the role that women play that is so significant in our society, and many of us are also wearing red to demonstrate that. So on this day of celebration and solidarity, we are determined to go forward to build on the progress of recent decades, and we rededicate ourselves to achieving respect, equality, and justice for every woman in every community and every country across the globe.

During its process, the Finance Committee adopted 11 Republican amendments.  Don't you find it particularly ironic that we are seeing this TrumpCare legislation being pushed through on the House side--and what we are hearing, the rumors about what is going to happen in the Senate is it is not going to have any hearings and it is going to be brought to the floor and we are expected to vote on it without having a chance for the public to know what is in it.

665,topic-id,1367,"I appreciate the eloquent comments from the Senator from Oregon and all of his efforts to make sure we don't take away healthcare for so many people who desperately need it.  That is why I came to the floor today, because I spent the week we were back home--not last week but the week before--talking to constituents in New Hampshire and listening to what their concerns were.  What I heard was that people were deeply, deeply concerned and very upset by the efforts here to repeal the Affordable Care Act, when they didn't know what the replacement meant for them. In dozens of conversations and roundtable discussions at a townhall forum, Granite Staters shared stories of how the Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for them. I heard from people who say their lives have been saved by the law.  In fact, we can see what is at risk in the State of New Hampshire, where we have almost 600,000 Granite Staters who have preexisting conditions. We have 118,000 people who could lose coverage. We have 50,000 Granite Staters with marketplace plans who are in the exchange, 42,000 who are enrolled in Medicaid, and 31,000 who have tax credits that lower the cost of healthcare for them. If that is taken away, so many of those people have no option for getting healthcare.  What we know now, after we have finally seen the plan Republican leaders are talking about, we know those fears were well founded that they were worried they were going to lose their healthcare. What we have seen is legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act that would have catastrophic consequences not only for people in New Hampshire but for people across this country.  It is especially distressing that TrumpCare--as it has been introduced by the Republicans--would roll back expansion of the Medicaid Program, which has, in New Hampshire and across this country, been an indispensable tool in our efforts to combat the opioid epidemic. In addition, we are seeing, as the Senator from Oregon pointed out, that TrumpCare would terminate healthcare subsidies for the middle class and for other working Americans, and it would replace those subsidies with totally inadequate tax credits--as low as $2,000, which doesn't begin to pay for healthcare coverage for an individual, much less a family. This means as many as 20 million Americans could lose their healthcare coverage.  Even as the bill makes devastating cuts to the middle class, it gives the wealthiest Americans a new tax break worth several hundred thousand dollars per taxpayer. I think this proposed legislation is totally out of touch with the lives of millions of working Americans, people whose health and financial situation would be turned upside down by the bill.  Last week, in his response to President Trump's address to Congress, former Steve Beshear of Kentucky said something that really resonated with me. He reminded us that people who have access to healthcare thanks to ObamaCare are ``not aliens from some other planet.'' As he described, ``They are our friends and neighbors. . . . We sit on the bleachers with them on Friday night. We worship in the pews with them on Sunday morning. They're farmers, restaurant workers, part-time teachers, nurses' aides, construction workers, entrepreneurs,'' and often minimum wage workers. ``And before the Affordable Care Act, they woke up every morning and went to work, just hoping and praying they wouldn't get sick, because they knew they were just one bad diagnosis away from bankruptcy.''  To understand why people in New Hampshire are so upset and fearful about efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, we have to look again at this chart because some 120,000 Granite Staters could lose their health insurance. That is nearly 1 in every 10 people in the State of New  In particular, repeal of the Affordable Care Act would very literally have life-or-death consequences for thousands of people who are fighting opioid addiction, who have been able to access lifesaving treatment thanks to the expansion of Medicaid and the Affordable Care  Sadly, one of the statistics we are not happy about in New Hampshire is that we have the second highest rate of per capita drug overdose deaths in the country. We trail only West The chief medical examiner in New Hampshire projects that there were 470 drug-related deaths in 2016, including a sharp increase in overdose deaths among those who were 19 years old or younger. For a small State like New Hampshire, this is a tragedy of staggering proportions, affecting not just those who overdose but their families and entire communities.  I am happy to say, in the last couple of years, we made real progress in combating this epidemic because we had the Affordable Care Act and its expansion of Medicaid, which has given thousands of Granite Staters access to lifesaving treatment. Over the past year, I had a chance to visit treatment centers all across New I met with individuals who are struggling with substance use disorders and providers who are trying to make sure they get the treatment they need.  Last month, at a center in the Monadnock region of New Hampshire, I had an amazing private meeting with more than 30 people in recovery from substance use disorders. They are putting their lives back together, hoping to reclaim their jobs, to get back with their families, and they are able to do that largely because of treatment that is made possible by the Affordable Care  One patient shared her story with me. As with so many others in treatment, her story is one of making mistakes, of falling into dependency, of struggling with all her might to escape her addiction. She is in recovery for the second time, and she said that this time for her is a life-or-death situation. She has no family support. She worries that she will be homeless when she leaves the treatment program, but she is grateful for the Affordable Care Act because it has given her one more shot at getting sober and the chance for a positive future.  At a forum in Manchester--New Hampshire's largest city--a courageous woman named Ashley Hurteau said[[Page S1728]]that access to healthcare as an enrollee in Medicaid expansion was critical to her addiction recovery. She had been arrested following the overdose death of her husband. Ashley said an understanding police officer and a drug court were key to her recovery. She added this:       I am living proof that, by giving individuals suffering      with substance use disorder access to health insurance, we,      as a society, are giving people like me the chance to be who      we really are again.  Without that access to treatment, where would Ashley be?  Several weeks ago I received a letter from Nansie Feeny, who lives in Concord, the capital of New She told me the Affordable Care Act had saved her son's life. This is what she wrote:       [My son] Benjamin went to Keene State College with the same      hopes and dreams many have when building their American      dream. While there he tried heroin. Addiction overcame him      but did not stop him from graduating. After graduation he      suffered a long road of near death existence. After a couple      of episodes where he had to be revived (fentanyl) he chose      recovery. And it was due to ObamaCare that we were able to      get him insured so he could get the proper help he needed and      [into] a suboxone program that assisted him with staying      ``clean.''       In April--  She wrote, and you could read between the lines how relieved she was--       it will be a year for Ben in his recovery. Without      ObamaCare, this would not have been possible. . . . I can't      find the words to define my gratitude to President I      believe my son would not be alive today if it were not for      this plan that provided the means he needed to get the help      he needed at the time he needed it. Ben still has a long road      ahead of him but I will see to it that he never walks it      alone.  I also want to share a powerfully moving letter from Melissa Davis, an attorney in Plymouth, ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgS1714.txt,1901,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,9.0,March

669,topic-id,453,"That is absolutely correct.  I remember meeting one young man early in the fall, in the middle of the campaign early last year. He came up to me in Manchester and said: I am so worried about what is going to happen in this election because I am in recovery; I am an addict. He said: I am worried that whoever gets elected is not going to continue to make sure that I can get the treatment I need. He said: I am worried about Mr. As my colleague pointed out, Donald Trump, when he was campaigning in New Hampshire, made a lot of promises about how he was going to address the heroin and opioid epidemic, how he was going to make sure that people could get treatment, treatment at a cost they could afford.  Well, thanks to the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of Medicaid and the great work by our Republican legislature and our Democratic Governor--then-Governor Hassan, who is now in the Senate--we passed a plan to make sure that people who had substance use disorders could get treatment.  Last year we had 48,000 applications submitted under the expansion of Medicaid for treatment of substance use disorders. If we pulled the plug on that Medicaid expansion so that people couldn't get that treatment, they wouldn't have anywhere to go.  That is what I heard when I was at Phoenix House in Dublin, in the western part of New Hampshire, a couple of weeks ago. I was sitting around with about 30 people in recovery, people who are hopeful for the first time in a long time because they are in treatment and they can see they can put their lives back together.  I said to them: What happens if we no longer have the Medicaid Program?  They said: We don't have any other options. We don't have treatment.  What we heard from President Trump is that he was going to introduce a healthcare plan that was going to cover more people for less money and better quality. Well, that is not what we are seeing.  The TrumpCare that was introduced in the House this week that they marked up and that is going to be coming to the Senate doesn't do that. It reduces coverage under the Medicaid It would throw thousands of people off of their treatment for substance use disorders, and there is nowhere else for them to go.  This is not an acceptable plan. This does not do what the President promised he was going to do. It is not what he promised in New Hampshire, it is not what he promised in the campaign, and it is not what he has promised since he became  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgS1714.txt,1901,OPPOSING GOP'S HEALTHCARE REPEAL,2017.0,9.0,March
671,topic-id,353,"I think that is a huge problem. New Hampshire has a population that is one of the fastest aging in the country. As Senator Wyden points out, not only does the TrumpCare legislation change how people on Medicare are charged for their health insurance, but it also would change the other aspects of the Affordable Care Act that have been beneficial, such as preventive care under  It would also change the effort to close the doughnut hole--the cost of the prescription drugs that seniors buy. That has been a huge benefit to people in New Hampshire over the last few years because they are beginning to see their costs for prescription drugs affected positively. So it will have a huge impact on seniors in New  The other issue that will have an impact not only on seniors but on everybody is what will happen to our rural hospitals. In New Hampshire, because we have a lot of rural areas in the State, we have a lot of small towns. Most of our hospitals are small and rural. They have benefitted significantly under the Affordable Care Act because they have been able to get paid for people who come to the emergency room for treatment. We have gotten a lot of people out of emergency rooms and into primary care. Most hospitals have seen about a 40-percent decline in people using emergency rooms for their healthcare. That has been a huge, important benefit to our rural hospitals that are operating on very thin margins that we need to keep open, not just because of the healthcare they provide but because of the jobs they provide. In most of our small communities, those hospitals are among the biggest employers.  There are huge impacts if we repeal the Affordable Care Act and we put in place this TrumpCare policy that doesn't cover as many people. It is going to cost more, it is going to reduce the help people are getting[[Page S1730]]through their healthcare coverage, and it is going to have a detrimental impact on people in the State of New Hampshire and across this country.

370,topic-id,932,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank my colleague and friend from Georgia for yielding time to me.  Mr.Speaker, with this package of bills, the majority is taking a sledgehammer to civil litigation. I know that my colleague and I are not going to agree with that because I listened intently to what he had to say. But it is closing courthouse doors to ordinary people who are injured in the workplace and makes it harder for working people wronged by the rich and powerful to seek justice.  First, H.985 is really a solution in search of a problem. It uses the false notion of rampant fraud in the legal system to shield corporate wrongdoers and deny their victims relief.  Second, H.906 has the potential to further victimize asbestos victims.  Third, H.720 would roll back significant improvements to the Rules of Civil Procedure and repeat a failed experiment that led to a decade of problems in the courts. By requiring mandatory sanctions that tie judges' hands, we saw an avalanche of unnecessary litigation.  The majority is wasting time and taxpayer money to make changes that evidence and the experts tell us are not necessary and could actually cause more harm than good. It doesn't make sense.  But consider, Mr.Speaker, how the majority conducted itself on health care for a decade now. Almost immediately after President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, 13 Republican State attorneys general filed a Federal lawsuit opposing health reform. That was back in 2010. Since that time, the majority has voted over and over again--more than 60 times--to undermine the  CBS News has highlighted that it costs the taxpayers an estimated $24 million a week to run the House of Think how many millions of dollars of legislative time the majority wasted on these votes that never had any chance of becoming law under the previous They wasted taxpayers' dollars and they wasted precious time. The majority spoke again and again about repeal and replace, and all the while, they didn't have a thing in the world to replace the health care with.  Former Speaker John Boehner recently made that clear, and it wasn't until this week that the majority finally let Members of Congress and the American people see their latest effort--and it would be a catastrophe for families across the country. More and more groups and individuals are lining up against it.  People would be forced to pay more for worse coverage if they could afford any coverage at all. The bill would also defund Planned Parenthood, which more than 2.5 million people, men and women, rely on for lifesaving preventive care, like cancer screenings and STI testing, every single year.  It is truly astonishing that the majority is trying to rush through this bill without a Congressional Budget Office estimate about how much it would cost or what impact it would have on the insurance market.  Let me quote from a Washington Post story this morning written by the great Karen Tumulty:       While it is not uncommon for panels to consider legislation      without the Congressional Budget Office first weighing in,      veterans of the process say that doing so on bills as far-     reaching as the healthcare overhaul is rare and ill-advised.  We don't have any idea how many people would gain or lose coverage without the CBO estimate, but we do know that this bill would take us back to the days before the Affordable Care Act when American people were on their own to try and get health care without any real safeguards in place at all; when families were liable to go bankrupt from heavy healthcare costs in a year's time, and the ACA protects them from that by saying that once an insured person has spent $4,500 a year on health care, the insurance company will pay the rest, and for a family, $12,500 to insure them. That is something so rarely talked about that is in this bill that I think is of vast importance, and we would lose that.  Billionaires would get a tax break, but working families probably couldn't afford health care.  We are rushing through this healthcare bill without a proper understanding of its cost or its impacts. The majority completely skipped the hearing process and, therefore, hasn't heard from experts or doctors or people battling an illness--except, I guess, what is going on torturing people over in the Energy and Commerce Committee where they have been there since, what, over 24 hours now.  So we were encouraged yesterday when we learned at the Rules Committee that White House Secretary[[Page H1965]]Sean Spicer had said at a briefing yesterday:       Every Member of the House and the Senate will be able to      have their opportunity to have amendments offered through the      committee process and on the floor.  It looks like we are not going to have that opportunity. And I do not have enthusiasm for the notion that we will have an open rule since, under this Speaker we have not had any, and the Democrats long to be able to offer some amendments to this bill. I certainly hope that that might be the case.  Now, the only way that happens is through the open rule. As I said, we haven't seen one of those in Speaker Ryan's leadership. I hope the majority follows through with the White House's promise of an open rule because, more than anything on this, the American people deserve an open and transparent process as this bill moves forward.

371,topic-id,330,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that would require a CBO cost estimate to be made publicly available for any legislation that amends or repeals the Affordable Care Act which may be considered in the Energy and Commerce or Ways and Means Committees or on the House floor.  The Committees on Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce are marking up repeal legislation today. Legislation this significant should not advance through the committee process, let alone the House, without first hearing from our nonpartisan budget experts at CBO on what the cost and overall impact would be.  Mr.Speaker, one of the most enduring symbols of fairness is Lady Justice, who is depicted holding the Scales of Justice that represent fairness in our courts. That central idea is embodied in the fact that justice in the United States of America is supposed to be delivered fairly, without any bias toward wealth or privilege.  It is no secret that sometimes we do struggle to live up to that ideal. We have seen evidence of that far too often recently. But, Mr.Speaker, this Chamber shouldn't be actively working to tilt those scales toward the rich and the powerful, but that is what this legislation would do. Considering these bills wastes their money and fritters away the time we should be spending addressing our crumbling infrastructure and the skyrocketing cost of education.

394,topic-id,474,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment would create an exception to this bill for instances of public health risks, including byproducts of hydraulic fracturing, well stimulation, or any water contamination. Fracking, especially in my home State of Florida, is dangerous, and its effects can be far-reaching. Just last week, a State senate committee voted unanimously to ban the practice in our State, and the bill continues to move through.  Pollution can reach our aquifers that provide drinking water to millions. Sometimes concerned citizens must go to court to stop this. Access to justice is a fundamental American right, and we must protect it. Sometimes in Washington, up is down and right is wrong. This, unfortunately, is the case with the so-called Innocent Party Protection                              {time}  1530  This bill is incredibly harmful to those injured by corporate wrongdoers. If someone drinks poisoned water as a result of fracking, well stimulation, or general water contamination, this bill will make it harder for them to get justice for their injuries. By restricting access to State courts, the courts that are closest to the people, this bill would deny justice.  The bill will deny plaintiffs their right to choose a State court forum for their claims and will instead allow defendant companies that negligently pollute water to drag a case out, which will drive up costs and increase burdens for plaintiffs by removing it to Federal court.  Then, once a case is in Federal court, instead of litigating over the merits of the case, the courts will argue over the various requirements that this bill establishes. Placing a higher threshold that a plaintiff must satisfy to get the case sent back to State court is unnecessary and unduly burdensome.  The amendment I am offering would restore access to justice. It would allow people whose water has been contaminated by fracking and related activities to seek damages from corporate wrongdoers.  This amendment isn't just a hypothetical exercise. Here in my hand I hold 18 cases involving fracking. They are 18 cases where fracking led to injury. In 10 of these cases, plaintiffs sued in State court, raising State claims, yet defendants removed the case to Federal court, only to have the Federal court remand the cases back to the State due to lack of diversity jurisdiction.  Thus, I hold here 10 cases where a remand back to State court would be denied under this bill. If this bill had been enacted, I hold here 10 cases that would have been denied justice. Four of these 18 hydraulic fracturing cases are still pending. Will we deny justice for these four cases?  For these plaintiffs and for future plaintiffs, I ask my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment and safeguard justice to all who drink water.  Mr.Chair, I urge support of my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.[[Page H1973]]    ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1968-2.txt,99999999999999,INNOCENT PARTY PROTECTION ACT,2017.0,9.0,March

448,topic-id,324,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment would strike section 1721 of this Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act of 2017. The irony of section 1721 is it unfairly subjects class action plaintiffs to an inevitable deluge of prolonged delay.  A stay of discovery means no depositions. It means injured people will not get essential documents. It means victims will not be entitled to the names of necessary witnesses and more as long as a motion that may dispose of the case is pending. There is nothing to prevent a corporation from filing motion after motion to obstruct a victim's path to justice.  Numerous consumer, civil rights, environmental, labor, and other public interest groups oppose this bill because it builds in an automatic stay of discovery in the district court whenever an alleged wrongdoer files any one of a list of motions, including common motions like a motion to strike, a motion to dismiss, and a motion to dispose of class action allegations. There will be no end to the filing of these motions. This is an invitation for gamesmanship and delay and will deprive judges of the ability to properly manage their cases.  The framers of the bill want you to believe that plaintiffs are greedy, undeserving people who want to hinder small business. This could not be further from the truth. If there are big settlements, it is because the damage to the victims was heinous.  Is there any doubt that huge corporations would file motion after motion to obstruct these victims from getting the facts they need?  Class actions are critical for enforcement of laws prohibiting discrimination in employment, housing, education, and access to public areas and services.  At the end of the day, if we are trying to reduce litigation, why have this glaring loophole where someone continues to file motions to stop ordinary discovery from going forward?

764,topic-id,615,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment would reinstate the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure rule 11(c)(2) safe harbor provision, which allows parties to avoid penalties, by withdrawing or correcting the claims within 14 days from when the alleged violation of rule 11(b) becomes known, anytime up until the end of the discovery period.  This bill would force attorneys to assess their case blindly as it stands. Every attorney knows to assess their case based upon an objective set of facts regarding the situation.  A good attorney would never overpromise a cause of action, but this bill prevents even a fair assessment of a case. A full and accurate analysis of the merits of the case must be done on day one, because this bill requires mandatory sanctions with no grace period. We have tried this already, and it did not work.  This bill will eliminate rule 11(c)(2)'s safe harbor provision, which currently allows the target of a rule 11 motion for sanctions to withdraw or correct the paper claim, defense, contention, or denial that is the subject of the motion for sanctions within 21 days after service.  Between 1938 and 1983, there were only 19 rule 11 filings. In 1983, rule 11 was changed to the standard being proposed by this bill. In the 10 years without this safe harbor provision, nearly 7,000 motions for sanctions were made. A 1989 study showed that roughly one-third of all Federal civil lawsuits involved rule 11 satellite litigation, and approximately one-fourth of all those cases on the docket involved rule 11 actions that did not result in sanctions. Thus, attorneys had a dual job: one to try the case, and the other to try the opposing counsel.  We can't go back to a failed system. The amount of sanction litigation that clogged the system was so extensive that in 1993, a mere 10 years after this failed legal experiment began, a safe harbor provision was established to unclog the system, and it worked. Since then, the amount of rule 11 sanction satellite litigation has come down, and the courts are now better able to focus on the case at hand.  In committee, Mr.Cicilline of Rhode Island, recommended the reimplementation of the 21-day safe harbor provision.                              {time}  1000  Instead of following this commonsense proposal, the committee rejected it by an 18-4 vote. I believe such an important provision needs to be revisited, but with a compromise. That is why I drafted this amendment that offers a 14-day safe harbor provision; and as a measure to protect further abuse, my safe harbor amendment is only available prior to the completion of discovery, yet another attempt to have a compromise here.  The intent for this discovery provision is that an attorney, during discovery, may realize a flaw in their case. Such a revelation should allow an attorney to correct or withdraw their claim without having the fear of having mandatory automatic sanctions imposed on them. Instead, this bill, as written, immediately places sanctions on the mistaken lawyer. This is well-intentioned, but it does not acknowledge the realities of litigation or the legal process.  In the real world, clients can easily misrepresent a situation to their counsel, and the truth won't be known until discovery. This bill will have a stifling effect on the legal community and will lead to denied justice because attorneys will not be willing to take a case unless it is a guaranteed win.  We should take the lessons learned from the 1983 experiment and preserve the safe harbor provision to protect well-intended plaintiffs' attorneys and not stack the deck against those who seek justice.  Mr.Chair, I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.[[Page H2031]]    ",CREC-2017-03-10-pt1-PgH2025-3.txt,99999999999999,FAIRNESS IN CLASS ACTION LITIGATION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,10.0,March

7,topic-id,633,"Mr.Speaker, 4 years ago, I stood on this same floor and condemned the online bullying of U.Marine Corps servicewomen on a public Facebook page. Today I stand before you again, incredulous, angry, and sad, to say that absolutely nothing has changed.  This weekend, news broke that the Department of Defense is investigating scores of enlisted marines for compiling thousands of naked photos of other marines--servicewomen--often surreptitiously, and distributing them through Facebook and Google The site in question is called ``Marines United,'' claiming a membership of over 30,000 people.  The photos are being tightly held due to the ongoing investigation, but all indications are they are just as repulsive as what we saw 4 years ago.                              {time}  1015  The report contains samples of the comments posted about female marines, which are too obscene to read on the House floor. Online commentators also reportedly called for the rape of some of the marines portrayed in the photos, which is terrifying, given many of the women are identified by name and base.[[Page H1599]]  This is not about sex or fun or boys will be boys. This is about marines deliberately trying to degrade, humiliate, and threaten fellow marines. They encouraged stalking, distributed stolen intimate photos, and reduced their comrades to a collection of body parts.  Well, I am here to say that women marines will not be treated like sides of beef. They are warriors and should be treated as such.  As one female marine who recently completed the once male-only infantry training said: ``Right now I'm supposed to be able to trust every male marine. And with some of the stuff I see them saying about women, that's just not happening.''  This cultural rot, which has clearly regressed even further since 2013, harms our troops and our readiness. It is abundantly clear that this is not a few bad marines; rather, it is another example of a culture of rot. It is a blight that infects not just the ranks of the enlisted, but also the officer corps.  Military leadership has utterly failed in their responsibility to protect their troops, punish those involved, and uphold the professed values of the That is why the survivors of this latest atrocity did not have the confidence to notify their superiors, for fear of retribution. It took a marine veteran and blogger to blow the whistle, and for that, he has been threatened with death and his wife has been threatened with rape.  Back in 2013, then-Commandant General Amos wrote to me saying, ``We share your indignation,'' regarding deplorable images on social media that denigrate women in the United States Marine They were words--just words. I fear that military leadership will say anything to placate Congress and an outraged public, but then do nothing.  I recently had the opportunity to meet with Secretary of Defense James I found him to be engaging, thoughtful, and committed to our troops. Secretary Mattis is also a retired marine.  Secretary Mattis, I hope that you are deeply disturbed by what we are seeing within the I hope that you are listening to servicewomen like the one whose private photos were posted in the 2013 Facebook group.  One left the service in 2015, and says that just knowing her pictures are still out there has silenced her. She said: ``I wanted to be a positive influence on the community. And this diminished me. It took away everything.''  Secretary Mattis, this must change now. I call on you to hold your leadership accountable for these failures; to establish a culture of dramatic change. That means heads should roll.  Talk is cheap. Action is what is needed for the integrity of the military. Survivors must be supported. That will only happen if those bad marines are drummed out of the Corps, with no exceptions.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgH1598-3.txt,1890,HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA,2017.0,8.0,March

657,topic-id,818,"Mr.President, as Senator Wyden's colloquy comes to an end, I will make a few comments in addition to those of my colleagues, and I very much appreciate all of their work.  There are so many different things to talk about as it relates to how healthcare impacts people. As Senator Casey said, this is very personal; it is not political. There are a lot of politics around this, but it is very, very personal.  In Michigan, when we are talking about healthcare, in Medicaid alone we are talking about 650,000 people who have been able to get coverage now. Most of them are working in minimum wage jobs, and they now are able to get healthcare but couldn't before, as well as their children. That adds to the majority of seniors who are in nursing homes now, folks getting long-term care, folks getting help for Alzheimer's and other challenges and who are relying on Medicaid healthcare to be able to cover their costs.  I want to share a letter, as well, from Wendy, a pediatric nurse practitioner from Oakland County in We have received so many letters--I am so grateful for that--and emails.  She writes:       As a pediatric nurse practitioner, I have seen so many of      my patients benefit from the Affordable Care Physical      exams for the kids are now covered in full, with no co-pay.      This means the kids are in to see us, which means we catch      healthcare issues and early problems with growth or      development that otherwise might be undetected and left      untreated until it became a much bigger problem.  Isn't that what we all want for our children, to catch things early?       Immunizations are covered, which keeps everyone safer.      Screening tests are covered, so potential problems are caught      while they can still be managed. This better care keeps kids      healthier and happier and prevents longer term care costs.  She goes on to write:       The Medicaid expansion means even more kids are covered,      keeping not only those children healthier but keeping      everyone around them healthier. Previously, parents of      children who did not have insurance coverage would not seek      care until the children were so ill that they could not see      another option. Frequently, these children then utilized      emergency room care--  Which, by the way, is the most expensive way to treat health problems--     [it was] not only a missed opportunity for complete and      preventative healthcare but at a cost passed on to the      community.       On a much more personal level, in 2015, our granddaughter,      at age 3, was diagnosed with epilepsy related to a genetic      condition . . . which made her brain form abnormally. On top      of the epilepsy, she has developmental delays and autism, all      related to her double cortex syndrome. Although our daughter      and son-in-law are fully employed (teacher and paramedic),      she qualifies for Children's Special Health Care (under      Medicaid). This has been a huge blessing for us, and without      it our family would have been financially devastated.       We are hopeful that my granddaughter will continue to have      good seizure control and will develop to reach her full      potential, but without the care that her private insurance      and Children's Special Health Care provides, she would not      have much of a chance of getting anywhere near her potential.      I do not want to even consider how it will affect her future      if insurance companies can refuse to cover her care due to      her preexisting condition.  She concludes:       Please do not let partisan politics take precedence over      doing what is right and what is best for the health of every      U.citizen.  I know we are all getting hundreds of thousands of letters and emails and phone calls of very similar stories because healthcare is personal to each of[[Page S1724]]us--to our children, our grandchildren, our moms, and dads, and grandpas and grandmas. It is not political.  I am very grateful for my colleagues' being here today. I want to speak not only about the importance of expansion under Medicaid but also about the person who would be in charge of that very, very important set of services. That is the nomination in front of us, that of Seema Verma to be the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  This is a critical position, especially given the ongoing efforts that we are seeing right now to repeal healthcare--the Affordable Care Act--and replace it with legislation that would literally rip away coverage for millions of people and pull the thread that unravels our entire healthcare system.

And I would only say ``amen'' as he was speaking because there is so much at stake for the moms and dads and kids and grandpas and grandmas in Michigan and And that is why we are on the floor speaking out so strongly and fighting so hard to defeat a very bad proposal.  Let me start by indicating that what is being debated right now in the House, the TrumpCare proposal, is not what President Trump promised. It is just not what he promised. He said it would be great. He said that people would get as good healthcare or better healthcare and that it would cost less. We know that is simply not true.  According to a FOX News report on the increase of people who would no longer have healthcare, be able to get medical care, be able to go to a doctor under the new TrumpCare plan, 14 million people would lose their healthcare, be unable to take their children to a doctor, just in the next year, by next year. People will have to go to the emergency room rather than a family doctor. Rather than being able to take care of a cold or something minor for their children, chances are that it would become something very serious before they would be able to be in a position to take them to a doctor or, more likely, an emergency room.  We know that in the next 10 years, we are talking about 24 million Americans--moms, dads, grandpas, grandmas, kids who would no longer be able to see a doctor and no longer have health insurance.  TrumpCare would also cost 7 million people who have an employer right now who is providing them health insurance so that they can get to the doctor and care for their family--7 million people would lose the insurance they have through their employer right now. That is not making things better. There would be 7 million people in that situation.  This is really a triple-whammy for middle-class families across our country and certainly for people in There would be higher costs, less coverage, and more taxes.  I believe we need to join with AARP and our doctors, hospitals, nurses, people who treat cancer, Alzheimer's, breast cancer, juvenile diabetes, and all of the other people who care for and advocate on behalf of loved ones or themselves, people who need to be able to see a doctor and get healthcare coverage. We need to say no to the TrumpCare plan that is being proposed in the  One thing that is really outrageous in this proposal is a senior tax that allows insurance companies to hike up rates on older It is right in the budget report. This is in the budget report we have now received. They are saying that in 2026--in 10 years--a single woman or man 64 years of age making $26,500 a year who currently pays $1,700 for their health insurance would suddenly get a bill for $14,600. So under this plan, that 64-year-old is going to go from $1,700 out-of-pocket to see a doctor to get their treatments, to be able to get the care they need, to $14,600. If you compare that to somebody who is 64 and makes $3.7 million a year, the good news for them is that they are going to get a $200,000 tax cut.  Most people in Michigan work hard every single day, get up and go to work, maybe take a shower after work, maybe take a shower before work, but most of the people I represent don't make $200,000 a year. Yet we are talking about a $200,000 tax cut for multimillionaires, which is in this proposal.  That is why the AARP, a nonpartisan organization representing millions of people across the country, is actively working to defeat this.  We also know that this creates what I call a voucher under Medicaid, meaning that instead of paying for whatever nursing home care is needed--if your mom or dad has Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, or they are simply in a nursing home for a variety of reasons, right now they get whatever care they need. There is not a cap on the amount of care. There is not a limit on the amount of care. Under this proposal, there would be X amount of dollars put aside for your mom or dad or grandpa or grandma, and if the care they needed because of their Alzheimer's disease was more than that, you would pay for it or your elderly parent in some way would have to figure out how to pay for it. This is outrageous.  Medicaid for families and for seniors in nursing homes has been a critical part of making sure people can get the medical care they need. I, frankly, celebrate today the fact that under the Medicaid expansion, under the Affordable Care Act, 97 percent of the children in Michigan can see a doctor. Imagine that. Ninety-seven percent of the children, almost all of our children, can go to a family doctor. Their moms and dads know that they are going to be able to take them to the doctor when they get sick. I don't want to roll that back, but that is what the TrumpCare proposal does.  We also know--because this was reported on FOX News as well--that the new plan would add a 15- to 20-percent premium increase for individuals starting next year--a 15- to 20-percent premium increase for individuals starting next year at the same time as big tax cuts for multimillionaires.  I have to say, as somebody who worked very, very hard on the women's healthcare provisions and authored the maternity care provisions, I find it outrageous that the TrumpCare proposal would mean that maternity care is not covered as part of basic healthcare for women.  Prior to the Affordable Care Act being passed, only 12 percent of the plans in Michigan--12 plans out of 100--offered maternity care. If you tried to buy maternity care as part of the basic coverage, you would have to get a rider. You would have to pay more.  Let's say maybe you gambled. Well, you weren't planning on getting pregnant and you weren't sure what was going to happen, so you didn't pay extra. Then you get pregnant. Guess what. You had a preexisting condition, and you couldn't get insurance. We don't want to go back to the time where being a woman was, in fact, a preexisting condition. And speaking of preexisting conditions, this plan puts them back in the hands of the insurance companies and creates penalties for people.  The truth is, under the Affordable Care Act, we made sure that when you purchase insurance, it is a real plan. It is not a junk plan. You can't get dropped when you get sick. If you have a preexisting condition, they can't block you. If you are a woman, you don't have to pay more. If you have a mental illness rather than a physical illness, you don't have to pay more. If you need cancer treatments, the insurance company can't tell your doctor how many treatments you are going to get or how much they will pay for your treatments. Everybody has benefited from that. Everybody who has insurance in this country has benefited from that.  One of the most important provisions relates to preexisting conditions, and that, in fact, is not continued, as it should be for American families.  Finally, let me just say that while we are talking about people paying more, getting less coverage, middle-class families paying more in taxes, guess what. Wealthy people do not. So if you are a multimillionaire, you are going to get big tax cuts in this provision, and the middle-class family, the working family, is going to pay for it. They are going to pay for it in higher premiums. They are going to pay for it in less healthcare for their family. That is absolutely unacceptable.  In addition to that, there is a tax break for insurance company CEOs so that they can, in fact, get a raise up to $1 million. So in this proposal, very wealthy people--insurance and drug companies' CEOs--are taken care of. Vast amounts of money are put back in their pockets, while money is taken out of yours. Absolutely unacceptable.  That is why we, as Democrats, are fighting so hard to make sure this does not happen, is not passed, and that, in fact, we will work together to strengthen our healthcare system.  We know there are areas where premiums are too high, copays are too high, and we need to work together on a bipartisan basis to fix that. But unraveling our entire system, ripping it apart, creating chaos, more cost, less[[Page S1792]]ability to go to the doctor, and less medical care for people is absolutely unacceptable.  The bottom line is that TrumpCare means more money out of your pocket and less healthcare for you and your family. That is just wrong in the greatest country in the world.

When I speak with North Country students and teachers in my district, I hear about the positive impacts of Pell grants. In my district, an average of 52 percent of students attending SUNY institutions are offered Pell grants.  Today's learners are different than previous generations, and their advancement toward completion is stifled by a Federal aid system built upon traditional spring and fall semesters. To support our students, I have introduced the Flexible Pell Grants for 21st Century Students Act, important legislation to expand access to Pell grants year-round. This change will allow students to accelerate toward completion and achieve their goals with less debt.  We must do more to bring flexibility to higher education, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this important bill.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1959-2.txt,2263,"MEND THE LAW, NOT END THE LAW",2017.0,9.0,March

685,topic-id,803,"Mr.President, I have been coming down to the floor for the past several months recognizing Alaskans who make our State great and our country better for all of us. I really enjoy doing this because it gives me an opportunity to share the excellent work my citizens are doing in their communities. It also gives me a few minutes to highlight to all my colleagues here in the Senate--and to some of those Americans who might be watching at home--to talk a little bit more about the unique place I call home and am honored to serve and represent in the  This week, I would like to honor pilot Glen Hanson, who is right now somewhere flying above racing sled dogs in the far north in Alaska, literally as we speak.  Before I get to how he is helping Alaskans and how he is this week's Alaskan of the Week, let me take you back through a remarkable bit of history that happened in Nome, AK, in 1925, when a diphtheria serum was desperately needed for the children in The nearest batch of serum was 1,000 miles away in Anchorage, There weren't--and still aren't--any roads that connect Nome to There was very challenging winter weather during this time, so no airplanes could fly. In fact, the nearest train station was over 700 miles away from Nome, so people traveled mostly by dog sled.  On the night of January 27, 1925, musher ``Wild Bill'' Shannon tied a 20-pound package of serum wrapped in protective fur around his sled. He and his nine dogs started the journey called then the ``Great Race of Mercy'' across the frozen Alaska land. Miles later, he met up with another racer and another team of dogs, and the relay continued all across Alaska, over 1,000 miles--20 mushers and 150 sled dogs--through some of the world's most rugged terrain and some of the world's most brutal weather. In fact, right now in parts of Alaska where the Iditarod is happening, it is 40 to 50 below zero.  That original race, the Great Race of Mercy, began to be reenacted, with some twists, in 1973 and continues today. In fact, it is going on right now, the Iditarod, the Last Great Race, in my great People from all across the world come to participate in it and come to watch it. It is the quintessential Alaskan event that involves the work of hundreds of Alaskans, lodge owners, veterinarians, dogs, dog handlers, volunteers, pilots--hundreds, thousands.  Alaska, as you might know, is home to more veterans per capita than any other State, but we are also home to more pilots per capita than any other Our pilots are a vital part of our economy and transportation, and they are a vital part of the In fact, the race couldn't exist without them.  Every year, more than a dozen volunteer pilots load their planes for the Iditarod race with more than 100,000 pounds of dog food, hundreds of bales of hay, and lumber for tents. They fly the veterinarians, the judges, the dog handlers, and so many of the volunteers out to the checkpoints hundreds of miles away. We call them the Iditarod Air Force, and every one of them deserves recognition.  That gets me back to Anchorage resident Glen Hanson, who is our Alaskan of the Glen, along with his brother Bert, is tied among this year's pilots as the longest serving volunteer in the Iditarod Air He began volunteering for the Last Great Race--the Iditarod Air Force--in 1984. Glen has since put in roughly 1,500 hours of volunteer time, making sure that the Last Great Race continues and that the dogs and the mushers are taken care of--taken care of right now in 40 to 50 below zero, as this race is going on.  This year, Glen won the Alaska Air Carriers Association Iditarod Humanitarian Service Upon receiving it, the Air Carriers Association wrote to Glen:       You are obviously an accomplished pilot held in high regard      by your peers. While there are many volunteers working to      make the race possible, you consistently go above and beyond      the call of duty. You are always quietly willing to take      every assignment, no matter how unglamorous or uncomfortable.      You step up time after time to fly in the challenging air      strips to ensure that the musher supplies and race personnel      are available to keep the race safe.  Thank you, Glen, for all you do to keep our great Alaska history alive. And thanks to all the pilots in the Iditarod Air Force this year and so many of the other volunteers who keep everybody safe--and are doing it right now during this year's And to all the mushers and these great dogs, good luck. Everyone involved makes this truly the last great race in                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgS1738.txt,2290,REMEMBERING PAUL IRON CLOUD,2017.0,9.0,March

Republicans refuse to wait for the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group, to tell us how much their plan will cost and how many people will get thrown off their health care plans.

332,topic-id,357,"Mr.Speaker, I rise this morning to share with my constituents what we know about the Republican healthcare plan and, more importantly, what we don't know.  We know that the Republican proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act will cut taxes for the wealthiest people in  We know that it will eventually eliminate the Medicaid expansion, which is responsible for ensuring millions of Americans, including nearly 80,000 people in my district alone.  We know that the GOP replacement plan shifts costs to seniors and low-income families while restricting women's access to reproductive health.  We know that it is a windfall for the healthy and wealthy and a disaster for nearly everyone else.  Now, this is what we know about the GOP healthcare plan, but perhaps more alarming is what we don't know. My Republican colleagues cannot answer the two most important questions about their proposal: How much will it cost and how many people will it cover?  Mr.Speaker, Congress should not take any further action on this bill without knowing its impact on the budget and its consequences for the American people.  I am stunned--stunned--that my Republican colleagues are planning to move forward on a plan that is, quite literally, a matter of life and death for millions of American families without knowing exactly what they are moving forward with.  Mr.Speaker, in 2009 and 2010 when Democrats held a televised healthcare summit with Republican leaders, when the Senate HELP Committee marked up the Affordable Care Act over a full month and accepted 160 Republican amendments, and when the Senate Finance Committee held 31 meetings over 60 hours, even after that process, Republicans said that Democrats rammed the healthcare bill through Congress without reading it. Now the Republican majority is moving forward with their replacement plan without knowing what it costs and what it will mean for American families.  This level of hypocrisy and recklessness is insulting to the American people, and it is dangerous for the future of our healthcare system.  There is already plenty to dislike about what we know is in this bill. Who knows what we will find out when we uncover the rest.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1958.txt,2110,1330,2017.0,9.0,March

I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in support of this bill.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I surely want to make sure that we support our warfighters. My problem with the Defense bill is that we are spending so much money on things that I think are questionable. I would rather spend money on supporting our troops more than spending $1 trillion over the next 3 decades building more nuclear weapons. We have more nuclear weapons than any other country in the world, and we ought to be talking about limiting nuclear weapons and eliminating them altogether.  I want to support our men and women who we put in harm's way, but I want this Congress, I want Members of this House, to do their job. It doesn't take any courage to sit back and have troops deployed all over the world, in harm's way, and we don't even take the time to actually debate an authorization for the use of military force. We are too afraid to talk about those issues.  So when we talk about supporting our men and women in uniform, people ought to do a little bit of reflection on how we have not been doing our job.  Again, I note my friends don't want to talk about health care. My colleague actually said she would like to talk about health care more. Well, we should, because the fact of the matter is, as I said, as we are speaking here, the Republicans have unveiled this bill that has been in secret, that nobody has really had a chance to digest. No hearings. They want to talk about health care so much--no hearings, no expert testimony, no nothing. Right to markup; trying to rush it to the floor before we find out the true cost to the American people about what this TrumpCare bill is going to be all about; when they find out how many of them are going to lose their care; how it is going to cut Medicare; how senior citizens are going to see an increase in their healthcare costs; how average Americans are going to pay more for health care and get less protections; how people who are struggling in poverty are going to be out of luck because they are going to do away with the Medicaid guarantee to  Health care ought to be a fundamental right in this country, and they are taking that right away, and they are doing it in a fashion so that CBO, again, 200 employees at the Congressional Budget Office that Congress appropriates $50 million a year to support so they can do their expert work, they are doing this in a way so we are not even asking for their expert advice. What sense does that make?  This is the rule. This is where we set our priorities about what our legislative agenda ought to be; and all I am simply saying is vote ``no'' on the previous question so we can vote on an amendment so we can demand a CBO score in the healthcare bill.  By the way, that doesn't slow down the Defense Appropriations bill. It still goes forward. Nothing stops. So let's do what is right.

We don't want to know how much it is going to cost. We don't want to know how many people are going to be thrown off of health care. Let's just rush something through.

262,topic-id,1443,"Mr.President, yesterday, the Senate approved H.44, a joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act, CRA, that overturned the Bureau of Land Management's resource management planning rule, commonly referred to as the planning 2.0 rule. I oppose this misguided revocation of a rule that would have allowed greater public involvement in the land-use planning process, increased government transparency, and improved the efficiency in making sustainable multiple use decisions for our public lands.  The BLM is responsible for administering 245 million acres, or over 10 percent of the total area of the United States, and 700 million acres, or 30 percent, of the Nation's mineral estate. The majority of BLM lands are in the 11 western States and  Across the West, the economy has changed significantly in recent decades. From 1990 to 2010, the population in the West grew by 36 percent, and the economy of the West has grown faster than any other region in the country. As new people and new businesses have moved West, demands on public lands for outdoor recreation, hunting, fishing, tourism, conservation, and renewable energy development have been increasing. These demands have the potential to lead to conflicts with uses such as grazing, timber, mining, and oil and gas extraction.  The planning 2.0 rule represented a new approach to addressing increasingly complex challenges on public lands and balancing what are competing uses and, quite frankly, at times competing values for the use of our public lands. Planning 2.0 was the first update of the BLM's planning regulations in 34 years. It included tools to help local land managers respond to these new challenges and the changing needs of western communities.  Under the BLM's 1983 planning regulations, the BLM's planning process has been far too slow. State, local, and tribal governments and the public have been frustrated with the BLM's inability to complete resource management plans that support key infrastructure projects like pipelines, utility corridors, oil and gas leasing areas, and other management designations. It takes an average of 8 years to complete a resource management plan, and the public is provided few opportunities for input. By the time a plan is completed, it is almost already out of date. Since public involvement doesn't occur until nearly the end of the planning process, new information provided near the end can require revision and cause further delay. Litigation also can stall the process and add significantly more time and costs.  Nullifying planning 2.0 through CRA disapproval permanently forces the BLM to use a planning process that wastes taxpayer money and is inefficient at best.  Planning 2.0 provided earlier and more frequent opportunities for public involvement as part of the new planning assessment step. By inviting State, local, and tribal governments and the public to share information and participate in developing alternatives before the draft resource management plan could be published, planning 2.0 made it possible to discover the issues and potential conflicts and work out solutions before huge investments of time and labor were expended. Early involvement and collaboration with the public and all stakeholders made the planning process more efficient and effective.  Under planning 2.0, the formal planning process remained largely unchanged: a draft environmental impact statement and a draft plan were still required, but with an expanded public comment period, from 90 days to 100 days. Draft plan amendments are often less complex, and so the minimum comment period was reduced from 90 days to 60 days. The rule provided opportunities to extend any comment period as necessary.[[Page S1687]]  Planning 2.0 preserved and enhanced partnerships with State, local, and tribal governments in the planning process. The rule maintained the coordination and consistency requirements, and it recognized the special roles of State, local, and tribal governments, affording opportunities to participate side-by-side with the BLM as cooperating agencies. The final planning 2.0 rule took meaningful steps to accommodate requests from States and local governments to improve the planning process and to ensure governors were able to raise concerns and fully engage in the planning process, as required by the Federal Lands Policy and Management  As vice chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, I closely review Federal actions that affect native people and Indian Under planning 2.0, the right of federally recognized tribes to government-to-government consultation was clearly enumerated and protected. The BLM worked extensively to make sure the new planning process was more inclusive. Planning 2.0 recognized the value of the knowledge, history, and culture that tribes bring to the planning effort. By formalizing the tribal consultation role and providing early and more frequent opportunities for tribes to provide input, the BLM had taken an important step to ensure Indian Country was able to be fully engaged in the process. Repealing planning 2.0 through the CRA now risks ignoring the concerns of tribes in favor of commercial interests and their lobbyists in Washington,  Pressures on BLM lands have increased in scale and complexity, and planning 2.0 encouraged the collection and use of high-quality data. It encouraged flexibility to identify a planning area boundary that reflects the resource issues. By looking at larger landscapes, local offices could have collaborated where there are shared resource issues and could have reduced conflicts and litigation for large-scale projects. Planning 2.0 would have enabled the BLM to set clear goals and allowed local offices to work together on landscape-wide planning where resource issues span multiple administrative jurisdictions.  The rule identified important corridors for wildlife and critical habitats early in the planning process so that those important areas could be managed and conserved in balance with other uses and development decisions. Working across boundaries is especially important to tackle wildfire prevention and eradication of invasive species, which are degrading our public lands and placing neighboring private lands at risk of harm. Efficient and collaborative planning is desperately needed to approve infrastructure projects, pipelines, and energy transmission corridors that are stalled under the current planning process. Eliminating planning 2.0 reinstates a cumbersome and inefficient planning process that increases burdens on industries and the public.  Opponents of the planning 2.0 rule mischaracterized the rule as a last minute ``midnight rule'' that excluded public comment. This is simply not true. The planning 2.0 initiative went through a transparent rulemaking process over 2 and a half years. The BLM responded to over 3,000 public comments on the draft rule and made critical changes in the final rule. Congress held two hearings on planning 2.0, and the BLM incorporated that information before publishing the final rule. The BLM conducted extensive public outreach through public meetings, webinars, an extended public comment period, and input from a broad spectrum of the public that resulted in significant revisions to the final rule.  However, the CRA resolution disapproving planning 2.0 was accomplished without public hearings and without transparency. Management of our public lands will now revert back to a process that gives commercial interest greater power and the public less opportunity for meaningful involvement.  Opponents of planning 2.0 expressed concern that emphasizing landscape-scale planning could result in the primacy of national objectives over State and local objectives. This is not true. Planning 2.0 did not centralize decisionmaking in Washington, DC, or dilute local control of the planning process. The rule actually allowed for more local community involvement and preserved the priority status for local governments and states in land use planning. Increasing the opportunity for public voices helped develop plans that met the increasingly diverse needs of western communities. Further, the rule did not require all resource management plans to be multistate landscapes. The rule provided the process for planning at larger landscape-scales when it made sense given the resources involved.  The use of the Congressional Review Act to revoke planning 2.0 is a reckless tactic. Specific concerns could and should have been addressed through the regular rulemaking process or targeted legislation by Congress instead. Under the CRA, once Congress passes a resolution of disapproval, the BLM is prohibited from writing a new rule that is ``substantially the same'' without additional legislative action. As a result, many of the provisions of planning 2.0 that improved the planning process cannot be enacted or proposed again without express congressional approval.  Secretary Zinke has now been confirmed and should have been given the opportunity to consider revising planning 2.0 and making any necessary changes. With passage of H.44, Secretary Zinke will face considerable legal uncertainty, and his authority to reformulate a new planning rule will be limited substantially. This resolution should have been rejected and the new administration given the opportunity to reformulate planning 2.0 and to make sure the public continued to have a voice in decisions that affect their way of life.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgS1686-3.txt,1567,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,8.0,March

Because it is a product of bipartisan negotiation, this is a good bill, and I intend to support it.  Despite my support for this legislation, I am extremely troubled that we are still working on the fiscal year 2017 Defense bill 5 months and 8 days into the fiscal year.  For nearly 6 months, the Department of Defense has been operating under two separate continuing resolutions, which wastes the time of people's lives and leads to inefficiencies in spending. I would emphasize this is not the fault of the committee. All that has been absent is the lack of political will on behalf of the majority party.  Even more disconcerting is the fact that the Defense Appropriations Act is just one of 11 fiscal year 2017 appropriations bills that need to be completed by the end of next month. There is no excuse for them remaining unfinished. The investments made through these bills are vital to so many in our country, and they need equal attention from Congress and the administration.  It is imperative that we strive every day to prioritize keeping America safe and supporting our brave servicemembers, but we must also prioritize educating our workforce, making improvements in public health, in science, and in our economic and transportation infrastructure.  If we neglect these investments in our future and in the well-being and success of current families and future generations, then I am deeply concerned that we will not have a country worth defending.  Confounding a confused fiscal situation, there is a $30 billion supplemental request for fiscal year 2017 recently submitted to the Office of Management and Budget by the Department of Defense, which should make its way to Congress in the next few weeks. Additionally, as the administration modifies its fiscal year 2018 budget request, they are without a predictable base on which to build.  There is very little margin of error, given the few legislative days remaining before the continuing resolution expires on April 28. I, and I believe the chairman, do not view that date as another point for negotiation.

251,topic-id,1308,"Mr.President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to reject this resolution to roll back accountability for the billions of dollars that are sent to States to help educate children.  When Congress updated the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 2015, it was a bipartisan achievement. Republicans and Democrats came together on the 50th anniversary of that landmark civil rights law to rewrite it into what became the Every Student Succeeds  When President Obama signed this K-12 legislation into law in December of that year, he called it a ``Christmas miracle.'' It received 85 votes in the It was one of the most important pieces of bipartisan legislation passed in the last  It wasn't the bill I would have written, but it was a bipartisan compromise. It gave States and districts far more flexibility when it comes to improving their struggling public schools. At the same time, it also maintained critical civil rights and accountability protections to ensure that when the Federal Government gives States billions of dollars to improve the education of their students, that money goes to the schools and students that need those Federal resources the most. It was a critical step toward making sure we are building a future not just for some of our kids but for all of our kids.  When Congress passes big, complex laws like the Every Student Succeeds Act, it always leaves some of the implementation details to the agency that has to enforce the law. That is why I fought hard to make sure the Department of Education had the tools it needs to write clarifying rules and guidelines to enforce the Every Student Succeeds That was a condition of my vote and the votes of lots of other people. We won that fight. The authority to enforce the rules is right there in the law. It was debated in public, and it was part of the bipartisan agreement between Republicans and  Last November, the Department of Education--after careful consultation with teachers, school leaders, State education leaders, and parents--issued new rules to enforce this law. Today, congressional Republicans are trying to take a sledgehammer to these new rules.  When these new rules were issued, everyone who works in education agreed that they were critical and necessary. Teachers were fine with the new rules. State education leaders were fine with the new rules. Civil rights leaders were fine with the new rules. Everyone was ready to get to work. Apparently, congressional Republicans do not care. Instead, they want to blow up these critically important accountability rules even though the people who work in or around public education did not ask them to do so. This makes no sense.  Groups that often disagree with each other over public education policies are united in their belief that this resolution is a dumb idea. It is opposed by teachers; civil rights organizations, such as the NAACP and the National Council of La Raza; and organizations representing students with disabilities, such as the National Center for Learning It is even opposed by the U.Chamber of Commerce because they know this resolution will only make it more difficult for States as they try to implement the new education law. And this resolution will undermine the work States are currently doing right now to improve their public schools with the new law.  Last week, many of these groups signed on to a letter that states: ``This action will cause unnecessary confusion, disrupting the work in states and wasting time that we cannot afford to waste.''  In fact, even conservative education policy experts at the Fordham Institute--a right-leaning educational policy think tank--argue that congressional Republicans should not swing a wrecking ball to these guidelines.[[Page S1682]]  They identified over 20 provisions in these rules that actually provide more flexibility to States by clarifying ambiguous sections in the law, and they concluded: ``Senate Republicans, then, should scrap their plan to use the Congressional Review Act to kill all of the accountability regulations outright.''  Killing these new rules now would lead to chaos and confusion just when States, districts, and school leaders are beginning to implement this new K-12 education law. States have already spent months drafting their plans for complying. Eighteen States, including Massachusetts, intended to submit their implementation plans to the Department of Education next month. If this resolution passes, all of that work will be thrown into limbo.  These clarifying rules include important provisions that allow States to send additional Federal resources to struggling schools, whether or not those schools already receive Federal dollars; provisions that give States more flexibility in educating their English learners in the manner that best meets the needs of each individual student; provisions that ensure that parents have more information about how their child's public school is doing and sets clear guidelines with what States and districts must disclose to parents and when they must disclose it; and provisions that promote transparency by preventing States from manipulating their graduation rates or data on how much money they are investing in each student. These regulations were carefully crafted over the course of 1 year of input from teachers, school system leaders, and student advocates. Both Republicans and Democrats should support these provisions.  I think we all know what is going on here. Betsy DeVos is the new Secretary of Congressional Republicans have decided they want to hand over the keys to her with no restrictions whatsoever. The resolutions we are debating today would give Secretary DeVos more freedom to push States in whatever direction she felt like. If you are a teacher in Tennessee or a principal in Massachusetts, you should be furious about that. Congress is about to scrap a year of hard work and a year of careful compromise in order to give Secretary DeVos a blank check.  It is a blank check for Betsy This is the same Secretary of Education who has never attended a public school, never taught in a public school, and never led a public school. This is the same Secretary of Education who proved to the world, during her confirmation hearing, that she doesn't have a clue about public schools. This is the same Secretary of Education who still holds shady investments that could be hiding conflicts of interest. This is the same Secretary of Education who has used her vast fortune to advance her extreme privatization agenda. This is the same Secretary of Education whom Jeff Sessions and the Vice President of the United States had to drag across the finish line in an unprecedented tie-breaking confirmation vote. She is the one to whom Senate Republicans want to give a blank check to figure out where she wants to drive public education--a blank check to push her radical privatization agenda.  States and school districts are planning for the next school year right now. They are figuring out how to implement this law and improve the education of kids as I speak. They are doing hero's work every day while Congress wastes time and creates more confusion.  Handing this law over to an Education Secretary with no experience in public education without any accountability rules to guide its implementation is an insult. It is an insult to teachers, an insult to school leaders, and an insult to families everywhere.  This is not a game. Congress should not be playing politics with the education of our children. Instead of disrupting the important work that States and districts are doing to educate our kids, Congress should get out of the way and let States finish what they have already started. Let them get to work. That is why I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

296,topic-id,1398,"Mr.President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote against the confirmation of Seema Verma to serve as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  CMS oversees the administration of the Medicare and Medicaid These programs provide healthcare coverage to grandparents, people with disabilities, foster kids, seniors living in nursing homes, single mothers, and babies. CMS is also in charge of implementing many parts of the Affordable Care Act and making sure that the protections guaranteed in the law are enforced.[[Page S1698]]  In other words, CMS is the part of government that we entrust with carrying out the commitments we have made to protect our health and our access to healthcare. We need someone to run these programs who is a champion for Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act and someone who can stand up to Republicans in Congress and stand up to the Trump administration when they try to burn these promises and turn their backs on the people who need help.  On Monday night, the Republicans finally revealed their latest plan to rip health insurance away from millions of After years of railing about how the ACA was too long and too complicated, the Republicans spent weeks working on a secret plan--locked in a room, hidden somewhere in the United States They didn't want anyone to see it. Here is a news flash: If you have to hide your plans from the American public, that is a pretty good sign that you are headed in the wrong direction.  Now we know why they were so afraid to let anyone else take a look at the plan. The plan is ugly--really, really, ugly. The Republicans' plan would rip health insurance away from millions of  Right off the top, the bill will end the Medicaid expansion established in the Right now, 11 million adults are covered by that expansion, and the Republican plan will end it. That is right--end it. Millions more Americans are using ACA subsidies to buy their health insurance. For the families who need it most, those subsidies will be cut. For seniors, prices will rise, and that means millions more people will not be able to afford health insurance.  The Republican bill promises tax credits to help people pay for their insurance, but this is an empty promise because the tax credits are designed to be too small to actually cover the costs of paying for healthcare. If you have a 2-month break in your health insurance coverage, no matter the reason, the Republican bill would let insurance companies charge you a 30-percent penalty on top of your premium for an entire year. That is right. If you lose your job and scramble to find a new plan, you have exactly 62 days to lock down that plan because 1 day longer than that, and you are slapped with a 30-percent penalty.  By the way, it is not a penalty paid to the government to help finance healthcare. It is a penalty paid to a $1 billion insurance company. Republicans should be ashamed of themselves.  Too bad if being able to buy affordable coverage on the ACA exchange has given you access to health insurance while you start your small business. Too bad if your healthcare has given you free cancer screening. Too bad if your healthcare has given you access to treatment for substance abuse disorder. All that is gone under the Republican plan.  So there it is--the Republicans' plan to take away health insurance for millions and millions of The Republican plan is cruel, and it gets worse.  The Republican healthcare plan gets worse because it also delivers a gut punch to the rest of the Medicaid Program--the part that predates the ACA by decades. It does so by putting a cap on overall funding that States can receive and then strictly limiting the growth in that cap. This growth rate is deliberately set lower than the actual growth rate in medical costs for Medicaid beneficiaries. Why? So Republicans can cut the Federal Government's commitment to Medicaid without using the word ``cut.''  I don't know if they think we are just too dumb to notice, but they are cutting Of course, people will still get sick and will still need medical care, so what the Republicans are doing is shifting hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid costs to State governments, which will struggle to pick up the tab, or shifting those costs to hospitals and doctors, who will not get paid, or shifting it to the families themselves, who will try to manage those bills.  Understand what that means. Right now, if you qualify for Medicaid coverage, you get Medicaid coverage. That has been the law for decades, but the Republicans want to change that. With the cap, if you qualify for Medicaid coverage, you will get something. Nobody is really sure what. All we know is that it will not cover your expected costs of care. Think about the impact of that.  The reckless Republican plan will blow huge holes in State budgets. The Republican plan will blow huge holes in rural hospitals' budgets and in the budgets of opioid treatment centers and community health centers all across this country.  Massachusetts is using some of its Medicaid funding right now to fight the opioid crisis, but the Republican plan makes it harder to wage that fight in Massachusetts and in every other State that is battling this terrible epidemic.  The Republican plan will leave millions of people who have decent Medicaid coverage holding the bag when they get sick. That is not healthcare; that is a con job.  But it gets even worse. The bill cuts funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides maternity care and birth control. It gives insurance companies the green light to jack up costs for people over 50, blowing up the limits that were established in the ACA to make sure seniors could afford healthcare.  But there is one more very, very ugly reason the Republicans should be ashamed, and that is because while they are gutting Medicaid, slashing health coverage for sick Americans, and slapping penalties on people who lose insurance through no fault of their own, Republicans are also handing out hundreds of millions of dollars in tax cuts to rich people and giving a special gift to insurance company  The Republican plan repeals two Medicare taxes that apply only to high-income taxpayers. Who benefits most from this repeal? They get a full 80-percent of the tax cut. It is a benefit that is worth an average of $50,000 each. That is right. The tax cut that millionaires will get from the Republican plan to rip up healthcare is more than many families make in a year.  The Republican plan also hurts Medicare by taking money away from the Medicare trust fund, where it really belongs.  Right now, the law says insurance companies can deduct only $500,000 in executive compensation, but the Republicans think that is too hard on insurance companies and their So sad. So they have lifted the cap to a full $1 million. The Republicans are determined to help boost the pay of insurance company No wonder the Republicans didn't want to let anyone see this plan.  This is literally a backroom deal to strip away lifesaving healthcare from babies, to drive the costs out of sight for seniors, to deny help for people with disabilities, and to make insurance more expensive for hard-working entrepreneurs. In exchange, insurance company CEOs and millionaires get giant tax deductions. Less health insurance for people who need it; more tax cuts for wealthy insurance company This is the deal it took Republicans years to come up with? They should be ashamed.  I have received letters and emails and calls from families in Massachusetts who depend on Medicaid and the These families are shouting as loudly as they can about how important Medicaid and the ACA are to them. We need someone running the CMS who is listening and someone who has their backs, who will tell Republican politicians that their secret deals are terrible, who will tell them that their plans to take away coverage will hurt people, who will tell them that their recklessness will blow up State budgets.  Seema Verma has a deep knowledge of the Medicaid Program, having worked at the State level to design and implement Medicaid waivers.

974,topic-id,1626,"Mr.President, before I get into my ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, let me say I appreciate the concern of the Senator from Texas that the Affordable Care Act leaves too many Americans uninsured. I am not sure the solution to that problem is to throw another 24 million people off of their insurance. I appreciate his concern that premiums for many are too high. I am not sure the solution is to dramatically increase premiums on the elderly. I appreciate his concern that Medicaid can be managed by the States--and I think I used his words correctly--along with the money to[[Page S1796]]pay for it. But when the bill has $800 billion in Medicaid savings but will not cure or prevent a single illness, you are not reducing those $800 billion in savings; you are just moving it to the You are just putting that burden on the Ask Arizona how that worked when they tried to do Medicaid as they dealt with the mortgage meltdown.  The American people do perhaps demand better than ObamaCare, but the solution to offer them something that is far, far worse does not seem very sensible. I believe we are willing to work together. Indeed, in the HELP Committee our chairman has already said that as soon as we start talking about repair, we can get to work. But the notion that there is an invitation out to us to work in a bipartisan fashion when the majority party is jamming this bill through without negotiation, using reconciliation as an extraordinary process to try to put it through under arcane budget rules that were never designed for this--that is not exactly much of a signal. So as soon as we get to regular order and 60 votes, I think we will be able to actually work and serve our constituents very well.                             Climate Change  Mr.President, I am here today for my 160th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, this one focused on the security consequences of our failure to deal with carbon emissions and climate change.  My remarks at the Munich Security Conference this year pointed out that climate change presents several orders of security risk to society. The first order of security risk is just physical damage, damage that science and our senses are already perceiving and measuring in our atmosphere, our oceans, and our environment.  This security risk, risks to the Earth's present national state, will hurt farming communities, coastal communities, fishing communities, and of course anyone vulnerable to wildfires, droughts, and extreme weather. Of course, the poorer you are in this world, the more vulnerable you are to this peril.  The second order of security risk from climate change is the consequences in human society from that physical, biological, and chemical damage in our environment. As farms and fisheries fail, people are impoverished and dislocated. Scarce resources lead to conflicts and confrontations. Storms and fires can make suffering acute, and people who are hungry or dislocated or torn from their roots can become desperate, radicalized, and violent. That is why the U.Department of Defense has for years called climate change a catalyst of conflict.  Drought in Syria, for instance, has been described as a root cause of the conflict there, a conflict that has killed more than 400,000 people, according to some estimates, and displaced more than 11 million. Researchers from NASA and the University of Arizona have determined that drought was very likely the worst in a millennium. Massive crop failures and livestock losses moved farmers into stressed cities, where popular protests met with brutal violence from the Assad regime and the tide of refugees from that chaos swamped  Nigeria, Sudan, and Central America are other areas where violence and flight are driven by scarce resources. So the second order of national security risk is the societal damage that cascades from the natural damage caused by climate change.  The third order of security risk is perhaps the most dangerous for our country; that is, reputational damage to the keystone institutions of our present world order: market capitalism and democratic government. People around the world who have been harmed by the first-order environmental effects of climate change, or people around the world who get swept up in the second-order societal effects of climate change will want answers, as will many who are witness to the global suffering and harm caused by climate change.  When that reckoning comes, as it will, the discredit to institutions like capitalism and democracy which failed to act, even when loudly and clearly warned, could be profound. This failure of action by these institutions is compounded by the moral failure. Fossil fuel companies are knowingly causing this harm. They are aggressively fighting solutions to this problem. Their weapons are as disreputable as their conduct: professionally administered misinformation--climate denial, after all, is the original fake news--and massive, massive floods of political money.  As a result, the Congress has shown itself utterly unable to resist the threats and blandishments of this industry, despite the fact that we know very clearly of the industry's enormous conflict of interest. This all stands to be a lasting blot on both democracy and capitalism, a blot that will worsen as the consequences of our climate failure worsen. If you believe, as Daniel Webster did, in the power of America's example, that we are, indeed, a city on a hill, then you should worry about this terrible example of greed, ignorance, and corruption triumphant.  It is not like we have not been warned. The National Intelligence Council has estimated that worldwide demand for food, water, and energy will grow by approximately 35, 40, and 50 percent respectively in coming decades. This increased resource demand is on a collision course with those first-order harms--disrupting fisheries and agriculture around the globe.  The U.Institute for Peace has warned that ``poor responses to climatic shifts create shortages of resources such as land and water. Shortages are followed by negative secondary impacts, such as more sickness, hunger and joblessness. Poor responses to these, in turn, open the door to conflict.''  For those who discount this as a bunch of peaceniks' prattle, let me add that in 2013, our National Intelligence Council put climate change alongside events like nuclear war and a severe pandemic among the eight events with the greatest potential for global disruption--noting for climate change that ``dramatic and unforeseen changes are occurring at a faster rate than expected.'' The Department of Defense 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review described climate change as a ``global threat multiplier.'' That report warned that ``the pressures caused by climate change will influence resource competition while placing additional burdens on economies, societies, and governance institutions around the world.''  As head of U.Pacific Command, ADM Samuel Locklear warned in 2013 that climate change was the biggest long-term security threat in his area of operation, noting the need to organize the military for ``when the effects of climate change start to impact these massive populations.''  Again, I will quote him. ``If it goes bad,'' he said, ``you could have hundreds of thousands or millions of people displaced and then security will start to crumble pretty quickly.''  Operation Free, a coalition of national security and veterans organizations, has continually pointed out the national security threat posed by climate change, as has the American Security Project, comprised of retired military flag officers. The Government Accountability Office, GAO, has warned that climate change is affecting defense infrastructure around the world, from sea level rise at Naval Station Norfolk to heavy rain and flooding at Fort Irwin, CA, to thawing permafrost affecting Air Force radar installations in Alaska, to faraway effects, even at Diego Garcia in the Indian  The Coast Guard, of course, must meet entirely new demands of the icecap's melt in the Arctic for transportation and shipping, for new fishing grounds, for resource exploration, and of course the possibility there of conflict. In 2005, when Defense Secretary Mattis led Marine Corps Combat Development Command, he called on Navy researchers to find ways to make the military more energy efficient, to ``unleash''--to use his words--U.military forces from the ``tether [of] fuel.''  Ask Senator Tammy Duckworth about the casualties sustained among her comrades in arms defending fuel supply lines if you want to see a passionate conversation. The military funds research into alternative energy and studies how climate change affects military capability because in the real world, where real lives are at risk, they can't afford to believe the false facts peddled by the fossil fuel industry.  The people we entrust to keep us safe, who have to deal with real threats in the real world, recognize the danger[[Page S1797]]climate change represents. The National Intelligence Council said in January that ``issues like . . . climate change invoke high stakes and will require sustained collaboration.'' Instead of that, we get a Congress and an administration that has deliberately let the fossil fuel industry occupy and sabotage the orderly operation of the Government of the United States to deal with this problem.  So I am going to start to push back. When these tools of the fossil fuel industry, to whom we in the Senate gave advice and consent, go too egregiously about their dirty business of climate denial, expect that I may come to the floor and object to consent requests.  Last week, Administrator Pruitt said carbon dioxide does not cause climate change. That is nonsense. That is somewhere between ignorant and fraudulent. He gets that one lie for free but no more--not next time with the stakes this high.

Some $300 billion was slashed from safety net health programs, while insurance company executives making over $500,000 annually were given a juicy tax break as a bonus.  To put this into perspective, this tax break that the insurance companies' CEOs seem to have after two committees in the other body have acted on TrumpCare--the amount of the bonuses for the insurance company executives would be enough to cover the TrumpCare-created shortfall in Oregon's community-based services for the elderly and the disabled two or three times over.  What we are talking about is how hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks are going to the fortunate few and special interests, while some of the money is coming from stealing a chunk of those dollars from the Medicare trust fund. And this is very much intertwined with the nominee's work because she would be overseeing Medicare payments to rural hospitals in places like Louisiana and  What I am going to turn to now is what TrumpCare, based on these two committees, means for rural areas. And, of course, it repeals the Medicaid expansion. It caps the Medicaid In my own view, and I know the Senator from Louisiana knows a lot about healthcare, in rural communities--and most of our towns are under 10,000 in population. I am from southeast I love southeast The only regret is I didn't get to play for the Portland Trail Most of the communities in our State are under 10,000 in population. As the Senator from Louisiana knows, we are talking about critical access facilities. We are talking about sole community hospitals. We are talking about the facilities that deal with acute care.  During the last major break over the President's holiday, I started what is going to be a yearlong effort for me, and I called it the rural healthcare listening tour. It is eye-popping to have those rural healthcare providers who in my State have worked so hard to find ways to get beyond turf and battles, to work together--the hospitals, the doctors, the community health centers, and the like. They have built an extraordinary effort that helps to wring more value out of scarce dollars. Their programs are based on quality, not on volume.  By the way, they are a huge source of economic growth and jobs for our rural communities. I spent the President's Day recess, and the next major recess as well getting out and listening to them. The verdict from Oregon's healthcare providers, who have worked very hard at being innovative, trying to make better use of what are called nontraditional services, said these kinds of cuts are not an option if you want to meet the needs of so many who have signed up as a result of the Medicaid expansion.  TrumpCare ends the Medicaid expansion, rolling back Federal matching funds in 2020. The rural hospitals in my State are frequently the only healthcare provider available for hundreds of miles. The Medicaid expansion helped these hospitals keep their doors open.  I don't think it is hard to calculate why the hospitals are speaking out against the flood approach of They have a lot of facilities in rural areas that are already on tight margins. If these communities lose the ability to cover needy people, some of the essential hospitals--and I just described three types of them--are going to have to close, and the reality is going to be that patients aren't going to have any doctor anywhere nearby.  Understand, if the majority insists on ramrodding TrumpCare through--and at this point we have, I believe--staff just told me that there aren't any budget estimates. As of now, the Congressional Budget Office is tasked with providing accurate assessments of the budget implications. There are not any budget implications.  So here is the latest. It comes from media that I think is not considered by many Trump supporters to be a purveyor of fake news. This comes from FOX They said: Unknown in the new healthcare plan, unknown in TrumpCare--the cost. How many lose or gain insurance?  I am very pleased that my colleague from New Hampshire has come to join me because some of this, I would say to my friend from New Hampshire, leaves you incredulous because this comes from FOX FOX News is hardly a source for what many Trump supporters would consider fake news. FOX News is asking the question because they are saying it is unknown. It is unknown in the new healthcare plan, Senator Shaheen, according to FOX The cost is unknown, and how many lose or gain insurance is unknown.  I would say to my colleagues, because my friend from Louisiana has joined the Finance Committee, and I remember welcoming him and Senator McCaskill, our new members. My colleague from Louisiana is a physician and is very knowledgeable about these issues. I don't know how you have a real healthcare debate in America--and I have been working on this since I was director of the Gray Panthers at home back in the days when I had a full head of hair and rugged good looks. When we would start a debate, nobody would consider starting it without having an idea of costs or how many lose or gain insurance. How much more basic, I say to Senator Shaheen, does it get than that? Are these ``gotcha'' questions? Are these alternative facts? Are these people who are hostile to conservatives? I think not. FOX News--unknown in the new healthcare plan.  I have been outlining what this means in terms of the transfer of wealth from working families in New Hampshire and Oregon to the most fortunate in our country--people who make $250,000 or more. They are actually going to be the only people in America who get their Medicare tax cut. So you have this enormous transfer of wealth, what I call the reverse Robin Hood: taking from the working people and giving to the fortunate few.  After two committees have now acted in the other body--two committees have acted--FOX News says the big questions are outstanding. The Senator from New Hampshire knows a lot about rural healthcare. I was just outlining to my colleagues what this means for critical access hospitals, sole community hospitals, acute care facilities. These are the centerpieces of many rural communities, the essence of rural life. You can't have rural life without rural healthcare.  Here we are on Thursday afternoon--with many of our colleagues out there tackling jet exhaust fumes heading home--and the big questions, according to FOX News, are outstanding.

668,topic-id,348,"I thank her for her presentation. It was factual and very specific, and I think it really highlighted so many of the concerns that we have at this point.  I want to see if I could get this straight on the opioid issue. Here you all are in New Hampshire, right in the center of the Presidential campaign. All of the candidates are coming through, and they are practically trying to outdo each other in terms of their pledges to deal with this wrecking ball that is the opioid addiction that has swept through New Hampshire[[Page S1729]]and, of course, my own home State as well.  I remember then-Candidate Trump being particularly strong and assertive about how he was going to fight opioids.  I think what my colleague said--and I am curious, so I am going to ask a couple of questions because I don't think folks even in my home State are aware of some of these things. So I am going to ask my colleague about it.  Are folks in New Hampshire aware at this point--my colleague put up that Trump chart, showing how the people didn't know what was being cut and how much it was going to cost and all the rest. Are people in New Hampshire at this point aware of the fact that this is essentially after a campaign in their home State, which certainly put out a lot of TV commercials and campaign rhetoric in the fight on opioids?  I think my colleague said that when people unpack this, they are going to see that this is a major broken promise, that TrumpCare is a major broken promise on opioids because, in terms of the time sequence, they all had debates and commercials, then we finally got some money in order to have treatment.  And I think what my colleague said is that now, as a result of TrumpCare and the cap on Medicaid, there will not be the funds to get the treatment to people who are so needy. Is that what this is going to be about in New Hampshire?  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgS1714.txt,1247,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017",2017.0,9.0,March
670,topic-id,458,"I think my colleague's point is well taken.  As we have been saying, this is very much intertwined with the Seema Verma nomination because what we learned in the committee is, in Indiana, where she touts her pioneering work, if somebody had an inability to pay for a short period of time, they would be locked out of the program. So in terms of Medicaid, this is going to cause a real hardship.  I had already outlined that it is going to cause a hardship in another program that is important to New Hampshire, and that is Medicare, because we are implementing what is called the MACRA, the new reimbursement system for doctors. We asked her questions about rural care, and she didn't know the answer either.  I particularly wanted my colleague to walk us through this situation with respect to how New Hampshire residents are going to see TrumpCare as it relates to opioid addiction after they have all these grandiose promises and the many debates and commercials.  I thought I would ask if my colleague has time for one other question.  In New Hampshire, as in Oregon, we have a lot of seniors. It looks to me as if somebody who is, say, 58 years old or 62 years old is just going to get hammered by what we call the age tax because in these bills, which are now moving like a freight train with the House already moving in two committees, Republicans want to give insurance companies a green light to charge older people five times as much as they charge younger people. So I cited a number of my small, rural counties--Grant County, Union County, Lake County--and how a 60-year-old who makes $30,000 a year can see their insurance costs, because of the age tax, go up something like $8,000 a year.  I don't have the numbers as of now--Finance staff is still working on that for every single State--but obviously that tax sure looks like it is going to hit somebody in New Hampshire, an older person, people before they are eligible for Medicare, and particularly in that 55-to-65 bracket. It looks like it is going to hit them very hard. How is that going to be received, because in my time in New Hampshire, we talked about it, and a lot of those people really are walking on economic tightropes. They are balancing their food bill against their fuel bill and their fuel bill against their rent bill. I know my colleague spends a lot of time trying to advocate for them, help them through small business approaches. How are they going to be able to absorb what is clearly going to be thousands of dollars in new out-of-pocket health costs?

674,topic-id,765,"I thank my colleague, and we are going to prosecute this cause together.  I see that the chairman of the Finance Committee has arrived. He graciously said I could take another 5 minutes or so of our time.  Before we wrap up this part of our presentation, I want to point out that we have outlined how people who are dealing with the consequences of opioid addiction would be hurt by We have outlined how seniors who are not yet eligible for Medicare are going to be hurt and how seniors who are now on Medicare are going to certainly be hurt by reducing access to nursing home benefits. Now I would like to wrap up by going to the other end of the age spectrum and talk for a moment about children.  Nearly half of Medicaid recipients are kids, and the program of the Republicans--now that we have two committees in effect out of chute with their proposals--restructures the program in the most arbitrary way, using these caps, shifting costs to And the reality is that Medicaid is a major source of help for children. There is early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment benefits. But with reduced funding, the States are going to be forced to make difficult decisions about which benefits they can keep providing. States are going to be forced to reduce payments to providers, particularly for kids, providers such as pediatric specialists, and limit access to lifesaving specialty care.  My own sense is that this is shortsighted at best, and it is like throwing the evidence about children and their health needs in the trash can. Children receiving Medicaid benefits are more likely to perform better in school, miss fewer days of school, and pursue higher education.  Before I yield the floor to my good friend and colleague Chairman Hatch, I want to come back to what disturbs me the most about all of this. All of these dramatic changes to Medicare and Medicaid that strip seniors and some of our most vulnerable citizens are being made at the cost of hundreds of billions of dollars to these programs while, in effect, there is an enormous transfer of wealth given to the most fortunate in America in the two bills that were passed by the other body today in the committee. In effect, for example, people who make over $250,000 will not have to make the additional payments under the Medicare tax. If ever there were a group of people in America who doesn't need additional tax relief, it is those people.  As we wrap up this portion of the presentation, I want people to just think about looking at their paycheck. Every time you get a paycheck in America, there is a line for Medicare tax. Everybody pays it. It is particularly important right now because 10,000 people will be turning 65 every day for years and years to come.  What the tax provisions of this legislation mean--and they are part of hundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts--for insurance executives making over $500,000 annually, there are yet additional juicy writeoffs, while seniors and those of modest means are going to bear the brunt of those reductions. Nothing illustrates it more than cutting the Medicare tax, colleagues.  I don't know how anyone can go home in any part of the country and say: You know, we are going to have to charge older people between 50 and 65 a lot more for their coverage, and by the way, insurance company executives making $500,000 a year are going to get more tax relief. I don't think it passes the smell test in It is reverse Robin There is no other way to describe it. It is transferring wealth from working families and those who are the most vulnerable. When working Americans see their paycheck and see the Medicare tax, I hope they remember that in this bill, the Medicare tax is reduced for only one group of people--people making more than $250,000 a year.  I want tax reform. The chairman of the Finance Committee knows that. I have introduced proposals to do that. But I don't know how we get tax reform when they are giving the relief to the people at the top of the economic ladder and it is coming out of the pockets of working people and working families. Everybody is going to be able to see it right on their paycheck, right there with the Medicare tax.

977,topic-id,1497,"Mr.President, the Senate has been digging into the legal quagmire of drug testing the unemployed. I would like to begin by saying that no matter where a Senator comes down on the issue of drug testing, my view is that this measure before us is simply bizarre.  If, like me, you believe that drug testing is ineffective and mean-spirited, you ought to oppose this measure because it simply vilifies unemployed workers who are actually less likely to use drugs than the general population.  For those Senators who support drug testing, this measure blows up what has been a bipartisan compromise and a Labor Department rule allowing select testing to go forward. The result of this measure passing would actually be to block testing from going forward.  The fact is that the courts have ruled that suspicionless drug testing violates the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. That is why there is now actually a rule that is narrow.  We have the courts expressing skepticism about this, and there is actually a rule that is narrow so that, in effect, States that are doing this drug testing have what amounts to guardrails to avoid running afoul of the If you pass this measure, you will throw out the guardrails, opening up, in my view, the possibility of yet more litigation on Fourth Amendment grounds.  Now, as I touched on in my opening comments, there isn't evidence that unemployment insurance recipients use drugs any more frequently than the general population. In fact, studies actually indicate that they are less likely to use illegal drugs than the general population. So this idea that somehow there is a presumption of irresponsible conduct and guilt is just baseless.  To be eligible for unemployment insurance, workers have to have substantial recent work experience. They have to be unemployed through no fault of their own. Workers can only collect unemployment benefits if they are actively searching for work and available to work.  For States that have implemented drug testing policies, there is evidence that the costs dwarf the potential savings. The costs of operating drug testing programs are charged to State health and human services accounts, and I think we all understand that those have been squeezed mightily by the effort to treat opioid addiction. In my view, instead of wasting money by drug testing Americans who are looking for jobs, the States ought to be putting those very same dollars toward[[Page S1798]]substance abuse treatment, given the fact that opioid addiction has hit our country like a wrecking ball.  Moreover, we have said that fighting opioid addiction ought to be a bipartisan cause. If Republicans wanted to do everything possible to fight addiction, they shouldn't be going forward with TrumpCare, a bill that would be a disastrous setback when it comes to fighting opioid addiction. The fact is that colleagues on the other side of the aisle here in the Senate--colleagues not from my side but colleagues from the other side--have expressed their concern about what TrumpCare means for the fight against opioid addiction.  The hard numbers are actually out now on TrumpCare, and they show that the majority is going into overdrive to pass a bill that strips millions of Americans of their access to treatment for substance abuse. Today Medicaid is strengthening our mental health network, expanding access to substance use disorder treatment, and is at the forefront of some promising new work to fight opioid addiction. So TrumpCare hits the cause of treating opioid addiction in a devastating way. It slashes the healthcare safety net, and, in my view, it would inflame the epidemic of drug abuse deaths across the country.  At the same time, there is this partisan effort to slash funding for addiction treatment. Republicans have dredged up an old head-scratcher of an argument that drug testing Americans and denying them earned benefits somehow just magically helps to overcome addiction. This is an important point.  Just like Social Security, unemployment insurance is an earned benefit. It is an earned benefit that ought to be there for workers who fall on hard times.  So what the majority is pushing for in this debate looks to me like light years away from what was discussed last year when there was discussion before the election about helping Americans in every part of the Nation who are struggling with opioid addiction.  You have to ask this question: What earned benefits are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle going to crusade against next? Is the drug testing crusade going to turn next to Social Security and Medicare recipients as an excuse to deny seniors benefits that they have earned--earned benefits that they worked hard for through a lifetime of work?  I am going to wrap up by way of saying that, if this measure passes, I think States are just going to be thrown into bedlam. The current law, based on a compromise--a bipartisan compromise reached in 2012--says States can drug test recipients of unemployed benefits in two cases: first, if the unemployment insurance recipient lost their job for drug-related reasons and, second, if the unemployment insurance recipient is applying for a type of occupation that requires drug testing, as defined by the rules of the Department of  Let's say, for example, that two unemployment benefits recipients are specifically applying for jobs as schoolbus drivers or air traffic controllers. The rule that is on the books now says that States can drug test those individuals because they are applying for work in occupations that require drug testing.  Now, as far as I can tell, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to eliminate the rule that defined those occupations. States would be blocked from performing any occupation-based drug testing for unemployment recipients, and the States would just be walking into a legal minefield if they wanted to go ahead with testing programs anyway.  Make no mistake about it. When this passes--if it does--drug testing policies go on hold until the Congress passes a new law, rather than our continuing a carefully put together bipartisan compromise of just a couple of years ago.  I have been trying to see this from my colleagues' perspective. I have listened to the arguments from the other side. I just find this a baffling, bizarre kind of analysis. All this measure does is create a huge amount of new uncertainty. That doesn't strike me as a good way to reduce bureaucracy and make government more efficient.  If the majority decides to take another crack at this issue down the road, I can only guess at what kind of new ideas they might have that would, again, miss the point of making sure we had a narrow, defined, and bipartisan approach to deal with this issue.  My view is that this is an ill-conceived campaign against working people built on a completely false premise. The premise is that if you are looking for work, you are guilty of drug use until proven innocent. My view is that we ought to keep trying, as I have said, on major issues involving health and taxes and infrastructure and trade. When you are dealing with important questions, we should work to find the common ground. It is not about taking each other's bad ideas. It is about taking each other's good ideas.  My view is that what was done a few years ago was a good and narrowly tailored bipartisan idea. What the Senate may choose to do is basically to throw that in the trash can, create bedlam, and make it impossible for States to move because they are in a sort of legal limbo. I don't see how that meets the test of sound policy.  This measure before us today sets back the cause of strengthening the unemployment insurance system. It sets back the cause of advocating for Americans struggling with addiction. I urge my colleagues to vote against this measure when we vote here in a little bit.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Rubio). The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

524,topic-id,915,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to spend time here with my colleagues. We just heard a diatribe from our colleagues. It is interesting to me to note how they say the American people don't want us to change this, but I have to remind my colleagues that I think the American people spoke very loudly on November 8. We have run multiple times to repeal this bill. I heard one of my other colleagues say that we voted over 60 times, and we are going to vote one more time to get rid of the Affordable Care Act because the American people have delivered that message to us, and we have a President that says that we will do this.  I think, as we go through this, we are going to have some interesting conversations. Considering all the bickering and posturing you see in the media by partisans on the left and the right, it is time for Members of this body to step back for a moment and take stock of where we are in the healthcare debate.  I was not a Member of Congress when the Affordable Care Act was passed. I was a practicing large animal veterinarian in private practice plying my trade and not a political animal, if you will. However, I was concerned to see the way the law was passed. My colleagues on the other side were talking about how this was rammed through Congress and how it was passed in the shadows--or how we are doing that now. But I have to remind them that in 2009 it was passed in the dark of night--no Republican input, no debate, and no discussion. It was just passed and rammed down the American people's throat.  I want to go on here, and I want to yield to a couple of my colleagues before I do.[[Page H2012]]  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.LaMalfa) because he has to go tend to some other business. I would like to have his input on this. Doug LaMalfa is my good friend and a great leader up here.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from California (Mr.Yoho), a good friend here, and my other colleagues here, to allow me the moment to speak.  Mr.Speaker, I am really excited about the opportunity with this new administration for relief for regular Americans from the Affordable Care I think the intentions may have been good when it was passed, but we see the devastating effects from the many emails, letters, calls, and the communications my office received from middle-income families. They are the ones that are the most negatively affected by this act. We have seen their premiums and their deductibles go out of sight. They may not even need to have the insurance anymore because the deductibles are so out of reach for them on cost, so insurance means nothing to them.  Indeed, with most Americans having health insurance before the ACA that they were at least reasonably happy with, they have had that choice taken away from them. They have had choices taken away. My wife and I were sitting there in December 2013, being forced, just like everybody else, to enroll in a plan with a broken website trying to get it to go through. We knew at the time we were going to have big problems with that.  We even agreed with the Republican conference when we were on the eve of this taking effect. The President decided that maybe we need to have a 1-year pause for this for employers of 100 people or more. We agreed with that. We offered legislation because you are not supposed to just do that with the stroke of a pen. Indeed, it was duly passed legislation with all Democrat votes, no Republican votes, just a few short years before. We agreed, let's lay this for a year, if nothing else, for those larger employers.  But we also said: Mr.President, we should also delay it for everybody else because we know it isn't going to work. We know this is going to do nothing to curb costs. That really is the bottom line. It is the middle-income families that I am really worried about in this thing because, again, we received so many communications from them saying: Please help us. We can't afford it. We are putting off being able to buy a home because we are seeing these costs go up. We are putting off college savings for our kids because our costs are spiraling out of control.  So if we do nothing else in the process, again, are we going to come up with the perfect bill?  There is no perfect bill when you have this many years of the type of government takeover of health care that we have seen here. But we are going to do the best we can because it is those folks out there--middle-income Americans--that we are trying to help to bring relief from the ACA so they can go back to doing the priorities they see: having affordable insurance, doctors they can choose, a plan they can choose, and being able to go off and do the things like saving for their kids' college and maybe buying that home that is part of the American Dream instead of the American nightmare they see it has been.  So I appreciate my colleague, again, having this time this night and for allowing me to speak for a few minutes.  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH2011.txt,2115,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,9.0,March
525,topic-id,936,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from  Mr.Speaker, as I was saying, I was concerned to see the way the law was passed. It was passed in the middle of the night. I thought it was passed through hastily and without transparency. I did not think that boded well for the law's success. Unfortunately, I was proven right.  If you remember the words of the then-Speaker of the House, it was passed without reading it, and the words were: We have to pass it to see what is in it. We have to pass it to see how it is going to work.  Talk about legislative malpractice that was poured on to the American people to get a bill they didn't want, that nobody read. Yet my colleagues on the other side are talking about how we are running this through without anybody's input. It has had 6 years of input, it is coming together now, and our goal is to fix health care for the American people.  As someone who has practiced medicine, I believe that, despite all the good intentions behind the Affordable Care Act, it was doomed to fail, as most Big Government programs are. In fact, one of the main reasons I ran was on behalf of patient-centered, free-market oriented health care. I supported and still support healthcare reform that allows us in Congress to keep our promises when we talk about what we want to achieve.  I was one of the Members that came up here who lost my health care because of the Affordable Care My premiums have gone up over $11,000 since I have been here. My deductibles have gone up and my coverage has gone down. It is a disaster. I have to remind my colleague from Minnesota who was talking about how bad the Republican bill is that his own Governor from the State of Minnesota said that this bill is a disaster, the Affordable Care Act in its present form, and his premiums have gone up 45 percent in his own  I want to remind this body that many people lost health care they had before ObamaCare was passed with the promise that if you like your plan, you can keep it. It was broken by our own President of the United If you like your plan, if you like your doctor, and if you like your insurance company, your premiums will go down $2,500 on an average. Lie after lie after lie. The American people answered that by electing a majority in Congress to the Republican Party to fix that, and that is what we aim to do.  Supporters of the ACA also told us that the premiums wouldn't increase. It turned out that was false. Premiums in the individual markets have increased partly because ObamaCare has forced insurers to leave the exchange. For example, benchmark silver-level plan premiums have increased by an average of 25 percent from 2016 to 2017, according to the Department of If you like the State of Arizona, the premium this year is going up an astounding 116 percent. They worry about us, and then they blame us for raising the cost of health care. Sophistry, pure sophistry.  Many families have been forced to pay drastically higher out-of-pocket costs, which hits their pocketbooks hard even though they are not wealthy people by any stretch of the imagination. As my friend, Mr.LaMalfa, was talking about the cost, at the end of the month people are finding out they are running out of money before they run out of the month.  I am reminded of one family in my district whom I met with personally many times over my tenure in They had to deal with the intense treatments and frequent hospitalizations for an illness that has hit two generations of their family very hard. They had coverage through an employer that they started out with, and it was a $350-a-month premium right before the ACA passed in 2010. However, around the time the ACA mandates kicked in, their plan went up over $100 a month. Today their premium is a staggering $680 a month. That is over $8,000 a year in premiums, nearly double what they were paying before the These are the people that sent us up here to fix health care. Unless you are making six figures a year, this is an absolutely painful sum.  Mr.Speaker, I may not generally be a supporter of government benefits, but I do believe very strongly that our government should make every effort in protecting our Nation's vulnerable population, especially the chronically ill. My concern is the ACA has resulted in those groups being harmed more than anybody else. Particularly for those who had employer-provided insurance prior to the ACA, the law's effect has been hurtful, especially if their coverage was for families afflicted by long-term illness. Simply put, no healthcare law should ever make things worse for people who were responsible and had health care to treat a medical condition. If anything, that is the opposite of health care.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Babin), who is a good friend of mine. Babin has practiced dentistry in our military and in the private sector. Right after graduating dental school, he was commissioned in the Air Force as an officer and was stationed overseas. I thank the gentleman[[Page H2013]]for his service. He later returned to his native east Texas to open his own dental practice, which he operated for over three decades. He has served on the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners and as a member of the American Dental  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH2011.txt,2115,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,9.0,March
527,topic-id,165,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate Babin's comments. He is very astute. He has been around health care. You know how this thing is not working and the strain it has put on people in your district, as it has in mine, and people around the country.  I am relieved that Congress is moving forward on legislation to right these wrongs. It feels so good to be a Member of Congress today to live up to a campaign promise that everyone in the majority in the House, Senate, and executive branch says: We are going to fix this; trust us. I have the complete confidence in that. I look forward to engaging with my colleagues.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.Newhouse). He is a farmer, small-business man, and good conservative who understands the importance of keeping government out of our healthcare system.  Our country's farmers have been hit hard, just as much as others, by Congressman Newhouse is, no doubt, well aware of these issues.

529,topic-id,311,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my good colleague from Washington I appreciate his words, his thoughtfulness, and the stories. You learn more from a story than you do facts and figures.  I want to go over a couple of things here. As we have heard, the average increase of health plans in the United States rose by over 35 percent. I already talked about Arizona: 116 percent this year alone.  The insurance exchanges that were set up--the 26 in the beginning--are down to 5, with some counties not even having exchanges to purchase insurance.  I think for the people that are watching this at home, whether they are Members of Congress, the American citizens, I want you to listen to this, and I want to take you back to the information that came out when the Speaker of the House then talked about, we have to pass it to see what is in it, how it is going to work. Then I want you to picture the words of the architect of this bill, Jonathan Gruber: The lack of transparency and the stupidity of the American voter helped ObamaCare pass.  The Democrats want to blame this body, the Republicans, for wrecking health care. This is what they passed on us and the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Carter), who is the only pharmacist serving in As a healthcare professional, he knows these issues very well.  He is the co-chair of the Community Pharmacy Caucus and sits on one of the main healthcare committees in Congress, the Committee on Energy and He ran his own business, like me, and witnessed firsthand the problems that government regulations and red tape cause on job creators, large and small.  I want to remind folks, too, that there were over 22,000 pages of rules and regulations that came out of the Affordable Care  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH2011.txt,2115,FAIRNESS IN CLASS ACTION LITIGATION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,9.0,March

The effort he has put in, working diligently to help us right this wrong that[[Page H2015]]has been instilled upon the American people.

531,topic-id,920,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.Rodney Davis). He brought up a very astute point. This is collapsing on itself. If we were to do nothing, this would collapse, and the American people would be left without any coverage. We have heard other people on the other side say: Leave it alone.  That is irresponsible, and we will not do that. We will repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and we remove it from Washington bureaucrats and government mandates. If government can tell you what kind of insurance to buy, you have to buy it, and if you don't, they penalize you, what else can they force you to do?  Our Constitution is not a function of the government. Government is a function of the Yet when government steps beyond the boundaries of the Constitution, it is up to us, we, the people--and we are the representatives of we, the people--to change how government works. That is what we are doing with the repeal and the replacement of the Affordable Care We have heard about the nightmare this has caused to the American people, to our economy, the loss of jobs, the depression of job growth, wage growth. We can go on and on for hours, but it is not going to fix this problem.  What I want to focus on for the next few minutes is what the replacement does do. We have heard about the mandates that are going away, the taxes that are going away, the expansion of The reality in America, our country is in financial dire straits. It is unsustainable. It would be imprudent for us to sit by and do nothing while the country goes into default.  So with the direction we are going, this will bend the cost curve to Medicaid to make it solvent for a longer period of time. This will empower the individual to have health care and make those decisions between the doctor and the patient, the way it should be, instead of a government-controlled mandate.  This empowers individuals to be more responsible for themselves, to incentivize them to go out and buy health care by the use of health savings accounts, where they can buy over-the-counter medications to share with family members the benefit of the health savings account.  Republicans, Democrats, and Independents all want preexisting conditions covered, so that is something we all are in agreement with. There is the argument about should children be able to stay on their parents' policies until the age of 26. Personally, I don't think they should have to--I think they should be out on their own, but I have heard from enough people in my district that I am willing to compromise and go along with that. Truth be known, children could already stay on their parents' health plan until the age of 26 if they were actively enrolled in college or disabled. So we are compromising.  This will make health care better. It puts health care into the hands of the American people and their doctors and drives government out of it. Let them oversee the process.  We have heard over and over again that we need to open up the market across State lines. There is legislation coming out that will free up the insurance companies. We are introducing legislation to hold harmless insurance companies now, before we get through with this process, so that insurance companies are not held to the standards of the Affordable Care Act, so that they can start writing policies today when this legislation passes, so they can write their policies and start marketing now so that the American people will have time to research these products.  There will be a transition period. I can't guarantee it is going to be smooth. I can guarantee you it will be smoother than the last one.  I think the last thing I want to leave the American people with is we don't want to pull the rug out from anybody. We will do everything possible, and I know on both sides of this. I would think the Democrats, with the debacle that they created, the legislative malpractice that they passed in the dark hours of the night in December of 2009 or 2010, that they would want to come to the aid to fix health care for the American people instead of chastising us and telling us how bad and how wrong we are to interfere.[[Page H2016]]  This plan is going to collapse on its own. We invite them to come to the table to help us fix this because this is for all Americans, not just It is for all Americans--Republicans, Democrats, Independents, everybody. I would hope they would come and help us do this.  I think the last thing, Mr.Speaker, is this is a historic opportunity. The Wall Street Journal said never before has there been a chance to change a program as significant as what we are getting ready to do. We are the ones who are going to lead this effort to bring healthcare stability to the American people.  I look forward to the discussions in the future. I ask the American people to believe in the people you sent up here to fix this. We are going to get it right.  One last thing. I will guarantee you that this bill will be read before it is passed, and we will know how it is going to work.
