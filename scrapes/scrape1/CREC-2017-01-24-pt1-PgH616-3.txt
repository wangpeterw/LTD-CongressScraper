                      MOVE PAST POLITICAL DIVISION

  (Mr. BOST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, our Nation is clearly divided. The division 
was displayed when a group of students from Marion High School in my 
district came to Washington for the inauguration weekend.
  On the way back to their hotel on Saturday night, a group of 
protesters surrounded their bus, threw projectiles through the windows, 
and painted the bus. Imagine that. A group of history students coming 
13 hours across this great Nation and wanting to participate in the 
peaceful transfer of power only to be intimidated.
  Free speech is essential to our democracy. However, acts of violence 
and intimidation have no place. Now is the time for both parties to 
move to get past this political division that is going through this 
country.
