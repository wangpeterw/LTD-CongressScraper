                    HONORING DANA MARSHALL-BERNSTEIN

  (Ms. ROSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am here today not only to mourn the loss of 
a family friend and lifelong Las Vegas resident, but to let Congress 
know what an amazing young woman she was.
  Dana Marshall-Bernstein died in December at the age of 28 following a 
lifelong battle with Crohn's disease. She spent most of her life in and 
out of the hospital, but even while she was undergoing countless 
surgeries, she never let her disease define her. She never stopped 
feeling optimistic about her future. She believed in kindness, and she 
used her experience to comfort others who were also affected by Crohn's 
disease.
  She shined in more ways than one, and I know she will continue to 
shine in the memory of each and every life she touched, and her memory 
will be a blessing to all those who knew and loved her.

[[Page H137]]

  I encourage all Members here today to carry with them the courage and 
determination that Dana brought into this world: to always think and 
live life with positivity and never ever stop believing in doing good 
by others.
