              SAVE HEALTHCARE, REJECT REPUBLICAN TAX BILL

  (Mr. DOGGETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, this wretched Republican tax bill threatens 
the health of millions. That is why Republicans are rushing this sham 
through in record pace. They want to pass it before most Americans know 
what has hit them.
  It is amazing that, on this Alzheimer's Awareness Month, they 
celebrate it by imposing a new Alzheimer's tax. Families paying 
thousands of dollars to care for a loved one would lose the right that 
they have today to deduct those huge expenses. It is not just a tax on 
Alzheimer's, but on any substantial healthcare expense.
  As if that were not bad enough, they pursue with their fanatical zeal 
the destruction of ObamaCare. Again, they would remove one of the key 
pillars that will lead to denying coverage for those with preexisting 
conditions because their insurance premiums will soar.
  It will mean that millions of Americans will lose their healthcare 
coverage. Protect your health. Reject this sorry Republican tax bill.
