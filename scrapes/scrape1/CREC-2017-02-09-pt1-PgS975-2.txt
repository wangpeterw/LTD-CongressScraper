                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Give ear to our words, O Lord. Listen to the sounds of our 
intercession. We look to You with the vibrant expectation that You can 
transform dark yesterdays into bright tomorrows. We are grateful that 
we can fulfill Your purposes because of the strength we receive each 
day from You.
  Lord, show our lawmakers Your compassion. Give them a peace that 
transcends human understanding. May they face life's challenges with 
the faith that nothing is impossible for You. Increase their faith, 
filling them with a more complete trust in You and with a willingness 
to follow Your guidance.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen
