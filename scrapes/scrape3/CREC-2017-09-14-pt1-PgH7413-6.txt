                          PROTECTING DREAMERS

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, DREAMers are bright, hardworking people who 
simply want to live in peace and contribute to the only country they 
know as home. They worship in our churches, serve as teachers and 
nurses in our schools and hospitals, and some even defend our country 
in the military.
  Additionally, every DACA recipient passed extensive background checks

and came forward to register with the Federal Government. There is no 
security reason that DREAMers should not stay and continue contributing 
to our community and our local economies. There is no way to disguise 
that their deportation would just be the worst of what our country is 
all about. We have to protect them.
  Being Members of Congress, it is so important that we step up, that 
we answer the call, and that we offer these young people the 
opportunity to continue to stay in our country, continue to work, go to 
school, and contribute so much because they have already given our 
country so much.
  I urge my Republican colleagues to work with House Democrats to 
immediately pass the Dream Act. It is the only way we can provide peace 
of mind to nearly 150,000 DACA recipients in my home State of Texas.
