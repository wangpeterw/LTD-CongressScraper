                      NATIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR DAY

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last Saturday, March 25, 
marked National Medal of Honor Day. Designated by Congress in 1990, the 
National Medal of Honor Day celebrates each of the men and women who 
have earned America's highest, most prestigious military decoration.
  I am grateful that South Carolina has a long tradition of military 
service, with 34 Medal of Honor recipients, including the youngest 
living honoree, Corporal Kyle Carpenter of Gilbert.
  To mark National Medal of Honor Day, I join Medal of Honor recipient 
Major General James Livingston and South Carolina Attorney General Alan 
Wilson with a wreath-laying ceremony at Mount Pleasant Memorial Garden. 
The inspiring program was organized by the Fort Sullivan Chapter, 
National Society Daughters of the American Revolution, led by Regent 
Nancy Herritage.
  Additionally, congratulations to the University of South Carolina 
women's basketball team and head coach Dawn Staley on their victory in 
the Elite Eight last night. I am happy to cheer for the Gamecocks as 
they head to Dallas, Texas, for their second Final Four appearance in 
just 3 years.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops. We will never forget September 
the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
