                         MASSACRE IN LAS VEGAS

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as the band played the latest country 
western song, gunfire erupted from the 32nd floor window across the 
street.
  Twenty minutes later, when the shots stopped and the smoke cleared, 
59 people were murdered and over 520 were wounded.
  The SWAT team quickly found the hiding place of the evil villain, and 
as they approached, the outlaw shot himself. Thus, he avoided a date 
with the hangman. Justice occurred.
  The casualties would have been much worse but for quick action by 
members of the crowd. People, including former military and off-duty 
police officers, helped hide and cover others while endangering their 
own lives.
  The first responders, police, doctors, emergency medical technicians 
quickly tended to the wounded. These unnamed quick responders, both 
civilian and law enforcement, and medical, without regard to their own 
life, saved others.
  The band had stopped playing music, but the cries of the wounded and 
the tears of the mourning continue, Mr. Speaker. We must have prayers 
for Las Vegas, and God bless them one and all.
  And that is just the way it is.
