                          NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National Bible 
Week.
  For thousands of years, the Bible has been a source of guidance and 
strength for humanity. During times of turmoil and confusion, I can 
think of no more important source of comfort than the wisdom provided 
in the Good Book.
  The Bible serves as a profound influence in my life, as well as 
others in this Chamber. Many of us gather weekly for prayer breakfasts 
and Bible study.
  The Bible offers us hope when circumstances are dire and is a source 
of strength when human frailty brings us low. As we read in the Gospel 
of Matthew: ``Come unto me, all ye that labor under heavy laden, and I 
will give you rest.''
  Next week, as we celebrate Thanksgiving, my prayer is that it will be 
a time of healing and unity for all. As we reflect on the blessings God 
has provided, I hope we will also celebrate the gift God provides us 
daily through His holy word
