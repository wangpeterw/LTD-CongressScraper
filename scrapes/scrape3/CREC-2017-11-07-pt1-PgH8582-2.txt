                        NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of November as 
National Adoption Month in honor of the 111,000 children waiting to be 
adopted from the foster care system.
  As a co-chair of the Congressional Foster Youth Caucus, I strongly 
believe that every child deserves a forever family. The love and 
stability that a family provides leads to far better outcomes for youth 
of all ages, and we must work to ensure that we have this support 
system.
  But adoption does take a toll on families, both financially and 
emotionally. They need assistance, and the adoption tax credit provides 
them with up to $13,570 in tax refunds for adoption expenses. I am 
truly disturbed, Mr. Speaker, that Republicans have introduced a tax 
bill that would eliminate the adoption tax credit.
  During National Adoption Month, I call on my colleagues to support 
adopted children and families by rejecting this misguided measure.
  Mr. Speaker, we need to make sure that adoptions are affordable, that 
they are possible, and that, long-term, they are successful, and the 
adoption tax credit does exactly that.
