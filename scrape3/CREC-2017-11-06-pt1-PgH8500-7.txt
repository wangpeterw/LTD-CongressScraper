                        ISRAELI-AMERICAN COUNCIL

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, our thoughts and prayers 
are with all those who are grieving at the First Baptist Church in 
Sutherland Springs, Texas.
  This morning, I was grateful to join the Israeli-American Council at 
their fourth National Council Conference to celebrate our ally, Israel, 
and the special relationship we have formed over many years with the 
people of Israel. It was meaningful to be greeted by National Chairman 
Adam Milstein, and to discuss issues with Dr. Miriam and Sheldon 
Adelson.
  The Israeli-American Council is the fastest growing Jewish-American 
organization in the United States, and works every day to foster a 
strong and positive relationship between the United States and the 
Israeli people.
  I am grateful for their many accomplishments, and I wish them 
continued success in strengthening the American-Israeli relationship in 
the years to come through mutual economic success, creating jobs while 
promoting peace through strength with military cooperation.
  South Carolina has always appreciated its Jewish heritage as home of 
the largest Jewish population of any State at the time of the American 
Revolution.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
