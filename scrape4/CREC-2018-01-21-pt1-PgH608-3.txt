                     THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN COUNT

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the American people can count. 
Forty-four Senate Democrats voted to shut down the government. Ten 
times as many Democrats as Republicans supported denying funds to our 
military, to children's healthcare, and to everyday Americans.
  The Senate Democrats must be held accountable. Their actions halted 
government services. They can't blame anyone else.
  The numbers don't lie, and the American people can count. Forty-four 
Senate Democrats voted to shut down the government. Let's hope they 
change their minds and vote to get back to work. We have much to do to 
make America great.
