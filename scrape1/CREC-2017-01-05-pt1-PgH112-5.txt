                       OFFERING A 28TH AMENDMENT

  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, we came together this morning to read the 
United States Constitution and its 27 amendments. I offer a 28th 
amendment, an amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's disastrous 
decision in Citizens United:
  Section 1. To advance democratic self-government and political 
equality, and to protect the integrity of government and the electoral 
process, Congress and the States may regulate and set reasonable limits 
on the raising and spending of money by candidates and others to 
influence elections.
  Section 2. Congress and the States shall have power to implement and 
enforce this article by appropriate legislation, and may distinguish 
between natural persons and corporations or other artificial entities 
created by law, including by prohibiting such entities from spending 
money to influence our elections.
  Section 3. Nothing in this article shall be construed to grant 
Congress or the States the power to abridge freedom of the press.
  Mr. Speaker, Citizens United let unlimited money flood into our 
elections and compromise our democracy. I ask all of my colleagues in 
this 115th Congress to join our effort to overturn it.
