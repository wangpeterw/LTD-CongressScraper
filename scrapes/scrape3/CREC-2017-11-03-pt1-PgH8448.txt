        HONORING WAYNESVILLE HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN MENTOR COUNCIL

  (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize some outstanding high 
school students from my district in Missouri, who have displayed a deep 
appreciation and respect for our Armed Forces.
  Before the last regular season varsity football home game, members of 
the Waynesville High School Freshman Mentor Council presented pocket 
flags to the 763rd Ordnance Company, who will soon be deploying. The 
students also presented the pocket flags to Waynesville High School's 
Partners in Education, the 787th Military Police Battalion and 3rd 
Battalion, 10th Infantry Regiment, to share with deploying soldiers.
  The flags are part of the Pocket Flag Project, which provides 
military personnel on the front lines with personal pocket flags. 
Waynesville High School freshmen folded the flags and wrote 
personalized messages to accompany each flag on Patriot Day.
  I applaud these students for taking the initiative to honor our men 
and women in uniform. With young people like these walking down the 
halls of schools, I am certain America has a bright future.
