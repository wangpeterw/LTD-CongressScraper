                                 PRAYER

  Imam Abdullah Antepli, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, 
offered the following prayer:
  The holy One, as Your creation, we call You by different names, 
experience You through multiple paths. Our human diversity is from You. 
As the creator of all, You made us different. Enable us to understand, 
appreciate, and celebrate our differences. Teach and guide us to turn 
these differences into opportunities, richness, and strength. Prevent 
us from turning them into sources of division, polarization, hate, and 
bigotry.
  The most merciful One, this incredibly diverse Nation of ours is one 
of the most successful attempts to understand Your wisdom in creating 
us different. We are far from being perfect, but came a long way in 
creating a multicultural, multireligious, and pluralistic society by 
making in America ``you will be judged by what you do, not by who you 
are'' as one of our foundational promises.
  The most compassionate One, help us to preserve our achievements in 
this regard. Do not let the destructive forces of division and 
exclusion erode our ideals, our firm commitment to diversity and 
pluralism. Empower us and these legislators to further improve the 
culture of inclusion and welcome to all in our Nation and beyond.
  The most forgiving One, if and when we forget You, do not forget us.
  In Your most holy and beautiful name, we pray.
  Amen.
