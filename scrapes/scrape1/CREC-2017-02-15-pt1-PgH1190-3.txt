  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  We give You thanks, O God, for giving us another day.
  As You make available to Your people the grace and knowledge to meet 
the needs of the day, we pray that Your spirit will be upon the Members 
of this people's House, giving them the richness of Your wisdom.
  May the power of Your truth and our faith in Your providence give 
them all the confidence they must have to do the work required for 
service to our Nation.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
