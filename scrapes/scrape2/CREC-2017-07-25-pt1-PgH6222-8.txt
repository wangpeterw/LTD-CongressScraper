                      CARE CORPS DEMONSTRATION ACT

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight the Care 
Corps Demonstration Act, a bill that Congresswoman Michelle Lujan 
Grisham and I will be introducing this week.
  Every year, millions of seniors and individuals with disabilities 
find themselves in need of long-term care and services. However, our 
Nation faces a critical shortage of caregivers. To address this growing 
problem, I have joined Michelle to introduce the Care Corps 
Demonstration Act.
  This commonsense and bipartisan bill will create a grant program that 
will provide compassionate young men and women an opportunity to gain 
valuable experience working with seniors and individuals with 
disabilities across our great land.
  Care Corps will not only help empower our young adults to meet our 
Nation's senior needs, but it will also provide them with essential 
educational assistance and give them an opportunity to start or further 
their careers as caregivers.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this bill so that 
our seniors and those with disabilities receive the care they so 
desperately need while empowering our youth to advance their careers.
