                            STRANGER THINGS

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, like the main characters in ``Stranger 
Things,'' we are now stuck in the ``Upside Down.'' Right is wrong. Up 
is down. Black is white.
  The White House deceives the American public for weeks about their 
contacts with Russia, but an Attorney General who followed her 
conscience is fired.
  Executive orders are signed to ban Muslims in order to keep us safe, 
while top secret national security conversations are held out in the 
open.
  President Trump showers praise on a thug like Vladimir Putin, while 
threatening and bullying our longstanding allies.
  President Trump signs an executive order to spend $20 billion on a 
border wall, while Flint, Michigan, still goes without clean drinking 
water.
  Mr. Speaker, mornings might be for coffee and contemplation, but 
Chief Jim Hopper is not coming to rescue us. This is not a TV show. 
This is real life. We have a President unlike any we have ever known. 
And like Mike, Dustin, Lucas, and Eleven, we must remain focused on the 
task at hand and hold this administration accountable so we can escape 
from our own version of the ``Upside Down.''
