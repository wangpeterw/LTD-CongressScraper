                     DON'T MAKE AMERICA SICK AGAIN

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was givenpermission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want tofollow my colleague 
and my neighbor in Texas to regret the loss of our two National 
Guardsmen from the 36th Division. The 36thDivision is a historic 
division, Texas division, T-Patchers, and to lose two of our soldiers 
is tragic.
  But I am on thefloor today to talk about health care. The Republican 
majority has taken the first legislative step to make America sick 
again.The first step was to take away health care from tens of millions 
of Americans, including premium increases for millions more inAmerica. 
The second action lights the fuse on the dangerous legislative process 
that threatens to cut Medicare, Medicaid, andhealth tax credits that 
Americans are now benefiting from.
  There should be no reform without a replacement because we maynever 
have a replacement, but we have millions of Americans who will lose 
their healthcare coverage because of the actions ofthis House. Let's 
don't make America sick again.
