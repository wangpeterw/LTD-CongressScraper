                         SUPPORTING HEAD START

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Head Start, a 
program which serves many Kansas families and children to be prepared 
for modern education.
  Many supporters of Head Start came to Capitol Hill today to spread a 
message, which I believe wholeheartedly: everyone should have the 
opportunity to pursue the American Dream. For so many, that starts with 
quality education and Head Start.
  We know the importance of getting kids exposed to learning at young 
ages, but many disadvantaged families lack the resources to do this for 
their own children. Without Head Start, these

children are at risk of falling behind and never catching up.
  Mr. Speaker, I believe this issue should unite this Congress. It goes 
without saying that this is a time of deep divisions in our country. My 
district encompasses all aspects of American society, from urban to 
suburban to rural. My constituents have a wide range of beliefs and 
ideals. Head Start is something that can bridge these divides, and it 
can help children and communities no matter where they live.
  Mr. Speaker, let's build that bridge and let's bring lawmakers from 
all across the country together in support of these children, in 
support of Head Start.
