                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Father, our souls long for You, for we find strength and joy 
in Your presence.
  Guide our lawmakers to put their trust in You, seeking in every 
undertaking to live with honor. When they go through difficulties, may 
they remember that with Your help, they can accomplish the seemingly 
impossible. Give them the wisdom to take time to get to know one 
another, to be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger. Lord, 
provide them with a faith that will trust You even when the darkness is 
blacker than a thousand midnights. May they always find strength in 
Your providential leading.
  We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
