                   PRESSING ISSUES FACING THE NATION

  (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam Speaker, enough is enough. Congress has 
a huge list of urgent, overdue bipartisan priorities for the American 
people, and we can't keep kicking the can down the road.
  The short-term funding bill congressional Republicans passed 
yesterday ignores the pressing issues facing our Nation: funding the 
Children's Health Insurance Program and Community Health Centers; 
delivering needed resources to fight the deadly opioid epidemic; 
protecting our DREAMers from deportation; and providing disaster relief 
for Americans ravaged by hurricanes, mudslides, and wildfires.
  These issues aren't going away. We must work together to address them 
immediately. Yet House Republicans have passed a fourth short-term 
funding measure in 4 months.
  This month-by-month approach is reckless and dangerous for the entire 
Nation. It hinders our military, medical research, and infrastructure 
investments. It hurts seniors who depend on Social Security and 
Medicare and veterans getting care at the VA.
  We need to stop the gimmicks and the cycle of delay. This is no way 
to run the government.
  Madam Speaker, let's stop putting off for tomorrow the things we need 
to do today. Let's get to work.
