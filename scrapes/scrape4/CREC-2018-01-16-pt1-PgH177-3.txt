                  LORI LOWERY SHOWS THE BEST IN TEXAS

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, the people of my hometown of Sugar Land, 
Texas, are amazing.
  Last Thursday, something terrible happened on a road I drive on every 
day at home. On Interstate 69, an 18-wheeler jackknifed during heavy 
rain. It flew off an overpass, crashing down on a small Toyota Camry. 
Look. That Camry is about 3 feet tall.
  The first miracle is that the driver, Karan Singh, is still alive. 
The second miracle that day is named Lori Lowery. Lori is training to 
be a nurse, most likely across the street at the University of Houston 
Sugar Land. The crash happened right in front of her. She jumped out of 
her car, crawled through metal and broken glass, and got Karan out.
  Lori Lowery shows the best in Texas and my hometown of Sugar Land, 
and I am proud to call her my boss in Congress.
