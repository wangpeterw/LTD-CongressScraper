                          HONORING CARRIE MEEK

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the inspiring 
work of former Congresswoman Carrie Meek.
  Hailing from my home State of Florida, Carrie grew up in a family 
where giving back to the community was a top priority. Throughout her 
many years of dedicated work, Carrie served as special assistant to the 
vice president of my alma mater, Miami Dade College, where she was 
instrumental in the desegregation of the school.
  In 1982, Carrie became the first African American elected to the 
floor of the senate, and my husband, Dexter, and I were proud to work 
alongside her on behalf of our community. Carrie and I later carried 
our bipartisan efforts to the marbled Halls of Congress.
  As a Congresswoman, Carrie's coveted seat on the Appropriations 
Committee allowed her to fight for much-needed aid to south Florida 
after the devastating impact of Hurricane Andrew.
  Following her retirement from Congress, Carrie established the Carrie 
Meek Foundation, promoting programs in housing, education, health, and 
economic development to improve the quality of life for the most 
vulnerable members of our society.
  At the age of 91, Carrie continues to demonstrate her affection for 
selfless public service. She is an example to be followed.
  Congratulations to Carrie Meek.
