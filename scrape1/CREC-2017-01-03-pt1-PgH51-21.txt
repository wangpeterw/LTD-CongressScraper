           By Mr. KING of Iowa:
       H.R. 175.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Clause 1, Section 8 of Article 1 of the United States 
     Constitution, which reads: ``The Congress shall have Power to 
     lay and collected Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises.'' 
     Therefore, Congress' taxing power would be the authority to 
     repeal ObamaCare's individual mandate.
       Clause 3, Section 8 of Article 1 of the United States 
     Constitution, which states Congress' power ``To regulate 
     Commerce . . . among the States.'' ObamaCare was a clear 
     violation of the Commerce Clause, forcing individuals to buy 
     a product, and this bill will ensure that such personal 
     economic decisions are returned to Americans.
       In addition, this bill makes specific changes to existing 
     law in a manner that returns power to the States and to the 
     People, consistent with Amendment X of the United States 
     Constitution.
