                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God, our shield, look with favor upon us. Lord, You have told us in 
James 4:2 that we have not because we ask not. We therefore continue to 
ask You to place Your healing hand on Senator John McCain. Astound us 
with Your power.
  Today, we also pray that You would guide our lawmakers around the 
obstacles that hinder their progress, uniting them for the common good 
of this great land. Lord, enable them to go from strength to strength, 
as they fulfill Your purposes for their lives. Striving to please You, 
help them to stand for right and leave the consequences to You.
  We pray in Your powerful Name. Amen.
