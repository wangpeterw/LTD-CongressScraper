                             STOP THE BLEED

  (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to help raise 
awareness for the Stop the Bleed training course.
  Recently, I had the opportunity to take this course, offered by the 
American College of Surgeons. This simple training teaches you how to 
treat bleeding injuries and help save a life. The most common 
preventable cause of death after an accident is losing too much blood 
after trained responders arrive.
  This past June, I saw the difference having these lifesaving skills 
can make when several of my colleagues and friends were shot while we 
were practicing for the Congressional Baseball Game.
  We were fortunate to have the skills of former Army medic, my 
colleague, Congressman Brad Wenstrup, who was able to apply a 
tourniquet to Majority Whip Steve Scalise and help save Steve's life.
  Each year, more than 180,000 people die from injuries sustained from 
car crashes, falls, industrial and farm accidents, shootings, and 
natural disasters. Every American could potentially save a life by 
learning these very simple skills.
  I commend this campaign and I hope by raising awareness we will equip 
more Americans to do just that.
