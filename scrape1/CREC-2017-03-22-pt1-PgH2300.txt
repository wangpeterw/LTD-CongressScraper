                               TRUMPCARE

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, Republicans are planning to vote tomorrow 
to pass TrumpCare.
  This bill is a great deal for the superrich, it is a great deal for 
insurance companies, and it is a great deal for drug companies. But it 
is a bad deal for working men and women across our country.
  TrumpCare will raise premiums, increase deductibles and out-of-pocket 
expenses.
  TrumpCare ends coverage for 24 million people.
  TrumpCare destroys 2 million jobs.
  TrumpCare imposes an age tax on older Americans.
  And TrumpCare cuts Medicaid by $880 billion to give corporations and 
the wealthiest Americans a $600 billion tax cut--the single largest 
transfer of wealth from working people to the rich in history. This is 
wrong.
  The American people do not want this bill. They don't want to pay 
more for less.
  Donald Trump promised that he would be a great champion for the 
middle class. It only took him 2 months in office to break that promise 
and sell out to the wealthy and the special interests. Shame on him and 
shame on anyone who votes to take away health coverage from working men 
and women to fund a big tax cut for folks who don't need it. The 
working people of this country deserve better.
