                           OBAMACARE FAILURES

  (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend hisremarks.)
  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today, we come and find this one 
truism: ObamaCare showed that a Federal Governmenttakeover of health 
care is not in the best interest of addressing our healthcare system.
  Today, we are going to be taking a closer look at the top three 
ObamaCare failures: premiums have gone up, not down; insteadof lowered 
costs, healthcare prices have gone up; and people have less choice than 
ever before.
  Before we examine these, let's remember how we got here. There seems 
to be some selective amnesia on this floor. It wasafter months of 
backroom deals, in the middle of the night, last-minute deals, and 
without giving the American people enoughtime to even read the bill. 
That is not what is going to happen this time. Republicans are going to 
do what we said we would do:listen to the American people.
  We are going to do this right, with input from our neighbors, the 
folks we go to church with, and our families and ourcommunities. We are 
not going to pull the rug out from under anyone.
  We have listened to our constituents, and what we are hearing over 
and over again are the same three failures: premiums havegone up, not 
down; instead of lowered costs, healthcare prices went up; and people 
have less choice than ever before, which, inmany cases, is no choice at 
all. This is a failure, Mr. Speaker, and it is time to end.
