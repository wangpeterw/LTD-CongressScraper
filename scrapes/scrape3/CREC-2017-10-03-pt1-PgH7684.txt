                          ENDING GUN VIOLENCE

  (Mr. KENNEDY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, on Sunday night, in mere minutes, one man 
took at least 59 lives, forever altered hundreds more, and left 
invisible, incurable scars on thousands.
  On Monday morning, our Nation welcomed all of them into America's 
fastest growing community: families left with a gaping hole in their 
hearts caused by a bullet; a community that does not have the luxury of 
moving on from gun violence after TV cameras leave, after the front 
pages fill with news stories; a community that includes families Black 
and White, rich and poor, big and small, Democrat and Republican.
  Ending gun violence isn't political. It is personal. So we are now 
powerless. We are not helpless. We are not hostages to some political 
organization. We are not bystanders, as bullets tear through our 
concerts, prayer circles, elementary school classrooms, nightclubs, 
military compounds, and quiet neighborhoods.
  This is up to us, every single American. This is our country, our 
home, and our families. We can decide that one person's right to bear 
arms does not come at the expense of a neighbor's right to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
  We must say, ``No more.''
