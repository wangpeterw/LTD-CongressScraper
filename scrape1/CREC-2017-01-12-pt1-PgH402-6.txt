                LET'S NOT REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I am deeply concerned about 
the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and what itwould mean for 
Americans struggling with debilitating diseases.
  Prior to the ACA, the struggle of a debilitating illness like 
Alzheimer's or cancer could be compounded because of thefinancial 
burden from lack of affordable health care. Imagine being denied 
necessary health care because you or a loved onesuffered from a 
preexisting condition. These are the concerns that I am hearing from 
constituents across the Granite State.
  Take Sally from West Chesterfield. Her daughter has Crohn's disease, 
and she is on their family plan because she is underage 26. She will 
always need access to health care because of her condition, and if the 
Affordable Care Act is repealed and notreplaced, she could lose 
coverage because of her preexisting condition. These concerns are all 
too commonplace.
  I agree the ACA is not perfect, and I am committed to working in a 
bipartisan way to ensure the law will work

for allAmericans. But in the meantime, the ACA is helping 22 million 
Americans, including 1 in every 10 Granite Staters. We shouldbuild on 
those successes.
  I urge my colleagues on the Republican side to resist the temptation 
to repeal the law, especially without a plan thatensures affordable 
coverage for all Americans.
