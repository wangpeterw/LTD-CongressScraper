                  LET DEMOCRACY PREVAIL ON IMMIGRATION

  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, we have 4 legislative days before those 
protected by DACA will be at risk. The Speaker has said he was going to 
address this issue. He has not at this point in time.
  The Speaker said on 9/23/2010: We will advance major legislation one 
issue at a time.
  He said: We will not duck the tough issues. We will take them head-
on.
  In that light, I urge the Speaker to put on the floor the three bills 
that are pending in this House: a clean Dream Act; the USA Act, 
sponsored by Representatives Aguilar and Hurd, a bipartisan bill; and a 
Republican bill, the Securing America's Future Act, sponsored by 
Representative Goodlatte.
  Madam Speaker, let the people's House speak. Let them vote. Put these 
three bills on the floor, and let the majority rule. That is democracy. 
Let democracy prevail in this House.
