   HONORING ALBERTO ``BETO'' GONZALES DURING HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH

  (Mr. BACON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to commemorate Hispanic 
Heritage Month by honoring a dedicated community leader from our 
district, Alberto ``Beto'' Gonzales, whose work with the youth of our 
Hispanic community serves as a shining example for current and future 
generations.
  Mr. Gonzales grew up in the Hispanic neighborhoods of South Omaha 
but, unfortunately, fell into drugs and alcohol and was part of a 
street gang by the age of 11. At the age of 23, Alberto met Sister 
Joyce Englert, who helped him learn about Christ and get off drugs 
permanently. As a result, Beto committed his life to helping youth.
  Beto runs youth drug and alcohol treatment groups, outreach with 
schools, and served as a Boys Town crisis hotline counselor. Today, he 
serves

as an Omaha Police Department gang prevention and intervention 
specialist and a youth counselor for the South Omaha Boys and Girls 
Club. Through these efforts, Alberto Gonzales has touched and changed 
the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of youths in the Hispanic 
community.
  Alberto gives credit to God; his mother, who always prayed for him; 
Sister Joyce; and the many educators and professionals who encouraged 
him along the way.
