            WHY CAN'T THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY PASS A BUDGET?

  (Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask the Speaker: How is it 
that the Republican majority, in really less than a month, could pass 
legislation that was the biggest transfer of wealth to the wealthiest 
people in America through this giant tax cut that costs every single 
American $7,000 or more, but the Republican majority cannot pass a 
budget that they have had a year to pass, that addresses our military, 
that addresses healthcare, that addresses pensions, that addresses the 
DREAMers, and that addresses a whole variety of things?
  Why can't it get done?
  Why is the only thing that the Republican majority has found the will 
to pass is giant tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans?
  That is really the question that people should be asking. Here we 
are, we can't even pass a budget to keep the government open.

  I ask my friends to continue to ask that question of the majority 
party.
