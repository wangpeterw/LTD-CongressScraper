                   85TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HOLODOMOR

 Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today we solemnly mark the 85th 
anniversary of the Holodomor--the Ukrainian famine genocide--that 
claimed the lives of millions in the 1930s. As part of its vicious 
crusade promoting a failed ideology, the Soviet Union perpetrated a 
forced starvation campaign against ethnic Ukrainians, hoping to erase 
their place in history and their cries for freedom and independence. We 
must never forget these crimes against humanity. Ukraine today faces a 
different kind of threat from its neighbor Russia's ongoing occupation 
of its land and aggression towards its people. We must recall the 
lessons from history and remain united in solidarity with our 
democratic friends and allies and all those who pursue freedom and 
justice. I am proud to represent a strong, engaged, and vibrant 
Ukrainian community in New Jersey, and I commend your efforts to 
continue to bring to light injustices of the past and efforts to 
promote a brighter future.

                          ____________________
