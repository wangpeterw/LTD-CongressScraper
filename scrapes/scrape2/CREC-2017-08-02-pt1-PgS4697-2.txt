                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Holy God, You make the clouds Your chariot and walk upon the wind. 
You illuminate the darkness with Your presence and provide for the 
salvation of our souls. Great is Your faithfulness.
  Today, make our lawmakers heirs of peace, demonstrating that they are 
Your children, as they strive to stay within the circle of Your loving 
providence for their lives. May they take pleasure in doing Your will, 
knowing that by so doing, they are fulfilling Your purposes in our 
world.
  Lord, You are never far from us, but often we are far from You. So 
show us Your ways and teach us Your paths. Thank You that Your mercy is 
from everlasting to everlasting upon those who come to You with 
reverence. May Your glory endure forever.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
