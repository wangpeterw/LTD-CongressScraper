         CONGRATULATING RABBI ELYSE FRISHMAN ON HER RETIREMENT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank my friend and 
spiritual mentor, Rabbi Elyse Frishman, for her 22 years of exceptional 
service to Barnert Temple in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.
  After decades of service to the Jewish community, Rabbi Frishman will 
be retiring this June. Personally, I am very lucky to call Rabbi 
Frishman my rabbi.
  In addition to leading our congregation, she is the editor of the 
reform prayer book ``Mishkan Tefilah,'' and a national leader in 
worship and congregational engagement.
  Rabbi Frishman has stood as a model citizen and faith leader, going 
the extra mile to bring together the community in times of anxiety and 
fear.
  She was recently featured by The Bergen Record for her work to unite 
the interfaith communities in a common mission, forming dialogues, 
understanding, and building friendships where they didn't exist before.
  In doing so, she has long set an example for the families of our 
congregation. As a parent, I am glad my children are growing up knowing 
and being led and educated by her in our faith community.
  Rabbi Frishman deserves to be held up as a model for public service. 
And though our congregation and I will miss her deeply, I congratulate 
her on her retirement, and I hope everyone enjoys the evening 
celebrating her years of service to us. America and our community has 
been very lucky to have Rabbi Elyse Frishman.
  Thank you, Rabbi Frishman.
