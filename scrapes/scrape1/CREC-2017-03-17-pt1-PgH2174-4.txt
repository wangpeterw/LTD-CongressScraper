              HONORING THE MEMORY OF MICHAEL JAY GROBSTEIN

  (Mr. SHERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the memory of my 
good friend of nearly three decades, Michael Jay Grobstein of Encino, 
California, who passed away Wednesday, March 8.
  Michael died at home, surrounded by his loving family, including his 
wife of 53 years, Barrie; his children, Marla and Marc; and his 
grandchildren, Miranda and Avery.
  Fifty years ago, as a young and talented CPA, Michael founded a CPA 
firm which grew to be the largest accounting firm in the San Fernando 
Valley, Grobstein and Horwath. In that role, he provided financial and 
strategic advice to businesses throughout southern California, and 
beyond. There are thousands of people who are employed today at 
businesses that Michael guided with insight and wisdom.
  Michael served as a founding member and president of The Executives, 
a group of business leaders in the Valley formed to support the Jewish 
Home for the Aging, where my own mother lives, along with hundreds of 
those enjoying their senior years. For that effort, Barrie and Michael 
earned the Circle of Life Award.
  As lifelong residents of the Valley, both Michael and Barrie were 
involved in many charities, including the Junior Blind of America, the 
Grossman Burn Foundation, City of Hope, Cal State University 
Northridge, Sherman Oaks Hospital, and the Sheriff's Youth Foundation.
  Above all, Michael was an example of one of San Fernando Valley's 
finest community leaders, and he was a good friend. He will be missed.
