            TAKING ISSUE WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE PRESIDENT

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as an American, I certainly celebrate 
religious freedom and acknowledge the importance of freedom of religion 
and speech and the ability to have access to a free press.
  Sadly, I rise to take issue with the comments said by the Commander 
in Chief, well documented by Senator Durbin and the Senator from South 
Carolina, Lindsey Graham, who delicately tried to instruct the 
Commander in Chief of the ugliness of his words.
  I will not say them on the floor, and I have not said the complete 
word, but over this weekend of the beloved community of Dr. Martin 
Luther King, everywhere I went, people were appalled. I believe that it 
is crucial that we pass the Dream Act and that we speak to the racism 
of this President through 1973, 1980, 1988, and 1989.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Mast). Members are reminded to refrain 
from engaging in personalities toward the President.
