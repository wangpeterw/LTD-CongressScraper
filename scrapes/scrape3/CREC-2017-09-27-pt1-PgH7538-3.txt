                     RECOGNIZING TANNER LEE JAMESON

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, my constituent, Tanner Lee 
Jameson, was just 13 when he died from cardiac arrest during a 
basketball game. His school had an automated external defibrillator, or 
AED, in a nearby office, but it was inaccessible when Tanner needed it 
most.
  Since Tanner's passing, his mother, and my constituent, Rhonda 
Harrill, who is in the gallery today with her husband, has been a 
passionate advocate for increased AED access.
  Early this year, I introduced the AEDs resolution, H. Res. 35, which 
would encourage schools to have AEDs and to provide annual AED 
training.
  In 1998, I introduced, and Congress passed, the Aviation Medical 
Assistance Act, the law that requires, among other things, passenger 
airplanes and airports to have AEDs and flight crews to receive 
additional first aid and AED training.
  Today, I am pleased to participate in this year's AED Hunt on the 
Hill, sponsored by my friend, Dr. Phil Roe, and hosted by the 
Children's Cardiomyopathy Foundation.
  Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to remember Tanner Jameson's life, and I 
urge my colleagues to cosponsor H. Res. 35 to hopefully help save lives 
in the future.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind the gentleman that 
references to occupants of the gallery are not permitted.
