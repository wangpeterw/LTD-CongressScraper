                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Vincent De Rosa, St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer:
  Lord God, we praise You, who rule all things. We thank You for 
another day and another opportunity to serve You in our citizens. We 
ask Your forgiveness for past failings, whether by act or omission.
  We intercede for this venerable House: grant the strength required to 
be humble before the necessities of our people, especially those most 
in need.
  May Your strong hand be our defense, Your mercy our salvation, Your 
truth our guide, and Your grace our comfort, so that we may all along 
and at last be faithful to our mission.
  Amen.
