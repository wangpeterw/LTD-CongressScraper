                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Gracious Lord, who has given us life, we praise You for Your faithful 
reliability.
  Bless our lawmakers today in the work they will do. May they seek in 
all their labors to please and glorify You as You fill them with Your 
grace. May they not become weary in doing what is right, knowing that 
in due season they will reap if they faint not.
  Lord, let Your peace flood their hearts and help them to realize that 
it is by Your permission that they will breathe their next breath. May 
they permit life's problems to make them more dependent on Your 
guidance and strength.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
