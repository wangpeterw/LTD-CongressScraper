  SENATE RESOLUTION 284--CALLING ON CONGRESS, SCHOOLS, AND STATE AND 
  LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANT EDUCATIONAL 
   IMPLICATIONS OF DYSLEXIA THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED, AND DESIGNATING 
         OCTOBER 2017 AS ``NATIONAL DYSLEXIA AWARENESS MONTH''

  Mr. CASSIDY (for himself, Mr. Murphy, Ms. Warren, Mr. Graham, Mrs. 
Capito, Mr. King, and Mr. Boozman) submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 284

       Whereas dyslexia is--
       (1) defined as an unexpected difficulty in reading for an 
     individual who has the intelligence to be a much better 
     reader; and
       (2) most commonly caused by a difficulty in phonological 
     processing (the appreciation of the individual sounds of 
     spoken language), which affects the ability of an individual 
     to speak, read, and spell, and often, the ability to learn a 
     second language;
       Whereas dyslexia is the most common learning disability and 
     affects 80 percent to 90 percent of all individuals with a 
     learning disability;
       Whereas dyslexia is persistent and highly prevalent, 
     affecting as many as 1 out of 5 individuals;
       Whereas dyslexia is a paradox, in that an individual with 
     dyslexia may have both--
       (1) weaknesses in decoding that result in difficulties in 
     accurate or fluent word recognition; and
       (2) strengths in higher-level cognitive functions, such as 
     reasoning, critical thinking, concept formation, or problem 
     solving;
       Whereas great progress has been made in understanding 
     dyslexia on a scientific level, including the epidemiology 
     and cognitive and neurobiological bases of dyslexia; and
       Whereas early screening for and early diagnosis of dyslexia 
     are critical for ensuring individuals with dyslexia receive 
     focused, evidence-based intervention that leads to fluent 
     reading, promotion of self-awareness and self-empowerment, 
     and the provision of necessary accommodations that ensure 
     success in school and in life: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) calls on Congress, schools, and State and local 
     educational agencies to recognize that dyslexia has 
     significant educational implications that must be addressed; 
     and
       (2) designates October 2017 as ``National Dyslexia 
     Awareness Month''.
