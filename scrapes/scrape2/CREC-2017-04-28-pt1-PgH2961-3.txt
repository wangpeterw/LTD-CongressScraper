                           THE FIRST 100 DAYS

  (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks 100 days of the Trump 
administration. So let's take a look.
  What does that 100 days mean? It means hundreds of vacancies still 
left in important agencies like State and Defense, hundreds of hours 
wasted on meaningless executive orders, hundreds of miles flown back 
and forth to Mar-a-Lago to play golf, hundreds of educational and 
cultural programs on the chopping block, hundreds of acres of public 
lands under threat, and hundreds of programs that benefit millionaires 
while causing hundreds and thousands of seniors to worry about losing 
Meals on Wheels, working families losing their health care, DREAMers 
losing their protection, women losing Planned Parenthood, and ordinary 
folks losing money out of their pocket to pay higher tax bills because 
of the new proposal.
  That is not much of a record, if you ask me. But what it also means 
is there are hundreds and thousands of voices rising up saying: We will 
resist, and we will persist.
