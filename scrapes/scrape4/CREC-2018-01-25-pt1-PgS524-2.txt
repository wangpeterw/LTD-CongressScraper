SENATE RESOLUTION 382--SUPPORTING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS

  Mr. DONNELLY (for himself, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Rubio, and Mr. Casey) 
submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 382

       Whereas Catholic schools in the United States are 
     internationally acclaimed for their academic excellence and 
     provide students with more than an exceptional scholastic 
     education;
       Whereas Catholic schools instill a broad, values-added 
     education emphasizing the lifelong development of moral, 
     intellectual, physical, and social values in young people in 
     the United States;
       Whereas Catholic schools serve the Nation by providing a 
     diverse student population from all regions of the country 
     and all socioeconomic backgrounds a strong academic and moral 
     foundation, including 41.4 percent of students from racial 
     and ethnic minority backgrounds and 19 percent from non-
     Catholic families;
       Whereas Catholic schools are an affordable option for 
     parents, particularly in underserved urban areas;
       Whereas Catholic schools produce students strongly 
     dedicated to their faith, values, families, and communities 
     by providing an intellectually stimulating environment rich 
     in spiritual, character, and moral development;
       Whereas Catholic schools are committed to community 
     service, producing graduates who hold ``helping others'' 
     among their core values;
       Whereas the total Catholic school student enrollment for 
     the 2017-2018 academic year is almost 1,900,000 and the 
     student-teacher ratio is 12 to 1;
       Whereas the Catholic high school graduation rate is 99 
     percent, with 86 percent of graduates attending 4-year 
     colleges;
       Whereas in the 1972 pastoral message concerning Catholic 
     education, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops 
     stated, ``Education is one of the most important ways by 
     which the Church fulfills its commitment to the dignity of 
     the person and building of community. Community is central to 
     education ministry, both as a necessary condition and an 
     ardently desired goal. The educational efforts of the Church, 
     therefore, must be directed to forming persons-in-community; 
     for the education of the individual Christian is important 
     not only to his solitary destiny, but also the destinies of 
     the many communities in which he lives.'';

       Whereas the week of January 28, 2018, to February 3, 2018, 
     has been designated as National Catholic Schools Week by the 
     National Catholic Educational Association and the United 
     States Conference of Catholic Bishops, and January 31, 2018, 
     has been designated National Appreciation Day for Catholic 
     Schools;
       Whereas the National Catholic Schools Week was first 
     established in 1974 and has been celebrated annually for the 
     past 44 years;
       Whereas while Catholic schools must work hard to maintain 
     enrollment, the demand and enthusiasm for Catholic schools 
     remains strong;
       Whereas 30 percent of Catholic schools have waiting lists 
     for admission and new schools are opening across the country; 
     and
       Whereas the theme for National Catholic Schools Week 2018 
     is Catholic Schools: Learn. Serve. Lead. Succeed.: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) supports the goals of National Catholic Schools Week, 
     an event cosponsored by the National Catholic Educational 
     Association and the United States Conference of Catholic 
     Bishops and established to recognize the vital contributions 
     of the thousands of Catholic elementary and secondary schools 
     in the United States;
       (2) applauds the National Catholic Educational Association 
     and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops on their 
     selection of a theme that all can celebrate; and
       (3) supports the continued dedication of Catholic schools, 
     students, parents, and teachers across the United States 
     toward academic excellence, and supports the key role they 
     play in promoting and ensuring a brighter, stronger future 
     for the Nation.
