1718,topic-id,3192,"Mr.President, I want to talk for a moment about something that is on the minds of anybody in this country who is making $60,000, $70,000, $80,000, $90,000 too much to have a subsidy to pay for your healthcare insurance and maybe are paying $15,000, $20,000, $25,000 of that salary for your insurance this year and who has heard from a lot of people that on October 1, the insurance companies are going to announce that your premium is going up. That is whom I would like to talk with today.  Specifically, let me use the example of a woman named Marty in She came up to me before Christmas at the Chick-fil-A on Charlotte Road in Nashville, and she stopped me while I was getting my mac and cheese at Chick-fil-A, and she said: My name is I am a self-employed farmer. A few years ago, my health insurance was $300 a month, today it is $1,300 a month, and I cannot afford that.  Well, in Tennessee, prices for health insurance for people who work and don't get any subsidy to help them buy their insurance and don't get insurance on the job, they don't get it from Medicare or Medicaid, people who work, the self-employed farmer, the contractor, the plumber, the songwriter, somebody who might be making $60,000, say--they are like They are paying $20,000 for their health insurance, and they cannot afford that.  I told Marty: I think we have a Christmas present for you. I think Congress, when we pass the omnibus spending bill, is going to include in it a set of policies we have that is going to lower your rates when they are announced on October 1 of next year, which is 2018.  Well, unfortunately, we had a continuing resolution at the end of the year, and Marty didn't get her Christmas present. Then I thought she might get a Valentine's present, and we went by Valentine's Day and did another CR, a continuing resolution.  Now we have until the end of next week to fund the government for the year we are halfway through. I am on the floor today, and I can say to Marty and to every plumber, songwriter, self-employed person in this country, someone who might be between jobs, that if the Congress will act, we can lower their rates next year for up to as much as 40 percent--40 percent. That is according to Oliver Wyman, one of the leading healthcare consulting firms in this country, which announced on Monday that a set of policies which wecall Alexander-Murray-Collins-Nelson, which President Trump supports, which Congressman Walden, who is the chairman of the House committee in this area, supports, which Senator McConnell supports, which I support--we have broad support for this. This policy we have been working on for months, according to Oliver Wyman, over the next 3 years, assuming States take full advantage of all the options we are giving them, could lower rates by 40 percent.  What does that mean? That means that if you are paying $20,000 for your health insurance--you are that $60,000-a-year plumber--that is 40 percent of $20,000, which, by my math, is $8,000. So that would cut your insurance to $12,000, and you get down toward something you might be able to afford. Can you imagine anything more frightening than approaching next year knowing that you might not be able to afford health insurance for your family? You are thinking: Well, look, I am doing everything I am supposed to. The government has not gotten me on any kind of subsidy to buy health insurance. I am out here working. I am paying my taxes. Maybe I got a little tax cut that the Republicans put through last year, but the thing that is really a problem for me is my health insurance. If I am making $60,000, $70,000, $80,000 a year, I cannot afford $15,000, $20,000, or $25,000 a year.  If you are a farmer in Iowa or a miner in Alaska or a songwriter in Nashville, you can't afford that, and you shouldn't have to, and you won't have to if Congress will act next week to accept the set of policies that I am about to briefly describe.  There are three things we propose to do. The most important is 3 years of reinsurance or the invisible risk pool. This is an idea that House Republicans have strongly supported and that Senator Collins and Senator Nelson have strongly supported here. It would allow more States to do what the State of Alaska has done. The Presiding Officer is from Alaska took the very sickest people in Alaska and put them in one pool and called that the reinsurance pool and paid for their health insurance. When they did that, it so reduced the cost for everybody else that it lowered the rates for everybody else by 20 percent. What we are talking about is lowering the rate for everybody else by 40 percent if States take full advantage of what we are proposing next week. So reinsurance is the first thing--3 years of reinsurance at $10 billion a year.  The second thing is 3 years of cost-sharing subsidies. You have to stop and think about it a minute, but the cost-sharing subsidies pay for the reinsurance. Cost-sharing subsidies are payments that are made to insurance companies to pay for the copays and the deductibles for low-income people, and that allows the companies to reduce the premiums. When you reduce the premiums, you reduce the ObamaCare subsidies.  According to conversations we have had with the Congressional Budget Office, if we do 3 years of cost-sharing subsidies and 3 years of reinsurance at $10 billion, the cost-sharing subsidies more than pay for the reinsurance, if you base it on reality, which is, if Congress passes a law that costs $30 billion over 3 years for reinsurance and 3 years of cost-sharing subsidies, the cost-sharing subsidies pay for the reinsurance and leave $2 billion over to reduce the Federal debt.  The third part is a set of proposals that would give States more flexibility. This streamlines the section 1332 waiver in the Affordable Care It makes some changes that permit the agency we call CMS to approve waivers from States, like the State of Alaska or Nebraska or Tennessee, which may say: We would like to spend our ObamaCare subsidy money in a different way, and we would like to add some of this reinsurance money to it. By doing that, that is how you achieve the 40-percent savings for the Nebraska self-employed farmer or the Nashville songwriter in their insurance policies.  So that is the set of proposals, plus within there is a provision for what we call a catastrophic policy, which is a policy that has somewhat higher deductibles but lower premiums, which people may choose to buy.  All of that policy has broad bipartisan support. I think the reinsurance provision--in the Republican discussions we have had in the Senate, almost everybody seems to agree that the only way we can have an individual market, which is the market for people who buy insurance on their own--people who don't get it from Medicare, people who don't get it from Medicaid, people who don't get it on the job--let's say you are between jobs or you are self-employed. You are the songwriter. You are the plumber. Those are the people whom we are focused on here. There are about 11 million in the United States, but there could be a lot more because all of us know what it is like to think, well, I might lose my job, or, I might change jobs, and what do I do for insurance in the interim? I have the so-called COBRA available, but it is very expensive. If I suddenly find I am losing my job or if I am changing jobs and I am worrying about insurance--that is the person we are talking about.  Where did these ideas come from? Did we just write them on the back of an envelope and give them to Congress? We went through a very serious process here in the Senator Murray, the ranking Democrat on the Senate HELP Committee--I am the[[Page S1752]]chairman--and I held four hearings last fall after Republicans failed to repeal and replace the ObamaCare law. We invited all Senators to participate. We had more than half the Senate come to our hearings and to our meetings with the witnesses. Out of that came the proposals to streamline the 1332 waiver--that is flexibility for States--and the need to pay for the cost-sharing subsidies temporarily, because people began to understand that they don't cost money, but they save taxpayer money because they reduce the need for Federal taxpayer subsidies. So that is where that came from.  The single most important idea that was not a part of the original Alexander-Murray proposal was reinsurance. In the House, they call it the invisible risk pool. Senators Collins and Nelson have championed it here. Representative Costello, Representative Meadows, and other people championed it over there. It was part of the Republican repeal-and-replace legislation in the House of So the idea of 3 years of reinsurance really has come from both bodies and from both sides of the aisle. It is the most essential part of any long-term policy to create an individual market where people can buy insurance if they don't get it on the job or from the government.  This would give States half a billion dollars in the current year, 2018, to plan for their reinsurance pools. It would then create $10 billion over 3 years that States could use to help pay for their reinsurance pools, and they would use their 1332 streamlined waiver in the second and third year. So they could have a combination of State money, reinsurance Federal money, and ObamaCare subsidy money and hopefully, in that process, create their own way of helping to pay for the needs of the very sickest people in the State and, by taking them out of the insurance pool, lower the rates for everybody else over that 4-year period, according to the Oliver Wyman consulting firm, by as much as 40 percent.  The Congressional Budget Office has also reviewed the set of proposals I have just described. My staff has been working closely with them because we want to know what it costs if we are going to put it in the omnibus bill, and the preliminary feedback from the Congressional Budget Office is more conservative than the Oliver Wyman estimate. The Congressional Budget Office says that it would reduce premiums by an average of 10 percent in 2019 and 20 percent in 2020 and 2021 if States take full advantage of the 1332 waiver they have.  As you can imagine, State Governors and State insurance commissioners are delighted with this package. First, they like to see us do something in a bipartisan way to stabilize the health insurance market so people aren't scared to death that they may not be able to buy a policy next year, but second, they think it is sound policy. It is sound policy.  Much of this started when the President called me last August and said: Between now and the time we make a final decision on what to do about the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, I want to make sure that people aren't hurt. So he asked me if I would work with Senator Murray and see if we could come up with a bipartisan set of proposals that would stabilize the individual market. He called me several times about that, and we have worked together since then. That is when we came together with the original Alexander-Murray proposal.  Then we had a big disagreement here within the Senate, and we had our tax bill wherein we repealed the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Republicans thought that was a good idea. It made people buy insurance they didn't want, and it was a tax on low-income people, so we got rid of it. Democrats didn't like that at all.  It is true that taking the individual mandate out, even though States could add it back if they want to, does increase the cost of insurance in the individual market. Despite that, this set of policies that I have described--State flexibility, the 3 years of cost-sharing subsidies, and the 3 years of reinsurance/invisible risk pools--those three policies, according to Oliver Wyman consulting, which is one of the leading health consulting firms in America, could lower rates to 40 percent lower than they otherwise would be. According to the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency that looks at things for us, it will lower them 10 percent in 2019 and as much as 20 percent in the next 2 years after that. Even if it is only 20 and not 40, 20 percent of $20,000 is $4,000 for Marty, the self-employed farmer in Nashville who stopped me at Chick-fil-A and said her insurance had gone from $300 to $1,300, $1,400 a month.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the report of the Oliver Wyman consulting company that says that the combination of policies I just described--reinsurance, cost-sharing subsidies, and the section 1332 waiver, which is the State flexibility--that those three policies will reduce rates by up to 40 percent.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Oliver Wyman Report: A Proposal To Lower ACA Premiums by More Than 40%                        and Cover 3.2 Million More  (By Tammy Tomczyk, FSA, FCA, MAAA, Partner, Oliver Wyman Actuarial  Consulting, and Kurt Giesa, FSA, MAAA, Practice Leader, Oliver Wyman                          Actuarial Consulting)       In our December 9, 2017 article, we analyzed the effects of      a proposal the US Senate was considering to fund cost-sharing      reduction (CSR) payments and appropriate $5 billion in 2019      and 2020 for states to establish reinsurance programs to      stabilize their individual insurance markets. We discussed      how pass-through savings could provide reinsurance coverage      equal to roughly $15 billion in protection for high-cost      claimants, and how this protection, combined with CSR      funding, would bring more people into the individual market      and lower premiums by over 20 percent.       More recent congressional attention is focusing on a      proposal that includes an extension of CSRs and a reinsurance      program in 2019, 2020, and 2021, funded with a $10 billion      appropriation in each year, with federal fallback option      available to states in 2019. The federal fallback option      would likely be based on--and use the federal infrastructure      built to administer--the Transitional Reinsurance Program in      place from 2014 through 2016.       Our healthcare microsimulation model, used to understand      this package's likely effects on the market, assumed states      would use federal pass-through savings under Section 1332 of      the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to supplement and leverage the      $10 billion the considered legislation would authorize and      appropriate each year. Pass-through savings result from the      fact that the premium subsidies available under the ACA cover      the difference between the second lowest cost silver plan      available in a rating area and a fixed percentage of a      household's income, varying only by federal poverty level      (FPL). Lower premiums result directly in lower premium      subsidies, and under a Section 1332 waiver, these savings      from lower premiums may be used to provide additional      reinsurance.       In our modeling, we are presuming that states will take      advantage of these pass-through savings in 2019. In reality,      states that have not already begun working on a waiver will      be challenged to get a 1332 waiver filed and approved under      the current regulatory regime in time to impact 2019      premiums. The current regulatory regime includes a      requirement that a state enact enabling legislation, develop      an application, hold public hearings during a 30-day public      comment period, and submit the application to the US Health      and Human Services (HHS). HHS then undertakes a two-step      review process that can span up to 225 days--up to 45 days      for a completeness determination followed by up to 180 days      for review. But even those states unable to get a waiver in      place for 2019 would still benefit from that year's federal      fallback program.       Therefore, we estimate, under the assumptions described      above, that an additional 3.2 million people will be covered      in the non-group market, and the proposal would result in      premiums that are at least 40 percent lower than they would      have been without the proposal in place, across all metal      levels. In those states that are not able to obtain a 1332      waiver and take advantage of pass-through savings for 2019,      we estimate that premium would decline by more than 20      percent across all metal levels. Those estimates include an      average 10 percent reduction due to the funding of CSRs, with      the remaining reduction coming from the reinsurance program.       As a note, our modeling reflects elimination of the mandate      penalty, but does not consider the proposed regulation's      likely effects on association health plans or on short-term,      limited duration coverage.                                  ____    Report: Individual Insurance Premiums Next Year 40% Lower Under      Alexander-Murray, Collins-Nelson Than if Congress Doesn't Act       Washington, March 12.--Health care experts at Oliver Wyman      released an analysis today showing that the passage of a      proposal based on the Alexander-Murray Bipartisan Health Care      Stabilization Act and the Collins-Nelson Lower Premiums      Through Reinsurance Act will lower premiums, compared to what      people in the individual market will pay if Congress doesn't      act, by more than 40[[Page S1753]]     percent in the individual market and provide insurance      coverage to an additional 3.2 million individuals.       Oliver Wyman based its analysis on a proposal that would      fund CSRs--temporary payments to reduce out-of-pocket costs      for low-income Americans in the individual market--and      provide $10 billion annually for invisible risk pool/     reinsurance funding in 2019, 2020, and 2021. It also factored      in increased flexibility for states that seek to use waivers      under Section 1332 of the Affordable Care The analysis      applies to ACA-compliant plans in the individual market, both      on and off the exchange.       ``This analysis from the experts at Oliver Wyman further      demonstrates that our bipartisan proposals will help drive      down premiums in the individual market and make health      insurance more affordable for millions of Americans,'' said      Senators Lamar Alexander, the Chairman of the HELP Committee,      and Susan       From the experts at Oliver Wyman:       ``Therefore, we estimate . . . that an additional 3.2      million people will be covered in the non-group market, and      the proposal would result in remiums that are at least 40      percent lower than they would have been without the proposal      in place . . .''       The analysis found that the lower rates would benefit all      plan levels on the exchanges.

1719,topic-id,700,"Finally, I would ask the question, What if we don't do this? I am generally a very optimistic person. I am results-oriented, and you don't get results if you don't work across party lines and if you don't think you are going to succeed. So I always think we will succeed. This has been more difficult to do than it should have been.  I would like to suggest to my colleagues and to the American people that we should focus on October 1 of this year because that is the date when insurance rates for next year, 2019, will be announced all across the country. Insurance companies are working with insurance commissioners in every State to try to figure out what is going to happen, what the rates will be. They will be announcing rates on October 1, which is about a month before the next election.  There a lot of people who are going to be looking at that because, in my State of Tennessee, rates were up 58 percent this year, and that is for the plumber who makes $60,000 a year; the songwriter; Marty, the farmer; and the people I have been describing. There was a 58-percent increase. So they are going to be looking on October 1 to see whether they can even afford any insurance in 2019.  If we do what we are proposing here in the Alexander-Murray-Collins-Nelson set of policies, which has broad bipartisan support in the House and the Senate and the support of the President, if we do that next week, Marty, the self-employed farmer in Tennessee, will be able to see on October 1 that her rates will go down and that, if Oliver Wyman is correct, instead of her rates going up 58 percent the way they did this year, they will go down 40 percent over the next 2 or 3 years. That means she could afford insurance.  If we don't do it, rates will go up, and the individual market will probably collapse. It was near collapse a year ago. By collapsing, I mean there will be counties where people can't buy insurance at all. There will be 11 million people who are between jobs, who are self-employed, or who are working who literally cannot afford insurance, and they are not going to be very happy campers. They are going to blame every one of us, and they should. They are going to blame the President, they are going to blame Republicans, they are going to blame Democrats, and they are going to blame insurance companies because we have an opportunity next week to solve that problem in a bipartisan way, developed through a bipartisan process, incorporating ideas that virtually everyone who looks at them says make very good policy sense.  We have a couple of things to work through on ancillary issues, but those shouldn't cloud the fact that we can reduce rates by up to 40 percent for the working Americans who can't afford insurance--the insurance companies will announce that on October 1--or we can do nothing, and we can let the markets falter.  There will be some counties where you can't buy insurance at all, some counties where you can't afford insurance at all, and we will have people look at us and say: My goodness, why did we send them up there to do nothing about that?  I am optimistic. I think we can do it. I appreciate the hard work on both sides of the aisle. In many respects, it has been a very difficult negotiation. I appreciate the President's consistency over the past couple of months in supporting this and the Vice President's work. Senator McConnell has been very supportive of this, which makes it very helpful in terms of getting it into the bipartisan agreement next week.  I look forward to being able to say to my songwriters, self-employed business men and women, plumbers, and Marty, the farmer, that if they are making $60,000 or $70,000 in Tennessee, we put in place something that will lower their rates by 40 percent over the next 3 years.

When I had the opportunity to speak with Rusty Moses about the success of his family business, he told me that his employees are hardworking, honest, law-abiding people, but high taxes and complex laws continued to stifle their income. Mr.Moses promised his employees that if the tax laws were changed, they would share in the business tax savings through performance bonuses and salary increases. Thanks to tax reform, this promise has become a reality.  Georgia Tire Company has seen an increase in take-home pay, and it plans to issue employee bonuses at the end of this fiscal year.  There are so many family businesses like Georgia Tire Company that are truly the lifeblood of our communities. Before tax reform, these businesses were struggling to make ends meet and unable to provide their employees with well-earned benefits.  Don't just take my word for it. There are more than 4 million Americans who have already seen the positive impacts of tax reform, just like at this tire company.

You see, Mr.Speaker, they believe, like a lot of us do, that all life is a gift from God and deserves their constitutional right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But now these pro-life pregnancy centers in California are being forced by law to advertise in a way that goes directly against their mission and, more importantly, their conscience.  The State of California mandates that these pregnancy centers disclose how patients can obtain a State-sponsored abortion. California, in my opinion, is abusing the power of the State to force people to post messages they do not believe in and which violate their conscience.  Government coercion of speech or conduct that violates the religious conscience of an individual is in direct violation of the First The Founders intentionally listed the right to freely express our religious beliefs first because they recognized the vital role faith in God plays in cultivating a moral foundation necessary for this democratic society.  While this inherent right to religious expression is being undermined, the Constitution could not be clearer on this question. I am confident the Supreme Court will uphold this sacred right against the heavy hand of government coercion.  ",CREC-2018-03-14-pt1-PgH1588-6.txt,2350,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2018.0,14.0,January

1009,topic-id,333,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.5131, the Surface Transportation Security Improvement Act of 2018, as amended.  As you may be aware, TSA was created in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11. While the impetus behind its creation was the threat to aviation security, TSA is responsible for securing all transportation modes, including surface transportation assets such as railroads, mass transit, pipelines, buses, and ports. Given the persistent threats facing aviation in the post-9/11 era, TSA's main focus has been securing the aviation sector. However, in recent years, threats emanating against surface transportation modes, especially mass transit hubs, have steadily increased.  Attacks against these surface targets often require less sophistication than attacks against aviation, making them especially attractive to lone wolves or homegrown violent extremists.  Surface transportation systems are also a very attractive target due to their large volume of daily ridership and open infrastructure. The most recent example of an attack targeting surface is the attempted suicide bombing in December 2017 at New York City's Port Authority Bus  Given the current threat environment, a review of TSA's approach to securing all transportation modes and an assessment of the degree to which surface transportation security should be prioritized is certainly warranted. Specifically, this bill mandates a GAO review of the national strategy for transportation security, the development of risk-based priorities for all[[Page H1671]]transportation modes, and a feasibility assessment of utilizing security technologies for surface transportation assets.  Furthermore, the bill requires TSA to disseminate best practices for enhancing security against vehicle-based terrorist attacks and authorizes a surface-focused Innovation Task  Finally, the bill requires a threat assessment of certain security technologies tied to foreign countries and a strategy for TSA's surface transportation inspectors.

2013,topic-id,531,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.5079, the DHS Field Engagement Accountability The sharing of counterterrorism and other homeland security information with State and local officials is vital in our efforts to protect the homeland.  Fusion centers as hubs for information sharing and analysis play a critical role in the domestic homeland security information-sharing environment. Over the years, there have been vast improvements in DHS' support for these key stakeholders, including the Nebraska Information Analysis Center, known as NIAC, in my home State of  H.5079, the DHS Field Engagement Accountability Act, builds on ongoing efforts to hold DHS more accountable for supporting fusion centers and fully utilizing them as a resource to the Federal  First, it requires DHS to develop a strategy for engagement with fusion centers. With the maturation of the national network, many fusion centers have adopted an all-threats, all-hazards mission to ensure they are keeping pace with the changing threat environment. A strategy that incorporates all the components of the Department will ensure DHS is supporting and leveraging fusion centers effectively and efficiently.  Second, this bill mandates performance metrics to hold DHS personnel in the field accountable. Among other responsibilities, these personnel serve as ambassadors of the Department and are integral in shaping and strengthening the relationship between fusion centers and As such, the Department must have appropriate performance objectives and metrics in place to ensure greater transparency in the expectations of these officers and accountability when issues arise.  Finally, this bill requires additional training and improvements for both the classified and unclassified information-sharing systems that the Department makes available to fusion centers and other law enforcement agencies.  While DHS has made strides in facilitating fusion center access to information and information systems, there are gaps in the Department's efforts to ensure these partners are adequately trained to utilize these systems.  So, for example, while all fusion centers now have access to DHS' classified HSDN, many fusion center personnel are not proficient in this system, and DHS does not currently provide any standardized, in-person HSDN training. Granting the appropriate clearances and credentials to access DHS systems is just as important as ensuring competency when using these systems.  Additionally, I have learned that many DHS components do not routinely share analytic products on the Homeland Security Information Network-Intelligence portal, and many documents are not posted on a timely basis.                              {time}  1645  It is incumbent on the Department to ensure the appropriate policies and metrics are in place to incentivize component use of this critical information-sharing program.  In that regard, I am pleased to report that, as of this month, both the Federal Protective Service and the United States Coast Guard have started participating on the HSIN-Intel Partner Products page. I encourage other components of the Department that do not participate to follow suit. This is a commonsense bill with bipartisan support that will enhance DHS' relationship with State and local fusion centers across the country.  In short, we have learned many lessons this past year in analyzing and studying fusion centers. This bill fixes the multiple problems that we have encountered.

2020,topic-id,438,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.5089, the Strengthening Local Transportation Security Capabilities Act of 2018.  As evidenced by recent attacks in New York, London, and elsewhere around the world, the threat against surface transportation is real and unwavering. While the Department of Homeland Security, the Transportation Security Administration, and other Federal entities have made significant progress in providing support to State and local surface transportation assets, the current threat environment necessitates a coordinated approach.  Intelligence sharing is the backbone of informed, risk-based security, yet the top-down dissemination of this information is often stymied by bureaucracy and classification barriers.  This begs the question: How effective is intelligence collection and analysis if it does not reach the front line and inform subsequent decisionmaking?  H.5089, the Strengthening Local Transportation Security Capabilities Act of 2018, requires the DHS Secretary to prioritize the assignment of officers and intelligence analysts and, as appropriate, the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis--or I&A--to fusion centers in jurisdictions with high-risk surface transportation assets.  High-risk surface transportation assets transport millions of people and commodities daily and are critical for the vitality of the American economy. This legislation will streamline and enhance the intelligence-sharing process so these high-risk systems are better prepared to be resilient against emerging threats.  A common complaint from owners, operators, law enforcement, and first responders is that the TSA, and the Federal Government in general, does not provide sufficient information for them to adequately prepare for threats. This is primarily due to issues surrounding classification, where key personnel at the State and local levels do not have access to pertinent security information.  As such, this bill requires the Secretary to make security clearances available to appropriate stakeholders, thereby making important and relevant threat information more accessible to the people who are heavily involved in the day-to-day security operations of surface transportation systems.  H.5089 also requires the TSA Administrator to share with owners and operators a framework for unified operation centers to ensure robust response to security incidents.  Recent terror attacks and plots illustrate the challenges of effective coordination in a ``system of systems.'' This bill will streamline coordination efforts between Federal, State, and local entities to bring the right information to the right people.  The interconnected, diverse, and readily accessible nature of surface transportation systems creates unique security challenges that are best addressed by communication, coordination, and collaboration.  H.5089 will create a structural framework to connect the Department of Homeland Security, the Transportation Security Administration, and surface transportation stakeholders, and it will facilitate timely information sharing.

2021,topic-id,456,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill, H.5089, the Strengthening Local Transportation Security Capabilities Act of 2018.  Mr.Speaker, in 2013, my home airport, Los Angeles International Airport, came under attack when a gunman opened fire at a TSA security checkpoint, killing TSA Officer Gerardo Hernandez and injuring many others.                              {time}  1715  This shooting was just one of several recent attacks on relatively soft targets such as public airport areas and surface transportation systems.  In the wake of the shooting at LAX, Congress passed the Gerardo Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2015, which made several important security improvements, including directing airports in high-risk surface transportation systems to install incident response plans and requiring TSA to provide active-shooter training to all of its screening personnel. Now, over 2 years later, it is time to take the next step in improving security for these soft targets. Enactment of my bill, H.5089, is that next step. H.5089 is focused on enhancing the capabilities of local transportation security stakeholders to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks and other serious incidents.  State and local stakeholders, including transit system owners and operators and law enforcement agencies, play a significant role in securing surface transportation systems against threats; yet many stakeholders cite a lack of sufficient information from TSA and the Federal Government to adequately prepare for these threats.  The Strengthening Local Transportation Security Capabilities Act of 2018 requires DHS to prioritize the assignment of officers and intelligence analysts to fusion centers in jurisdictions with a high-risk surface transportation asset, thus improving information sharing.  Further, it directs TSA to make a framework available to stakeholders for establishing operation centers responsible for overseeing daily operations of transportation facilities, allowing for improved communications.  Finally, it authorizes DHS to develop a training program through the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers to enhance the capabilities of law enforcement agencies operating at surface transportation assets.  Taken together, the provisions build upon previous efforts to secure our transportation systems by enhancing protection, preparedness, and response capabilities of State and local partners working to protect these critical systems.  Mr.Speaker, the shooting at LAX, along with attacks on surface transportation systems and public airport areas in New Orleans, Fort Lauderdale, New York City, and overseas have proven that acts of terror are not limited to the aviation sector. To effectively address threats to surface transportation systems, State and local stakeholders must be able to communicate not only with TSA and the Federal Government, but amongst themselves during an incident. My bill seeks to bridge potential gaps in communication and coordination capabilities.  Mr.Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.5089, and I yield back the balance of my time.

675,topic-id,691,"Madam President, when we were debating the tax relief law at the end of last year, it was a very familiar debate in many ways.  Republicans came to the floor with facts and figures on how much extra money people were going to see in their pockets and their paychecks. Democrats came to the floor with the same old tired line that you always hear them talk about--the millionaires and billionaires.  Republicans pointed out economic studies that showed that workers right now pay more than 70 percent of the cost of corporate taxes. We talked about a study by the Tax Foundation that predicted that if we passed the tax relief bill, the average family would actually see a gain of about $2,600 a year in their after-tax income. It was partly because of getting the tax cut and partly because their employers would then pass on much of the tax cut in higher wages. Democrats didn't believe it. They said that only rich people would benefit and that businesses would never share their tax savings with the workers. The Democratic leader said that ``tax cuts like these benefit the wealthy and the powerful to the exclusion of the middle class.''  Here we are. It is the month after we passed the tax relief bill, the tax reduction bill, and the tax simplification bill, and the question is, Who was right? The very day the tax bill passed in Congress, AT&T came out and said it was giving its workers a bonus. It said that 200,000 hard-working employees were going to get an extra $1,000 each directly because of the new tax relief, tax reduction, tax cut bill. The Tax Foundation predicted that they would eventually get an extra $2,600, and these people are already getting $1,000 each on day one.  That has opened the floodgates to other companies doing the exact same thing and employees around the country experiencing the exact same thing. Businesses started sharing the tax savings with rank-and-file, middle-class workers, and it started on day one--not just the wealthy and the powerful, as Senator Schumer has predicted. Over 120 companies have said they are raising wages, giving out bonuses, and investing in their workers because of the tax law. It adds up to over $980 million--$980 million in the pockets of hard-working men and women around the country. How many people are seeing that? By last count, almost 1 million hard-working Americans--over 970,000 hard-working Americans have already gotten the good news.  There is more good news coming every day, with more announcements today. It is exactly what Republicans said would happen. It is happening for people who work at banks, who work at insurance companies, who work at airlines. It is happening for people who work at big companies, such as AT&T, Visa, and Comcast, but it is also happening for people who work at smaller companies, such as a winery in California and an aviation company in These are businesses and people in communities who are important parts of their communities and doing important jobs. The employees work hard, and now they are getting a share of the relief the Republicans had predicted they would get all along. And they are not just getting cash bonuses. There is a bank in Massachusetts called Berkshire Hills They announced last week that the people working there will be getting a $1,000 bonus and will also see the minimum wage raised to $15 an hour.  More is being invested in employee development and training programs. When you invest more in employee development and training programs, that means people are going to have additional skills that make them even more productive, better at their jobs, and qualify for even higher wages.  This bank in Massachusetts is also contributing an extra $2 million to its charitable efforts, including scholarships. That helps improve the communities where the workers live and where they raise their families.  Democrats said it is not going to happen. It has happened. It is happening every day. They said that businesses would keep the money for themselves. That is not what we are seeing all across the country.

809,topic-id,881,"Mr.President, when we were debating the tax relief law--the tax reduction law, the tax cut law--Republicans predicted that it would be very good for the people of our country. Democrats like Nancy Pelosi predicted that it would be ``Armageddon.'' She said it would be the ``end of the world.'' Well, that was just last month, and it is already very clear to me that we have won the argument. People across the country are seeing the benefits. Thanks to this Republican tax relief law, Nancy Pelosi is seeing that hard-working Americans have actually won as a result of this law being passed.  Businesses around the country have begun turning those tax cuts into higher wages for many workers. Almost every day there is another business announcement about bonuses of more than $1,000 for workers. We are seeing it for hundreds of thousands of workers at businesses all across the country. They are raising wages and also investing millions of dollars back into the workers who make the companies so productive for our country.  Democrats are just wrong about tax reform. I am hearing it at home as I visit with people and stop in the drugstore and the grocery store around the State of They are saying: Look, anybody who does the math sees that it is a good deal for them. It doubled the standard deduction, lowered the rates, and raised the child tax credit. All of these things have been very, very helpful, certainly, to people in my State of  It is interesting listening to Democrats because they think they have great ideas, and they are just proven wrong about the facts. One of the ones I want to talk about today is something that the Senator from Vermont has been talking about with regard to healthcare. He has essentially wanted to scrap the U.healthcare system and replace it with a government-run system.  As he said, the current system under ObamaCare is the most bureaucratic, inefficient, and expensive system in the world. He often points to a single-payer system--sort of what they have right now in Great Of course, who would be paying for that? That would be the American taxpayers dealing with the incredible expenses of a program like that.  I want to point out what is actually happening today in Great Britain, in the system that the Senator from Vermont--the father of an American single-payer plan, one that a number of Democrats have signed on to--where the authorities in Great Britain just told hospitals to cancel 50,000 operations in January and to put them off until next month because they are just too busy doing other things. So scheduled operations were canceled. Now, these are surgeries for things like cataracts, knee replacements, and hip replacements.  Facilities are turning away all but the most urgent cases in need of care. They are closing outpatient clinics. Why? Because it is winter, and it is flu season, and the British healthcare system, based on a single-payer, taxpayer-run system, is not prepared to deal with the needs of the people of that country.  So hospitals across the country of Great Britain have canceled surgeries that have been planned and for which people had decided to take off time from work to have done according to their schedules. Forget it; they have been delayed.  One doctor in England actually said that they are seeing, in his words, ``third-world conditions''--third world conditions, describing the British healthcare system today. This was an[[Page S32]]Army doctor who did three tours at a field hospital in Afghanistan, somebody who knows what third-world conditions are truly like.  An article in the British newspaper the Guardian, out yesterday, said: ``Hospitals are reporting growing chaos''--growing chaos--``with a spike in winter flu leaving frail patients facing 12-hour waits, and some units are running out of corridor space''--corridor space.  Now, that is what the situation is like in British hospitals right now, today. It turns out it happened before in Great Last winter, they had a similar problem with too many sick people and not enough options for care. Back then, the British Red Cross called the situation a ``humanitarian crisis.''  In today's New York Times--this morning's edition, page 9--talking about the British healthcare system and the problems with it, the chief executive of the National Health Service in England, Simon Stevens, in a speech to Parliament, recently said: ``The N.H.waiting list will grow to five million people'' coming down the line--grow to 5 million people. How would the American people like to be one of 5 million people waiting to get an appointment, waiting for an operation, in the waiting line? That is what Senator Sanders and the Democrats who propose this government-run system are talking about for our country.  The scenes unfolding across hospitals in Britain--and I will describe one that is outline and written about today in the New York It says:       Tuesday night, the emergency ward at Kingston Hospital in      southwestern London looked more like an airport lounge than a      hospital, with patients sprawled out in the waiting room.       ``There's no real system or order; it's a jungle in here,''      said Nancy Harper, who had accompanied her 87-year-old      grandmother, who was lying down and complaining of      excruciating pain in her lower back.       ``It's been more than five hours,'' ",CREC-2018-01-04-pt1-PgS29-2.txt,1881,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4545, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS",2018.0,4.0,March

1076,topic-id,1380,"Mr.President, this week we are debating an important piece of legislation that is going to streamline and simplify government regulations. We are going to make it easier and cheaper for families to get access to loans from their local banks. This legislation is good for communities, and it is good for the American economy.  This is just the latest action we have taken in Congress over the past year to help give the American economy a boost. The economy is responding, and the American people are doing better because of it.  Here is a headline from the New York Times on Friday: ``The Economy is Looking Awfully Strong.'' That is the headline in the New York Times--``The Economy is Looking Awfully Strong.'' This article was about the jobs report that came out last week. It said that the report ``can be summed up in four words: The economy is humming.''  The U.economy has already created over 552,000 new jobs in just the first 2 months of this year--over half a million new jobs in the first 2 months of this year. There are half a million more people working today compared to when Republicans passed this tax relief law. If we want to go back a little, there are more than 3 million new jobs since President Trump was elected in November of 2016. That is a real number to look at. That is the moment when people said they had enough of slow-growth policies from the Democrats in Washington and elected Donald Trump That is the moment when businesses realized things were going to be different with Republicans in charge.  More people are working now. And do you know what else? They are being paid more. According to the Commerce Department, the take-home pay of working people in America increased by $40 billion in They say it is directly because of the tax relief law that Republicans passed last  More than 4 million workers are also getting a bonus or a pay increase. Four hundred companies have said that is because taxes went down. They are sharing the savings with their workers. These are people who work at Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, Starbucks, and other businesses that have familiar names all across They are also people who work in smaller businesses, like the Jonah Bank in Wyoming, at branches in Casper and in It is not a nationally known bank, but it is very important in our State and in our communities. Some people who are getting bonuses work at places like Taco John's. That is another business that is important to the people of When I was in the State senate, Taco John's was a place I went regularly to eat lunch. It is one of many Taco John's facilities around the State of Wyoming and around the Republicans cut taxes, and working Americans are seeing more money in their paychecks as a result.  This is what we see in terms of confidence. This new survey came out recently where they talked with the heads of midsized companies all around America, and this is what they say: 89 percent of the business leaders are confident in the U.economy and the economy's prospects for the year. U.economic confidence soars--in 2016, 39 percent; in 2017, 80 percent; and in 2018, now 89 percent. The American people realize we have now beaten back 8 years of bad policies from Democrats in As soon as President Trump took office, we saw confidence soar, and I don't know that it has ever been higher.  Americans are feeling better about the U.economy. They are also feeling better about their own personal situations. That is the key--people's own personal situations. That is certainly the case in my home State of  The polling company Gallup looked at overall economic confidence State by They found that Wyoming is the most confident State in the country when it comes to America's economy. Attitudes about the economy turned positive immediately after Donald Trump was elected President in 2016. You could feel it. You could feel the confidence. You could feel the optimism. You could feel the positiveness in the people of People living in 43 out of the 50 States now have a positive view of the economy, and Wyoming, of course, is 1.  People I talk to at home--I was in Cody, WY, this past weekend, as well as in Sheridan and Riverton and Casper and around the State talking to people in various communities. The people I talked to about the economy will tell you it is because businesses are hiring again. People are doing better. They see their take-home pay going up. They see their taxes going down. They see that Republican policies are making their lives better. They see that Republican policies are also making the economy stronger. They see that Republican policies are making it easier for people to achieve their dreams and to enjoy their lives. It comes from tax relief. It comes from cutting regulations, as we are doing this week.  What are the Democrats offering? Well, last week, the Democratic leader came to the floor and said he wants to raise taxes by $1 trillion. That is what the leader of the Democratic Party said on the floor of the Senate last week. He wants to raise taxes by $1 trillion. Is he serious? A trillion dollars? Raising taxes? Taking away from people the tax cuts they have just started to enjoy?  More people have jobs. The economy is humming. The New York Times says the economy is humming. Ninety percent of working Americans have increases in their take-home pay. That is because of the tax cuts this body passed. Democrats want to reverse it all. That is what we hear on the floor of the They want to take back the money. They want to roll back the progress we have made. That is their plan--raise taxes. That is what we hear from the  Senator Schumer came to the floor of the Senate, and he said: ``There are much better uses for the money.'' That is what he said on the floor of the That is what the Washington Democrats always say. They have better uses for the money than the American people do. They have a better idea, they always say, about how to use somebody else's money. They want higher taxes. They want more Washington spending because they think they know best. They don't think the money should go to pay increases or bonuses for working Really? They think it should go to Washington? I think American families know how to spend their paychecks better than any Washington Democrat ever will.  Democrats say they want to use this $1 trillion in new taxes to pay for infrastructure. We all know that America's infrastructure--our roads, our bridges,[[Page S1717]]our dams, our waterways--are in desperate need of attention, but as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I can tell you that I am committed to improving this situation by working with the President and working on both sides of the aisle. If Democrats want to talk about a robust and fiscally responsible infrastructure plan that is going to help the American economy, then I am ready to have that conversation, but if all they want to do is talk about raising taxes on American families, they are wasting their breath.  There is a very big difference between Republicans and Democrats in Congress: Republicans want the American people to keep more of their hard-earned money. Democrats want Washington to take more of people's money. Republicans want new policies that grow the economy, create jobs, and inspire confidence in a brighter future. Democrats want the same old tax-and-spend policies that have failed for years. Their policies have led to slow growth, stagnant wages, and a terrible lack of confidence in our economy.  Republicans promised that our ideas will do better, and the results from the tax cuts and the tax relief speak for themselves. The economy is strong. Confidence is off the charts.  The American people deserve this chance to have a brighter future. That is what Republicans are offering, and that is also what Republicans are delivering.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

I also thank Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Cedric Richmond for allowing us to come tonight.  Mr.Speaker, I join my colleagues in coming to the floor tonight to mark the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Reverend Martin Luther We have made progress in these past 50 years, but the legacy and example of King show us that much remains to be done.  Although many marches and protests were met with violence, we had King and the women and men who stood with him, like our very own colleague and Congressional Black Caucus member, Congressman John  As I listened to Congressman Lewis tonight--as I sit on this House floor and have the privilege and honor to call him a colleague and a friend--it reminded me of his courage and how much more work we have to do.  It was through these peaceful protests, it was through their courage, it was through the power of the messages that they sent that they stood up against the establishment.  King was able to bring the injustices felt by African Americans nationwide to the forefront of American politics. His work culminated in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where hundreds of thousands of individuals of all stripes and communities came for a call to justice and equality for all.[[Page H16]]  It was on that day, August 28, 1963, when King gave one of his most powerful and famous speeches, that passionate speech, ``I Have a Dream,'' calling for the end of racism and the expansion of civil rights and economic rights.  I am so proud that Mother Beatty's mother, my husband's grandmother, was an invited platform guest to witness that speech. We have that picture in our office to remind us and to remind our children and grandchildren of the power of Martin Luther King and Congressman John  With the emotions and the will of the march that it encapsulated in such powerful words, civil rights rose to the top of the agenda of reformers and facilitated the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Still, Mr.Speaker, King's work was not done.  The next year, King helped to lead the Selma to Montgomery march. How proud I am that I was able to participate in the reenactment of that on its 50th anniversary. The march route spanned some 54 miles, from Selma, Alabama, to the State capital in  The marchers were in response to the Southern States' legislatures passing and maintaining discriminatory laws and practices over decades where it meant to deny, Mr.Speaker, African Americans across the State, across the South, the right to vote.  What is our message? What is our message tonight?  We are here because we are still walking in it. We are still fighting for civil rights and voting rights and economic rights. We are still fighting for equal pay for equal work.  But we are not afraid. Mr.Lewis led us on this House floor in fighting for gun safety. We are not afraid because we are continuing the legacy of Martin Luther  Lastly, let me just say that we must break this cycle of economic inequality, racism, and poverty. We must stand up to the GOP and to President Trump, because when we look at this tax reform bill, it brings those injustices to economics and equality, a financial gain.  So we are here tonight to say there is still a dream. There is still a stone of hope.

2070,topic-id,667,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  Mr.Speaker, this motion to recommit is simple and should be able to garner the support of every Member of this body who seeks to enhance our robust public and private markets while, at the same time, ensuring there are adequate safeguards in place for the benefit of Main Street investors.  Specifically, this motion will accomplish two simple things: one, it will strike the increase in the offering limit to $75 million; and, two, it will require the SEC to review and revise their bad actor disqualification regulations prior to future increases in the offering threshold.  Unfortunately, as currently written, with all due respect to my Republican colleagues, raising the offering threshold is a solution in search of a problem. Congress designated the SEC with regulating the offering. Congress decided the SEC would administer the offering. The SEC is the expert on Regulation A+, and it should be the one to raise the offering threshold, assuming the data supports such an increase.  Under the law, the SEC will be reporting to Congress whether or not they will raise the threshold just next month. This bill is premature, and for the lawyers in the room, it is not ripe for review. So why wouldn't we wait?  Right now there is zero data to suggest Congress needs to raise the threshold, and it seems prudent to wait until next month to see what the SEC has to say before rushing to increase it.  The majority argues this bill will allow companies to raise more money. I say this bill is a solution in search of a problem because only less than a handful of companies have ever actually raised the current maximum amount of $50 million.  With regard to updating the bad actor disqualification regulation, Bloomberg recently published an article on Regulation A+ and the companies using the offering and found one executive of a company was convicted for filing false tax returns, another for obstructing justice, and another was accused of selling unregistered stock. For the sake of time, these are just a few examples. Are these really the types of individuals we want selling securities to Main Street mom-and-pop investors?  Another article, appearing in Barron's, studied the hundreds of companies that have used Regulation A+ to raise funds, and I quote them: ``We were supposed to get new jobs and new industries. Instead, we've gotten GoFundMe-style websites hawking penny stocks and professional wrestlers shilling shares on TV.''  They went on to highlight some of the companies and the products availing themselves of the lightly regulated Regulation A+ offering, which included companies trying to make cannabis paraphernalia, flying cars, guns, and my personal favorite, the founder of a rock band seeking to raise money to study UFOs and light-speed travel.  Now, I am not trying to persuade Members that all companies seeking to raise money through Regulation A+ are Wolf of Wall Street or UFO chasers, because back in my home district, a Scottish-based company successfully used Regulation A+ to open their first brewery and restaurant in the United That example is exactly what Congress had in mind when it called for the creation of Regulation A+, and it is precisely the type of opportunity for investors that the law was intended to create.                              {time}  1515  This is why we need to ensure that we maintain the integrity of the Regulation A+ offering and that we prevent bad actors from using it in a way to rip off and scam all of our constituents.

The reality of our warming atmosphere, oceans, and continents has been established in thousands of peer-reviewed articles. This is scientific fact accepted by the governments of peoples of almost every nation in the world.  But science is always evolving, and scientists continue to work diligently to discover the facts, the processes, and the implications for all of us. Mostly, what we learn is sad and destructive.  Last Thursday, the peer-reviewed academic journal Science published a new study that concludes the frequency of coral bleaching has increased so much that reefs cannot recover between severe episodes.

What many people may not know is that a large number of these fatalities result not from instantaneous trauma but, rather, from blood loss. From the moment a major injury occurs, the clock is ticking. Uncontrolled bleeding can kill us in as little as 5 to 10 minutes.  Bleeding is a preventable cause of death, and that is why the Stop the Bleed effort is such a valuable program. The American College of Surgeons, working in partnership with many other organizations, has now made this training easily available to Americans across this country.  I had the opportunity to participate in Stop the Bleed training myself, and as part of my course, I learned how to properly apply bandages and tourniquets. And do you know, what? It actually was kind of fun.  We should do everything possible to ensure that more accidents don't become tragedies.

932,topic-id,405,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman, my good friend John Katko, and also the ranking member, my good friend Filo Vela, and also the chairman, the full chairman of the committee, Mr.McCaul, for their great work. I really appreciate it.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.4561, Security Assessment Feasibility for Equipment Testing and Evaluation of Capabilities for Our Homeland, or the SAFE TECH My legislation seeks to strengthen the safety of international air travel.  Specifically, this bill provides an avenue for third-party testing of innovative technology screening capabilities to enhance airport security. The testing program authorized under this act shall include evaluating the performance of detecting explosives and other prohibited items. Additionally, the SAFE TECH Act will look into alternative testing for other factors, including, health and safety concerns, operator interference, human error, environmental dynamics, reliability, and interoperability.[[Page H38]]  The bill also assesses the feasibility of linking compatible security technology utilized by the United States and international allies in order to augment screening checkpoints. The coordinated collaboration is an essential element of strengthening global security.  Currently, technical standards for safety and operating procedures at the international airports are set by international agreements. However, the standards in place are generally broad, leaving potential vulnerabilities through inconsistencies with international partners.  On a recent congressional delegation trip that I appreciated the chairman including me on to review screening procedures for inbound travel to the United States at major EU hubs, I was startled by the lack of consistency in international standards and gaps in technology that support precautionary measures to ensure passenger safety.  Today's bill--and I appreciate the work of the committee, and I thank you for making it an even stronger bill--will address this concern and improve the safety of our air travel for all passengers. I have always contended that, if we are not safe, nothing else matters.  The protection and security of our homeland and its citizens is our responsibility, Mr.Speaker, which is why I introduced the SAFE TECH We must ensure those entrusted with the care of our citizens have the best resources and technology available to combat the growing threat of terrorism.  Passage of this bill today makes air travel safer for everyone entering the United States and for our citizens, and it represents a step forward in ensuring the cooperation needed to improve global security.

9,topic-id,693,"Mr.Speaker, one of the phrases one often hears is, ``I hate to say I told you so.'' And it is delivered with a feigned sincerity, but usually people actually like to say, ``I told you so.''  I must confess that I have some of those feelings myself, as repeatedly during the few hours the Ways and Means Committee met, rushing through the massive tax cut, the largest transfer of wealth in our Nation's history, which will be paid for on the backs of our children and grandchildren with increased debt and benefiting people who in the main don't need it--I said at the time that each week after this bill passed, if it did, we would have a series of embarrassing stories about mistakes and oversight and special interest provisions that were stuck into it.  Well, actually, the fact is that that was somewhat understated because we are seeing, literally, every day people understand what was tucked in the bill: mistakes, oversight, and special interest provisions.  For example, there is a provision in the bill that was, we were told, designed to help small craft brewers. That is important to me and the people I represent, and there is broad support for minor provisions that would be able to help them by reducing their tax liability. But the provision that ended up in the final bill has massive opportunities to benefit large producers--a little bit for small craft brewers, but for large, international distillers, an opportunity to reconfigure how they do business to take advantage of multiple opportunities for that tax break.  There was an article yesterday talking about how the tax rate for American companies that manufacture overseas, the tax on that activity will be half as much as if they were manufacturing in the United States, providing an incentive to offshore jobs at a time when most of us would like to make sure that it is, here at home, at least, a level playing field, not to disadvantage people manufacturing here at home.  And, of course, there is another story in today's Wall Street Journal, ``Tax Law's Effect Fuels Farm Outcry,'' because there was a provision inserted in the bill that would give farmers a more lucrative deduction when they sell agricultural products directly to farm cooperatives. There is a story about one gentleman in there who felt that this could put him out of business. It is going to sting large agribusinesses like Cargill and Archer Daniels The new provision could reshape parts of the agriculture economy and sharply reduce many farmers' taxes as well as scrambling these individual businesses.  John Power, a North Dakota accountant who was the accountant for the small grain operator who is going to be hammered, said: ``It is kind of hard to imagine they intended to make farming tax free. Fixing it becomes difficult because they don't think it's something that can be fixed with regulation.''  There are a variety of these provisions that are a result of not following what we call ``regular order,'' without having hearings on the provision, of allowing lobbyists and staff to be able to draft the bill on the fly without having members of the committee--not just Democrats, but Republicans--fully know what was in it. That is legislative malpractice. It is one of the reasons why, despite giving over $3 trillion of tax cuts, the bill remains unpopular.  Americans are nervous about increasing our national debt over $2 trillion, and they know that the benefits for average citizens are going to go away in a few years and some are actually going to see tax increases, but the benefits for the top 1 percent and the largest corporations are permanent.  People know that it is not fair, that it is unnecessary, and that it is going to have more and more problems here, not just in States like mine where citizens are no longer going to be able to fully deduct their State and local taxes, property taxes, resulting in significant inequity, in scrambling property values, not just in Oregon, but it is across the country where people are going to be facing these problems.[[Page H86]]                            ____________________",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgH85-4.txt,99,SUPPORTING THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE OF IRAN TO FREE EXPRESSION,2018.0,10.0,March
392,topic-id,534,"Mr.Speaker, Friday, the Trump administration declared war on State legalization of marijuana as they come out on the wrong side of history and the American public.  The Obama administration recognized that the vast voter-driven movement to legalize marijuana at the State level was something that couldn't be stopped and, in fact, that the Federal Government shouldn't interfere. Their Justice Department issued guidance, known as the Cole amendment, that, as long as these voter-approved State legalization efforts were enforced rigorously and thoughtfully, the Federal Government wouldn't interfere with what the voters wanted.  Friday, Sessions and the Trump administration overruled that guidance and declared open war on the part of 93 U.attorneys to feel free to interfere with what local voters have decided.  This is strongly opposed by the American public. Over 60 percent in poll after poll show that Americans favor legalization of marijuana. When it deals with medical marijuana, that percentage is over 90 percent. We have seen State after State, approve medical marijuana including Florida, with a 71 percent ``yes'' vote in November of 2016.  If the question is, regardless of how you feel about marijuana, should the Federal Government interfere with what the voters have decided, three out of four voters say the Federal Government should keep their hands off it.  Luckily, at least as far as medical marijuana is concerned, they are protected from interference by the Justice Department because of the amendment that I have authored with my friend Dana It is in the continuing resolution. It needs to be in any long-term funding bill. In fact, we should embrace an amendment by our colleague Tom McClintock from California, that would expand those protections to any State legal marijuana activity.  The Justice Department is not just on the wrong side of history and the American public, they are missing a chance to cure the damage caused by selective and cruel enforcement of marijuana laws. We are still arresting tens of thousands--mostly young men of color, especially African-American men--for something the majority of Americans now think should be legal.  We miss a chance to win the war against opioid death and addiction. In States that have medical marijuana--surprise--there are fewer pills prescribed. The longer the States have had medical marijuana, the lower the overdose deaths. In California, which has had medical marijuana the longest, there are a third fewer opioid deaths. We are missing an opportunity to build on that.  We are missing the opportunity to increase the hundreds of millions of dollars that are now going to the State tax coffers to deal with education and addiction and law enforcement through State legal efforts and away from the drug cartels and the black market. Indeed, if we clean up this mess, we will have billions of dollars to devote to public purposes and further undermine the strength of drug cartels that use the black market to fund their efforts.  It is past time that Congress steps up and fixes this mess.  The good news is this reckless action by the Trump administration and Jeff Sessions will accelerate the time that we support what State and local governments should do: rationalize our cannabis policy and stop this ineffective, failed prohibition.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgH21-4.txt,99,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2018.0,9.0,January

1212,topic-id,457,"Mr.Speaker, we find that areas that have acted, in the aftermath of gun violence, to increase protections for gun safety actually makes a difference. It is a lie that gun safety provisions make no difference; that, somehow, people who are intent on slaughter will not behave according to the law, they won't obey it; it will have no impact.  The evidence is that where actions are taken to reduce gun violence, to increase protections, to take guns away from people who shouldn't have them, gun violence is reduced.  In the aftermath of Sandy Hook, when this Congress was paralyzed, refused to allow a bipartisan legislation that would have increased universal background checks, for instance, the State of Connecticut acted. And over the years, they have enacted a series of provisions on gun safety that have resulted in reduced gun violence.  Indeed, the States with the fewest gun safety protections, some no protections at all, have the highest rates of gun violence.                              {time}  1215  We don't have to fall victim to that type of thinking.  The Council of the Great City Schools pointed out in their resolution that Americans are 25 times more likely to be killed with a gun than people in other developed countries. They reject the proposition that we have to be the only developed country that cannot protect our families from gun violence.  They recognize that there is no place to arm teachers in response. There is no evidence that having teachers packing heat would make any difference at all. What it would do is add another layer of uncertainty, and more guns in schools increases the likelihood that they will be used.  They categorically reject the arming of teachers, but say move forward, remove the ability of people to purchase high-capacity automatic weapons, tighten background checks, and make it easier to do research on gun violence--which this Congress has tried to make illegal.  Mr.Speaker, I am hopeful that we will not have the Republican leadership continue to deny us an opportunity to fully debate the proposals that are circulating on a bipartisan basis that would make a difference dealing with background checks, dealing with taking guns away from people who shouldn't have them; making sure that we are reducing the access to some of the most destructive military weapons that have no place circulating in society, that children not old enough, young men not old enough to buy a beer can buy an AK-47. That is wrong.  Mr.Speaker, I hope that people's hearts and minds will be touched by the eloquence that we have heard from these young people in Florida who have endured it, who have put pressure on the Florida Legislature to act. I hope we can do the same.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-19-pt1-PgH1656-2.txt,99,MICHIGAN PTA CENTENNIAL,2018.0,19.0,January

344,topic-id,1660,"Mr.Buchwald wrote a satirical list of tactics Republicans were using to keep Americans from focusing on the Watergate scandal. The list is eerily familiar. The tactics being employed by the Trump supporters today ring of those same tactics used in Buchwald suggests focusing on accusations made against prominent Democrats or individuals who had accused Richard Nixon of wrongdoing. He suggests attacking the media. He suggests saying: ``The Democrats are sore because they lost.'' He suggests deflecting blame to a ``bunch of eager kids''--perhaps sounding like the reference to ``coffee boys'' today--and saying that this investigation is ``bad for the dollar,'' much like bad for America abroad.  I am very confident--and I want to emphasize this point very emphatically--that the special counsel will be in no way distracted from his investigation and his team will be undeterred by these tactics. But the American people should not be distracted or deterred either and, equally important, the Judiciary Committee, the U.Senate, and the Congress as a whole has a duty here that is, in fact, vulnerable to that same distraction. We must persevere.  What our Republican colleagues are doing at this point is indicated by a recent New York Times article. The article describes President Trump's efforts to persuade congressional allies to drop their investigations, and it says:       Another Republican Senator said Mr.Trump had not urged him      to help bring the Russia inquiry to a halt. Instead, the      Senator said, the President nudged him to begin an      investigation into Hillary Clinton's connection with the      intelligence-gathering firm Fusion GPS, which produced a      dossier of allegations about Mr.Trump's ties to  The goal was to stop the investigation of Russian meddling, but the implication in the article is that the President knew he could achieve that goal as effectively, or at least more practically, by distracting from those investigations, diverting resources to other issues, and muddying the waters for the American people. That is the playbook from 1973 that is referenced by Art Buchwald in his 1973 column.  Here is the danger: Distractions are dangerous, and efforts to discredit law enforcement are equally perilous. Those efforts have included not only the urging for an investigation of Uranium One and Fusion GPS but also attacks on the integrity of some members of the FBI and the FBI as a whole and attacks on individual members of the special counsel's team, on the team as a whole, and on Robert Mueller himself. The effort plainly is to discredit the investigation before it reaches a potentially incriminating conclusion and to stop the investigation, but if not stop it, at least to demean its credibility before charges are brought.  It is standard operating procedure. We know as prosecutors. The distinguished Senator from Rhode Island and I served as U.attorneys and then attorneys general for our We know going into the courtroom that we can expect to be attacked and that our teams can be expected to be attacked. That is what defense lawyers do. That is what they do because they hope to demean and discredit and dismantle the credibility of prosecutors before the jury in the courtroom. Here, the courtroom is not a court of law but the court of public opinion. Our Republican friends have launched that preemptive strike, methodically and meticulously, just as the special counsel is engaging in his investigation methodically and meticulously.  Now, I referred to Republican colleagues, and I believe strongly and passionately that many, if not most, of our Republican colleagues share our zeal for the rule of law and for a just outcome to this investigation. The reason is very simple. The Russian attack on our democracy imperils not just this administration and not just one election. It imperils our democracy as a whole. The meddling in our elections was perhaps done to advance the Trump candidacy in 2016, but it can be used against the Trump candidacy in 2020. It can be used against another Republican candidate in that year. It could be used in 2018 against other candidates for Congress or for State election.  My Republican colleagues have been as eloquent as any of us in defining that threat because there is no doubt in the intelligence community that it is a threat, that the Russians did interfere, and that they sought to advance the Trump candidacy. Whether there was an impact and what the impact was may never be known, but the effort is clear. It involved a massive campaign of disinformation, propaganda, cyber attack, and other means. That is what the FBI learned was happening, not as a result of Christopher Steele but from sources within the Trump campaign, including George Papadopoulos, and from other intelligence sources, and that is what we must make sure is known to the American public. We must make sure that anyone who aided the Russians pays a price and that the Russians themselves pay a price, because if there is no price, it will be done with impunity again.  So there should be--and I believe there is--bipartisan apprehension about that threat to our Nation's security. That is the reason that the Judiciary Committee's investigation, along with the special counsel, is so important, because our purview includes obstruction of justice and the integrity of the Department of Any interference politically with the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling must be prevented in the future as well. Only the Judiciary Committee can frame and craft legislation that will help to protect the  Senator Whitehouse and I, and Senator Feinstein and others on the committee, will be proposing such legislation based on what we know so far. It is legislation that essentially protects the rule of law against such efforts to obstruct justice and politically interfere.  The intelligence community's conclusions about Russian meddling did not rely on the credibility of Glenn Simpson or Christopher The two guilty pleas and convictions that the special counsel has already secured do not rely on the credibility of Simpson or Without fear of contradiction, I can predict that additional convictions and indictments will be based on fact and law, not on the credibility of Simpson and The conclusions reached by Simpson, Steele, or anybody else are relevant only insofar as they are supported and backed and proved by facts and consistent with relevant law.  Now, in fact, as we know, Christopher Steele tried to blow the whistle on the He brought to the FBI's attention information that he thought was relevant to protecting the United States of America against Russian interference. As my colleague Senator Whitehouse has outlined in detail, the FBI already knew of it and courteously heard from Christopher Steele and later interviewed him.  The effort to undermine the credibility of the FBI by pointing to Christopher Steele completely misses the mark. In fact, I am deeply disappointed that the first major action by our Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee was aimed at someone who reported wrongdoing, not committed it, and it was done without any cooperation or even consultation with Democratic colleagues. It is really a betrayal of the spirit that I think should characterize this very serious investigation, because it should be bipartisan.  My hope is that these distractions, dangerous as they are, will, in fact, not divert either our committee or the special counsel. The pace of our committee's investigation--again, to be very blunt--has been shamefully slow. I hope that its pace will quicken and that it will intensify and that there will be hearings in public with witnesses under oath and subpoenas of documents. I have said it repeatedly. I hope we will use those tools because only by relying on our powers to investigate effectively and comprehensively will we protect the goals of upholding integrity and justice.  As for the special counsel and our law enforcement community, I think they should know that we support them and that we will protect the special counsel against political interference. That is why there is legislation I have proposed, along with my[[Page S100]]colleague Senator Whitehouse and others. It is bipartisan legislation. I thank Senators Tillis and Graham, as well as Senators Coons and Booker, for joining in this legislation. That legislation has already had a hearing. It should be voted to the floor and passed by the Congress so that there is no question that the special counsel will be protected against interference or firing.  As that investigation moves closer to the Oval Office, as it tightens its grip on members of the administration, there will be increasing threats and efforts to intimidate. The FBI and the Department of Justice, as well as the special counsel, have a well-earned reputation for integrity and zeal. It is part of our rule of law that a law is enforced. Enforcement of a law depends on thorough and independent investigations that are pursued without fear or favor, without efforts to distract or demean. This body, the U.Congress, has an obligation to support those kinds of values. They are uniquely American values. They are the underpinning of all of our laws, all that we hold dear, and all that we celebrate in this body and in this country.  My hope is that we will be part of the effort to avoid politicizing the pursuit of justice. Politicization of the pursuit of justice diverts energy and attention away from credible criminal investigations. It sends a message to this President and future Presidents--and everybody who occupies any office--that there are no repercussions for diverting and distracting and for the ploys and rabbit holes that may be used to squander resources or undermine credibility.  Republicans and Democrats alike should join in the effort to preserve the rule of law. My hope is that we will and will do so without delay because every day that passes when these kinds of false, baseless, and biased innuendos and rumors are raised and given credence is a day that undermines those values that we hold dear.

457,topic-id,1349,"Mr.President, a number of us are here today with a very simple, straightforward demand. We must act now to pass a Dream Very simply, the honor and integrity of this Chamber are at stake.  The young people who would be covered under the Dream Act are Americans in all but name. They came here as children. They grew up as They go to our schools, serve in our military, and support our economy. They work hard and they give back and they believe in the American dream. Deporting Dreamers would be cruel and irrational, inhumane, and, very simply, repugnant to basic American values.  Just think of Jonathan Gonzalez-He is a college student at Southern Connecticut State I had the privilege of meeting him in His story has stuck with me. His story haunts me when I think of the moral imperative of this Nation to pass the Dream  Jonathan was born in He came to this country when he was just 4 years old. The United States is home for him. It is the only country he has ever known. He received a full scholarship to attend Southern Connecticut[[Page S133]]State University, and he is set to graduate this spring with an honors degree in economics and math.  His dream is to attend law school, but due to the uncertainty surrounding DACA, he has decided to delay applying, knowing he will be unable to receive scholarships without his DACA status. He could attend, but he can't pay for it with scholarships unless he has that DACA status.  Jonathan first became compelled to speak up and tell his story after his father was deported, and they were unable to even say goodbye. Despite his own struggles, Jonathan is a passionate advocate for his community, and he actively works for Connecticut Students for a That organization, Connecticut Students for a Dream, is a group of students who help empower and advocate on behalf of other undocumented students. In fact, today, Jonathan is in DC to help ensure that the voices of students are, in fact, heard. Jonathan is a volunteer peer mentor through that organization because he is so passionate about raising graduation rates and ensuring that all students like himself have the support they need to succeed.  During his senior year, Jonathan has been interning at an immigration law firm, and he is glad to be helping others gain legal status in this country. The irony is not lost on him--and should not be lost on us--that he, himself, could face deportation this year. If Jonathan is not permitted to stay--if Congress does not act and he loses his DACA protection--Connecticut and this Nation will be the losers. Connecticut and this Nation will lose an educated and compassionate public service-minded individual who gives back to his community, to his fellow students, and to our He is just one example of the estimated 10,000 like him in Connecticut--and at least 700,000 around the country--who could lose their status in March if Congress fails to act now.  Very simply, we have an obligation to do our job and provide permanent status and a path to citizenship for the The hopeful news is, there is broad bipartisan support for affording the Dreamers protection against mass, draconian deportation. Our challenge is to make sure that what we do here reflects that broad bipartisan support in this Chamber and around the country because America knows it has made a promise. It made a promise to those Dreamers, and great countries do not break promises.  Last night, a Federal district court issued a preliminary injunction ordering DHS--the Department of Homeland Security--to resume accepting renewal applications. Once again, the courts have served as a bulwark for basic rights under rule of law, but this reprieve is no final remedy. We must redouble our determination to protect these young people from draconian, mass deportation--a continuing threat as long as President Trump refuses to reverse his cruel, unconscionable policy.  A Federal judge has struck down President Trump's order as unconstitutional, but a Dream Act is no less necessary today than it was yesterday. Congress should waste no time in swiftly passing clean legislation--a clean Dream Act to protect these young people.  When DACA was adopted in 2012, it changed the lives of young people like It opened new vistas. It provided Dreamers with the opportunity to get driver's licenses, to attend college, to become productive members of our economy.  Importantly, when DACA was adopted, we made that promise to these young people. We promised that if they came forward and provided the United States of America with information, some of the most personal information any of us have--information about their addresses, employment, dates of birth, their families--we would not use that information against them. They had a place here under They had rights--moral, if not legal. That promise is now about to be broken.  Great countries keep those promises. The United States is the greatest country in the history of the world. It should not be breaking promises to innocent young men and women who know only this country, who believe in the American dream, who believe in America's promises, who believed those promises when they offered that information and now are relying on the good faith of The rescission of DACA threatens to tear apart families, destroy lives, create disarray, and derail futures. We are a country that is better than this rescission. We are a country that keeps promises, and Congress must now act to protect these young people.  DACA protections are set to expire in 2 months. Already, tens of thousands of DACA recipients are estimated to have lost their protection from removal. The longer Congress takes to act, the longer these young people, who were promised the American dream, continue with anguish, with targets on their backs.  Continued waiting means instability to the job market because companies are forced to hire replacements for DACA recipients and train new workers in anticipation of the March deadline. It could mean a massive ejection of qualified, hard-working people vital to our economy.  This kind of massive deportation by plane, by boat, by car, by foot would be unprecedented. We have never seen anything like it before. As I have said repeatedly, this kind of mass, draconian deportation would be a humanitarian nightmare, a betrayal of  If Congress fails to pass the Dream Act, we will lose nearly $500 billion over the next 10 years. Let me repeat. We will lose $500 billion over the next 10 years. We will lose $25 billion in Medicare and Social Security taxes alone. In my home State of Connecticut, we stand to lose $300 million in economic benefits a year.  Now is the time to abandon the myth that the Dreamers work on the sidelines of American society. They are part of the fabric of this Their lives are woven into the great tapestry of They drive our economy. They give back to our communities.  The administration has thrown a ticking time bomb into their lives, but it is also a ticking time bomb in this We have the power to defuse it. In doing so, we can give hope to hundreds of thousands of members of our society and reaffirm the greatness of our country. At stake is nothing less than the character of our country, and that is why there is such bipartisan support for the Dream Act, as evidenced yesterday in the Cabinet Room when the President met with Members of the Congress on both sides of the aisle.  In the Dreamers, we see ourselves. We see relatives who came to this country years ago, many of them as teenagers. My father fled Germany at 17 years old with nothing more than the shirt on his back, speaking no English, knowing virtually no one here.

Even though code words may be used and sometimes doctored photographs, they are sold for sex because the traffickers are able to do so using the internet. We are here to stop it. We are here today to stop the trafficking and, most importantly, to stop the advertising.  In support of a measure, known as the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, SESTA, we have a strong bipartisan coalition. This bill is about as bipartisan as any bill is. I have worked on this legislation together with my colleague and friend, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, from the very beginning. We have been joined in this effort by two Democrats and two Republicans--Senators McCaskill, Heitkamp, Cornyn, and We are passionate about this effort, and so are our colleagues who have joined us, because it is about those victims--those children, teenagers, and young women--who are sold for sex, who are trafficked on the internet. We want to give those victims a voice and a day in court, a right of action, a defense against this absolutely heinous, atrocious, inhumane crime. It is a crime and it can be prosecuted, but the victims deserve a day in court and a voice as well. That is the fundamental, core purpose of this legislation. It is about the victims.  We have been joined in this effort by advocates for those victims--sex trafficking survivors themselves and a diligent, bipartisan coalition of colleagues. In fact, more than 60 of our colleagues have joined this as cosponsors. We are now at a critical milestone for this bill. We have reached a point of momentum that makes this bill unstoppable if those survivors are to be heard and heeded, and I urge my colleagues to do exactly that. SESTA is really the product of stakeholder consensus. It has the support of every major human trafficking organization, of law enforcement, and of all of the major tech companies.  In essence, SESTA would clarify that section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was never intended to protect websites that facilitate sex trafficking, and it would ensure that those survivors get their day in court. It stands in stark contrast to a measure in the House of Representatives that has been approved by the relevant committee there, which would fail in that effort. Websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking should be afforded no protection under the Communications Decency They should be given no harbor or implicit approval, which is what the legislation now does. The House bill, unfortunately, would fail to give those survivors and victims their day in court and the voice that they so desperately need.  Senator Portman and I--and I am proud to be joined with him today on the floor--have championed this cause as a result of what we have seen and heard. In fact, in going back almost a decade, when I was attorney general for the State of Connecticut, I saw firsthand the way that websites can knowingly facilitate sex trafficking. I saw firsthand how challenging it was for law enforcement to develop cases against sex traffickers and employ anti-trafficking laws given the constraints on their resources, especially when those sex traffickers were able to use the internet to reach their customers. My experience in combating sex trafficking as attorney general at the State level led me, in my working with Senator Portman, to co-launch and co-chair the Senate Caucus to End Human Trafficking so as to help find solutions to this problem and others around the world whereby children and teenagers and others are sex-trafficked and victimized.  As the State attorney general, I concluded that facilitating sex trafficking must face repercussions. I was joined by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which reported and has since reported the numbers. For example, there has been an 846-percent increase in reports of suspected child sex trafficking from 2010 to 2015--a spike it found to be ``directly correlated to the increased use of the internet to sell children for sex.'' We have heard of some of those instances, of some of the histories and the stories of these young people.  In 2012, a 15-year-old girl ran away from home. Over the next 2 years, pimps trafficked her for sex through these ads. As a result, she was raped over 1,000 times while she was moved from one site to another with the aid of the internet. In 2010, another 15-year-old girl ran away from a residential program. A pimp began to traffic her for sex by posting online ads. As a result, she was raped 900 times over the next 2 years.  These two young women and a third mustered the courage to tell their stories and to bring a lawsuit against backpage.com, which is the website that has profited most prominently from these online ads. These advertisements graphically emphasized the survivors' and victims' youth and other characteristics in trafficking them for sex. Yet the courts, understandably and perhaps rightly, have held that backpage.com and these internet sites generally have no legal responsibility. The First Circuit Court of Appeals found that backpage.com was immune from civil liability because of section 230 of the Communications Decency  Websites that facilitate sex trafficking unconscionably and intolerably are now immune from legal action by survivors. That is unacceptable in No matter how terrible the harm they cause, no matter how horrific the consequences to these young people, they are protected by a shield from moral and legal responsibility. In a sense, these women were victimized as much by backpage.com and the internet as they were by the pimps who more directly sold them.  Senator Portman and I, through SESTA, would implement three key reforms: 1, allow victims of sex trafficking to seek justice against websites that knowingly facilitate their victimization; 2, clarify that it is illegal to knowingly facilitate a violation of the Federal sex trafficking laws; and 3, enable State law enforcement officials, not just the Federal Department of Justice, to take action against individuals or businesses that violate Federal sex trafficking laws.  If websites are not knowingly facilitating sex trafficking, they should have nothing to fear from the law. If[[Page S86]]websites are doing their best to avoid facilitating sex trafficking, they have no worry about their liability. Yet, if they knowingly facilitate, they ought to face survivors and victims in court, and they ought to acknowledge and recognize their legal and moral responsibilities.  I want to be very blunt with my colleagues here about the House bill because my feeling is that we owe it to those survivors and victims to give them not just nice words and rhetoric but real rights. Congress must not only pass an online sex trafficking law; it must pass real sex trafficking internet protection. Unfortunately, the House Judiciary Committee recently passed legislation that fails to accomplish that goal.  My colleagues should not be fooled--the House bill is in no way an adequate alternative to It is, unfortunately, completely insufficient in protecting survivors and victims and giving them that day in court and that voice they now lack. The difference between the House and Senate bills is stark and clear, like night and day. The Senate bill gives victims of trafficking their day in court. The House bill does not give a single survivor or victim access to justice. It fails to open the courthouse doors; it leaves them shut. In fact, it may even deny victims and survivors their right to file legal action. The Senate bill has the support of every major human trafficking organization, as well as of all of the major stakeholders. The House bill is supported by none--zero--no major group. In fact, 47 organizations and more than a dozen survivors and family members recently sent a letter that calls for the House bill, as it is presently written, to be rejected.  I strongly urge my colleagues to join this bipartisan group of more than 60 of us who are supporting SESTA to help pass this essential legislation as soon as possible. We owe it to those survivors and victims. We owe it to ourselves. We owe it to  I am proud to yield to my friend and colleague who has joined in this effort and has been such a steadfast champion, Senator  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgS85-2.txt,2076,2045,2018.0,9.0,January

808,topic-id,1538,"Mr.President, I am here to talk about our fellow Americans in Puerto Even as the Northeast is gripped by a storm of impressive proportions, Puerto Rico is still recovering from the hurricane that hit that island 106 days ago.  I visited Puerto Rico with my friend and colleague, Senator Murphy, yesterday and the day before, to bring back to my colleagues a fact-based report on how the recovery effort is going and how ample Federal support has been.  I come to the floor today furious and frustrated. The people of Puerto Rico have a right to be furious, as well, because they have been denied the basic help and relief that this great Nation--the greatest in the history of the world--owes to all  Let there be no doubt that the people of Puerto Rico are our fellow They have fought in our wars. They have come to the mainland and gone back, contributing to our communities, as well as theirs.  They are in our communities in Connecticut, which has the highest concentration of people from Puerto Rico and their descendants of any State in the country. We are proud of the Puerto Ricans in Connecticut and of the Puerto Rican families and people who are coming from the mainland in an exodus unmatched in recent history.  The reason for that out-migration is that Puerto Rico is in the midst of a humanitarian and economic crisis. Let me repeat that. Puerto Rico is in a humanitarian and economic crisis 106 days after Hurricane  It is still in triage. Half of the population lacks reliable electricity. Almost half lacks drinkable, healthy water. The tourist industry--the lifeblood of its economy--is shrinking and struggling. About half the hotels still are not open, and the unemployment rate is well above 10 percent--double the rate of unemployment here on the mainland. Housing continues to be a major problem. Of the homes that need temporary relief, only half of them have been provided the blue tarps because they have not been delivered.  I want to pay tribute to the first responders, the Corps of Engineers, and FEMA workers, as well as the National Guard from Connecticut and elsewhere who are on the ground serving and sacrificing for their fellow They lack the support they need in resources and commitment from the administration and from this Resources and support have been denied them because of a lack of will, not a lack of money.  Many of the schools there are shuttered, and students have been denied the privilege to continue their education. The healthcare system of the island is still in shambles. Primary care is struggling to recover because of the lack of electricity. A doctor's office simply cannot run without electricity, nor can manufacturing plants be operated without a reliable source of power.  In restoring power, the Corps of Engineers has provided generators in places where formerly there were plants actually producing power. Generators are a temporary source of power, not a reliable permanent source. Transmission is still down in many parts of the country.  To add insult to injury, Puerto Rico is stuck with a tax as a result of the action of this Congress and the administration--a tax imposed only on manufacturing in foreign countries. Puerto Rico is treated as a foreign country for purposes of the 12.5 percent tax on certain manufacturers. That is simply unconscionable. Manufacturing plants will soon be facing the decision of whether to stay or go, and many of them will go, adding to the unemployment situation there.  It is heartbreaking and gut-wrenching to visit this island and to walk in a neighborhood, as Senator Murphy and I did on Wednesday night, and find darkness after the sun goes down--total darkness, except for a few isolated lights here and there. How can students study? How can parents care for children?  On that Tuesday night, we walked through a neighborhood in downtown San Juan that was dark because of the lack of electricity. There simply are not enough generators for every home to have one. Generators, themselves, are only a stopgap source of power.  The human faces and voices are gripping and riveting from the suffering[[Page S31]]that people in Puerto Rico--our fellow Americans--still endure. The lack of Federal commitment and response is shameful and disgraceful.  There are steps that we must take immediately. In the short-term relief package that is coming to us from the House of Representatives, we must make sure that some of that aid--a significant proportion--is specifically targeted to Puerto The number requested by the Governor is $94 billion. It is a number that is fully and amply supported by fact. The total package coming from the House is only $81 billion, and it is supposed to cover expenses in Florida and Texas as well as Puerto Rico and the Virgin So that number has to be vastly increased. Longer term, there must be a change in the Tax Code to eliminate that 12.5 or 13 percent tax that discriminates against Puerto Rico as if it were a foreign country and as if the residents in Puerto Rico were citizens of another country. They are  The Medicaid formula must be changed so that it is fair to Puerto The 20 percent commitment that now goes to Puerto Rico, unlike other States, must be increased so as to treat Puerto Rico, in fact, as if it were a State and so that it is given an adequate match.  These kinds of commonsense steps must be the beginning of more than just repair and more than just rebuilding. It must be a full recovery with a vision for the future.  I have proposed, with Senator Sanders and others of our colleagues, a Marshall Plan for Puerto That is the kind of commitment that is necessary. The $150 billion includes not only the $94 billion that is necessary to repair and recover right away but a longer term plan to enable the island to be back on its feet financially, to recover from the near bankruptcy that it is enduring, to able its institutions to function fully, and to permit its healthcare system to rely on electricity from plants that are powered in an economic and environmentally friendly way.  There is, sadly, the hint also of potential corruption in the Whitefish contract that now has been withdrawn and in the Bronze Star contract for tarps that is under review. Investigations must be concluded quickly and thoroughly so that we are assured that Federal dollars are being used honestly and effectively.  We must make a commitment to use the island's natural advantages. Electricity is essential. It is not a luxury, not a convenience. It is vital. It is the lifeblood of that island economically and humanly. One of the island's great advantages is its sunlight. Solar has to be used more effectively and widely as a source of power.  My hope is that we can make this disaster relief program a Marshall Plan-like program for the island in the long term with bipartisan support.  There is nothing political about a neighborhood in darkness, about children unable to go to school, about health facilities closed, electricity lacking, and water undrinkable. These are basic needs that we have an obligation to come together on both sides of the aisle and meet.  I hope that we will do so and that we will match the resilience and resolve that I saw in meeting with Governor Rossello and all of his team. The island's residents and FEMA and other Federal workers were also there.  Governor Rossello has provided the kind of courage and commitment that are necessary to lead his people in this time of challenge. We must match the courage and strength of the residents on the island with equal resolve here that we will meet the needs of our fellow Americans and that we will keep our commitment, as we do always in times of crisis, to rebuild and to recommit and make sure that we leave no one there behind.  I am proud that we are working with Governor After meeting with him yesterday and after meeting with him in the wake of the hurricane when I first visited--I had the privilege of flying over the island, and I saw the devastation, with whole villages destroyed, houses and community centers completely razed--progress has been made. Governor Rossello is to be commended for his continuing perseverance, as well as the people of Puerto Rico in their resolve and resilience, but we must now do our part and match that resilience and resolve with a true commitment that we will leave no American behind and keep faith with the people of Puerto  I am proud that many in the Puerto Rican community in Connecticut have shared their stories with me, and I look forward to returning to them this weekend and sharing my stories with them of their families and their friends on that island.

In the hearing presently underway in the Judiciary Committee, as I speak, there is testimony from members of the government investigative agencies which have responsibility for stopping gun violence. My fear is, this hearing will be an excuse for inaction and continued complicity by Congress in the failure to act. The complicity in those deaths is on our hands in this body by failing to take action.  There are actions we can take that will help to save lives--commonsense, sensible action--that Congress has failed to take: universal background checks, ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, a red flag statute that will prevent people who are dangerous to themselves or others from having or buying guns. Many of these measures are bipartisan, and we can come together with the lesson from the students and young people who are in the streets coming to the Capitol today.

1563,topic-id,1388,"Mr.President, at the very start, I am grateful, and I praise my cosponsor, Senator Portman, who has helped to lead in the championing of this measure. He has really been steadfast in the face of a lot of challenges. It was a difficult bill to draft and then to redraft and change again in response to suggestions that we received from friends and adversaries, but Senator Portman has been really stalwart throughout it.  I join him in thanking our partners, Senator McCaskill, Senator McCain, Senator Heitkamp, Senator Cornyn, and, of course, Senator Thune, who is the chairman of the committee, and Ranking Member  This road began for me more than 10 years ago when I was the State attorney general in Connecticut, and I wanted to pursue legal remedies against the websites. Back then, it was craigslist or MySpace that promoted sex trafficking and prostitution as well as pornography. My staff informed me that there was a provision of Federal law--section 230 of the Communications Decency Act--that would stop me in my tracks. Indeed, it has stopped others, most recently some of the survivors of sex trafficking who were told by a Federal court of appeals, in effect, that what happened to you is outrageous, and there should be a remedy for you, but section 230 of the Communications Decency Act blocks your day in court. It closes the courthouse doors to you in your seeking a legal remedy.  Along the way, there were many who said to Senator Portman and to me that we could never pass this legislation because it would hold trafficking websites accountable. They said the opponents of this change were too powerful, too big, too entrenched. They said the victims and survivors were too powerless, too invisible.  We have met them. We know their stories. They are heartbreaking. They are children--some younger than the pages in this Chamber today--who have endured torture that is unspeakable and unthinkable for anyone of any age, and they deserve their day in court, rights, and remedies--real remedies that make the rights real.  So I thank Senator Portman, and I thank, as he has also done, those survivors who have come forward and been the faces and voices of our cause. Their courage and strength and that of their family members have enabled us to reach this point.  I emphasize that this measure is very carefully and narrowly written to address a specific harm, and I want to take a couple of minutes to correct any misunderstanding that there may be in this  First, some of the legislation's critics have claimed it will impose liability on the so-called Good In reality, this bill explicitly preserves subsection 230(c)(2)(A) of the Communications Decency Act, commonly called the Good Samaritan provision. This provision ensures that websites cannot be held liable on account of actions taken in good faith to restrict objectionable material. SESTA is crystal clear on this point. A website operator's good deeds cannot be used against him.  This measure is also technology neutral. It imposes no requirement that website operators use a particular technology to screen their sites for objectionable content. They are free to use whatever technology they wish. That is why the Internet Association and its member companies support this legislation. They know that if technology companies work to prevent human trafficking and not to profit from it, they have nothing to fear from this measure.  I understand that an amendment has been offered to restate SESTA's Good Samaritan provision. Even if the amendment only protected Good Samaritans, it would be unnecessary and potentially confusing to the courts. I emphasize that point. It would obfuscate and confuse the good intent of the Good Samaritan provision. It would also derail this widely popular legislation by sending it back to the House, where special interests will have another chance to kill it. Unfortunately, this proposed amendment--perhaps unintentionally--would not simply protect Good Samaritans; it would also protect websites that operate in bad faith. It would also protect websites that identify sex trafficking ads and then leave them up in order to continue profiting from them.  I will briefly talk about one other amendment that has been offered--again, while being well-intentioned--that threatens to derail this legislation.  The amendment would provide additional money to Attorney General Sessions to investigate and prosecute websites that criminally facilitate human trafficking. I believe law enforcement ought to have additional resources. I firmly support more funding to investigate and prosecute this criminal activity, but this bill is not the means by which to do it.  In fact, law enforcement and the community against human trafficking are strongly against these amendments. Let me repeat. These law enforcement groups include the Fraternal Order of Police, the Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies, the FBI Agents Association, and I could go down the list. In fact, there is no need to.  I ask unanimous consent that the letters from these groups be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           National Fraternal Order of Police,                                    Washigton, DC, March 19, 2017.

This legislation will allow law enforcement to investigate      and prosecute individuals and businesses that advertise or      facilitate sex trafficking more effectively. The bill will      create a new Federal offense prohibiting the use or operation      of an instate facility, like a website, that promotes or      facilitates illegal prostitution.       The FOP is opposed to the two pending amendments because      they may have the unintended consequence of derailing this      important legislation.

705,topic-id,1810,"Mr.President, I have two topics I want to speak about today; one is  There is no question that Iran is the principal state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Both the Obama administration and the Trump administration have without hesitation made that point. The Iranian regime provides money and it provides material support for groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah and a host of other terrorist groups. They have threatened to wipe out Israel, one of our closest allies. Their threat is to frankly wipe Israel off the map. And they have systematically trampled on the fundamental freedoms that all people everywhere would want to have. They have done that by taking those freedoms away from their own citizens and those human rights away from their own citizens.  In recent days, we have seen what happens after a decade of that kind of corruption and oppression. Protesters began a week ago to protest. It was, by all accounts, unexpected by the previous protest groups, by the military, or by the government. It spread to at least 50 cities, where brave people wanting to stand up--and in the streets began standing up by the thousands--to protest a government that denies them their rights, a government that has impoverished their country while it funnels billions of dollars to terrorists across the Middle East and across the world.  Where did those dollars come from? Unfortunately, too many of those dollars came from us.  I came to the floor, to this spot, nearly 2 years ago to ask that same question about where that money came from, after the Obama administration paid Iran what amounted to $1.7 billion in what appeared to be a ransom for the release of five American hostages. At the time it was explained: Well, this is just money that we have had for a long time, which was part of an economic agreement, a foreign military sale that we have held on to. It turned out that the story was not true. We later learned that $400 million of that payment was delivered in pallets of cash that came off an airplane. The pallets were stacked high with cash. And, on top of the $100 billion in sanction relief, we had another stack of billions of dollars in just straight cash--the sanctions relief, under the terribly thought-out Iranian nuclear deal, and the cash to apparently grease the skids so that agreement and others could happen.  We have heard of other things in recent days where the administration turned its back on bad things that were happening in order to see that the Iranian deal was going to go through. Now, if the Iranian deal had been a good deal, that would have been one thing, but to turn your back on bad things so that another bad thing can happen is even worse.  So where is this money going? Protesters have seen that the money that we delivered to them and the sanctions relief that we delivered to them didn't go to them and didn't go to their economy. It continued to finance terror around the world and war in other countries.  The State Department, once again, in their assessment said:       Iran remained the foremost state sponsor of terrorism in      2016 as groups supported by Iran maintained their capability      to threaten U.interests and allies. The Iranian Islamic      Revolutionary Guard Corps--Qods Force, along with Iranian      partners, allies, and proxies, continued to play a      destabilizing role in military conflicts in Iraq, Syria, and       Those assessments always come about a year late, after you have had time to assess the previous year. I have no doubt that the same assessment for 2016 will also be the assessment for the year we just ended--2017.  Frankly, the Iranian people are tired of it. They are angry. They are putting their lives on the line to protest.  The response of the Iranian Government has been predictable. First of all, they blame others for creating these problems. They said that we were agitating those freedom fighters in their country, those freedom protesters. They censored access to the social media. They have cracked down by arresting hundreds of people. The reports are that at least 20 people have been killed.  It is clear that their behavior hasn't changed; the hope that the Iranian deal would somehow bring the long sought-after moderates in the current government to the forefront has not happened. We should support the Iranian people.  I join the administration in expressing my support for the men and women, young and old, and the courage that they have demonstrated as they stand up and try to achieve the greatness of that country, with its long heritage and its incredible assets in location and in resources, which they should be able to achieve; they just have not been allowed to do that.  The last time this happened, our country was very quiet. This time, our government is speaking up. Hopefully, others will join in. The European countries have more economic impact in Iran than we do, and there is a good reason for that. We have been very thoughtful of wanting to support this regime. They have not. It is time for them to speak up as well.  So I join the administration, I join the President, and I encourage friends of freedom around the world to not let this moment pass again--to not, one more time, act as if nothing has happened, and that, somehow, this is exactly what the Iranian Government says it is, because it is almost never what the Iranian Government says it is. We wish for those who care about freedom to stand up and defend and encourage those who are seeking a greater freedom.[[Page S43]]                               FEMA Decision  Mr.President, the other issue I want to speak about today very briefly is that I want to commend the administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency for a decision they just made. That decision was to make houses of worship eligible for Federal disaster aid. This is in line with legislation that I introduced in September of last year. Senator Gillibrand and I introduced this legislation after the impact of Hurricane Sandy on houses of worship.  FEMA's Public Assistance Program provides financial grants for the repair, reconstruction, and replacement of private nonprofit facilities--private nonprofit facilities. However, until yesterday, houses of worship were ineligible for FEMA public assistance grants.  As we saw last year, houses of worship--churches, synagogues, mosques, and other places--are critical institutions within communities. They help feed people in need and, in trying to respond to disaster, they provide comfort and shelter during those disasters. FEMA not only did the right thing by making houses of worship eligible for disaster assistance, it did what our Constitution demands.  According to FEMA officials, the change in policy was prompted by the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, v. We have a provision in our constitution which I argued against and other Missouri elected officials filed amicus briefs against where we said our constitution was wrong in finding that religious, not-for-profit organizations couldn't be eligible for State programs simply because they were religious. That is not what the U.Constitution says. It is not what the Supreme Court determined State constitutions have a right to do.  So FEMA has taken an important step. I think it is equally important now that we make this policy permanent law. It is the right thing to do. It deserves to be permanently the right thing to do. I am hoping that we see the legislation that I have introduced and that many have cosponsored in whatever is the next supplemental disaster funding. Money is going to be spent. Let's go ahead and properly authorize it, as the Supreme Court said we had every right to do and as FEMA has decided that it is the right thing to do.  We are in a new year. We have new challenges. One of the goals we have is to be sure that we move forward in strengthening our economy, to help those responding to disasters and expanding opportunities for hard-working families. We have done that with regulatory reform, with judges who will determine what the law says, and with a tax bill where people will soon see in their paycheck that it is actually all about hard-working families.  I have an editorial from the Joplin Globe today. A tornado struck a community in 2011, and over 100 people were killed. According to the Joplin Globe editorial--just to remind me of the numbers--some 28 churches were either destroyed or damaged by the tornado that came through A significant number were totally destroyed. I have been to a number of those buildings that have been replaced, but they were replaced without any of the kind of assistance that other not-for-profits would have had.  The Joplin Globe editorial ends with this:       Floods, fires, tornadoes and hurricanes don't treat      churches differently. Neither should  Again, I congratulate FEMA for the decision they made on this topic.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the Joplin Globe editorial be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        [From the Joplin Globe]                    Our View: FEMA Aid for Churches       During Joplin's 2011 tornado, some 28 churches were either      destroyed or damaged. But those that were still standing      quickly opened doors and became centers for those left      homeless after this national disaster.       That's why we applaud the Federal Emergency Management      Agency's announcement that houses of worship are eligible for      FEMA Public Assistance program grants, which provide funding      for the repair, reconstruction or replacement of private      nonprofit sites.       That's thanks to U.Roy Blunt, R-Mo., who introduced      the legislation in September to make houses of worship      permanently eligible for disaster assistance. Claire      McCaskill, the Democrat from Missouri, also added her name to      the bill in a show of bipartisan support.       Both Blunt and McCaskill, in statements put out on      Wednesday, recognize the value churches can play in      disasters.       ``I'm glad to see FEMA do the right thing by ensuring      houses of worship are eligible for disaster aid on the same      terms as other nonprofits,'' Blunt said. ``As we saw again      last year, houses of worship serve a vital role during      disasters, providing shelter, food and other services for      families who need it the most.''       Previously, houses of worship were ineligible for FEMA      Public Assistance program grants. FEMA's announcement on      Wednesday means that churches, synagogues or mosques affected      by disasters declared on or after 23, 2017, and for      applications for assistance that were pending with FEMA as of      23, 2017, are eligible for assistance.       Blunt's right. Legislation is still needed to ensure houses      of worship remain eligible for disaster assistance under      federal law on a permanent basis. Floods, fires, tornadoes      and hurricanes don't treat churches differently. Neither      should  ",CREC-2018-01-04-pt1-PgS35-2.txt,1464,SUPPORTING THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE OF IRAN TO FREE EXPRESSION,2018.0,4.0,March

1731,topic-id,2952,"Mr.President, in the next few days, we will begin to debate this important bill on sex trafficking. This is something that, for whatever reason, the country turned its back on for too long. As the ways to communicate and the ways to offer so-called adult services grew, the government and law enforcement didn't have the new tools they needed to fight back.  This is a bill that Senator Portman and others have worked so hard on, on this side of the building. We are actually taking up the House bill. The principal sponsor of the House bill is Missouri Congresswoman Ann Wagner, with whom I have worked closely and who has been a good friend of mine--she and her family--for a long time.  When the House passed this bill overwhelmingly, Ann Wagner said that they ``sent a clear message to trafficking victims: you are not alone, and justice is no longer out of reach.'' It is hard to imagine a more lonely place, I would think, than someone who is being trafficked, some young woman, young child, boy or girl, who has fallen into the hands of traffickers and who, for drugs or whatever reason, has been sold into this or become dependent in a way that put them into this.  Congresswoman Wagner went on to say about this bill that ``FOSTA will produce more prosecutions of bad actor websites and more convictions and put more predators behind bars.'' She said: ``It will give victims a pathway to justice and provide a meaningful criminal deterrent, so that fewer businesses will ever enter the sex trade and fewer victims will ever be sold.''  The whole idea that people are being sold to be used in whatever terrible way someone else wants to use them is so offensive. The idea that we have websites that people can go to that have some description of some person who is helplessly in this system and how they would be used--that is something Congress should stand up on. By voting for Congresswoman Wagner's bill, the House has already done that.  On our side of the building, Senator Portman and others have worked so hard to draw attention to the fact that we need to find time to get this bill on the floor. Now we have a bill that has already passed the House, and all we have to do is pass that bill and send it right to the President, or we can make[[Page S1760]]some changes that Senator Portman and others may want to suggest, and then we can send the bill back to the House, where hopefully it can be dealt with in the same overwhelming way they passed it the first time. Then we can get this bill on the President's desk and do exactly what Congresswoman Wagner said this bill will do. It is time for us to do everything we can to end this.  We would be foolish to think that one piece of legislation will end this problem. By working with law enforcement, looking at trafficking, looking at locations like the intersections of major interstate highways, where it is easy to bring people, to pass people along to somebody else, to get them to where not only are they disoriented, but your actual contact with that person doesn't last very long before you give them to somebody else or sell them to somebody else who could use them in a terrible way--this needs to stop. I am confident the Senate will pass this next week, and I will just say that it is about time.                         Funding the Government  Mr.President, also next week we are going to move forward on an appropriating process that has gotten way out of control. I am glad the leaders have decided to appoint a special committee to look at this. The Presiding Officer and I are on that committee. We will be looking at the budgeting process and looking at what has happened. Instead of bringing these bills to the floor one at a time and letting every Member of the Senate have an opportunity to amend any bill in any way they want to as long as it deals with spending and as long as you don't add new money--every amendment you want to come up with where you want to take some money here and spend it here instead and have a debate about why that should happen--that is what the Congress did for a couple of hundred years, and it is time we did it again. This idea that all the bills come together in one big, what we call an omnibus--``ominous'' might be a better word--an omnibus spending bill that includes everything, plus all the legislation that it can possibly carry, is not the way this process should work. It is the way this process is going to have to work this year because we missed all of those opportunities that are now behind us.  As soon as we get this done, we need to start on this year's process. We know what the top-line spending number is going to be. There is every reason to believe that this year's process could be a big step in the right direction, but some guidelines from that special House and Senate committee will do even more.  I would like to say, as the chairman of one of those appropriating committees--the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Subcommittee--that one bill of the 11 left after the Defense bill is decided on--that one bill has about a third of all of the money to be appropriated of the discretionary money. Senator Murray, my counterpart on the other side, and I have worked hard on this committee for 3 years now. In the House, Chairman Cole and Congresswoman DeLauro, the chair and the ranking member on that side, have worked hard as well.  These are big decisions to be made. These programs matter, but some of them matter more than others, and part of our job should be and needs to be setting priorities, doing things that increase the commitment to the programs that are working and eliminate the programs or change the programs that don't work. Hopefully, we will continue to do more of that this year and even more of that next year.  Some of the programs touch the lives of so many Americans, such as apprenticeship programs. Medical research clearly touches the life of virtually every American and every American family. What we could do to develop a flu vaccine that actually hits the mark every year instead of misses the mark often, things we can do in special education--these are all parts of this one part of the bill that Senator Murray and I and Congressman Cole and Congresswoman DeLauro have been working on.  Frankly, everybody should have had a chance to work on this. I think we know a lot about these topics. I think that our debate is a good debate, but it is not nearly as good of a debate as if every single Senator got to be a part of working on this, not just the three dozen or fewer Senators who are on the Appropriations  There are a wide variety of programs here that need to be funded. I want to spend just a few minutes talking about some of the priorities that we are looking at that need to be part of this bill and create a sense that this is really a process that matters.  First, we are on track to increase the third straight year of significant increases for the National Institutes of Health and health research. What do they do? In the last decade, we failed most of the time to make any increase at all. In fact, 2 years ago, when I started chairing this committee and Congressman Cole started chairing the committee on the other side of the building, it had been 12 years since there had been a one-penny increase in health research. During that 12 years, we figured out so much more about the human genome. We figured out so many more ways to figure out how I am different from you and how you are different from me and how that makes a difference and how whatever is attacking my system we can fight back.  There was not one penny of an increase in 12 years. In fact, the research people said that we were 22 percent below, in research buying power 3 years ago, where we had been 12 years earlier. Young researchers who had never gotten a research grant before weren't likely to get one when they had less effective money to spend than they have had for over a decade. So hopefully that 22 percent--our goal would be to get most of that 22 percent back in 3 years. We have also already restored 13 percent of it. I hope we have a big number next week that gets us back to where we are--at least back to where we were in 2005 or so.  We made a commitment at the end of the last century to double, in a short period of time, the National Institutes of Health funding, and then somehow we thought we were done. We would be done anytime there is no more research to be done. We will be done as soon as we have developed a cure for cancer and found out what to do about Alzheimer's and determined what we can do to lessen heart attack risks and found the answer to every orphan disease, diseases that only a few people have. Let me tell my colleagues, we are a long way from doing that. In the last 3 years, we have tripled the amount of dollars going to Alzheimer's research. Without a cure for Alzheimer's or a way to slow down the onset of Alzheimer's, the projection is that by 2050, we will be spending twice as many tax dollars on Alzheimer's-related care and dementia-related care as we are spending now to defend the country. If I had said we would spend $1.1 trillion, I don't know about everybody who is listening, but in my case, it is pretty hard to get a handle on that. What does that really mean? How much bigger is that than $1.1 billion? Well, $1.1 trillion is twice what we spend to defend the country. Every military base everywhere in the world, every ship, every plane, every paycheck for every soldier, sailor, airman, marine; the National Guard, the Coast Guard; training dollars--that is about $500-and-some billion, approaching $600 billion. We would be spending twice that in today's dollars, in tax dollars--not what families would spend to try to deal with the tragedy of Alzheimer's but twice that in just tax dollars if we don't find something to do. A cure would be great. Just figuring out how we could determine early, in an effective way, that you were likely to get Alzheimer's and try to begin to delay the onset of Alzheimer's so it either doesn't affect you at all because some other health concern does or you get it a few years later. If we could delay the onset of Alzheimer's by 5 years on the average, that $1.1 trillion in today's dollars--in 2015--would be reduced by almost half, by 46 percent. So knowing how to detect this--there have been some great studies going on that have been funded in better ways over recent years. This has continued.  I think what we are looking at in the Brain Initiative--the Cancer Moonshot, as Vice President Biden referred to it--diabetes--again, these diseases that maybe not very many people get are particularly the diseases that the National Institutes of Health needs to be doing research on because there is not much of an economic driver for private[[Page S1761]]sector research on a disease that almost nobody has. So a lot of the money that we put into NIH research we specifically try to put in there without any specific category, where we are saying: You take this money, and you do what you think needs to be done, and we are going to have oversight to talk about what you did. A bunch of Members of the Senate and the House aren't going to try to become the research deciders for the United States of America--and, by the way, for the world--when you do that.  In this bill, we are also looking at the crucial fight on the opioid epidemic. The President says it is a crisis, and he is right. It is the 1 cause of accidental death in the country today. It has exceeded car accidents as a cause of death in the country and in Missouri and in many other  The last two funding bills have put almost an additional $1 billion into opioids from where we were just 3 years ago, but the Presiding Officer will remember that in the last continuing resolution, some specific money--about $3 billion more--was given to this cause, and it is the job of our committee and then the Congress to decide how to spend that $3 billion.  We need more resources. There is no reason to think that the opioid addiction epidemic, leading to heroin and other drugs, is slowing down, so we need to do things that improve treatment and prevention efforts. Prevention, obviously, is better than treatment, but if prevention fails, we need better treatment systems than we have now.  We need to look for alternative pain medications that aren't addictive. I will say that in the 1970s and 1980s, I am told, in medical schools, they thought opioids weren't addictive. So we need to be sure that when we have an alternative that seems to be nonaddictive, that it really isn't addictive.  We need to think of the workforce needs and what happens when people become addicted to pain medicine and their pain doesn't go away, probably because their addiction doesn't go away. Then there is behavioral health that impacts so many families and so many communities.  If you are going to recover from opioid addiction, you have to have a place to go. Too many programs and policies say: We will work with you for 14 days. A lot of them say: We will work with you for 28 days--4 weeks. Not many people get this behind them in 28 days. So we are doing that.  In this bill, we are also looking at ways to support students and parents and teachers. Obviously, a safe environment--what can we do to provide more flexibility to schools to spend the money they currently have from the Federal Government to create a safer environment, and what can we do to increase the money available for that?  We need to be doing things that prepare people not just for college but for careers. If you can get a certificate that puts you to work in a job you love quicker than you can get a college degree that maybe doesn't do those two things--we ought to be thinking about whether our post-high school dollars are equally available to both college and other kinds of training.  We need to see that people have access to higher education. We are doing that by increasing funding for the Pell grant--this is not a loan; it doesn't have to be paid back--given specifically based on economic need and performance in school. You have to stay in school; you have to get passing grades. But in many colleges in my State of Missouri--in community college and in several of our 4-year schools--if you qualify for the full Pell grant, that is more than enough to pay tuition, books, and fees.  If you are putting yourself through school or if you are returning to school as an adult, if you are the first person in your family to graduate from college, year-round Pell means that if you have something working, you need to stick with it as long as you can, as quickly as you can.  Summer break is always well-intended. For 10 years Pell didn't pay for school in the summer; it does now, starting last year. This will be the first year that students and colleges and universities can really prepare for summer But if you don't break the rhythm you are in where things are working for you, you are much more likely to graduate from college than you would otherwise.  We need to be sure we prioritize funding for elementary and secondary education grant programs so that they are fair across the country, so that we are not only supporting STEM education, but we are also supporting IDEA for students with learning disabilities, an obligation the Federal Government has taken on itself.  We are going to have a chance next week to deal with this important, long-awaited bill on trafficking. I think there will probably be one vote that covers more things than it should on funding the government for the year we are already in. But, as I have talked about today, there are many reasons for Americans and American families to be focused on the job we do. Frankly, we need to spend our time figuring out how, in the future, the American people can watch the Congress more closely and watch the Congress openly debate the priorities of the government, which the government sets nowhere else quite the way it does when it decides how to spend the money we have been entrusted with.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

703,topic-id,3418,"Mr.President, I rise today because earlier on this day, the Trump administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Justice Department's policy known as the Cole memo.  The Cole memo is a policy issued under the Obama administration instructing prosecutors to shift away[[Page S40]]from a focus on nonviolent marijuana crimes and toward more serious crimes that threaten our communities. This memo was a critical step and a move in the right direction, undoing some of the catastrophic damage that has been caused by the failed War on It was a step forward for the Federal Government in mending our broken drug policies that have so hurt our Nation in so many ways. I believe it was a step forward that the vast majority of Americans who believe the War on Drugs failed agree with. It was a step forward that improved Americans' safety, saved money, and better aligned our laws with our most fundamental values of fairness, equality, and justice. Yet, today, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has instructed the Department of Justice to not just double down on failed policy but to turn back the clock and undermine the well-being of our country.  The policy change actually goes against what Jeff Sessions promised elected officials in this body before his confirmation. We already heard from the other Cory in the Senate--Republican Senator Cory Gardner--that he had a commitment from the Attorney General before his confirmation that this is not what he would do.  This is an attack on our most sacred ideals and the very purpose of the Department of Justice, which is to protect Americans, to elevate ideals of justice, and to do right by people. It is a failure of this administration, which said--our President said during his campaign that he would honor what States are doing. It is a betrayal by our Attorney General, who gave a commitment to at least one Republican Member of this body. But most significantly, it will hurt It ignores the fact that there is a growing bipartisan consensus that the War on Drugs has failed. It sacrifices our critical, urgently needed resources in our communities, violating our values and destroying families, and has failed to make us safer.  Let me walk through those four points one by one--first, this massive waste of public resources that are urgently needed in other areas. In the last four decades in this country, we have spent so much on these policies at the same time that we are disinvesting from public education, from our public colleges, disinvesting from investments and innovation, investments in science and research. Yet we have spent trillions of dollars on this failed War on  We have created a nation that says we are the land of the free, but we are the incarceration nation on the planet One out of every four incarcerated people on this planet is imprisoned here in the United States of One out of every three incarcerated women on the planet is incarcerated right here in the United States of  Between the time of 1990 and 2005, we have devoted so much of our resources to building new prisons. During that time, we were building a new prison in the United States every 10 days to keep up with the massive amount of people who were being driven into our prisons. One new prison was being built every 10 days as our infrastructure and our roads and bridges crumbled.  We have sidelined the resources of our law enforcement officials. I know this, having been a former mayor. The precious time, resources, and energy of our law enforcement officials have been sidelined, redirecting them to marijuana enforcement, and for what?  At a time when we have real issues to deal with in our country, such as a drug epidemic; at a time when people cannot afford treatment and when there are waiting lists for treatment because we don't have the resources to deal with this opioid epidemic, we are instead using our resources to enforce marijuana laws.  The Centers for Disease Control, the CDC, reported last year that 91 Americans die every single day from the opioid epidemic in this country. Meanwhile, according to FBI data from 2014, one American is arrested every single minute for marijuana possession--one American every minute for marijuana possession. That is about 1,700 Americans being arrested every day for marijuana possession, using police resources, resources to put people in jail, to hold them, to feed them, court resources. All that can be used better and invested in our society to deal with the ravages of the opioid epidemic. Police resources that could be used to chase after violent offenders are instead being used for marijuana possession. It is somehow crazy that we think we can arrest our way out of a problem.  Doubling down on these failed efforts makes no sense. It is a massive waste of our precious resources as a society.  2, it is also perpetuating injustice in our country. We believe that everyone in this Nation should have equal justice under the law. Those are the words written on the Supreme But we know this War on Drugs has not been a War on Drugs, it has been a war on people--and not all people but certain people, the most vulnerable people. It has been a war on people, a war on mentally ill people. It has been a war on people of color.  The unequal application of marijuana laws has created a justice system where outcomes are often more dependent upon race and class than dependent upon guilt or innocence. In privileged communities and places all across this country, marijuana is being used with little fear of consequences and openly spoken about and joked about with little understanding of the painful fact that the War on Drugs in America has scarcely affected their lives but the War on Drugs, because of the unequal application of the laws, is affecting people in other communities.  I have seen this personally. I went to Stanford and to Yale, and I watched drug use being done openly--marijuana use. There are no FBI investigations, no sting operations set up to go after the privileged in this country.  There are people in this body who openly admit to using marijuana with no consequence. But if you are poor or vulnerable in the United States of America, they are coming after you, and there will be consequences. I have had countless conversations with elected officials about their own personal drug use because it is outrageous to me, this outrageous hypocrisy that they could flaunt drug rules while poor people and people of color suffer as a result of our marijuana laws.  The facts are clear. The disproportionate enforcement of marijuana laws has helped to create a system of massive injustice in our country, and it is obvious. There is no difference in America between Blacks and Whites using marijuana, no difference between Blacks and Whites selling marijuana. Blacks are 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a White person is. This is a targeting of certain communities, a targeting of low-income people who are having their lives devastated by this unequal application of the law. Jeff Sessions' announcement today will make the problem worse.  People don't understand what it means to have a felony conviction for marijuana possession. Most people have no understanding that this is a lifetime sentence in It not only affects the individual's ability to get a job, you can't get a Pell grant if you have a felony conviction for marijuana usage, which many people in this body have done. You can't get a business license with a felony conviction for marijuana. You can't get food stamps. You can't get public housing.  It devastates individuals economically, but it devastates their families as well. It destroys the lives of children when suddenly the earner in their family, who is guilty of no more a serious crime than some of my colleagues--suddenly they have to pick up the pieces after one of their parents is sent away to prison. Missing 1 or 2 days of work often means losing your job, not being able to make your car payment or rental payment. We know that for children, where their father is in prison, they are more than five times more likely than their peers to be expelled or suspended from school.  This marijuana enforcement is devastating families--the fundamental building blocks of communities--and it is devastating communities. These laws weaken our overall economic health. One study found that if it weren't for the mass incarceration explosion as a result of the War on Drugs, the poverty rate in this country would be 20 percent lower.  We have a self-inflicted wound by wasting the resources--police resources and financial resources--of this country, and we have another self-inflicted wound by destroying families and communities economically.[[Page S41]]  It also has hurt our safety as a country. There are communities all across this Nation that worry about the safety of their children, the safety of their families, and the safety of their neighborhoods. By taking these critical resources away from law enforcement, this is a sacrifice of our efforts to make communities safe and strong.  In 2016, more Americans were arrested for marijuana possession than for all violent crimes combined. How many unsolved murders are there? How many unsolved assaults? How much violence and crime should our police be investigating as opposed to dealing with marijuana prohibition? We have fewer police resources, fewer officers. We have occupied our prisons with more marijuana arrests than for rape, murder, aggravated assault, or even the unsolved robberies alone in our country because we are spending our precious police resources on marijuana prohibition. Our history shows this is true.  Historians now attest to the complete and utter failure of another prohibition in this country, which is the prohibition of alcohol. It arguably made people less safe. It led to more drinking and was a blow to our economy and the ability of our officers to do their job. It was even a blow to officers' safety and security.  If we are serious about making our communities safer or stronger, families more secure, we should be focusing on how to undo the catastrophic damage of marijuana prohibition, not double down on it.  I say all of this as someone who ran a police department in It was under my authority as mayor. My officers would talk about the churn of people they arrested again and again on nonviolent charges--which, by the way, many of our law enforcement officers may have engaged in and people in positions of authority, like Senators and Presidents, have done themselves, deepening the distrust between officers and the community.  I saw firsthand how the disproportionate enforcement of our drug laws made communities of mine overcriminalized and underprotected--overcriminalizing possession of marijuana and underprotecting them on serious crimes.  This is an issue which I know too personally. I have seen this from walking privileged and elite communities like universities or here in Washington, and I know it because I may be the only Senator who, when I go home, I go home to an inner-city community. I go home to a community where my census track is about $14,000 per household. I love my neighborhood. I love my community. I love my neighbors, but it is outrageous to me that communities like mine and all over this country have seen the vicious impact of the War on Drugs, while other communities--elite communities--can brag and joke about their marijuana usage.  I am proud that I spent most of my adult life working with the people of Newark, NJ--a city that is rich with culture, that is rich with art, that is rich with civic engagement--but I know, from Camden to Paterson, to Passaic, to Newark, there are communities like mine that, every single day, are getting the devastating blow of this prohibition--this war on marijuana.  I see the anguish people feel about the unjustness and the unfairness of it all and having lives upended for getting caught with small amounts of marijuana. I have seen countless people who couldn't find a job or a decent place to live to support their families.  I will never forget, as a city councilman in Newark, waiting in line at the A guy came over and told me the story that he was issued a uniform. He finally had a job that had a pension. He could support his family and move out of a bad neighborhood into a better one. He was so excited. They ran his record, and 18 years earlier he had a nonviolent, marijuana-related charge, and they took it all away from him. Think about that comparison to the highest office in the land, where marijuana users have occupied with no consequence--the hypocrisy of it all.  These aren't just a few people. These are hundreds of thousands of Americans who are bearing the brunt of nonviolent charges for marijuana. They have had their lives destroyed. They have that lifetime sentence of, time and time again, having to check a box about a marijuana arrest, having their uniforms taken away, opportunities closed.  I have seen how these laws make us less safe. When are we going to get back to this understanding that we--all of us as Americans--put our hand on our heart and we make a pledge; we swear an oath that we will be a nation of liberty and justice, not for the privileged, not for the elite, but we will be a nation of liberty and justice for all.  Countless people have talked about equal justice under the law. They have talked about these ideals and principles from this floor. They talked about it in the suffrage movement. They talked about it in the civil rights movement. It goes all the way back to slavery. Frederick Douglass, on the 24th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, made a statement that was as true then as it is now. He said:       Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where      ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel      that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob      and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be      safe.  Well, this is the War on This is the marijuana prohibition. It has been a systematic oppression of poor people in our country. It has destroyed and devastated individuals, families, communities, and cities. It has bled our national treasure. It has filled our jails to the point where we had to build more and more of them. It has taken away resources from investing in drug treatment or education, which we know not only drives down drug use but empowers people economically.  This is the War on This is the war on marijuana. Attorney General Sessions' policy rescission today will only make these problems worse, at a time that the majority of the American public agrees with me--agrees that this prohibition must end. The majority of the American people understand that this policy makes our communities less safe, wastes taxpayers' money, makes it more difficult for police officers to do their jobs, and ultimately hurts the struggling folks at the bottom of the economic ladder most. It disproportionately affects Black and Brown They are the ones who are bearing the brunt of our failure to get rid of this prohibition.  Let's be clear about what this setback is. The American people know the War on Drugs has failed. They want change. Republicans and Democrats and Independents in States all across our country are making change at their legislature, at the ballot box--voting in a repeal of these awful, unfair, wasteful policies all across this country. In red States and blue States, Americans are marching, are standing up, and are fighting to change these laws.  We know States that have legalized marijuana have seen a massive increase in revenue and decreased rates of serious crime. Crime is going down in those communities. They have been able to put more resources to use to address urgent public needs like education and infrastructure.  In Colorado, arrest rates have decreased and State revenue has increased. Washington State has seen a 10-percent decrease in violent crime over the 3-year period following legalization.  It is time for Congress to step up to the plate. It is time for us to once again live up to our oath. It is time for us once again to fight to make our country a place of liberty and justice for all.  I know right now Attorney General Jeff Sessions and President Trump are standing squarely on the wrong side of history. I know what our ancestors have taught us about the arc of the moral universe bending toward justice. I know this is not a matter of if but a matter of when we will have sane marijuana policies in this country and end the prohibition that is destroying neighborhoods. I know these things.  How long will people suffer? How long will we waste resources? How long will we make ourselves less safe? How long? This fight is more than about a substance--a plant. It is more. It is about the soul of our It is about our ideals. It is about justice. It is about justice for veterans who rely on medical marijuana to treat their They fought for us, they stood for us, and now, according to Jeff Sessions, with the use of medical marijuana to deal with their PTSD, they are criminals.  That is not the America I believe in. It is about justice for the man who has[[Page S42]]a criminal record for doing something that three out of four Presidents have done--who now can't get a job, can't get a business license, and can't move his family to a better home.  This is not justice. This is not the America I know we are. This is about the mother I stood next to with her child who had Dravet syndrome--who fell into seizure after seizure multiple times a day--who was a marijuana refugee, leaving a State that didn't end prohibition to go to a State that had medical marijuana laws. According to Jeff Sessions, she is a criminal.  This is not our This is not the land of truth and justice to treat a parent like that--like a criminal. This is about families and communities that too long have been fractured by the inaction of this body to address the overcriminalization of our country. This is about the very values people fight for and stand for. This is about who we will be. We cannot fall into this Nation where the privileged and the elite have certain laws and the poor and the struggling have others.  What Jeff Sessions did today is unconscionable, unacceptable, and I will fight against it because when I go home, I see the communities in struggle. I can't turn my head and not understand that there are millions of Americans who are hurting from this decades-long War on  This is a self-inflicted wound that goes deep to the bone of our country. It undermines our health and well-being, and too many suffer because of it. We have to fight. I feel this sense of hopefulness because around this country, Democrats and Republicans on the State level are making changes. They are marching forward. They are undoing past wrongs. I feel a sense of hope and promise, and even though today we were delivered a painful blow by our Federal Government to cast a shadow against every American citizen who is using medical marijuana--every American citizen who is doing things Senators have done--I still know that truth will go marching on. I still know we are a nation of justice. I know we are better than this, and I know what our future holds.  I ask my colleagues to reject this action by the Attorney General, to speak out against this devastating reality. There are Senators here who represent States where the people have spoken. It is now time we speak for the people. It is now time we speak for our country's ideals. It is now time we don't just speak the words of our pledge but we make this country, in truth, a nation of liberty and justice for all.  Thank you.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

679,topic-id,572,"Mr.President, I rise to highlight the positive impacts our historic tax reform law will have on the agricultural community.  Agriculture is Arkansas' largest industry by far, adding $16 billion to our economy every year and accounting for approximately one in every six jobs. We are the top rice-producing State in the Nation, 2 in the Nation in broiler chicken production, and the third largest producer of catfish in the United We could also clothe and shelter ourselves from fiber grown in Arkansas, as we are the third in the Nation in cotton production and the fifth largest softwood lumber-producing You could keep going down the list, and you would find Arkansas as one of the Nation's top 10 producers of a number of agricultural commodities.  Clearly, ensuring that Washington helps create an economic environment that allows the agricultural industry to thrive is extremely important to my home State of When President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, his signature provided much needed tax relief to America's farmers. More than 94 percent of farms are organized as passthrough businesses, which means they are impacted by the same tax provisions as individual filers. Lower tax rates across the board and a 20-percent deduction from their taxable income means immediate savings, which can be reinvested to help grow their operations.  Ninety seven percent of the farms in Arkansas are family owned, and the vast majority of them will now be exempt from the estate tax--the death tax. This is a big deal. It will help keep those farms and ranches in the family for generations to come.  Finally, farmers and ranchers will be able to expense 100 percent of their capital investments, such as equipment, over the next 4 years. In his address to the Farm Bureau earlier this week, the President called this the ``sleeper'' in the bill. He is right. People don't realize and there hasn't been enough talk about how beneficial this provision will be for our family-run agricultural operations. The substance of the President's Farm Bureau speech tilted heavily toward our efforts to bring stability and predictability to the economy.  As we have witnessed over the course of the previous administration, uncertainty is devastating to our economy. There are few industries that are inherently more affected by uncertainty than agriculture. This is why we have taken steps to eliminate some of the punitive, needless regulations that create uncertainty for our farmers and our ranchers.  It is also why my colleagues and I on the Agriculture Committee, under the steadfast leadership of Chairman Roberts, are working hard to reauthorize the farm bill. Programs are authorized by the farm bill that are absolutely vital to farmers, ranchers, and consumers. These programs will provide more certainty in rural America to address the challenges ahead. Finally, it is why we took great care to ensure that the agricultural industry will see the benefits of tax reform. Establishing a tax code that works for our farmers and ranchers, as opposed to against them, is vital to their ability to plan for the future and invigorate our rural communities.  I am proud of our efforts to pass this landmark tax reform law, and I am[[Page S124]]confident it will have lasting, positive effects for our economy.  With that, I yield back.

To recognize the significant milestone, the community is organizing a year-long celebration that highlights its rich history, its citizens, and its future.

To recognize his efforts, the Bass Reeves Legacy Initiative raised money to honor him with a monument in the community's downtown.  Reeves' career is well documented, as are the stories of Fort Smith during this period. In 1968, Charles Portis depicted Fort Smith's role in taming the West in his book ``True Grit,'' which portrays a teenage girl's efforts to avenge her father's death with a U.Marshal by her side.  The bond between the community and the U.Marshals Service is strong and continues today, as Fort Smith will be the home of the future U.Marshals Museum scheduled to open in 2019. Part of its collection will include a gun and badge that belonged to Bass  The national historic site and other organizations have done an exceptional job of keeping the community's history alive. Promoting its history in this way will also have positive benefits for the future. Fort Smith is a city with an incredible story to tell in its faith communities, its schools, its industries, its arts, and its culture.  The community is marking its bicentennial with events throughout the year that include an attempt to break the world record for a lip dub video at the Old Fort Days Rodeo Parade and the city's first fort building competition for kids.  I was pleased to contribute to the time capsule, and I am looking forward to seeing many old friends at our high school reunion. A lot has changed since my days at Northside High School as a Grizzly, but the steadfast resilience and spirit of the citizens of Fort Smith have remained.  I am proud to be a native of Fort Smith and look forward to the events during this year-long celebration. It is home to a growing university, new medical school, and vibrant new industries.  I know Fort Smith is starting the 21st century on a solid foundation. We have much to celebrate from the past, but even more to look forward to in the future. We are forever grateful to the men and women who have encouraged the community's progress and implemented their ideas to shape the city for the next generation.  Jerry Stewart is one such leader, who led a life dedicated to public service. He had a successful career as a pulmonologist and served as CEO of Cooper Clinic, leading the growth and development of one of the region's top medical care providers. After his retirement, he helped underserved patients at the Good Samaritan Clinic in River Valley Primary  He was well respected in the medical community and admired for his influence beyond the walls of the clinic.

1820,topic-id,638,"Thank you, Mr.As you know, our Chamber is focused on a heavy subject at the moment--human trafficking.  An estimated 25 million people are victims of human trafficking all around the world. Smuggling people for forced labor and sex slavery is a heinous crime. It is the kind of crime that we tend to think happens in some far-off place, but these atrocities are happening all across the globe--sadly, including, unfortunately, here in the United In fact, human trafficking appears to be on the rise in our country, according to data released by Polaris, which shows a 13-percent jump in cases reported to the help lines it runs.  Since Polaris began operating over 10 years ago, its help lines have received reports of 203 cases of human trafficking from my home State of Almost half of those were reported in the last 2 years. Fortunately, our State is fighting back. Last year, Arkansas legislators approved a law requiring State-licensed truckers to be trained in spotting the red flags of human trafficking. Using their position on the road, these drivers have the tools to recognize the signs of human trafficking and alert the authorities to any suspicious activity.  Congress is also increasing its efforts to combat human trafficking. In September, the Senate unanimously passed two pieces of legislation to renew existing programs in support of survivors and help bring perpetrators of these horrific crimes to justice.  The Abolish Human Trafficking Act provides more resources to law enforcement in its effort to combat human trafficking and establishes human trafficking justice coordinators at every U.attorney's office and at the Department of In addition, the legislation helps survivors rebuild their lives by extending the Department of Justice Domestic Trafficking Victims'  The Trafficking Victims Protection Act reauthorizes key programs to help survivors in their recovery, as well as offering specialized training on human trafficking to judges and Federal investigators.  We have made progress, but more needs to be done, and the legislation on the floor this week will help by giving law enforcement and prosecutors additional tools to crack down on crimes involving exploitation of the vulnerable. It will help us to take on nefarious actors like Backpage, which hid behind the Communications Decency Act to avoid prosecution for trafficking crimes.  It is time to rip the cover away from these bad actors. We are going to do that by making narrowly crafted changes to the law to ensure that websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking online are held accountable. ``Knowingly'' is the keyword here.  During the last session of Congress, the Homeland Security Committee, under the leadership of Senators Portman, McCaskill, and Johnson, uncovered just how much Backpage knew. It was a lot. In fact, Backpage's operators helped customers modify their ads to hide references to underage prostitutes. I think we can all agree that rises to the threshold of knowingly facilitating sex trafficking online.  Should this bill pass--and I believe it will in a very bipartisan way--these bad actors will not be able to fade quietly into the dark, as we are going to give State attorneys general the authority to prosecute websites that violate sex trafficking laws. That is why I support this bill. That is why I cosponsored similar legislation here in the It is also why I supported the inclusion of at least $90 million in Federal funding to combat human trafficking. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue to support funding for these important programs, and I look forward to the Senate's completing work on fiscal year 2018 funding bills.

In Congress, I have made returning land from the Federal Government to our territorial government of Guam and Guam families a top priority. Since 2003, I have secured return of more than 1,000 acres from the Federal Government to the people of  My Guam Land Return Act of 2018 would reduce Federal landownership on Guam and return those lands to GovGuam and, ultimately, our people. This important legislation builds upon the work of my predecessors, former Congressman Robert Underwood, in particular.  The Guam Land Return Act would authorize the General Services Administration to transfer Federal land, buildings, vehicles, and other heavy equipment designated as surplus to GovGuam at no cost to the taxpayers. This would provide another avenue for the Federal Government to compensate GovGuam for expenses that our territorial government is required to bear in serving migrants under the Compact of Free Association, known as Compact It would also ask Federal agencies to return more Federal land to GovGuam more quickly.  The Federal Government must finally live up to its commitment to Guam and other affected U.jurisdictions with Compact migrant residents. I continue working to secure full Federal reimbursements for GovGuam's costs in providing local services to Compact migrants.

Since January of 2011, the Defense Department has returned approximately 686 acres to  My Guam Land Return Act holds the Defense Department accountable for meeting the net-negative commitment in full. This legislation would require the Secretary of Defense to maintain a public inventory of all land parcels the Defense Department expects to ultimately transfer to GovGuam under the net-negative commitment.  My legislation outlines 17 specific Federal land parcels, totalling 476 acres that should be transferred to The Guam Land Reform Act would also provide a public mechanism for the Governor of Guam to petition the Defense Department to consider transferring additional land parcels to GovGuam under the net-negative commitment.  Lastly, my legislation includes several provisions relating to current and former Federal land on Two provisions ensure that no-cost transfers of surplus Federal land and other valuable property do not create additional liabilities or public safety concerns for the Federal Government relating to environmental cleanup or flight paths for air traffic control. One section removes an antiquated Federal restriction on 927 acres on Guam's Cabras Island, which GovGuam has owned since 1981.  The people of Guam are patriotic Americans and support our military servicemembers and their families and the Nation's veterans, and at the same time, the people of Guam want to see their ancestral lands returned, and rightfully so.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-19-pt1-PgH1657.txt,1723,A NEW DIRECTION,2018.0,19.0,March

345,topic-id,1843,"Mr.President, I thank Senators Whitehouse and Blumenthal for their remarks.                  Children's Health Insurance Program  Mr.President, it has been 100 days since this Congress allowed the Children's Health Insurance Program to expire. Congress did nothing in September, October, November, and December, and now we are more than a week into January--100 days of anxiety for parents, 100 days of wondering if their kids will be kicked off their coverage, 100 days of worrying if they will be able to afford their child's prescriptions or worrying whether they can take them to the doctor if they get the flu.  Members of Congress--new Members, such as Senators Smith and Jones, Members like Senator Hatch, who has been here for 40 years, and all of us--have healthcare paid for by taxpayers.  We remember the discussion of the tax bill written down the hall in the office of Majority Leader The Senate found plenty of time in December to pass a massive handout for corporations. The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Florida, has since questioned whether too much of this bill went to corporate interests. More than 80 percent of the tax cut bill went to the richest 1 percent.  In addition, we know it was a massive handout for corporations that sent jobs overseas. We are going to see more companies shut down in Mansfield, Lima, Zanesville, Chillicothe, Portsmouth, and in big cities like Columbus, Cleveland, and We are going to see more plants close and move overseas because this Senate and the House passed a tax bill that encourages more corporations to ship jobs overseas. All the while, this body couldn't be bothered to give families more than a short-term funding Band-Aid for CHIP, which experts have said will not even last the last 3 months they promised.  I applaud the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Florida, for his efforts to enlarge at least some of the tax bill to put more money into the pockets of working families, particularly low-income working families. It was not enough, but at least some effort was made.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are reporting that some States will run out of money by January 19, next week. In my State of Ohio, 209,000 children rely on Who are these kids? These are sons and daughters of Ohioans, who are working, in most cases, making $8, $10, or $12 an hour. They are the sons and daughters of parents who don't have insurance not because they aren't working as hard or harder than we do, but they don't have insurance simply because their parents happen to work at a job where they are not provided insurance.  There are 209,000 Ohio children who rely on CHIP, a program that has been bipartisan for 20 years. It was without controversy in the past. Families in some States already got letters last year and early this year warning them that their children could lose their healthcare.  Think about these families. The parents of some of these millions of children around the country come home from work, working in a $10-an-hour job, not making a lot of money. They are working every bit as hard as we do. They go to the mailbox and see a letter from their State government. I will read one of these letters, a copy of which went to tens of thousands of parents: Because Congress has not acted yet, we need to let you know there is a chance that the CHIP Program may have to be shut down. In other words, there is a chance that your children's health insurance will be cut off.  Remember, this is because of the inaction in this body. This is because Senators, who have insurance paid for by taxpayers, would rather vote for tax cuts, would rather do whatever we do all day instead of renewing the Children's Health Insurance  This letter goes on: If Congress does not renew Federal funds for CHIP in time, you will get another letter in January telling you your benefits will end.  So first, it is a warning. Some parents got this warning right around They are already struggling financially. They are not giving their children nearly as much as they want for Christmas because they are making $8, $10, or $12 an hour. They are just trying to stay above water. They are just trying to raise their kids. They get a letter like this at Christmastime saying: If Congress doesn't act, there is really bad news; your kids are going to lose their insurance. Then the same letter says: If Congress doesn't act, in January you will get another letter saying your insurance is cut off.  It is already an expensive time of year. There is record cold in Several of our grandchildren live in Columbus, one of them in Croix, and two in Providence, When a number of our grandchildren were around, it was too cold to go outside. It was that kind of winter in The day after Christmas, temperatures dropped to single digits for 5, 6, or 7 days running. Families are paying more for their heating bill. At Christmastime, of course, it is more expensive. Now their government adds to this list of worries.  How do they plan their budget for this year if they don't know whether or not they will have to shell out thousands of dollars more for care for their kids? Remember, 9 million children are at risk because of Republican inaction.  Senator Portman, my Republican colleague from Ohio, and I and almost every other Senator on the Finance Committee voted to move forward on CHIP, to renew it for these 9 million children for 5 years. That was a good thing. It passed out of committee, but Senator McConnell, for whatever reason, didn't think this was important enough to actually put it on the floor, move on it, and get it to the  I have no idea if the President will sign it. I don't think he knows much about the Children's Health Insurance Program, but I assume his advisers will say that it is probably a good idea to sign it. But he hasn't had a chance to sign it because the majority leader doesn't think this bill is important enough--that these 9 million children are important enough--that Congress should take action.  These are often families with two working parents. They might make $8, $10, or $12 an hour, but they are working in jobs where they are not lucky enough to have health insurance. They work for companies or many for small businesses that, for whatever reason, can't afford it. Whatever the reason, they are working for companies that don't offer health insurance coverage[[Page S101]]for their families, or they are families with children with special needs.  I have introduced to my colleagues before Crystal This is Crystal's son Noble, a first-grader in Dublin, OH, a small, prosperous suburb west and northwest of  I met Crystal and Noble last year, when they made the trip from Ohio to Washington to talk to Members of Congress about Crystal's life is not easy because she is taking care of a child with a disability whom she so clearly and dearly loves. I could see, watching Noble, how much he loves his mother and how important they are to each other.  Noble was born with a rare genetic disorder. He needs three therapy sessions every week. He gets daily hormone injections. His medications cost $1,500 a month. I talked to Crystal when she visited. I talked to her again. We talked about how she and her family are scared to death about what will happen to them if Congress doesn't save  This is not difficult. Congress has renewed it every year for 20 years. It is bipartisan. It has never had much of any opposition. There are a lot of people like Noble's mother. Crystal said CHIP is ``the difference between living a middle class lifestyle, or being part of the poverty line.''  Congress had time to hand out massive permanent tax cuts to the richest Americans and the biggest corporations that send job overseas, but it could only manage to scrape together just a little short-term 3 months of funding for these families.  It is really what is wrong with this city. Folks here listen too much to the lobbyists. I remember--and the Presiding Officer remembers, too--seeing the stream of lobbyists from drug companies, from insurance companies, from the big banks, and from the oil industry, in and out of Senator McConnell's office, writing a tax bill. We remember that from just a couple of months ago. But for some reason, Crystal and Noble couldn't get in that line--the line of lobbyists asking for huge tax breaks, saving billions of dollars for their employers while these lobbyists are paid very well. But, frankly, there was nobody having the political wherewithal to convince the majority leader that we ought to move on the CHIP bill.  Healthcare for our kids shouldn't be controversial. It never was until this recent Senate and until this recent President was sworn in. It shouldn't be partisan. It should be easy. It is a program created 20 years ago. It was bipartisan. It has always been bipartisan. It still has bipartisan support today, except that the Speaker of the House down the hall and the majority leader a little closer to us just simply don't want to pass it.  We passed the CHIP extension out of the Finance It is ready to go. Republican leaders could put it on the floor today, and it would pass. I am guessing that it would pass with no more than 5 or 10 ``no'' votes.  I want my colleagues to explain to Noble's mother Crystal and to explain to other mothers and fathers like her why corporate tax cuts are more important than their children's health.  This is about whose side you are on. Do we work for the corporations that send our jobs overseas, do we work for those companies that line up hungrily for tax breaks, or do we work for families who just want the peace of mind so they can take their kids to the doctor?  It is past time for folks in Congress, with taxpayer-funded healthcare, to do their jobs and extend I don't want more families to get a letter like this from their capital city, from the Department of Welfare or the Department of Job and Family Services, whatever it is in each community in each I don't want any more parents to go to the mailbox, to open this letter, and to have that fear and anxiety hit them in their gut, thinking: Oh, my God, my children's health insurance may be canceled.  We can do better than that.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.

1083,topic-id,885,"Mr.President, 10 years ago today, March 14, Bear Stearns was on the verge of collapse. Despite its 85-year history, despite its relationship with nearly every bank on Wall Street, the bank suddenly found itself on the brink. On this very day, March 14, Bear Stearns lost $3.5 billion in market value. The bank was in the midst of a free fall. In the course of one week, Bear Stearns went from trading for $65 per share to being bought for $2 a share in a sweetheart deal orchestrated by the Fed over the course of a weekend. Nearly overnight, one of Wall Street's most prestigious, almost 100-year-old banks fell apart.  Across the country, families sat at their kitchen tables and started to wonder: Will one of us lose our job? Will we have to move? Will we be able to retire? Will we lose our house? Will we be able to send our kids to college? On this day 10 years ago--March 14, 2008--a headline from CNN read: ``Job Losses: The Worst in Five Years.'' The story talked about how the economy was hemorrhaging jobs. The article warned that the crisis was building, quoting one analyst who said the real estate and credit crunch ``was whipping its way through the U.economy like a Midwestern tornado.''  In hindsight, we know that things would get a lot worse before they got better.[[Page S1724]]  Some people say nobody could have possibly seen this coming. Some people say the 2008 financial crisis was like the weather--like that Midwestern tornado--something out of control that we wouldn't have seen, but we know better.  Advocates in communities--the people who are actually dealing with the consequences of this crisis--were sounding the alarm. For years before the crisis, they predicted what would happen if Washington didn't rein in Wall Street, and clearly they were right.  A few people in Washington, like Ned Gramlich, saw the problem for what it was; that Washington didn't stop the crisis, after it began, after it intensified--Congress at least responded. We passed a law that created important protections for the financial system, for taxpayers, for homeowners to hold banks and watchdogs accountable to prevent another crisis, but Wall Street wasn't even close to being ready to quit. There was no contrition. Nobody went to jail. In fact, on the day that President Obama signed Wall Street reform--what we know as Dodd-Frank--on the day that bill was signed into law, the top financial service lobbyists in this town said: Now it is half time.  Now, what would that mean: Now it is half time? It meant they lost the first half. They lost the battle where people in this Congress actually had the guts and the backbone and sloughed off their campaign contributions and were unwilling to listen to bank lobbyists tell them what to do. They stood up to the bank lobbyists and stood up to Wall Street and they did the right thing, but this lobbyist said it was half time. So the lobbyists lost the first half, but they were back at it, going to the regulators, trying to convince the regulators to weaken the rules and not implement the bill.  Not long ago, another bank lobbyist told us their game plan: ``We don't want a seat at the table, we want the whole table.'' This bill gives them that. The same group that warned us about the last crisis--this is what I ask my colleagues to listen to. The same group that warned us about the last crisis or that were the regulators who tried to fix the last crisis--those same people are opposed to the bill the Senate is considering today.

Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from two of these financial experts.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             The Volcker Alliance,                             Working for Effective Government,                                                February 21, 2018.       Dear Senator Brown: I appreciate your letter seeking my      views on the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer      Protection Act, 2155. I am pleased that the Senate Banking      Committee has forged ahead with meaningful, bipartisan      financial reform to ease the unnecessary regulatory strain on      small banks, helping them flourish as an engine of economic      prosperity. I appreciate your leadership and dedication, and      that of Senator Crapo, to this bill over the last two years      and congratulate the bipartisan coalition of senators on the      Committee who have worked diligently to advance this      legislation.       Your letter sought my views on three sections of the bill.      Specifically: (1) Section 401, which would exempt some      important banks from stringent prudential standards, such as      those for capital, leverage, stress testing, and resolution      planning; (2) Section 402, which would relax leverage      limitations on custodial banks; and (3) Section 203, which      would exempt small banks from the Volcker Rule ban on      proprietary trading. I offer the following observations and      possible alternatives for your consideration.       First, section 401 would raise from $50 billion to $250      billion the asset threshold at which banks begin to face      increasingly tougher prudential standards. Eight years      following the passage of Dodd-Frank, it is appropriate to      reexamine whether the $50 billion asset threshold is set too      low. Indeed, there may be an opportunity to raise it without      endangering financial stability. However, an increase to $250      billion would go too far. It would have the effect of      substantially reducing the regulation of 25 of the 38 largest      banks to which these standards now apply, notably including      the operating subsidiaries of several large foreign banks.       Clearly the distress or failure of some of these banks      could trigger reactions spreading broadly to the financial      system. To take specific examples, Countrywide, National      City, and GMAC, standing well below the $250 billion mark, in      fact, required billions of dollars in official capital      assistance and debt guarantees either for themselves or their      acquiring institutions. Failure of the large U.operating      subsidiaries of foreign banks could pose similar risk. I urge      consideration[[Page S1725]]     of raising the threshold to, say, $100 billion but building      in additional flexibility for regulators to implement the      standards below that.       Second, section 402 is a highly technical provision that      relates to so-called custodial banks, institutions that      specialize in safeguarding assets of their clients, including      mutual funds, pension funds, asset managers, and other      institutions. Given their size and importance to the      financial system, some such banks, of which the sizable BNY      Mellon and State Street stand out, are required to maintain a      minimum supplementary leverage ratio (``SLR''), a measure of      equity capital to total exposure.       Section 402 would mandate bank regulators to amend their      regulations to allow ``custodial banks'' to exclude deposits      they hold at the Federal Reserve and certain other central      banks when calculating their While there may be reasons      to adjust the SLR calculation for custodial banks, including      during a crisis to facilitate the banks' ability to serve as      a safe-haven for deposits, regulators already have broad      authority to make those adjustments. They also are best      positioned to decide how and when to exercise that      discretion.       Section 402 does so preemptively, reducing leverage capital      requirements for at least two of the most systemically      important custodial banks by as much as 30 percent at a time      when they should be building their capital cushion. It also      would put Congress under pressure to expand the exclusion.      Claims will be sure to arise that other banks in competition      with the big custodial banks should have similar capital      relief: that temptation should be resisted.       Finally, section 203 would exempt from the Volcker Rule      banks with assets of less than $10 billion and whose trading      assets and liabilities are no more than five percent of total      assets. I'm in strong agreement with the aim of reducing      unnecessary regulatory burdens on traditional community      banks, not just from the Volcker Rule, but also more broadly.      Community banks play a vital role in serving the needs of      small businesses and do not require the full panoply of      regulation or frequent full-scale examination.       An alternative to section 203 would be to simply relieve      small banks from demonstrating compliance with the rule,      while, at the same time tasking the bank regulators in their      normal supervisory roles to detect persistent violations and      demand remediation. This would have the advantage of      preventing a small bank or a group of small banks protected      by the Federal bank ``safety net'' from benefitting from      risky proprietary trading activity. I know from my long      experience in banking and savings and loan regulation that      plausibly small loopholes can be ``gamed'' and exploited with      unfortunate consequences.       I thank you for the opportunity to comment on this      important piece of legislation and look forward to its swift      passage.

With the pending consideration of      2155 by the full Senate, I wanted to take this opportunity to      reiterate some of the points about the regulatory structure      we have discussed in the past, especially as they apply to      this bill.       While 2155 begins from the sound premise that some      refinements are desirable in the way various statutory      requirements have been tailored, I have a number of      disagreements with specifics of the bill. Rather than      rehearse all of those, I want to focus on the three features      that raise particular concerns about financial stability, in      hopes that they could be omitted or at least clarified. As I      will explain in more detail below, I would urge the following      changes:       1. Clarification that banking organizations with assets      between $100 and $250 billion will continue to be subject to      the annual stress test and CCAR process of the Federal      Reserve;       2. Clarification that the higher section 165 threshold      established by the bill applies to the worldwide assets of      foreign banking organizations; and       3. Deletion of Section 402 of the bill, which would make      certain changes to leverage ratio requirements.       With respect to the first two of these changes, while there      is widespread--though by no means universal--agreement that      the $50 billion level is too low a threshold for many of the      section 165 requirements, there is considerable disagreement      over how much it should be raised. There is a case to be made      for the $250 billion level chosen in 2155, though      personally I think that is too high. In considering how to      raise the threshold, the most important consideration is to      align enhanced prudential standards with the risks to safety      and soundness and financial stability actually associated      with various groups of banks.       As you know, I have for several years advocated a limited      number of changes to the statutory thresholds established in      the Dodd-Frank Act for certain additional regulatory      requirements. My reason for suggesting these changes was my      conclusion, both from my own analysis and from discussions      with supervisory staff when I was still a member of the Board      of Governors of the Federal Reserve, that the benefits of      some of the important prudential requirements added by Dodd-     Frank were considerably less significant for the smaller      banks within the range established by the different      thresholds. In these instances, it seems better policy to      allocate more of the risk management and compliance resources      of banks, and of the supervisory resources of the banking      agencies, to the important risks actually faced by banks of a      certain size and activity mix. For instance, the expense      incurred by small banks with minimal trading assets and      liabilities just to ensure that they are complying with      Volcker Rule regulatory exemptions seems quite      disproportionate to any safety and soundness benefits.       When it comes to the threshold for the more stringent      prudential standards mandated by Section 165 of Dodd-Frank,      this same calculation should apply. That is, which of these      requirements deliver significant safety and soundness      benefits for particular sizes of banks? The answer, I      concluded after several years of experience, is that the 165      requirements deliver relatively small benefits for the safety      and soundness of banks that currently have between $50 and      $100 billion in assets, and many deliver only moderate      benefits for banks somewhat above that size. For example,      special liquidity requirements (on top of normal supervisory      assessments of liquidity management) seemed of limited      prudential utility for medium-sized commercial banks engaged      in the conventional business of taking deposits and making      loans.       But 2155 calls into question the post-crisis prudential      measure that is essential for the safety and soundness of      these banks, and for the stability of the financial system in      the face of major asset shocks. Section 401(e) of the bill as      reported out of Committee instructs the Federal Reserve to      conduct supervisory stress tests of banks with between $100      and $250 billion ``on a periodic basis.'' This provision is      obviously meant to indicate that these banks are not exempted      from the stress testing requirements created by Section 165.      Yet the provision is quite vague, with little indication of      what kind of test is contemplated for these banks. This      language might be interpreted benignly, simply to indicate      that this set of banks will remain in the stress testing      program even though they will have been removed from other      section 165 requirements. Of more concern is an      interpretation that these banks not be in the stress test      every year, though the results of the test--whenever it is      conducted--could still be used as the analytic basis for the      general authority of federal banking agencies to set capital      requirements on a bank specific basis. And then there is a      very troublesome interpretation that these banks not be in      the current Federal Reserve stress testing process, including      the Comprehensive Capital Annual Review (CCAR). Instead, they      would be in some different, ill-defined kind of stress      testing program.       Although liquidity and concentration limits beyond those      applicable under pre-existing statutory requirements for      insured depository institutions are only obliquely related to      the risks faced by banks currently in this size range,      capital shortfalls are a risk. Loans gone bad, with the      resulting impairment of capital positions, are the principal      risk associated with the traditional lending that dominates      the activities of most of these banks.       A number of banks of this size received TARP funds in late      2008 in order to buttress their capital positions. While      other, smaller banks also received TARP funds, the difference      is precisely in the aggregate size of this group of banks.      Together, just the domestically owned firms falling in this      range hold $1.5 trillion in assets (compared to less than      $300 billion in assets for those between $50 and $100      billion). There is good reason to believe that these regional      lending institutions share the risks associated with shocks      to commercial real estate prices, residential real estate      prices, and the financial situation of consumers. Thus there      could also be systemic implications of stress among this      group of banks. The current CCAR program of the Federal      Reserve helps build the resiliency of banks to these serious      problems, thereby decreasing the chances of systemic stress      or the unavailability of lending to even creditworthy      businesses and households that results when the capital      positions of banks are compromised.       To remove this protective measure would be to undermine a      key achievement of the post-crisis period. Accordingly, as      the first feature of the bill that should be changed, I urge      the Senate, should it proceed with this legislation, to      remove any ambiguity as to whether these banks will remain in      the quantitative side of the CCAR program on an annual basis.      The Federal Reserve has already exempted these banks from the      qualitative part of the CCAR and has taken steps to simplify      some of the procedural and reporting requirements associated      with it. I suspect the Board of Governors would be amenable      to doing more along these lines. But we should not risk the      improvement in[[Page S1726]]     the resiliency of the U.financial system that the stress      testing program has brought about by ensuring that regulatory      capital requirements take into account the changing economic      and financial risks faced by sizeable banks that together      provide credit to large proportions of American households      and businesses.       The second feature of the bill that raises concerns of a      systemic nature is also related to the $250 billion      threshold, as it applies to foreign banking organizations      operating in the United As you know, since the      financial crisis the Board of Governors has required certain      foreign banking organizations with more than $50 billion in      assets other than branch assets to establish intermediate      holding companies in the United (Some foreign banking      organizations already had such holding companies.) In raising      the $50 billion threshold to $250 billion, the bill may raise      the question as to whether foreign banking organizations with      less than $250 billion must now be excluded from the      application of section 165 requirements.       I should say first that I do not think this is the best      reading of the wording of 2155. That is, I think the best      reading is that worldwide assets of large foreign banks are      be the basis for determining if they are covered by section      165, with the Board of Governors having continuing authority      to determine what level of U.assets of these large global      banks is the appropriate threshold for section 165 regulatory      measures promulgated in its regulations. I understand that      Chairman Powell indicated something along these lines in his      Senate testimony last week. However, it does appear that      there are other interpretations being advanced, including by      Secretary Mnuchin, whose testimony before the Senate Banking      Committee in January seemed to suggest that foreign banking      organizations with between $50 and $250 billion in assets in      the United States would be exempted from Section 165      prudential measures by 2155.       This result would be a grave regulatory mistake, one that      is almost incomprehensible in light of experience during the      financial crisis and the profile of many large foreign      banking organizations in the United States today. As I      explained above, many of the special section 165 requirements      are not especially relevant to nearly all the U.banks      currently holding less than $250 billion in assets. But that      is precisely because they are traditional commercial banks,      taking deposits and making loans. The U.operations of many      foreign banking organizations, on the other hand, contain      substantial proportions of assets in broker dealers and other      non-traditional-banking operations, where funding runs,      cross-activity counterparty exposures, and resolution      challenges are very significant risks. Indeed, the broker-     dealer operations of many of these banks are more significant      in the United States than in their home countries. They are      also susceptible to having their parents seek dollars from      them in order to meet obligations of parts of the foreign      banking organizations outside the United       Moreover, in sheer dollar terms, the group of foreign      banking organizations with between $100 and $250 billion is a      very important part of the U.financial system, holding      about $1.4 trillion in assets. Some of the foreign banking      organizations falling in this category are among those that      were most affected by the financial crisis; some have      encountered significant problems since then. U.regulators      do not have a window into the global liquidity positions, or      authority over the global risk management practices, of these      firms.       Again, like Chairman Powell I believe the best reading of      2155 is that it does not affect the authority of the      Federal Reserve to apply section 165 standards, as      appropriate, on foreign banking organizations with over $250      billion in worldwide assets--the change from current law      being that it would not be required to do so for foreign      banking organizations with between $50 and $250 billion in      worldwide assets. But, given the enormous gap in the      regulation of systemically important foreign banking      operations in the United States that would result from a      different interpretation by a regulator or court in the      future, it is very important that this ambiguity be      clarified. In an environment in which judicial deference to      the interpretation of a possibly ambiguous statute by the      administering agency is no longer so predictable, it is      incumbent on Congress to eliminate such ambiguity wherever      possible.       The third feature of the bill that raises potentially      systemic concerns is section 402, which contains an oddly      and, I think, inappropriately targeted change in the leverage      ratio applied by the banking agencies. Removing funds      deposited with central banks from the denominator of the      leverage ratio only for banks ``predominantly engaged'' in      the custody business is troublesome for at least two reasons.       First, removing any assets from the denominator risks      sliding down the slippery slope of removing others. While      central bankers may argue their interests in not having      monetary policy affected at all, treasuries and finance      ministries may then argue their interests in not having      sovereign debt included. And, as we have already seen in the      Treasury Department's report in June 2017, some will go even      further, such as by arguing that margins posted in central      clearing facilities should be excluded, presumably to      encourage more central clearing. While these proposed      exclusions may be justified on the ground that the assets in      question are utterly risk-free (a clearly incorrect      proposition for central clearing margin), that argument      misconstrues the rationale of a leverage ratio, which is      precisely to serve as a backup mode of capital regulation by      measuring and controlling total leverage, not riskiness.      Going down this path of excluding assets from the denominator      would, in addition to being ill-advised legislative policy,      threaten the post-crisis improvement in the leverage of major      U.banks.       Second, it is hard to see the rationale for excluding a      particular type of asset from the denominator of the leverage      ratio only by reference to a bank's dominant form of activity      in ``custody, safekeeping, and asset servicing.'' Banks other      than custody banks engage in this activity. Taking this kind      of approach is very much out of keeping with the      traditional--and wise--practice of Congress in avoiding      legislating the details of capital requirements. It will      invite lobbying efforts for changing other details and,      thereby, risk both the coherence and the integrity of      regulatory capital requirements.       As I think you know, I am sympathetic to the situation of      State Street and Bank of New But, as I have suggested      previously, there is a much sounder way to address that      situation. Their difficulties stem from the fact that the 2%      enhanced supplemental leverage ratio add-on is applicable to      all eight systemically important U.banks, whereas the      risk-weighted capital surcharge varies based on the systemic      importance of each bank. Thus State Street and Bank of New      York have, in effect, higher leverage ratio ``surcharges''      than they do risk-weighted surcharges. This reverses what      should be, and has been, the traditional role of the leverage      ratio as a back-up to guard against excessive leverage build      up in good economic times that can come to grief in bad ones      (though the crisis revealed the pre-crisis leverage ratio      requirement, like risk-weighted capital requirements, to be      insufficiently robust). Modifying the enhanced supplemental      leverage ratio requirement by stipulating that it would not      exceed the risk-weighted surcharge, or by making it      proportional to that surcharge would be a much more      defensible policy approach.       My understanding, based on public statements from Federal      Reserve officials, is that the banking agencies are planning      to make changes to the leverage ratio. I anticipate that      those changes will relieve the State Street and Bank of New      York situations, though I hope without going so far as to      erode the value of the leverage ratio more generally by      encouraging the untrammeled growth of repo and other short-     term, runnable funding back closer to pre-crisis levels. In      any case, this anticipated action by the regulatory agencies      should address the situation of the clearings banks without      the damage to the framework for capital regulation which that      Section 402 would entail.       To recapitulate: In the interests of protecting financial      stability and guarding against systemic risk, I would urge      the Senate to:       1. Make clear that banks with between $100 and $250 billion      in assets will continue to subject to CCAR stress testing and      resulting capital distribution constraints;       2. Make clear that foreign banking organizations with $250      billion or more in worldwide assets are subject to more      stringent prudential restraints within the discretion of the      Board of Governors; and       3. Remove Section 402.       Thank you for your consideration of these admittedly      lengthy comments on 2155. As always, please let me know if      I can be of any further assistance.

1085,topic-id,1211,"So the question is, Why do we ignore these pleas? Let's recap the problems with this legislation.  First, the bill puts American taxpayers at risk of another bank bailout. It weakens stress tests for all large banks. In spite of what my colleagues say, everybody that has commented on this bill--so many experts that have commented on this bill understand that this is not just about community banks; it is not just about the regional midsized that go up to $250 billion. We can stress test for all large banks; JPMorgan Chase, $2.5 trillion in assets; Bank of America, $2.3 trillion; Wells Fargo, $1.9 trillion. As if they haven't had enough--done enough, made enough mistakes, violated the public trust enough times. Citigroup, $1.9 trillion. These four banks--JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup--hold 51 percent, more than half of all industry assets, $8.6 trillion.  These banks have had a really good run since the crisis, since the bailout. Remember, people didn't go to jail even though people in my ZIP Code, in my community, in my State and in Pennsylvania and all over the country--people lost savings, their homes, and their jobs. These banks, which are more profitable than they have ever been in the last couple of years, got a huge tax break just last December, and now we are doing them a favor by weakening the stress test. All the country's biggest banks took about[[Page S1727]]$239 billion in taxpayer bailouts. Without rigorous annual stress tests, taxpayers can once again be on the hook if too-big-to-fail banks collapse and we don't have the right tools in place to see it coming.  Second, this bill opens the door to weaker oversight of foreign megabanks operating in the United States, the same banks that repeatedly violated U.law. These are banks like Deutsche Bank in Germany, the Trump business organization's personal bank; Santander in Spain, Barclays in Britain, Credit Suisse, and UBS in These are banks that violated Iran sanctions. They are banks that repossessed cars from American service men and women who were serving overseas. These are banks that were fined by the Federal Government, and we are doing these foreign banks a favor in this bill.  Third, with the change of just one word, this bill forces the Fed to weaken the rules even for the largest banks with more than $250 billion in assets. Former CFTC Chair Gary Gensler wrote to the Senate this month and said this change ``may subject the government to additional lobbying and possible litigation from individual banks seeking specially tailored rules.''  We know all of these regulators put in place by the Trump administration--most of them with ties to Wall Street, and we know the White House now looks like an executive retreat for Wall Street executives--we know these regulators are going to bend over backward for the big banks, and if they don't, they are going to be sued by the foreign banks and by other big banks to open up those loopholes even more.  Senator Dodd, one of the authors of the original bill, identified this $250 billion threshold as the 1 reason he can't support the bill. He said: ``It raises the danger of a cascading economic effect.''  Fourth, this bill makes another change to allow big banks to borrow more money than they can afford, which, once again, puts taxpayers and our economy at risk. The New York Times described this provision as weakening rules ``aimed at keeping banks from being able to take big risks without properly preparing for disaster.''  The Washington Post reported that JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup may get a combined $30 billion windfall--$30 billion windfall--if this provision passes. I am not making this up. This is what analysts are saying this bill will do.  Fifth, this bill chips away at key mortgage rules put in place after the last crisis. It includes provisions that weaken transparency, inclusiveness, and fairness in mortgage lending. The bill makes it easier for lenders to mislead families into mortgages they can't afford, and takes away those families' right to take the bank to court. It strips away key data used to monitor trends in mortgage lending and spot discrimination against communities of color.  There was an amendment to fix that from Senator Cortez Masto that the Republicans will not allow us to offer.  We know that in too many places across the country, people of color are far more likely to be turned down for a loan for no good reason. Without this data, we will not know when that redlining is happening.  Sixth--and this may be the most awful of all. For reasons I can't even pretend to understand, this bill helps It is the same Equifax that let hackers steal 148 million Americans' personal data. More than half the adults in this country had their personal data breached because of Equifax--their birth dates, Social Security numbers, and addresses--the same Equifax whose former executive was just today charged with insider trading for dumping his stocks just before the company announced its data breach failure.  In exchange for a small provision helping servicemembers watch their credit, this bill forces them to give up their right to take Equifax to court the next time the company's recklessness exposes sensitive financial data.  If that weren't bad enough, the bill also gives Equifax a big new business opportunity. This will give a company that put half the American population at risk of identify theft the power to decide who can get a mortgage.  What do the American people get in exchange for these goodies to big banks and to Equifax? They get to pick up the check. The Congressional Budget Office confirmed that this bill would increase the probability of a big bank failure and a financial crisis adding to the deficit. Even after the addition of language offsetting some of the costs of this bill, the legislation would increase the deficit by $455 million. Let me repeat that. The bipartisan Congressional Budget Office found that this bill will increase the probability of a big bank failure and a financial crisis. So don't tell me this bill doesn't roll back Dodd-Frank for the biggest banks.  In this town, no one seems to be able to find a single dollar when we need to solve our pension crisis or invest in infrastructure or remove toxic lead from kids' homes, but when the Big Bank lobbyists come calling, the Senate waives its budget rules to do Wall Street's bidding.  Let me also remind my colleagues how hard it was to enact the reforms we passed after the last crisis.  Do you remember that lobbyist said that it was only halftime after one of the few times in this body's recent history that Wall Street actually lost, when we did the right thing 10 years ago?  In the move up to that bill, the Senate considered 14 separate Republican amendments, where there were votes taken, to Dodd-Frank and another 12 from Of those 26 amendments, 5 of them were adopted, 5 Republican amendments, 10 Democratic amendments. They were voted on in a Senate where the Democrats were in the majority and gave both parties the opportunity to amend the bill.  The PRESIDING The Senator's time has expired.

I credit Chairman Crapo for at least allowing amendments, but that is as far as it went. On the Senate floor, it has been worse. Democrats and Republicans alike were completely shut down, not able to offer a single amendment.  We know how this place has worked the last year. All decisions are made down the hall in the majority leader's office. The tax bill was written there. The healthcare bill was written there. This bill was written in a way that there are no amendments allowed on the floor, no debate, no deliberation, no changes.  Lastly, fundamentally, the problem with this bill is that we are entrusting the profiteers from the last crisis, the deniers of the last crisis, with implementing big-bank giveaways. I am not willing to put blind trust in the people who failed us before. Regulators Quarles, Mulvaney, Otting, and Mnuchin are the people we are expecting to regulate and save us from another bailout, save us from another financial crisis, and save us from another implosion in our economy. These are the people who failed us so spectacularly in the past, with such grave consequences, and we are expecting them to protect us the next time. Nothing in their public record has earned them this trust.

I thank him for his leadership, in Toledo and Cincinnati, but especially in Toledo, where the sheriff, the community, Celia Williamson, and so many others have been so important in combating this terrible affliction in our society. I thank them.                    Wall Street and American Workers  Mr.President, last week, the House passed another giveaway to Wall Street, siding with special interests and rolling back accountability on some of the biggest banks at the expense of taxpayers. It comes on the heels of last year's tax giveaway that will benefit those same megabanks. This Congress bends over backward to help Wall Street while working families continue to struggle.  It is not just that we are helping Wall Street with tax breaks, we are helping Wall Street with rolling back regulations. Let me outline what exactly all that means.  In a series over several months, I am laying out the case for how Wall Street undermines America's workers and some of the changes we need to make in this country to grow our middle class and make work pay off.  Remember, one of the points I made was that American Airlines announced that they were going to increase workers' wages, as did Chipotle, and Wall Street hit them with a lower stock price as a result.  In each installment of this series, we have talked about these issues. I want to talk specifically this time about what Wall Street's war on workers does to employment. You can follow each installment on my medium page at www.medium.com/@ Last time, I talked about workers' paychecks. Today, I want to talk about layoffs.  Wall Street's singular focus on padding their own pockets is bad enough, but worse, it comes at the direct expense of American workers. Corporations focus almost exclusively on their quarterly performance on the stock market. That is how a CEO's performance is evaluated. They are compensated in large part with company shares. They do better when their stock price goes up. They do things to make their stock price go up, and then they do even better because they are compensated in large part with company shares.  Wall Street analysts like it when corporations minimize their cost to boost their short-term profits; hence the stock price goes up even when the company is already profitable, and that leads directly to layoffs. Corporations lay off workers to show they are serious about cutting expenses, and their stock prices often rise as a result. Wall[[Page S1831]]Street's war on workers means not only smaller paychecks but also pink slips for those workers.  How did we get to a point where stock prices are more important than workers? It didn't happen overnight.  I was talking with Senator Whitehouse about this, and whether it is Cranston, RI, or Mansfield, OH, companies used to consider their employees, their customers, and even the people in the town they did business in, as stakeholders. They cared about their community, they cared about their workers, and they cared about their customers. They felt a duty to fulfill obligations to a broader community, not just their own corporate board members and their own corporate executives.  I grew up in Mansfield, OH, a city of about 50,000 in North Central Ohio halfway between our State's two largest cities, Cleveland and I remember that there were so many companies in our town. I didn't know those company presidents--they were the big people in town, and I was a kid--but I do remember what those companies did. They sponsored Little League teams. They were involved in local Kiwanis clubs. They cared about workers, and they cared about the community. They cared about their customers. They weren't always interested in shareholders; they were interested in stakeholders, in all of us as a community. All the workers, all the customers, and all of the community were stakeholders. But now the focus has narrowed to just shareholders.  As Wall Street's influence has grown, corporate priorities have shifted from shareholders kind of writ large, and the way success is measured has changed fundamentally to stockholders. Businesses have become beholden to those quarterly earnings reports. They have left employees, communities, and customers behind in many ways. They do everything possible, including laying off workers, to make sure their balance sheets and profit margins look as good as they can--the impact on the workers and the long-term health of the company be damned.  In the 1980s, investors began to pursue hostile takeovers of companies that failed to maximize profits. Executives at other companies began to fear takeovers if they didn't keep profits and stock prices high. The pay packages of top management became greater and greater and became more and more closely tied to short-term stock performance.  Wall Street's and Main Street's interests began to diverge. Folks in the corporate boardroom were no longer forced to consider what was in the long-term interests of their workers and of their small-time investors. For top corporate executives, workers became nothing more than a line item in the budget, a cost to be minimized.  By the 1990s, even profitable companies started laying off workers to boost profits even further. Look at what happened to Xerox, an iconic American company that had never had a major layoff in its history. In 1993, the company announced plans to cut 10,000 workers despite being profitable. The company was doing fine. It wasn't a case of an industry moving south, facing an agonizing decision with bad options, but the CEO justified the job cuts as necessary ``to compete effectively'' and to have a ``lean and flexible organization.'' He also said he expected to see higher profits because of the layoffs the following year.  Xerox wasn't alone. In the first 10 months of 1998, when the economy was booming, corporations laid off over half a million U.workers--200,000 more than were laid off the year before. This is the definition of profits before people, and things have gotten worse and worse since the late 1990s.  In 2015, Sysco announced a 3-year plan that included reducing its workforce--corporate-speak for laying off workers. It might have made sense if the company had experienced a year of sluggish sales, but guess what--the opposite was true. Their sales had increased. They generated $1 billion in cash flow, and they were able to pay $700 million in dividends to the company shareholders. If the large dividend payout the year before wasn't generous enough, the CEO said that one of the goals of the 3-year plan and its layoffs was to ``maximize shareholder returns''--not stakeholders, not employees, not the communities, not the customers, but shareholder returns.  The next year, 2016, Tyson Foods announced layoffs despite having a good quarter in beef sales. The following year, the company's president touted ``exceptional financial results.'' What was the reason for those results? Cost-cutting. It is always cost-cutting--more corporate-speak for laying off workers. Do you know what else he cited as the company's good health? Not great sales, not new products or investments in more workers, but the ability of the company to buy back billions of dollars of its own stock. So an accounting trick that funnels money to executives is what the company cited as a measure of its success. Buying back means executive compensation goes up. That is the key to what it was doing with cost-cutting. The company buys up shares of its own stock to drive up the price and increase the value for shareholders and the compensation for executives whose pay is tied to stock performance. Sounds familiar.  It is no coincidence that since the biggest corporations reaped their tax windfalls in September, they have announced billions of dollars in buybacks. It is always about the executives--about the executives' tax cuts, about the executives' compensation, about the executives' buybacks. Again and again, we see Wall Street consider workers as simply a cost to be cut but executive pay as essential to a company.  Last year, Humana announced that it was eliminating 2,700 jobs despite $13 billion in revenue. In the same call that the CEO announced the layoffs, he also announced an increase in executive pay. Workers lose their jobs to pay for more money for corporate executives. Sound familiar again and again and again? And the cherry on top? A month later, Humana announced $3 billion in stock buybacks. Again, what is that about? Higher executive compensation.  Of course, cost-cutting measures typically include workers losing their jobs. Cost-cutting measures almost never include pay cuts for corporate executives. In each of these examples, the company cited cost cuts that were so necessary, they had to fire workers, upend thousands of employees. I wonder how many of those executives and how many of those corporate leaders actually brought some of those workers into their offices and looked them in the eye and told them they were laying them off. My guess is that they had a much lower paid employee make that announcement and face the media and, more importantly, face the employees who lost their jobs.  How many of these executives actually listened to the story of an employee who loses her job, loses her house, whose total life is upended? How many of them ever listened to the stories of what happened to their workers who got fired? The company cited cost cuts that were so necessary, they had to fire those workers.  The shortsighted approach to running a company may work for top executives who can squeeze as much value out of the company in the short term without considering the business's long-term value. It is not just bad for the employees and communities, it is usually bad for the long-term health of the company. Making short-term decisions pays off if you are already well paid, but it doesn't work for those employees. Mainstream investors and workers only make a profit when a company's stock value continues to rise over time, but the corporate executives are no longer forced to consider what is in the long-term interest of workers and small-time investors. As long as Wall Street's analysis of one-size-fits-all measure of corporate success continues to be cost-cutting, workers are at constant risk of losing their jobs. As long as CEOs get paid based on stock prices instead of the company's long-term success, workers will keep getting fired from hostile companies.  We need to break this cycle of greed between Wall Street and In the end, companies can't be profitable without good workers. We need policies that restructure our economy so workers share in the profits they create and Wall Street doesn't determine when workers keep their jobs or how much is in their paycheck.

1724,topic-id,1560,"Madam President, I particularly appreciate, in light of my comments in a moment, Senator Klobuchar's service. She has been a pioneer as the first woman Senator from And I believe the Presiding Officer, Senator Fischer, is the first female Senator from                        Tribute to Marcy Kaptur  Madam President, I rise today to honor my colleague and my longtime close friend, Marcy Marcy Kaptur serves down the hall on the other side of the building. She has dedicated her life to serving the people of Toledo and northern  This Sunday, she will make history. She will officially become the longest serving woman in the history of the U.Congress in either On Sunday, she will have served in the House of Representatives for 35 years, 2 months, and 18 days, breaking a record that was set in 1960 by I believe a Massachusetts For 3\1/2\ decades, she has been principled and she has been passionate about her family, her community, and our country, and she has advocated for She serves like nobody else.  She is the granddaughter of Polish immigrants. That is important to her. She comes from a working-class family. That is important to her. She is a practicing Roman That is important to her. That describes much of who Marcy is--Polish immigrant, working-class family, Catholic faith.  Her father was a trucker and autoworker who became a small businessman. Her mother worked at the Champion spark plug factory, where, of course, she helped to organize a union. I say ``of course'' because of Marcy's not just understanding of the importance of the labor movement but her feeling it in her bones, that a unionized workforce is good for those workers, good for the company, and good for the community, and we need more of that.  Marcy's story echoes that of so many of our generation. Her parents worked hard. With the help of a union card, they earned their way to a better life for Marcy and her brother. She became the first in her family to graduate from high school and then college, and then she ended up in the U.What a great country we live in.  Marcy has never forgotten those roots. If you want to know one thing about Marcy Kaptur--who, as I said, works down the hall at the other end of the building--know that she has never forgotten her roots. That is what drives her. That is who she is. That is why she is such a terrific public servant. That is why she is going to break the record of 35 years, 2 months, and 15 days. She remembers her roots in Ohio's Polish and Ukrainian communities and how much they matter.  Unemployment reached 19 percent in Toledo in the early Reagan years when Marcy first ran for office. She said it was ``the condition of working people that drove me to change my life and run for office.'' She has lived up to that ideal, fighting for working families in Ohio for every one of the nearly 13,000 days she has served in  In my first year in the House, Marcy was a mentor to me. I worked with her to fight against the North American Free Trade She showed me the way in understanding these trade agreements because she knew they would mean job losses in She knew these trade agreements would push down wages. That is sort of the untold story--something I don't think the President quite understands when he talks about NAFTA even though he is right that NAFTA was bad for our country. What NAFTA has done, which Marcy explained to me and understood for 25 years, is NAFTA also pushed down wages and is one of the reasons working-class Americans, whether they are in Omaha or Cleveland, so often don't get a raise. Unfortunately, Marcy was right.  Since then, as we have fought bad trade deal after bad trade deal, Marcy has been a reliable ally and leader in our fight for a trade policy that puts workers in Toledo and everywhere else in this country first.  We have also worked together to protect another very important love of Marcy Kaptur's, and that is our greatest natural resource, Lake We fought for the Great Lakes Restoration We joined with Senator Portman on a bipartisan basis to stop the President's all but elimination of the--why would the President of the United States want to stop our cleanup of Lake Erie? That is why Marcy steps up. She works to protect the lake from invasive Asian carp; she works with farmers to prevent runoff into Lake Erie--all to protect the lake. It is what the lake means to us in terms of drinking water, jobs, commercialism, commercial development, and people just enjoying the beauty of the lake.  She has gone to bat time and again for the auto industry. When some called the auto industry dead, she fought back. Never bet against American workers. Never bet against the American auto industry. Never bet against Marcy That scrappy, fighting spirit is one of the qualities I love most about Ohio, and you find it in abundance in Marcy  No one fights harder for people in her district. Because of absurd redistricting, her district now goes from Toledo all across northern Ohio, only a few miles wide along the lake, all the way to the city of In only 5 years, the people of Cleveland have gained the same affection for Marcy as the people from Toledo have. You can see the love and respect they have.  I remember once going to a rally in Toledo for President People were excited to see him, of course. I[[Page S1757]]guess a few people may have noticed I was there too. But when Marcy walked in, someone screamed ``Marcy,'' and there was pandemonium. Everyone got to their feet as if a rock star had just taken the stage, because in Toledo, a rock star had taken the stage.  She fights for the people of She fights for her district. She fights. She is known, more than anything, as a fighter for working families. It is so fitting that she reaches this milestone during Women's History When she first joined the House, there were fewer than two dozen women serving. She helped blaze a trail for others. She even told the stories of the women who paved the way for her in her book ``Women of Congress: A Twentieth Century Odyssey.''  Having Marcy in Congress matters for so many reasons. It mattes for the hundreds of thousands of Ohioans she serves. It matters for the perspective she brings as the daughter of working-class parents. As I said, she was first in her family not just to go to college; she was first in her family to graduate from high school, right in the industrialized heartland.  As in Nebraska, Madam President, it matters to the little girls in Toledo, who for 35 years--do you know how, when you are in school, there is often a map or a chart of the Presidents? There was a calendar in Brinkerhoff Grade School when I was a little kid in Mansfield, Every year, there was a calendar with all the Presidents' pictures on it. When I was in school, all the Presidents looked alike. Some had whiskers; some didn't. But they all looked alike because they were all White guys. Right? That changed in 2008. I was hoping it would change in 2016. It didn't. That is beside the point.  Marcy Kaptur--because she is the Congresswoman for Toledo, little girls growing up in Toledo since 1982 have realized there is someone to look up to. In Scottsbluff and in Lincoln and in Kearny, NE, they will now look up to having a woman Senator from Ohio has never had a woman Senator or woman Governor, but they have had Marcy That has mattered to little girls for 35 years, as they see a picture of their Representative in the local paper, the Toledo It is not just another man in a suit but someone who looks more like them, someone they can grow up to be.  I want to thank She is not in the building now, but I want to thank Marcy for her service to I hope we get to keep working with Marcy Kaptur for another couple of decades. The voters would have to approve that, but I am hopeful that we will.                        Tribute to Rachel Petri  Madam President, I also want to talk about somebody else who is sitting in this Chamber who will continue, as her career advances, to be a role model for the people of this country and the people of her community. A daughter of Eastern Ohio, Rachel Petri has done communications work for me for a number of years.  She is leaving our office to, of course, return to her home State of She has been a joy to work with. She has been a pleasure to work with. She is so smart and so committed, with an incredible work ethic. I am honored that she has spent part of her life working with me in our office in Washington, DC, and I thank her for her service.

1460,topic-id,1131,"Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. The rule makes in order two bills reported favorably by the Committee on Financial Both bills were the subject of multiple hearings before the Committee on Financial Each bill was reported favorably by a bipartisan majority without amendment. The rule adopts the only two amendments that were offered to these bills.  Madam Speaker, yesterday I had the privilege of being here on the floor debating three financial services bills, and I am back with two more today. Last night, the Senate took a significant step toward joining the House in producing a banking reform bill. The negative impacts of Dodd-Frank are enough to finally overcome even the Senate's inertia.[[Page H1619]]  Last year, the House Republicans passed our own plan to reform our banking system and regulate financial institutions in a smarter way. Ever since Dodd-Frank became law, our small town and community lenders have been hamstrung by regulations intended for large Wall Street banks.  As is usually the case, Washington did not regulate in a manner that focused on bad actors or that differentiated between diverse financing institutions. Instead, Federal regulators stamped out one-size-fits-all regulations that have had negative impacts on our local community banks and credit unions.  Under the House Republican plan, we correct this wrongheaded approach by forcing regulators to take into account the size and risk profiles of smaller institutions. The Financial CHOICE Act ensures the security of our financial institutions without creating a too-big-to-fail government support system and encouraging local banks and credit unions to invest in our communities.  Over the past few months, we have put various components of the Financial CHOICE Act on the floor in order to demonstrate to the Senate that there is a bipartisan pathway forward on many of our proposals. We continue that effort today.  The first bill that is made in order by this rule is H.4061, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement This bill enhances transparency and procedural equity of the nonbank systemically important financial institution designation process.  Under Dodd-Frank, systemically important financial institutions were intended to be large banks whose collapse would bring about enormous financial upheaval; however, in the hands of regulators, certain insurance companies and asset managers were designated as systemically important. This was not Congress' intent when allowing regulators to designate nonbanks as systemically important.  The bill before us today will not roll back the ability of regulators to determine that a large nonbank financial institution is systemically important, but it will ensure the process for designating the nonbank as transparent. It also forces regulators to consider other possible regulatory fixes before designating a nonbank as systemically important.                              {time}  1230  Well, this is all well and good. But what does this mean for Coloradans and other Americans?  In 2014, the life insurer MetLife was designated as a systemically important financial institution by regulators. By 2016, MetLife had prevailed in court and had their designation overturned.  What was revealed was how arbitrary and capricious the designation process seemed to be. Regulators never clarified what level of risk would be acceptable, nor did they clearly identify particular types of financial products or business activities that would result in too much risk.  So life insurers and others were left wondering how to avoid the important designation. Being designated would not only increase compliance costs and consume resources that could not be invested into the business, it also would have forced the financial company to limit the options they made available to their customers.  So we see the vicious cycle of overregulation play out again: less growth and fewer choices.  Fortunately, in the case referenced above, the courts stepped in early and halted the process. However, we have the opportunity now to bring about reforms to the designation process that protect Americans from losing access to financial products that serve them well.  When we talk about Washington picking winners and losers, look no further than Dodd-Frank and the systemically important financial institution designation. Let's put an end to these opaque regulatory decisions and allow light to shine on financial regulators.  Madam Speaker, the second bill that this bill makes in order is H.4293, the Stress Test Improvement  The Federal Reserve determines the ability of bank holding companies to withstand certain types of economic turmoil. These determinations have become known as stress tests.  These stress tests have become notorious for their vague rules and the secrecy by which the regulators conduct the tests. Bank compliance officers are often stuck trying to figure on what exactly their bank is going to be examined. Banks not only do not know what they are going to be tested on, they often never know what they were tested on after the stress test is conducted.  Frankly, technocrat regulators playing ``hide the ball'' from Americans that they are regulating seems like a system of government wholly unlike our own.  A professor from Columbia University testified before the House Committee on Financial Service that: ``It is hard to believe that the stress tests' current structure could occur in a country like the United States, which prizes the rule of law and adherence to due process.''  Former Senator Phil Gramm testified before a Senate panel and said the following: ``What does the stress test test? Not only does no one know, but the regulators see that as a virtue. The Fed's vice chairman has stated that giving banks a clear road map for compliance might make it `easier to game the test.' But isn't the fact that compliance is easier when you know what the law says the whole point of the rule of law?''  The Stress Test Improvement Act inserts much-needed transparency into the testing process. It alters current regulations to make the internal, company-run test an annual exercise. It also streamlines the number of scenarios on which a bank may be tested, while ensuring that banks are still tested on whether they are able to withstand a seriously adverse scenario.  Dodd-Frank was born out of an effort to prevent another collapse of our financial institutions like we experienced in 2008. Unfortunately, the broad brush stroke regulatory regime that it produced has had many unintended consequences.  Hardest hit were our small community banks and credit unions. However, there were also unforeseen negative impacts on larger financial institutions as well.  The bills made in order by this rule restructure portions of Dodd-Frank that have resulted in unreasonable regulation of our financial institutions. They preserve consumer protections while providing the certainty needed to reduce compliance costs and expand the ability of these organizations to provide the best and safest financial services to  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this rule and the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend for his support of the STOP School Violence Act yesterday, along with 406 of our colleagues; that passed overwhelmingly.  Madam Speaker, Dodd-Frank unleashed a torrent of regulation on our financial institutions. While it is understandable that people reacted strongly after the 2008 crisis, most of the Federal response heaped needless red tape onto our banks and credit unions.  Much of this red tape has, at best, done nothing to improve the security of financial customers and, at worst, deprived Americans of crucial capital and financial products.

A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the[[Page H1624]]     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

1646,topic-id,1039,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. The rule makes in order three bills reported favorably by the Committee on Financial All three bills were the subject of multiple hearings before the Committee on Financial All three bills were reported favorably by a bipartisan majority without amendment. The rule ensures that each of these provisions are fully paid for and makes in order an amendment offered by the Democrat ranking member on the committee.  Mr.Speaker, I have the privilege of working with Chairman Hensarling to bring many Financial Services Committee bills to the floor for debate. I will be here again tomorrow doing the same thing. I am always amazed at how bipartisan these votes are in the Financial Services  Once again, we have before us today components of the Financial CHOICE As I have already noted, each of these bills received bipartisan support in the committee. I anticipate that these bills will receive a bipartisan vote on the House floor as well.  Mr.Speaker, it is encouraging to hear that the Senate is working hard toward their own bill overhauling Dodd-It is about time. The House has already done its work under the leadership of Chairman We passed the Financial CHOICE Act nearly a year ago. But I certainly understand that the Senate has its own ideas about financial reform.  I would encourage the Senate to look at the roster of bills that we have passed unpacking the CHOICE Act, as they demonstrate a clear bipartisan roadmap to overhauling our financial regulatory reform effort. We continue to provide that roadmap today.  The first bill made in order by this rule is sponsored by my good friend, the gentleman from Colorado, Mr.H.1116, the TAILOR Act, is commonsense legislation that I am pleased to cosponsor.  One of the biggest complaints I hear as I travel the Fourth Congressional District of Colorado is how the Federal Government stamps out cookie-cutter regulations without a thought as to how much variation occurs in industries from State to For example, how do Washington regulators take into consideration the unique business model of AMG National Trust headquartered in Colorado? Do they know better than my good friend Earl Wright, who cofounded the bank in 1972, about the banking needs of his customers? Are they able to differentiate between AMG's needs and the needs of a bank in another State or on Wall Street? Typically, the answer is no.  They do not model banking regulations to the particular differences from State to But even inside a State there is diversity within industries. The needs of AMG National Trust's customers vary from the needs of other community banks in my district; such as, the Bank of Burlington or Community State Bank, both of which are on the Eastern  The TAILOR Act solves this problem. It requires regulatory actions to take into account each particular institution's business model and risk profile. Mr.Speaker, this change would be an innovative regulatory reform. It would ensure that overarching goals of accountability to investors and depositors are maintained while providing flexibility in the application of the regulations to each institution.  Independent community banks and credit unions have been hit hard by Dodd-Frank's wrong-headed approach to financial services regulation. In 2016, former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said: `` . . . when it comes to bank regulation and supervision, one size does not fit all''--and--``rules and supervisory approaches should be tailored to different types of institutions such as community banks.''  The TAILOR Act will do just that. It will reorient our regulatory structure and free up our community lending institutions to increase their investments in our communities, creating jobs and opportunities for  This rule also makes in order H.4263, the Regulation A+ Improvement This regulation was the result of the JOBS Act passed by Congress in 2012. While Regulation A had been around for many years, it caused startups to enter into a cumbersome process for raising money from certain types of investors. The process is so inefficient that most startups avoided it altogether.  Regulation A+ revamped the regulation and raised the amount of money that entrepreneurs could raise in their startup fundraising round. Crucially, it also changed the type of investor who could invest in a startup. Prior to the JOBS Act, essentially only accredited investors could participate in the first fundraising round.  The problem is that, according to research done by Forbes magazine, accredited investors only made up 1 percent of the population, thereby excluding 99 percent of The JOBS Act changed the regulation to allow nonaccredited investors to participate in a startup's initial fundraising round. Expanding the pool of investors has proven to be a success, and the Regulation A+ Improvement Act continues reforming this area of investment regulation by further increasing the threshold investment amount. This bill will ensure greater access to capital for entrepreneurs seeking investors in their startup.  Finally, this rule makes in order H.4545, the Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform This bill establishes deadlines by which certain regulatory decisions must be made and provides for a more transparent appeals process. Under current law, financial institutions may appeal regulatory determinations to an intra-agency appellate process. The Financial Services Committee found during hearings that the appeals process was not as impartial as it was intended to be.  This bill removes the appeals process from the original examining agency and creates an independent examination review director who is able to review regulatory determinations. To ensure timeliness of regulatory reviews, the bill requires the final reports from agencies are completed within 60 days.  The combination of a better appeals process and deadline for agency action gives community financial institutions certainty as a regulator evaluates their practices.[[Page H1556]]                                {time}  1230  Certainty in the regulatory arena will ensure that lending institutions do not needlessly restrict capital investments due to the unpredictability of a regulatory agency's decisionmaking process.  These three bills continue to advance smart financial regulatory reforms that the Committee on Financial Services has been known for under Chairman Washington's cookie-cutter approach to regulation hinders investments in Colorado and across the United  Mr.Speaker, I support these measures, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thought we were here to debate a rule on the Regulation A+ Improvement As much as I also want to do things regarding the Dreamers, the issue at hand is a bill that is meant to help those who are creating jobs.  I want to thank my cosponsors, Representatives Sinema and Gottheimer, for cosponsoring the bill. Any time we can do a bill together on a bipartisan basis, I think it is a better bill.                              {time}  1245  The purpose of this bill is pretty simple. Seven out of ten jobs in this country, new jobs, come from the 28 million small businesses. I used to run one of those businesses and grew it to be a larger national business, and I know from experience that you have to have capital to grow businesses.  If we help companies raise capital, then we help them create jobs. Biopharmaceutical companies in my State of New Jersey are perfect examples. These are growing companies. They are capital intensive. They need help. The government can't do everything, but the Federal Government can play a role in helping these companies access capital, and that is what this bill is about.  Regulation A+ of the 1933 Securities Act, the very first securities law in this country, Federal law, allowed companies to offer shares on public exchanges. It required that any company that engaged in interstate commerce had to register with the  They made two exceptions: Regulation A+, which was for Main Street investors, but it put a cap on the amount that could be offered; and Regulation D, which allowed an unlimited offering to companies that were only selling to accredited investors. It has been really helpful in creating jobs and giving companies access to capital.  This bill is a modest improvement. Over time, Regulation A+ has gone from a small limit to, most recently, a $50 million limit under the JOBS Act of a few years ago, and it is time to raise that limit again.  There is good precedent for this. The JOBS Act actually required that the SEC raise it within 2 years of 2015, when the JOBS Act took effect, or they had to explain to Congress why they didn't. Well, they haven't. They haven't raised it.  We have an interest in making sure that we help our companies in this country create new jobs, and so this bill would raise that limit from $50 million to $75 million and allow companies to make offerings to Main Street investors, everyday people trying to find good companies so they can build a future for their families.  Mr.Speaker, this bill has been through committee markup. It was open to amendments. It is a bipartisan bill. It has gone through the Rules It is in order for this bill to move to the floor, and I urge that the rule be passed.

What usually starts as a do-good effort quickly devolves into a ``Washington knows best'' regulatory regime. Instead of recognizing the unique needs of businesses around this country, the Federal Government usually stamps out a cookie-cutter regulation that purports to be the solution to a problem but, in reality, almost always has unintended consequences that reduce the freedom of Americans and reduces economic activity in our communities.  The bills before us today take a balanced approach to regulation, maintaining overarching safeguards while making commonsense reforms that free our community banks and credit unions to increase investment in our communities.

Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

438,topic-id,570,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.Garrett) for organizing this in support of those protesters in It is the ongoing protests that started late last month in Iran that are significant not just for their people, but also for the world.  While these protests started because of a dire economic situation in Iran, with upwards of 40 percent of its youth unemployed, it has grown to be a nationwide movement that is about much more than just the economy.  Over the past couple of weeks, we have seen the Iranian people flood the streets in favor of fundamental freedoms, economic opportunity, and a government that represents their interests, not Hezbollah's. There are even reports of people chanting, ``We don't want an Islamic Republic,'' or, ``We will die, but we will take Iran back.''  This has been a long time coming. A State Department report in 2016 found that Iran is the top state sponsor of terrorism in the whole world. Whether it is providing financial support to Hezbollah or providing arms to Islamic rebel groups in Yemen, the Iranian Government's priorities are obviously more focused on wreaking international havoc than they are on addressing the pressing issues within their own country.  And while we are talking about issues with Iran, the protesters are pleading for fundamental freedoms. For example, married women aren't even allowed to travel outside the country without permission from their husbands. They also risk being put in jail or even to death if they take off their hijab in public.  But brave women throughout Iran have been unmasking themselves during the last couple of weeks in protest. To many in our country, this may seem insignificant, but videos of these women and their courage have been shared millions and millions of times around the globe.  Mr.Speaker, those who dislike President Trump have criticized his approach to foreign policy, but these same people fail to praise his strong defense for freedom when it comes to  As soon as the protests started, President Trump put out a statement that said the Iranian people are hungry for food and for freedom. He also said that it is time for a change, and I couldn't agree with him more.  This is the opposite of the Obama administration that preached moral authority and, yet, sided with the corrupt Iranian regime and the corrupt Iranian Government when anti-regime protesters took to the streets back in 2009.  So now that President Trump has proven his credibility on the global stage by siding with the protesters, the question is: Now, where do we go from here?  Well, Mr.Speaker, first we should increase the sanctions on the Iranian Government in response to their crackdown on protesters for freedom in recent weeks.  President Trump should also strongly consider pulling out of the nuclear deal that was struck by President Obama in 2015.                              {time}  1730  We have already seen the Iranian Government break parts of the agreement, and we should have a zero tolerance for these breaks because the consequences are just too grave.  Mr.Speaker, the people of Iran are bravely speaking out against their government and they are calling for change. For the United States to continue to be a shining example of freedom and liberty, we must continue to vocalize our support for these protesters in Iran and make sure that they know that we have their back.

1274,topic-id,1090,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, it was indeed incredibly disappointing last week when our Democratic colleagues did not join us in supporting what was very carefully crafted right-to-try legislation.  The President came and talked to us at the beginning of February, and right to try was one of the issues that he highlighted there from the podium. So it should be to no one's great surprise that this House would indeed take up and work on that issue that the President himself highlighted. Right to try was the one piece of legislation that President Trump specifically promised to the American people in the State of the Union address.  Today, I want it to be known that I stand with the I stand with the thousands of Americans with terminal diseases and their families and their friends in getting this important bill passed.  Since 2014, 37 States, including my home State of Texas, have passed a version of a right-to-try law, and through a strong grassroots movement, they have accomplished that.  Today, the House is considering H.5247, the Right to Try Act of 2018, which would improve access to experimental treatments for terminally ill patients and offer them a chance--a second chance, a third chance--at life.  Over the course of the last decade, our Nation has achieved unprecedented innovation and scientific breakthroughs. Thanks to researchers in our academic institutions and those working in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, American patients have access to innovative treatments.  Regardless of these achievements, I hear from patients with serious life-threatening conditions, including my constituents from north Texas, who are frustrated with what they see as regulatory barriers from trying and experimenting with new therapies when every other avenue has failed.  It does seem we are at a crossroads when lifesaving treatments, while not yet approved, both exist and remain unavailable to patients.  As a physician, I understand that access to investigational drugs and therapies is a deeply personal priority for those seeking treatment for themselves or loved ones with a serious and life-threatening condition.  It is crucial to mention the multistakeholder efforts that have gone into improving the original right-to-try bill. Chairman Walden of the Energy and Commerce Committee led negotiations with the Commissioner of the United States Food and Drug Administration, Scott Gottlieb, and with other stakeholders to ensure that this legislation opens the door to innovative experimental drugs for these patients without necessarily compromising the vital work and the mission of the Food and Drug The product of those negotiations is a bill that strikes the proper balance between ensuring patient safety and granting access to these treatments.  I also want to mention that the Subcommittee on Health did have a hearing in this regard October 3. We heard from the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration during that hearing. We heard from a number of patient groups and stakeholders who felt that it was, in fact, in their best interest for us to advance legislation.  Currently, the Food and Drug Administration conducts an expanded access program aimed at helping patients who do not qualify for clinical trials to gain access to therapies that the agency has yet to approve. While this program makes a good faith effort to help those patients, right to try would create an alternative pathway for those individuals, allowing them to access eligible investigational drugs.  The fact is that individuals may not qualify for a clinical trial if they do not meet very specific patient inclusion criteria, which may include factors such as age, gender, type and stage of disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions. There are also many patients for whom participation in a clinical trial is not feasible, especially those who live in rural areas far from where those academic clinical trial sites exist.  Most, if not all, of the patients with a terminal medical condition fall into one of these categories. This legislation allows those patients to participate in the alternative pathway so long as they are certified by a physician who is in good standing and abides by the rules laid out in the bill.  Again, we worked closely with the Food and Drug Administration to ensure that the new alternative pathway does not hinder or conflict with the critically important oversight that that agency conducts. While some people may have reservations about the safety of a new pathway, this bill protects patients from manufacturers mislabeling or misbranding drugs, requires sponsors and manufacturers to report adverse events to the Food and Drug Administration, and provides certain liability protections for parties participating in the new pathway. This alternative pathway would also be limited to individuals who have exhausted all FDA-approved treatment options.  Additionally, only certain investigational drugs are considered eligible under this legislation. In order to qualify, the drug must have completed a[[Page H1707]]phase one clinical trial, must have an active application, must be under active development or production by the manufacturer, and must not be the subject of a clinical hold.  Eligible patients include those suffering from a stage of a disease or condition for which there is reasonable likelihood that death will occur in a matter of months or that would result in significant irreversible morbidity that is likely to lead to premature death.  This revised right-to-try bill also provides certainty to manufacturers in the drug approval process. It is essential that we do not create additional hurdles in that process. The legislation clearly states that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services ``may not use a clinical outcome associated with the use of an eligible investigational drug . . . to delay or adversely affect the review or approval of such drug.''                              {time}  1245  Since the Health Subcommittee first considered the right-to-try legislation, the bill has passed in the Senate, and we have had many conversations with patients, advocates, the administration, and stakeholders on all sides of this complex topic. That collaborative effort was necessary, and I am certainly grateful to all who participated in those discussions.  Madam Speaker, this represents months of hard work and thoughtful discussions and decisions. I believe this legislation is a positive step forward in our shared goal of improving care for American patients. Again, this was the one aspect of the President's State of the Union Address where he asked us specifically to act on this legislation.  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Lisa Blue will have an extra reason: to say thanks for      Pelosi's efforts when her husband, Fred Baron, was dying of      bone marrow cancer. His only option was an experimental drug      whose manufacturer refused to give permission to use it for      Baron's condition.       ``He was a big fan of hers, and now I am as well,'' Blue      said.       Baron, the ``King of Toxic Torts,'' built a fortune suing      on behalf of asbestos victims. He died the week before      Election Day 2008 at age 61.       A prolific Democratic fundraiser, he served as finance      chief that year for his friend John Edwards, who also made      his fortune in court. Baron later acknowledged funneling      large sums to Edwards' mistress--a scandal that gave      ammunition to those who already despised trial lawyers.       But to Blue, first and foremost, Baron was a husband.       The tale she tells of his final weeks is not so different      than any widow might tell, except, of course, that the couple      had friends in especially high places--friends like Pelosi,      who will headline the 24 dinner to raise cash for the      Democratic Congressional Campaign       In 2002, Baron was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. By      October 2008, his doctors at the Mayo Clinic were telling him      he had just days to live.       They also offered a glimmer of hope. Over the years, the      couple had donated about $1 million to The staff was      especially diligent, Blue said. They tested an arsenal of      drugs and finally discovered that Baron's cancer responded      surprisingly well, in the lab, to a drug called       Mayo had an ample supply, but the drug was--and still is--     approved only for treatment of multiple sclerosis and Crohn's      disease. The manufacturer, Biogen Idec, refused to give      permission, even under special ``compassionate use'' rules      that protect a drug-maker from a black mark in case of an      adverse outcome.       Biogen said it didn't want to jeopardize the drug's      availability to other patients. (The company did not respond      to a request for comment last week.)       ``I told Mayo, `I'll sign anything, I'll release anything.      Just give him the drug,' '' Blue said.       Blue, also a top lawyer, began making calls. She started      with Lance Armstrong, the bicyclist and cancer survivor, whom      she had represented.       ``I started going through Fred's Rolodex,'' she said. ``I      called every politician, every celebrity that I knew and just      begged them to help. . . . I must have made 200 calls.''       She called clinics in Canada, trying in vain to find      doctors willing to administer the drug without Biogen's      She hired a lawyer and prepared to sue Mayo to force it to      dispense the drug. She even bought some Tysabri online from      Australia, intending to send stepson Andrew Baron to smuggle      it back, she said.       The younger Baron posted an open plea online to Biogen,      noting that Bill Clinton, John Kerry and Edward Kennedy      of Massachusetts, Tom Harkin of Iowa and even the head      of the Food and Drug Administration had urged the company to      reconsider.       ``You talk about mental anguish,'' Blue recounted. ``Fred,      every day, would wake up and he said, `Am I going to get the      drug?' ''       Others were supportive, she said, but Pelosi ``put her      heart and soul'' into the cause, as did       Somehow--Blue still isn't sure how--Pelosi cajoled the FDA      to find a legal justification that let Mayo administer the      drug, even without Biogen's consent.       ``Nancy figured out a way,'' she said.       The drug beat back the cancer for a few days, but not      enough.       Blue has no illusion that a typical family could pull such      strings.       ``There are so many cases like Fred's,'' she said. ``One      thing he taught me was politics matters. What a personal      experience for me to understand how politics matters.''       And no, she added, ``It's not fair that other people can't      pick up the phone and make the government give them a drug. .      . . It was just such an awakening about how the drug      companies have so much power.''       That's what she'll tell Pelosi over dinner.

1281,topic-id,1995,"Mr.Speaker, this article references events that occurred in 2008.  In 2002, this individual was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. By October of 2008, his doctors were telling him that[[Page H1709]]he had just days to live. They also offered a glimmer of hope. There was perhaps one chance of therapy. It was an unproven therapy that might, in fact, be helpful to him.  The family made inquiries, made entreaties, but they were not successful until they invoked the then-Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, who actually helped this lawyer get access to this medication. Unfortunately, it was not successful. His disease spread to a point where the therapy was not helpful. But the family observed, ``Nancy figured out a way.''  How about that. The Speaker of the House figured out a way to get this medication to an individual who was dying of a disease, who obviously was very important--a large Democratic donor, and I get that.  But the Speaker of the House intervened because the clinic where he was being treated felt that they did not have the authority to give him the medication. The company that was manufacturing the medication did not feel that it was in anyone's best interest to give him the medication. But Nancy found a way.  Well, Mr.Speaker, today, we are going to find a way. The President asked us, and we are going to find a way for those millions of Americans who are asking for that same chance.

A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's[[Page H1710]]     how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in      their own manual: ``Although it is generally not possible to      amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the      time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment,      the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous      question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous      question is defeated, control of the time passes to the      Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous      question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may      offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of      amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

Since Parkland, NRA officials, Republican lawmakers, and even the President have repeatedly said that we need to disarm individuals who pose a threat to themselves or their community--those posting on social media or telling friends and family that they plan to take lives with a gun.  GVRO laws do just that. That is why California passed these protections after the shooting at UCSB's Isla And now Florida is considering similar legislation in the wake of the Parkland shooting.

She attended Thomas More School and was a 1979 graduate of the old Seton High School in Charles She received a diploma from what was then Villa Julie College and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Early in her career, she worked for the Baltimore Jewish Council and then became a lobbyist for Associated Catholic Charities of  Anne joined my office in 1990 when I was a Member of the U.House of Representatives and remained a member of my team when I became a U.She was a dedicated caseworker in my Baltimore office and was an invaluable resource to my staff and the citizens of She was an indefatigable advocate for veterans and their families and helped them navigate a complicated system to obtain disability, medical, and educational benefits. She also helped veterans obtain much-needed medical appointments and lost medals. In addition to her work with veterans, she also worked tirelessly to help Marylanders save their homes as the foreclosure crisis spread across the State during the recession.  Anne was very knowledgeable about the agencies and personnel available to serve the needs of my constituents. Agency professionals knew Anne and respected her willingness to assist those constituents in need. Anne considered her position in my office as a career, not just ``a job.'' She was a true professional who wanted to make life better for as many people as she could. That is the essence of public service.  Anne would be best described as a ``gentle soul.'' She was a devoted caregiver to her parents and close family members. She was a huge football fan. I think the only person she ever had a ``beef'' with was John The Baltimore Colts drafted him in 1983, but he refused to play for the Colts, so they had to trade him to Even though she was from Baltimore, she later cheered hard for the team from Washington after the Colts left town under the cover of darkness on March 29, 1984.

1068,topic-id,719,"Mr.President, today I wish to speak on the importance of helping our community banks and credit unions. These institutions are on the ground daily helping our families and small businesses. They deserve recognition. They also deserve our careful consideration of regulatory adjustments that will help them continue their work.  Let me be clear: There are parts of 2155 I disagree with, as do many of my colleagues, but what I think that we can all agree on is the good works that our local credit unions and banks do for our communities.  Community banks and credit unions anchor our towns, helping our workers and businesses. These institutions provide more than just savings and checking services. Many provide credit counseling and financial management. They help individuals save for education or for a financially secure retirement. They provide the mortgage loans that make homeownership a realistic goal for many families. They get to know our small businesses and provide them with much-needed financial support. Most importantly, they do so in a way that is tailored to their communities.  I would like to emphasize the role that community banks and credit unions play with respect to small businesses especially. We talk a lot about Main Street businesses in this body. As the ranking member of the Small Business Committee, I am keenly aware of the need to provide our small businesses with adequate resources and support, including through access to capital. This is especially the case for underserved communities, where the bigger banks simply don't have a presence.  There are provisions in this bill that will help. For example, for credit unions, the bill changes the designation of certain real estate loans which have previously been classified as business loans. This will free up capital for small business lending. It is through changes like these that we can carefully tailor regulations, address regulatory unfairness or duplication, and help our local lenders.[[Page S1713]]  In Maryland, we are fortunate to still have a good number of these local institutions. We have almost 90 credit unions in Maryland who have about 1.9 million members. These credit unions serve many of the Federal workers that we in Congress work with every day. They provide services and support for our Department of Defense employees, our Library of Congress employees, our National Institutes of Health employees, and our State and county workers who keep our communities going. Because of their close ties with their membership, these credit unions and others like them are able to offer special services that big banks may not have the incentive to provide.  Similarly, our community banks remain strong. There are 54 community banks chartered in the Our community banking sector employs over 35,000 These banks have withstood the Great Recession and even the Great For instance, Eastern Savings Bank in Baltimore was established in 1905, pulled through the chaos of the Depression in 1929, and still operates four service branches throughout Maryland today, with a customer base of primarily local residents. All of our Maryland community banks are essential to our urban, suburban, and rural communities. They are critical to economic growth in my hometown of They provide nearly half of the industry's small business loans, despite making up less than 20 percent of the banking industry's assets.  It would be naive to ignore the fact that the number of these institutions is shrinking. They have a difficult market to navigate. One-size-fits-all regulations can exacerbate this trend. This doesn't mean that we should not provide oversight of this sector of our economy; however, I think carefully considering ``tailoring'' our approach to regulating is more than appropriate here. I think we can all agree on this principle. Many of the credit union and community bank provisions we are considering, standing alone, have broad bipartisan support. If those provisions stood alone, my vote on such a bill would be a yes.  2155, of course, contains more than community bank and credit union provisions, and I share some of the concerns voiced by my colleagues on this bill, especially regarding consumer protections in certain industries. At the same time, I cannot stress enough how important it is to strengthen our credit unions and community banks. I look forward to continuing to work on these issues, especially on small business lending, with my colleagues going forward.

1829,topic-id,1129,"Mr.President, I join my colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and under the leadership of Senator Menendez to point out that now--I guess it has been 14 months under President Trump's leadership--we have seen a dramatic shift in U.foreign policy that jeopardizes our standing globally and our national security. It starts with this administration's hollowing out the State Department and our capacity to participate in diplomacy.  As my colleagues have pointed out, so many vacancies exist today, unfilled by this administration. It is not the slowness of the Senate in confirming the positions. Many of these positions are not even positions that require Senate confirmation. We have seen an exodus of the most experienced people in the State Department, and the capacity of the State Department has been dramatically reduced. President Trump's budget speaks volumes about his support for diplomacy, as we see 30-percent reductions in the State Department budget being proposed by this administration.  The role of diplomacy in solving international issues is at an all-time low. There are many times I disagreed with Secretary Tillerson, but he at least was an independent voice in the White House as it related to certain issues on Iran or climate change. Now his voice has been silenced in this administration.  America first is America alone. It is the isolation of our country. We have seen that with the United States under[[Page S1822]]President Trump and pulling out of the climate talks--the only country in the world. We see it now, potentially, in Iran, with reports that the President may unilaterally withdraw the United States from the nuclear agreement, putting the United States as the outlier where we should be putting our attention on This is reflected in the Gallup polls, showing that the global opinion toward the United States has dropped dramatically. We see the President embracing oppressive leaders around the world, such as the leaders of Russia, China, Turkey, and Egypt, and embracing the autocratic practices of the President of the Then, he attacks our closest allies, calling into question the transatlantic partnership.  Perhaps more than anything else, this administration has trampled on America's values. As Secretary Tillerson said early in this administration, America's interests will no longer be dictated by our values. That is not what the trademark of America is about. The President over and over has questioned universally what America stands for when he gave space to hate in his response to Charlottesville and when he implies that people who come to our country of certain religions or certain races are less favored than others. When he suggests he cannot have a conflict because he is President of the United States and does not have to divest of his business interests or when he says things that we know are not true and the President of the United States is standing up for matters that are outright lies, it diminishes the value and strength of America and our global leadership.  One issue I want to talk about in the time I have is that of ignoring one of our greatest national security threats--what Russia is doing to the United States under Mr.We just saw in Russia's most recent election that it was neither free nor fair. The opposition candidates were not allowed to participate, as they were handpicked by Mr.Putin, and he controlled the media. As the OSCE observed, the election took place in an overly controlled legal environment, and it had pressure on the critical voices of the Russian people.  We find a Russia today under Mr.Putin that is contrary to the values we stand for. In January, I authored a report on Russia, with the other Democrats on the committee, that talked about the asymmetric arsenal Mr.Putin uses that includes propaganda. We saw this on display when he was asked about what happened in the United According to the transcript, as reported by the Washington Post, these are Mr.Putin's own words: ``Maybe they're not even Russians,'' in his talking about who attacked our country and referring to those behind the election interference. ``Maybe they're Ukrainian, Tatars, Jews--just with Russian citizenship.'' He also speculated that France, Germany, or Asia might have interfered in the election or even Russians who were paid by the U. That type of rhetoric is straight out of the Soviet and Russian playbook to cast Jews and other minorities as undesirables--enemies of the state. As an American Jew who has family roots in Eastern Europe and Russia, I find that kind of rhetoric to be dangerous and frightening, but at its most basic, such rhetoric is part of Mr.Putin's grand design. That is what he does.  We saw it play out in the UK just 2 weeks ago when a person was poisoned in England who was an enemy of Mr.Putin's. We see it play out over and over again. Prime Minister May spoke out. She called it for what it was. She sent a clear signal to Moscow that that type of behavior by the Russian state against the British people would not be tolerated and that there would be consequences. This is how a leader of a great nation should speak out in defense of its people to counter a major threat from a global adversary.  Yet what happened here in Washington with the threat we saw to our own country by Mr.Putin? The President has said virtually nothing. His spokesperson condemned the crime but ignored that likely Russian link. The Secretary of State later did what the President could not or would not do by calling out the Maybe that was his swan song because it was the last thing we heard before he was silenced by Mr. Never before in America's history has such a clear threat to our national security been so clearly ignored by the President of the United The President's difficulty in publicly acknowledging the Russia threat and leading our country forward to combat that threat is one of the most perplexing and reckless pieces of Mr.Trump's disastrous foreign policy. We in Congress took action. We passed legislation. We passed mandatory sanctions against Yet this administration has not taken full advantage of the law we passed. The President needs to protect America's interests, not appease Mr. Congress's role in shaping and advancing U.foreign policy has never been more important. I will continue to advance legislation, conduct oversight, and speak out about these important issues in the name of the American people and the values and norms that define us and our place in this complicated world. I am proud to be a part of the group of Senators who will stand on this floor and work to make sure we protect our national security interests.  I yield the floor.

1834,topic-id,579,"Mr.President, I take this time because I think this issue is an extremely important issue. I am talking about the authority of the Congress of the United States versus the President on the introduction of our troops into war or hostilities. This has been a struggle we have been debating for a long time. Congress passed the War Powers Act over the objections of the President because we recognize that the Constitution gives us the power to introduce troops into harm's way.  The resolution says very clearly that the introduction of the U.Armed Forces into hostilities will allow Congress to have an expedited process if the administration has not gotten the authorization for the use of that military force. The Supreme Court decision made it very difficult for us to enforce that, causing us to pass, in the State Department authorization, a process in which a joint resolution could be filed in order for Congress to express itself if the President has not sought the authorization for the use of military force.  We now have a circumstance where the United States, in my view--the President has introduced American troops into hostilities by assisting the Saudis in refueling missions in regard to the campaign in To me, that is introducing troops. Whether it is right or wrong, Congress has a responsibility to respond to this. I say that knowing that our Presiding Officer has been very articulate about the need for us to pass an authorization for the use of military force in regard to our campaign against  Here is the challenge we have. The administration and previous administrations have interpreted hostilities in such a narrow way, it would take away[[Page S1825]]from Congress our ability to have the authorization for the introduction of American troops into hostile circumstances. Yet compare that with this administration's and previous administrations' interpretations of the 2001 authorization for use of military force, which we passed after the attack on our country on 9/11. They would have you believe that authorization, which was limited to those who planned the attack against us in 9/11, applies to our military campaign against ISIS in Syria or ISIS in Yemen or wherever we may find ISIS anywhere in the world. I think that is an absurd interpretation.  Yes, I know the distinguished chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is on the floor. I think our committee needs to take up this issue. We need to take up what is happening in Yemen with our support of the Saudis and what is happening in regard to the authorization for the use of military force. But this campaign has been going on for a long time. Congress needs to weigh in whether we are for or against it. We need to exert our jurisdiction, and we haven't done that. It is very frustrating that those of us who believe very deeply in our constitutional responsibilities, assume that responsibility--and I have a lot of confidence in the distinguished chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but I question whether we are going to get more time in the future to debate this issue. I know the chairman will give us time in committee, but will we have time on the floor of the Senate to debate this issue? I think we need to debate it and vote up or down whether American troops should be assisting in this mission.  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1050,topic-id,3667,"Mr.President, I have come to the floor to talk about the legislation before us, which is the banking legislation that has been reported out of the Banking Committee on a bipartisan vote and awaits our attention here today.  Mr.President, like my colleague from Washington State, I will also speak briefly to the issue that is being raised in States across America and in schools across America, where students are demonstrating their support and their solidarity with the folks in Parkland, FL, where 17 kids were lost earlier this year.  My dad was a hunter, grew up in West I was born in West Virginia and grew up in I bought my first BB gun when I was 10 years old, and I still have the shotgun that my grandfather gave me just before he died, when I was just a pup of a teenager. In my family, we are big believers in Second Amendment rights--to own and bear arms. We are also big advocates of using common sense with respect to weapons.  My dad was not only a hunter, he was also a gun collector. He would buy and sell guns to other people whom he knew. From the time my sister and I were little kids, my dad would always say to us, ``Just use some common sense.'' He said it a lot to us when we were growing up. We must not have had much of it because he said it very often. My dad said that it didn't make common sense for somebody who had serious mental health problems or a felony record to be able to go to a gun show and buy a weapon. It also doesn't make a lot of sense for people who can't fly on airplanes because they are on a terrorist watch list to be able to buy guns. My dad would have said that didn't make a lot of sense.  What is happening across the country is that the kids are leading us. In a verse in the Bible, it reads that the ``child shall lead them.'' I think that is really what is going on here, and I think States are already starting to address this issue in a more constructive way than we have done thus far.  My hope is that the children will lead us and that the States will lead us as well. Maybe we will be able to come to agreement on some of these issues that are respectful of our Second Amendment rights in the Constitution but that are also consistent with the kind of common sense that my dad always talked about with respect to everything, including the buying and selling of weapons.  Mr.President, I remember standing on this floor--I think it was about 8 years ago--when we debated the Affordable Care That was at a time when we were spending about 18 percent of the GDP for healthcare in this country--18 percent. The Japanese were spending 8 percent. They had better results in Japan for their healthcare than we had, and they covered everybody. Think about that. We had been spending 18 percent, and they had been spending 8 percent. They had gotten better results in healthcare--in life longevity for adults and in lower rates of infant mortality. They covered everybody. When people went to bed in this country at that time, 40 million people went to bed without having any healthcare coverage. I think most of us realized at the time that that was not a good thing. I used to say that the Japanese can't be that smart and we can't be that dumb.  We passed the Affordable Care There was a lot of debate and a lot of amendments offered in committees, including in the Finance Committee on which I served, Republican amendments and Democratic amendments. As we know, the final vote here on the floor was not a bipartisan vote. It was a huge issue that we were trying to address--delivering healthcare to 300 million  For those who supported the legislation, even they realized that it was not perfect and that we were going to have[[Page S1700]]to come back at some point in time and make changes to it. The Democrats felt that way. The Republicans and Independents felt that way as well. We ended up not coming back and offering modest amendments or making tweaks to the legislation. At the end of the day, we ended up with a battle here, initially over the repeal of the ACA and later over repealing and replacing it.  I felt proud of the work we had done on the In my knowing it was not perfect, I always looked forward to coming back shortly after we had adopted it, actually, and making some tweaks. I felt the same way about Dodd-Frank, the banking legislation that we passed after the great recession about 7 or 8 years ago.  I will just remind everybody, especially our young pages here today, who were probably about 7 or 8 years old at the time, that we didn't fall into a burning ring of fire--we fell off a cliff. The unemployment rate shot up to 10 percent, and banks stopped lending money to send kids to school or to allow people to buy a car or a house. Credit was shut off for businesses as well. The unemployment rate skyrocketed. Our economy was locked up, and we felt that we had to do something.  What we tried to do was to figure out how we ended up in that mess in the first place. What had gone on is that the people who wanted to buy houses, who were not creditworthy, ended up being loaned money by banks across the country to buy houses. In many cases, the appraisals for the houses were not worth the paper they were written on. The creditworthiness of the buyers was not worth the paper it was written on as well. We had unqualified people who were trying to buy property. They were unable, realistically, to repay their loans. It all worked just fine until we went into a slump. As the unemployment rate started to go up, people found it more and more difficult to make their payments.  In the olden days, I remember the first house I lived in when I was a kid. My parents borrowed money from a bank for a mortgage, and then they paid it off to that bank. I remember, when they paid off the mortgage to the house they owned in Danville, VA, it was a big deal. My dad actually took the mortgage and burned it up outside, not inside our house.  Yet, 7 or 8 years ago, for a lot of people, after they borrowed money from banks, the banks sold those mortgages to somebody else, oftentimes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would package those mortgages into mortgage-backed securities--into a security that could be sold to investors in this country and to investors around the world. As long as housing prices continued to rise, everything worked fine. When they stopped rising and started falling, a number of those mortgage-backed securities were riddled--almost like Swiss cheese--with bad mortgages. As more and more people failed to be able to pay their mortgages, the mortgage-backed securities lost their value. Those investors around the world who had invested seriously in mortgage-backed securities got scared, and it started to spiral down from there.  That was not really the only reason we got into a burning ring of fire all those years ago, but it was a big reason. Part of what we decided to do with Dodd-Frank was to make sure that didn't happen again. We would make other mistakes, but we were not going to make that mistake again.  The legislation was passed. Again, not everybody was for it. I voted for it and helped to write some of the provisions in the bill. I knew at the time, as I think we all did, that anything that big--a massive change in our banking regulatory approach in this country--was going to have to be tweaked and revisited just like the Affordable Care It has taken a while.  For the most part, our Republican friends--not all and probably not including the Presiding Officer--were interested in repealing Dodd-I and, I think, the majority of folks on our side were interested in fixing the provisions that needed to be fixed but not in throwing the baby out with the bath water.  The legislation before us today was reported out of the Banking Committee but not unanimously. It was reported out, I think, last fall, by the chairman of the committee, Mike Crapo from Idaho, whose name is on the bill. I am going to spend some time here today talking about what it does and what it doesn't do.  If the bipartisan bill before us becomes law, 90 percent of Dodd-Frank will remain unchanged. Let me say that again. If the banking bill before us today becomes law, 90 percent of Dodd-Frank will remain unchanged.  The legislation that has been authored by Senator Crapo and others does not touch some of Dodd-Frank's most important reforms. Some of those most important reforms include the Consumer Financial Protection It remains. The Financial Stability Oversight Council remains. It is affectionately known as FSOC, and it works to identify and to address overarching threats to the financial system. The regulations that crack down on risky derivative trading remain, and the ability of the FDIC to wind down failing complex institutions through an orderly liquidation authority remains.  Under this legislation, the Federal Reserve would retain the authority to apply enhanced standards to any bank with over $100 billion in assets. In addition, banks with over $100 billion would still be subject to numerous regulatory requirements. Those requirements include, one, meaningful stress tests; two, increased capital requirements to provide a cushion in tough times and bad times; and, third, vital international reforms to leverage in liquidity standards.  I have a number of charts. I have more charts today than I think I have ever brought to the Senate floor. I promise we will be done by sundown. It will seem that long, but in reality it will not be.  Let me start off, if I could, with a couple of claims made about the bill and, then, talk about the reality.  One of the claims is that this bill would gut Wall Street reform that was passed after the financial crisis to prevent another global meltdown.  That is the claim. Here is the reality. This bipartisan bill makes targeted, commonsense fixes that will provide tangible relief to community banks and credit unions, while leaving in place the rules and regulations that will keep Wall Street accountable.  Before we look at the next claim, like the Presiding Officer, I do customer calls all over my The Presiding Officer has a big State, and I have a little I visit businesses, schools, hospitals--you name it. I do customer calls literally every week, including the credit unions and small community banks. Sometimes they come to see me, and oftentimes I go to see them. For years, during those customer calls, visiting credit unions and community banks, especially in the central and southern part of our State, they would say to us: We didn't create the financial meltdown that led us to the great recession. Yet we bear the burden of the regulatory reform for that meltdown.  It wasn't their fault. We need a lot of the regulation that is adopted in Dodd-Frank, but keep in mind that credit unions and community banks didn't cause the problem but yet they bear a big part of the burden of fixing it.  Another claim is that this bill rolls back stress test requirements for all big banks. I will say it again. This bill rolls back stress test requirements for all big banks. That is the claim.  Here is the reality. This bill continues to require stress tests for all banks over $100 billion in assets. That would be the largest financial institutions. That is the reality.  The claim is that this bill does nothing to protect consumers. That is the claim--that the bill does nothing to protect consumers.  Here is the reality. This bill actually creates new protections. It provides free credit freezes and allows year-long fraud reports. It allows parents to turn credit reporting on and off for minors. It provides free credit monitoring for all Active-Duty servicemembers.  I am a retired Navy captain. Our Presiding Officer is a colonel--Navy salute.  It was one of the things that Senator Coons and I insisted on in order to support this legislation, and that was to provide free credit monitoring for all Active-Duty servicemembers as part of the bill.  Another reality in terms of new protections is that it encourages banks to report suspicious behavior they become aware of.[[Page S1701]]  That is a little bit of the claims and the reality. I can go on with that, but I will not. I will actually turn to the words of other people, starting off with questions from Senator Jon Tester of Montana, a senior member of the Banking The first question he asked last November was to a fellow who had been nominated to be Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell, who was confirmed on this floor with 80 or 90 votes--a big bipartisan vote.  Senator Tester asked Mr.Powell, who was a Governor, if I am not mistaken, at the time within the Federal Reserve He asked:       Part of that bill--  The bill before us today--     is eliminating the Volcker Rule compliance for community      banks that have less than $10 billion, as long as they have      less than 5 percent, trading assets and liabilities. Any      concerns there?  The witness, Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, said: ``None.''  Senator Tester went on to ask the Federal Reserve Chairman--I think this was in February of last year. Senator Tester, my colleague, is a farmer out in He asked Jay Powell, who was not yet the Chairman of the Federal Reserve:       But I'm a dirt farmer, OK? I just, kind of, read things as      they are and don't read a lot of extra stuff into it. You're      the--you're the man on the Fed and so I need to know your      opinion. Does 2155 require the Federal Reserve to weaken any      of the Dodd-Frank enhanced prudential standards for . . .      [foreign banks] such as Deutsche Bank, UBS or Barclays?  This was the response of Chairman Jay Powell of the Federal Reserve:       It does not, according to my reading of the text.  I will just add that this is the text of the bill.  Senator Crapo, the chairman of the Banking Committee, has put together this bipartisan legislation, with a lot of help from Jon Tester and others. In a hearing last July, he questioned the woman who was then-Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Janet I think she did a very good job. She stepped down, and I thank her for her service and leadership.  Senator Crapo said:       There appears to be growing consensus that Congress should      consider changing the $50 billion SIFI threshold [for big      banks]; also, changing the Volcker rule, exempting certain      institutions from company-run stress testing requirements and      reducing the burdens on community banks and credit unions.  He went on to ask:       Do you agree that it would be appropriate for Congress to      act in each of those areas?  He asked: Do you believe it would be appropriate for Congress to act in each of those areas--changing the SIFI threshold, changing the Volcker rule, exempting certain institutions from stress test requirements, reducing the burdens on community banks and credit unions.       Do you agree that it would be appropriate for Congress to      act in each of those areas?  She said four words: ``I do--I do.''  Again, in February of last year, Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen, on the Volcker rule, said:       So, yes, let me reiterate what I said there. It's important      to look for every way we can to mitigate the regulatory      burden. What we've suggested previously and I would reiterate      with respect to Dodd-Frank is that Congress might want to      consider exempting community banks from the Volcker rule. . .      .  That is what she said last February, a year ago.  Then, former Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo spoke. I think his position is held now by Andy Last year, Daniel Tarullo said:       We have found that the $50 billion in assets threshold      established in the Dodd-Frank Act for banks to be      ``systemically important,'' and thus subject to a range of      stricter regulations, was set too low. . . .  He went on to say:       The fact that community banks are subject at all to some of      the Dodd-Frank Act rules seems unnecessary. . . .  I will say it again.       The fact that community banks are subject at all to some of      the Dodd-Frank Act rules seems unnecessary to protect safety      and soundness, and quite burdensome on the very limited      compliance capabilities of small banks.  Dan Tarullo said that last  Here are the words of former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, whom I got to know and work with when I was in the House of He was Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and I was on the Banking He was a giant then and still is--literally and figuratively.  Here are his words in February of this year. He said:       I am pleased that the Senate Banking Committee has forged      ahead with meaningful bipartisan financial reform to ease the      unnecessary regulatory strain on small banks, helping them to      flourish as an engine of economic prosperity. . . .  He goes on to say that he doesn't agree with every single word of the legislation before us today, but he concluded by saying:       I thank you for the opportunity to comment on this      important piece of legislation and look forward to its swift      passage.  This is in a letter to Senator Brown, I believe. It doesn't mean he agrees with every single sentence and paragraph, but he looks forward to it.  Former Congressman and former Banking Committee chairman and my colleague Barney Frank, spoke on whether Dodd-Frank needs reforms in a CNBC interview last He was asked if Dodd-Frank needed reforms, and he said: ``Of course.''  On the $50 billion SIFI threshold, he said: ``I think it should be changed,'' and he went on to say: ``It's too low, I believe it is.''  Again, former Congressman Barney Frank on November 27 of last year said:       If this bill became law tomorrow, well over 90 percent of      the Wall Street reform bill would be unchanged. . . . The      Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; the strict regulation      of derivative trading; the orderly liquidation authority; the      risk retention requirements on securitizations and most other      provisions would remain in full force. . . .  In full force.  We are almost done here. I thank my colleague from Vermont for his patience.  This is former Congressman Barney Frank on relief for community banks. These words are from the CNBC interview last February, a year ago.       With regard to banks under $10 billion, some of them are      spending more money than they should complying with      provisions that were never really intended to apply to them      and I understand that. The Volcker Rule which says that large      banks should do more lending and less derivative trading,      which I think is a wholly good thing, a number of small banks      which never did much derivative trading are overdoing the      effort to show [that] they aren't there. I would exempt some      of the banks under $10 billion from some of those rules and I      would agree to raise the $50 billion threshold.  Last but not least, a couple of comments more--one from the Bipartisan Policy Center recently; the words of two of the folks from there:       As U.politics descends ever further into partisanship,      there are still signs that old-fashioned legislating is not      dead. This week, the Senate Banking Committee will mark up      one of the first significant pieces of financial regulatory      legislation in years with real bipartisan support. . . .       These are not major changes. Yet taken together, they are      constructive and should provide greater incentives to extend      credit, particularly to Main Street small businesses, without      undermining the progress made since the crisis in making the      financial system safer.  This statement is from the president and CEO of the Independent Community Bankers of America:       The markup of 2155 is a rare opening for real, impactful      relief that will strengthen economic growth, job creation,      and consumer protection. It is the culmination of years of      collaborative effort to achieve consensus among Members of      Congress across the spectrum and community bankers in their      home States and districts. Community bankers urge all members      of the Senate Banking Committee to vote YES on 2155.  This is from the president and CEO of the Credit Union National Association, or CUNA:       This bill includes credit union-specific provisions that      provide meaningful regulatory relief, a sign that      policymakers are praying close attention to the needs of      credit union members. We thank Senator Crapo and his      colleagues for working across party lines to advance      regulatory relief legislation that benefits community      financial institutions, and look forward to continuing to      work closely with them as the bill moves through the      legislative process.  I hope we will keep these words in mind in the hours and days ahead as we take up this important legislation.  I have no interest in undoing Dodd-I am a strong supporter of Dodd-I helped to write some of the provisions in Dodd-Frank, and I have no interest in pulling the plug on Dodd-Frank.[[Page S1702]]  Can we make some reasonable changes? Yes, we can. I felt the same way about the Affordable Care  With that, I yield the floor to my friend from Vermont, and I thank him for his patience.

62,topic-id,1315,"Mr.President, I rise to talk about another matter that will be before us in the days ahead. It should not be before us as it should have been done many months ago. In fact, if you want to count it by days, it should have been done about 100 days ago, as we have heard. That is the Children's Health Insurance Program, known by the acronym  Most Americans know what the CHIP program is. It is a program that became Federal law a little more than 20 years ago in order to provide an opportunity for healthcare for those families whose incomes were a little bit too high, maybe, to have their children enrolled in Medicaid but those families did not have their children's healthcare paid for by their employers. You had a lot of families--a lot of middle-income families or families near middle income--who were caught in between and didn't have opportunities for healthcare. So CHIP was passed. For the most part, it was bipartisan. All of these years now--decades later--it remains bipartisan, but it is not reauthorized. Probably, the only two numbers I will get into tonight are 9 and 180. What do I mean by that? I will start with  So ``180'' means 180,000. That is the number of children, roughly, who were enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program as of December of 2017. If you look at it over the course of a year--of children becoming eligible and then maybe moving off of CHIP to some other insurance or having other changes--in Pennsylvania, roughly, in the last year, 340,000 children benefited, at one time or another, but the monthly number was 180,000 children just in[[Page S64]]Pennsylvania, and ``9'' was representative of the 9 million children across the country who were enrolled in When we have all of these debates about what has to get done in the next couple of days and between now and the middle part of January, I hope that 9 million number will be uppermost in people's minds. Included within that are 180,000 children in  This is really not about a number or a program. It is about real people, real people's lives. Every Member of the Senate has a constituent he could tell a story about or hundreds, if not thousands, of stories. I will just tell one tonight about a mom whom I met not too long ago, just about a week ago, Jennie Jennie is from Upper Makefield, That is Bucks County, Southeastern Pennsylvania, just north of the city of  Jennie told us about her son Kam-au. Kam-au is 8 years old, and he is enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance His brother and his sister have special needs and are Medicaid beneficiaries. So, in one family, you have an example of one child, thankfully, benefiting from the CHIP program and then two other members of that same family benefiting either from CHIP or the Medicaid Thank goodness those programs are in place. Without CHIP and Medicaid, Jennie said her children would be uninsured because, even though both Jennie and her husband work full time, covering the whole family on her plan is too expensive.  This is another example of working families who depend upon these programs for their children. They need these programs. These programs aren't theoretical. They aren't some far-off Washington debate about timing and leverage and negotiations and back-and-forth. This is about their real lives right now. As I said, the CHIP program should have been reauthorized 100 days ago, and it is inexcusable that it is not being done now.  We all left here right after the tax vote. Everybody went back to his home State and, I am sure, had a great holiday season. Unfortunately, even though there was a little bit of a patch--a tiny, little patch made for this program--a lot of people left here with no worries at all and went back to their States and communities and neighborhoods, where there were a lot of other people worrying about whether they were going to get the kind of coverage for their children they should have a right to expect.  Back to Jennie and her son. What are they going to do without the Children's Health Insurance Program? I cannot imagine--and few Senators or House Members can imagine--how Jennie and her son will get from here to there without having the Children's Health Insurance I cannot imagine what it must be like for Jennie to worry about how she will pay for her son's care if he loses CHIP coverage. No parent should have that kind of stress in his life when there is an existing program that covers 9 million kids that should be reauthorized.  When he was a public official, my father used to talk about people who had led lives of real struggle. We have all known them in our lives--people who have to work every day just to make ends meet in order to provide for their families and get through another day, another week, another month, another pay period. He used to refer to those Americans as leading ``quietly triumphant lives.'' My father's words for those who struggle--``quietly triumphant lives.''  There are a lot of families out there who lead very difficult lives, and they depend sometimes on the Children's Health Insurance Program or Medicaid or some other program just to get through another week, and I think about Jennie and parents like her who have to overcome so much to help their children--to love them, to care for them, to protect them, and to educate them. Even the most loving, caring, hard-working, and dedicated parent cannot provide the protections and the care health insurance coverage and quality healthcare can provide, the kind of quality healthcare from professionals that comes to that child because he or she has the protection of health insurance. Those parents--no matter how much they work, no matter how good they are to their children--sometimes cannot provide something as basic, obviously, as healthcare and, of course, the insurance coverage that makes it possible.  We have legislation ready today, the KIDS Act, that is bipartisan. It has already moved through the Finance Committee unanimously. I don't think there was a single vote against it. If there was, it was not that loud a vote. I hope we can make these children a priority in the coming days, finally, at long last.  There were a lot of deals made in the tax bill, a lot of numbers moved around to get the tax bill done. I understand that is part of any legislation, but if a tax bill can get done in the U.Senate, we can certainly have a vote to get the Children's Health Insurance Program reauthorized now that it is 100 days old.  I see the distinguished majority leader is here so I will wrap up tonight with the words of Jennie's son Kam-au:       I was happy when I got health insurance because I knew I      could go to the doctor if I got hurt or sick. When I didn't      have health insurance, I was a little worried . . . I think      we should keep CHIP going so we can stay healthy.  No better words were uttered or spoken about the Children's Health Insurance Program than Kam-au's, an 8-year-old, who said CHIP should stay in place so we can stay healthy.  I agree. The American people agree. Let's get CHIP done.  I yield the floor.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 p.m. tomorrow, all postcloture time on the Campbell nomination be considered expired and the Senate vote on confirmation of the Campbell nomination with no intervening action or debate; finally, that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.

698,topic-id,1197,"Mr.President, Republicans just passed the largest tax reform package in 30-something years, and middle America will go home in February with bigger paychecks than they did--I say in February because it will not take that long for the IRS to update their software. They will go home with more money in their pockets.  If there has been a theme in the Trump administration, it is that they want those working Americans, those middle-class Americans, to do better under this President than they did in the previous 8 years. That tax reform package is part of that, and I am amazed that my Democratic colleagues objected to it. They objected to middle-class Americans having more money in their pockets, in their take-home pay, for no other reason, I think, than to resist President                 Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing Proposal  Mr.President, what I am about to speak about speaks to better jobs and better wages for working Americans, for those middle-class families.  This afternoon, the U.Department of the Interior released the Trump administration's draft proposed program for offshore oil and gas leasing. This proposal would mean more affordable energy made right here in the United States of That is good news for American workers and families. I commend President Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke for their commitment to supporting American workers and making America energy dominant.  For decades, past administrations have handcuffed American energy manufacturers by restricting offshore leases to the western and central Gulf of You could only drill there, not elsewhere. Past plans left 90 percent of U.offshore resources off limits to energy producers and in the process said no to thousands of good-paying American jobs and billions of dollars in offshore investments--when I say ``offshore,'' I mean off the American shore[[Page S37]]but creating jobs here in the United States of  The Trump administration's proposal rejects the status quo and puts American workers and families first. It would open areas with significant oil and gas potential--areas off the coast of Alaska and the Atlantic and Pacific and portions of the eastern Gulf of  What are the ramifications of this? According to one study, opening the eastern Gulf of Mexico would create nearly 230,000 new American jobs by 2035. It would bring roughly $115 billion of investment to the United Federal, State, and local governments would collect an additional $70 billion in tax revenue by 2035, not because rates are going up--rates have now gone down--but, rather, people are making more money, and because they are making more money at lower rates, Federal, State, and local tax receipts continue to increase. American energy production would be boosted by about 1 million barrels of oil, making our country more secure.  Let's take a look at the State-by-State job increases from these lease sales. Florida gets the biggest gain of all--87,000 new jobs by 2035. Texas would add 62,000. My home State of Louisiana would add 31,000 new jobs. Alabama would add 21,000; Mississippi, 12,000; and the rest of United States, 15,000 new jobs.  I know some of my colleagues across the aisle, including my Democratic colleague from Florida, have expressed concerns about this energy production plan's impact on fishing and military training in the Gulf of Let's remember that oil and gas manufacturers have coexisted with other activities for decades. I share my colleagues' interest in protecting our communities, businesses, and the environment. The reality is that these goals are not mutually exclusive, especially on the gulf coast.  Let me use Louisiana as an example. According to NOAA, Louisiana has 4 of the 10 top ports in the country by volume and value of seafood landed. In 2016, two Louisiana ports alone received 670 million pounds of seafood landed in the gulf. This is in addition to the oil and gas production off of our coast. Together with Texas, our two States accounted for half of U.shrimp landings.  NOAA also reports that roughly half of the jobs in commercial and recreational fishing in the gulf exist in States where there is also oil and gas production. Recreationally, gulf anglers accounted for 33 percent of fishing trips, which equals 39 percent of the total U.catch.  Of course, more than 85 percent of recreational landings were in inland estuaries or State territorial waters. Most of the oil and gas activity we are discussing today is in deeper, Federal waters many miles away.  Again, the gulf coast is a working coast, and it has been proven over the decades that multiple industries can successfully coexist.  When my colleague from Florida brought up his concerns about potential conflicts with the Department of Defense operations in the Gulf of Mexico, I took that very seriously. Ensuring that our military is equipped to train and test is vitally important. However, it is simply not true that the eastern Gulf of Mexico must be completely free of energy production in order for the military to conduct operations. Our military's own testing data from the last 5 years makes that very clear. This map shows all the Department of Defense testing done in the last 5 years in the eastern Gulf of The Department of Defense used only 19 percent of the eastern Gulf of Mexico during the last 5 years. To put it differently, 81 percent of the gulf went untouched.  When you look even more closely at the space regularly used by our military, it becomes clear that this objection to energy production in the eastern gulf does not pass the smell test.  This is the Panhandle of Right here is the State of For those who are interested in it, the Florida-Alabama bar is right there, and this is where folks from Louisiana love to go and enjoy themselves.  This is, if you will, zoomed in on the last map and shows the spaces the military used for more than 14 days during that 5-year period. So over 5 years, these are the spaces it used for more than 14 days--not per year but over the 5 years. Only 0.5 percent of the eastern Gulf of Mexico was used by the Department of Defense for more than 14 days over the last 5 years--0.5 percent. That means that the Department of Defense regularly uses only 1 out of every 200 acres in the gulf.  I have met with both the Interior Department and the Defense Department and urged them to work together to ensure the best use of Federal waters. This data shows that it can be done.  I am confident that, under the Trump administration's proposal, we can provide thousands of Americans with good-paying jobs, boost our energy manufacturing and security, strengthen our economy, and do it in a way that is environmentally responsible and protects our communities.  I applaud today's announcements because it will make a true difference for our country and for the American people, the American worker who has not done well over the last 8 years but under this administration has begun to do well, and this is the next step in making sure that his and her future is as bright as it ever could be.

638,topic-id,805,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on this.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of all three of these overwhelmingly bipartisan bills.  First, I would like to speak on H.535, the Taiwan Travel Act, a bill which I introduced this Congress along with my colleague, Congressman We appreciate his support on this and a lot of other issues in this Congress, Chairman Royce and other Members as well.  For close to 4 decades now, the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act has served as a cornerstone of U.S.-Taiwan relations, and together, with President Reagan's six assurances, we have maintained peace and stability and security in the Asia-Pacific region. However, there are still major steps that we can take to further strengthen the U.S.-Taiwan relationship.  I believe one of the most important improvements that we can make is to allow the President of Taiwan and other high-ranking officials, like Taiwan's foreign and defense ministers, to visit Washington, our Nation's Capital, something that is currently prohibited. This is our own self-imposed policy and it is outrageous. These restrictions are only carried out because of potential diplomatic retaliation from the PRC, from  Personally, I think restricting high-level visits by senior Taiwanese officials is not only insulting, but it is counterproductive.  We should be encouraging more direct dialogue with the democratically elected President of Taiwan and other highest elected officials.  We let the leaders of China, the PRC, come to Washington on a regular basis and we give them the highest honors, yet we shun the democratically elected leaders of our longtime ally,  We need to send a strong signal that the current approach to bilateral contacts and communications between the U.and Taiwan is outdated and it is time for it to go and be changed, and that is what this bill is all about.  If we seriously want to promote greater democracy in the region, we should be as supportive as possible to the countries that are actually practicing democracy, and that is what Taiwan does. It is a longtime ally of ours.  That is exactly why I introduced the Taiwan Travel Act along, again, with Congressman Sherman and Chairman Royce a year ago--January 13, 2017, to be exact.  This bill, which has broad, bipartisan support from a long list of cosponsors, states that our government should encourage visits between the U.and Taiwan at all levels.  Mr.Speaker, I would also like to quickly voice my support for H.3320, a bill championed by my friend and colleague, Chairman Ted This bill directs the Department of State to assist Taiwan in regaining observer status in the World Health Organization, Unfortunately, Taiwan has been excluded from participating in most of the really important international organizations, including the WHO, for almost 50 years now.  Many of my colleagues and I have advocated for years for Taiwan's meaningful participation in the WHO, much to the dismay of China, which has consistently thwarted these efforts.  Taiwan's exclusion from the WHO creates a dangerous and unnecessary gap in global health, especially considering the stellar health research and medical resources Taiwan has to offer.[[Page H59]]That is why H.3320 is so important. WHO membership for Taiwan is not only in the best interests of Taiwan, it is in the best interests of the rest of the world, including the United  Mr.Speaker, lastly, I want to voice my support for 676, Chairman Royce's and Ranking Member Engel's resolution supporting the rights of the people of Iran and condemning the Iranian regime for its crackdown on legitimate protesters. This is a commonsense measure.  The current regime in Iran has never respected human rights or the rule of law. The recent situation in Iran only underscores this reality.  I am pleased to see my colleagues quickly condemning the atrocities by that government this very day; however, I want to take this opportunity to stress the importance of remembering the big picture in It is a country, let's face it, that is being run by thugs. Not only do they perpetrate violence and marginalize their own people, they harbor, promote, and finance terrorism throughout the region. They threaten America and its allies. They continue to develop ballistic missiles, which we know that one day they would like to have tipped with nuclear devices. That could be a threat not just to our allies in the region, but the United  This most recent outbreak of civil unrest in the country should not be a surprise, considering the Iranian regime's ruthless tactics.  Mr.Speaker, I hope my colleagues join me in support of this measure also and take further steps to hold Iran accountable for both its domestic and international violations. I urge my colleagues to support all three of these measures.  Mr.Speaker, I again want to thank the gentlemen from California, Chairman Royce and Mr.Sherman, for their support on these and other measures.

980,topic-id,343,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte, Majority Leader McCarthy, and Congressman Rutherford for their leadership on this important legislation.  Over the years, our Nation's schools have become soft targets for any would-be killer who has gotten access to a gun. We need to do a better job of protecting both students and faculty from these increasingly frequent threats.  This legislation combines school safety provisions included in two bills, one originally introduced by Mr.Rutherford, and the other by me. Together this proposal represents a collection of commonsense solutions to better help protect our students, our teachers, and other faculty in our schools.  H.4909 reauthorizes the COPS Secure Our Schools grant program and more than doubles its annual budget from $30 million to $75 million annually. Of that $75 million, not less than $50 million per year will be made available for evidence-based strategies and programs to prevent violence in public or private schools over the next decade.  Among the security measures for which these grants may be used include additional training to ensure the health and well-being of students, the development of more robust threat reporting systems, and investments in more advanced security technologies.  Additionally, the COPS Secure Our Schools grants can be used in conjunction with the COPS Hiring Program to ensure that our schools have both the security measures and personnel in place to prevent future violence. On Monday, U.Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Department of Justice will use the COPS Hiring Program to increase the number of school resource officers nationwide. The legislation we are considering[[Page H1562]]today could help that effort by allowing schools to hire retired police officers to provide security if the Department of Justice determines that such plans would provide a significant improvement in school security.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, I want to thank Dan Hils, president of the Cincinnati FOP, for actively engaging on the issue of school safety and for bringing these types of forward-thinking solutions to my attention.

If nothing is done, 200 multiemployer plans are projected to fail, many within the next 10 years, and the impacts will be felt by Americans in every State in our country.  Cuts to these pensions would be economically devastating for 1.5 million people who have earned their livings as carpenters, truck drivers, iron and steel workers, bricklayers, and painters.  They paid into these plans. After a lifetime of hard work, they deserve to retire with dignity and peace of mind.[[Page H1617]]  If these plans fail, taxpayers could have to pay billions of dollars if the Federal Government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation fails.  That is why Democrats have proposed A Better Deal to save our pensions that provides financing to put failing pension plans back on solid ground to ensure that they can meet their commitments to retirees today and workers for decades to come, prevents a single dollar of cuts to benefits retirees have earned, and it puts safeguards in place so that pension plans remain strong in order to be there for today's workers when they retire.  We need to bring these proposals to the floor so we can work together to protect the pensions that American workers have earned.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-15-pt1-PgH1616-7.txt,2055,NIFLA V.

1132,topic-id,965,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.4545.  Today we are considering yet another measure that would weaken our system of financial regulation and bog down regulators in their important work. It would ultimately take us right back to some of the problems that led to the largest financial crisis since the Great The bill puts financial institutions' profits before the protection of consumers and the best interests of the American public.  I rise, Madam Speaker, to say to Members of both sides of the aisle that we must remember the past as we create policies. I was here during that entire period, and it created a very, very heavy darkness over this entire country.  In the years preceding the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve failed to write rules stopping predatory, risky mortgage loans. The OCC and OTS preempted State regulators from reining in mortgage abuses. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other regulators failed to stem excesses at large companies and did not downgrade troubled companies until it was too late. Legislation such as H.4545 sets the stage to return us to an ineffective regulatory system.  Republicans have made it a habit to falsely claim that their legislation is designed to benefit small community banks and credit unions. There are some things that could be changed to improve Dodd-Frank and to provide responsible relief for small community institutions, which I believe we all recognize did not cause the financial crisis.  I have said in our committee and I will say openly in any other place, including on the floor here, that there are some things we can repair in Dodd-But what this bill would do is give all regulated financial institutions an additional way to appeal and, thereby, postpone material supervisory determinations of their prudential regulator and of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.[[Page H1627]]  In other words, messy megabanks and other big financial firms could appeal and delay adverse determinations such as a downgrade of a bank's credit rating for capital asset quality management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to the market risk. It would also enable them to appeal significant deficiencies of their anti-money laundering programs, findings related to the violations of various rules, or a downgrade of their Community Reinvestment Act ratings.  Let's think about this for just a minute. Some banks would be allowed, under this bill, to appeal the OCC's historic and well-deserved double downgrade of its CR rating. Under this bill, Wells Fargo, for example, would be allowed to unleash its army of lawyers to not only fight against the rating, but to tie the OCC up in proceedings. We all know that when the banks who spend millions on legal teams each year deploy those resources, they deploy them to win; and if they win, then American consumers lose.  But let's focus on CRA was intended to ensure that institutions were making loans and providing services in the lower-income and moderate-income neighborhoods in which they were located to address the problems of redlining.  As highlighted in the recent report by the Center for Investigative Reporting, redlining is not just some relic of the past. Sadly, painfully, and embarrassingly, redlining appears to be still very much an ongoing, troubling problem that continues to harm many minority mortgage loan borrowers in cities all across the United States of  This bill will make redlining worse, and that will happen because, instead of improving their ratings and trying to end discriminatory lending practices, bank executives will simply challenge these rates and bully their own regulators into submission.  Now, this may be unintentional, as I would presume to believe, but this bill ignores the fact that prudential regulators and the Consumer Bureau each already have an agency ombudsman and an intra-agency formal review and appeals process. What's more, messy megabanks already have existing avenues to bring a court challenge to any form of regulatory enforcement act.  Thus, what this bill would actually do is create unprecedented barriers to the effective, prudential, and consumer protection supervision of the messy megabanks. It will give messy megabanks and predatory lenders, including payday lenders, an additional way to resist corrective actions to avoid violations of law or safety and soundness risk. As a result, the bill would allow these financial institutions to bog down agencies with frivolous appeals.  In a letter opposing H.4545, the National Consumer Law Center wrote that the effective bill ``would be most pronounced at the largest banks who could appeal dozens or hundreds of material findings from every examination creating enormous roadblocks to supervision. The bank supervision process has been the first line of regulatory defense against threats to bank safety and soundness for a century or more. H.4545 creates unprecedented roadblocks to the effectiveness of bank supervisory determinations and could be devastating to effective regulatory oversight in areas ranging from basic prudential oversight to key consumer protections that make our financial markets fairer.''  In addition, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that H.4545 would increase the deficit by hundreds of millions of dollars--by hundreds of millions of dollars. It would increase by hundreds of millions of dollars. Hundreds of millions of dollars it would increase. Millions of dollars would be increased because banks would be more likely to fail and need government assistance.  In sum, H.4545 would weaken our Nation's system of financial regulation, and, in so doing, it would recklessly set the stage for a return to the captive, hamstrung regulatory system that existed in the years before the 2008 financial crisis that enabled the risky profit-fueled activities of large, complex, messy megabanks and other titans on Wall Street to go unchecked. I therefore urge my colleagues to oppose H.4545.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

1466,topic-id,390,"Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding me the time.  Madam Speaker, this rule fails to make in order four significant measures to address the gun violence epidemic that is plaguing our  In addition to closing the gun show and internet sale loopholes in the background check system, lifting the prohibition on Federal research into gun violence, and creating a process to prevent dangerous individuals from having firearms, the amendment includes my legislation to close the Charleston loophole, which allows gun sales to be completed even if FBI investigations are still going on to determine the outcome of a background check.  The tragic consequences of this loophole were demonstrated on June 17, 2015, when a hate-filled gunman opened fire at the historic Emanuel A.M.Church in Charleston, South Carolina, killing nine and injuring three others. In that fateful instance, the shooter attempted to buy a firearm on April 11 and was initially delayed due to possible red flags in his criminal record.  Despite the investigation not being completed in 3 days, he was allowed to purchase the weapon. The FBI later discovered the shooter would not have been allowed to purchase the firearm due to his documented history of drug abuse had they been able to complete the background check.  Madam Speaker, the consequences are too great to allow loopholes like these to persist. We have laws on the books to prohibit dangerous individuals like the shooter in Charleston from buying weapons, but these loopholes prevent them from being enforced. Thousands of weapons are sold each year through the Charleston loophole alone. In fact, I read that over 6,000 such weapons have been sold through this loophole.  I appreciate that many of my colleagues have signaled they are supportive of improving the background check system, but no amount of improvement will protect the American people if all the loopholes are allowed to exist.  For almost 3 years, the people of Charleston, South Carolina, and across the country have been demanding a vote from this House on closing the Charleston loophole. They have yet to get one.  I urge my colleagues to allow this body to take a vote on closing this loophole and giving the American people the protections they need and deserve. I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question and a ``no'' vote on the rule.  ",CREC-2018-03-15-pt1-PgH1618-4.txt,208,FUNDING THE GOVERNMENT,2018.0,15.0,January

1341,topic-id,751,"Mr.Speaker, today, I rise to talk about the events of Friday night and concern for the continued special counsel position of Robert  On Friday night, late, the Deputy Director of the FBI, Mr.Andrew McCabe, was fired. I haven't seen the IG report. Nobody has seen it. It won't be available until But it is concerning that, that late at night, people were working at Justice to fire a career employee and possibly deprive him of his pension.  Mr.McCabe believes the reason he was fired was because of his knowledge of Mr.Comey's conversations with the President, and his own conversations with the President, and his being a corroborating witness. I don't know what the cause was, but the process was awful. It was rushed, and it seemed to violate the due process rights of this career Federal employee.  And then to watch the President of the United States, a multibillionaire, spike the ball on being able to deprive a 20-year Federal employee of a pension was cruel, un-American, and mean-spirited. It was a shot across the bow at other government officials who are doing their jobs--Justice Department officials, FBI officials, law enforcement officials who love this country and put their lives on the line--and that if they don't agree with the Mueller investigation continuing; or if they see concerns about the United States President and his campaign and some involvement with Russia or with obstruction of justice, or violations of emoluments clauses; that they too risk their jobs and risk their pensions, and risk their financial security.  It is a scary time in America, and we are looking at the abyss.[[Page H1656]]  In December, I was concerned about this as well. And Representative Walter Jones from North Carolina, a Republican, and I, have a bipartisan bill, H.4669, which has a Senate companion filed, and is bipartisan as well, by Senator Tillis and Senator Coons, which is 1741; and it gives the special counsel due process if he is fired for causes that are not objective--related to his job and the performance of his duties.  But it means he couldn't be fired for politics and he couldn't be fired to squelch an investigation concerning the very fundamentals of this country and allegiance and adherence to the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America for which we have all taken an oath to uphold. Nothing is more sacred.  If the President has done nothing wrong, as he has said on many occasions, and he has tweeted recently about Mr.Mueller and said it is a ``witch hunt'' and said there is no collusion. If there is no collusion, if there is no obstruction of justice, if there are no violations, the President should, as Representative Trey Gowdy has said, welcome the continuation of the investigation to clear him.  As Representative Trey Gowdy said: He is not acting like a man who is innocent. And Representative Charlie Dent has said similar things.  If you have nothing to hide, why stop an investigation if there is nothing to find? And if there is something to find and something for the American people to know about, and for Congress to know about and act on, then it is incumbent on us to protect Mr.Mueller and protect that investigation.  That is why we have these bipartisan bills. I know there is Democratic support for these bills, but there hasn't been Republican support that I know of, beyond Senator Tillis and Representative Walter  I call on Speaker Ryan to schedule this bill, have it scheduled in Representative Goodlatte's committee, my committee, the Judiciary Committee, for a hearing, or bring it directly to the floor for a vote.  I call on Representative Goodlatte to schedule the bill for a markup and have it voted on.  But, more importantly, I call on my Republican colleagues to stand up for America and stand up for their oath of office.  We get along, Republicans and Republicans are good people, too. They have different thoughts on certain issues and different perspectives than most Democrats and I do.

847,topic-id,622,"Mr.Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for consideration of a very important measure. The resolution provides for consideration of 140, to amend the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of 2010 to clarify the use of amounts in the White Mountain Apache Tribe Settlement This bill also includes the text of 249, a bill to provide that the pueblo of Santa Clara may lease for 99 years certain restricted land; and H.986, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2017.  The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, 30 minutes of which will be equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee, and 30 minutes of which will be equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Education and the Workforce  Mr.Speaker, the first two items are noncontroversial; however, I am very pleased that within 140, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act is included. This language would allow Tribal governments to be excluded from requirements for employers under the National Labor Relations When President Franklin Roosevelt signed the NLRA into law in 1935, Congress wisely excluded governments, all governments, from the definition of ``employer.''  At the bill signing of the NLRA, President Roosevelt said: ``This Act defines, as a part of our substantive law, the right of self-organization of employees in industry for the purpose of collective bargaining, and provides methods by which the Government can safeguard that legal right.''  The President made clear in his speech at that time that the intent of the law is that it should apply only to workers in the private sector. Tribes are governments and should be treated as such. The intent of the law was and is clear: Tribal governments supervise the employees within their governments and enterprises, not the Federal  From 1935 until 2003, nearly seven decades, the National Labor Relations Board agreed and interpreted the statute in a way that did not apply to Indian Tribes because they were governments. In 2004, the NLRB abruptly changed course and, for the first time, held the act applicable to Indian The NLRB did this by highlighting the fact that the act did not expressly include Tribal governments among those excluded from the phrase ``employer.'' This is simply an egregious act of bureaucratic overreach.  Let me be clear. In this case, acting on its own, the NLRB expanded its jurisdiction. Neither the existing administration at the time nor Congress asked or ordered the NLRB to take this action.  The impacts of labor strife on Tribal governments and economies are more harmful than on other governments because there is no effective tax base in Tribal communities. Indian lands are held in trust by the United States and are not subject to taxation. The high unemployment rates and legal restrictions make income taxation an unfeasible option.  As a result, the businesses operated by Tribal governments, gaming operations, Tribal agriculture, energy and timber operations, and other Tribal government enterprise constitute the sole source of revenue that is used to fund essential government services for  This bill has drawn bipartisan support in our effort to reverse the decision of the In the 114th Congress, the same language passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 249-177.                              {time}  1400  This bill will strengthen Tribal sovereignty and correct this overreach, directing the NLRB to enforce the NLRA, National Labor Relations Act, as it was originally intended. In the end, Mr.Speaker, all we are doing here today with this bill is affirming what was Congress' original intent. The NLRA does not have jurisdiction over Tribal governments.  Mr.Speaker, I urge support of the rule and the underlying legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgH96-5.txt,2259,1300,2018.0,10.0,January
849,topic-id,1105,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, my good friend from Colorado covered a lot of ground, so let me try to respond to some of that area because a lot of it doesn't have a whole lot to do with the legislation until the final phase of his remarks.  In terms of CHIP, we actually agree. I think that's something--and, frankly, this House should be proud it passed a CHIP bill on a bipartisan basis months ago. Our real problem is the United States Senate simply hasn't produced legislation. It doesn't have to accept our legislation. It just needs to pass a CHIP bill so we can go to conference and bargain.  I am pleased that both sides, frankly, have worked to make sure that, when we have done extensions of government spending as we work through some of these knotty issues, we continue to fund I think the leadership on both sides of the aisle have been clear about that, and I think we will. But, again, it will be great when the Senate finally passes a bill or we make this part of a larger spending bill.[[Page H99]]  In terms of my friend's points about the Dream Act, I am honestly heartened at the discussion that took place at the White House yesterday. I think there is a genuine desire to come to an agreement on But the real issue there is border security in addition to legal status.  These folks, obviously, I think, deserve legal status; but you also have to fix the problem, and the problem is on the border. So the outline of the deal is there if people approach it in good faith on both sides of the aisle. I take the fact that we had leadership in both parties meeting with the President yesterday as a good sign in that regard.  In terms of the budget, we probably have at least some areas of agreement. My friend didn't vote for it, but it is worth noting, the House passed every single appropriations bill before the September 30 deadline. We have been waiting now for over 120 days for the United States Senate to just pass a single appropriations bill.  We are in discussions with them now, and I think at some point, when there is an agreement as to what the top line number is--and I think we might not be too far away from that--then we will be able to proceed. But again, this House has done its work. Just as it did on CHIP, it produced legislation on time, and it is prepared to sit down and negotiate with the Senate whenever the Senate decides it can get around to getting its job done.  In terms of the National Labor Relations Act, the Tribal sovereignty portion of this bill, let me point out a couple of things.  My friend does have an excellent record, honestly, in terms of support on Native American issues. This is just an issue where we disagree. There will be Republicans and Democrats who oppose this legislation. There will be Republicans and Democrats who support this legislation.  It is not really purely a partisan question at all, but it is worth noting, the Indian community is united on this issue. The National Congress of American Indians, over 150 Tribal organizations and individual Tribes have come and asked the Congress to correct this oversight.  The fact that this happened in the way it did, that is, the National Labor Relations Board acted on its own to extend its jurisdiction, had no instructions from Congress to do that, had no request from the administration to do that, they just decided they would do it all, that is my definition of a regulatory body run amuck.  For almost 70 years, the NLRB recognized that it did not have jurisdiction in this area and did not try and do it. This is a very new thing. It aroused opposition in Indian Country immediately.  Again, we don't apply these standards to any State government or any local government. We have lots of State governments and lots of local governments involved in activities that are not strictly governmental. They run municipal golf courses. They do water parks. None of these things are necessarily inherently government. They are not forced to comply with this. So we should extend to Tribal government, which we historically have done, the exact same status and rights in this regard as we do to State and local governments.  We would all be pretty upset if the Federal Government decided it would interject itself in this way into the affairs of any individual State or any of the individual localities that we represent.                              {time}  1415  Working for a public entity is different. You certainly have rights, but there are restrictions. You have certain rights, like the right to strike, that in most States and most localities do not exist. Tribes should have the same right to make those sorts of decisions for themselves. Again, they resent and have resented historically the violation of their sovereignty. In this case, a regulatory agency without the authority of this body and without the authority of the administration that existed at that time acted on its own.  What the Indian nations and Indian Country have come and asked is: Restore us the sovereignty that you historically accorded us.  That is all this legislation does.  The last point, my friend says this is unlikely to become law. I beg to disagree. Not only did this pass the House on a bipartisan vote in the last Congress, but this Congress it has been reported out of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on a bipartisan vote. There is every reason to believe this. We will see what the administration does. But I suspect views change over 25 years, and I would hope the administration is supportive of this. As a matter of fact, as I recall, I think they issued a statement to that effect.  So, regardless, let's do our job. Let's continue to do the job we did in the last Congress when, on a bipartisan basis, Republicans and Democrats alike decided Tribal sovereignty was an important issue. We should work together to defend it and to expand it. In this case, we are working to reclaim something that a Federal agency took away, acting on its own, over a decade ago. So the solution to this is long overdue.  Mr.Speaker, I would certainly urge my friends to support the rule and, more importantly, the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

853,topic-id,600,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Again, Mr.Speaker, I certainly respect my friend's right to bring up a subject that they think is important and is important, and it is appropriate that they use their time to do that.  I would remind them that there is a negotiation underway. I think the issue here is less about DACA probably and more about border security. The issues are naturally paired together. These young people came here through no fault of their own. They are not responsible for any sort of criminal act. But they were transported across a very porous border.  So to ensure that we are not here again doing the same thing again, strengthening that border at the same time that we provide legal status seems the appropriate thing to do. I suspect neither is achievable without the other linked together.  So I take it that the two sides are negotiating. I am not involved in those negotiations. I am not a member of the relevant committees, but I think the two sides are involved in that negotiation. My hope is that they come to an agreement and that we can have a large, bipartisan victory and a piece of legislation that we are all proud of. But I suspect it is going to take some give-and-take on each side to achieve that.  I do want to go back, though, to the principal underlying legislation here and ask my friends--many of whom, by the way, will support this legislation. There will be considerable Democratic support for this. But I would hope--and, again, I understand this is an issue of competing goods, but sovereignty is not something we should grant to States and localities and deny Indian  We should not have a double standard here. If we need to make changes across the entire Labor Relations Act, fair enough. I guess we should consider that. But we should not single out Tribes and make them subject to capricious, arbitrary, bureaucratic activity deciding on what their legal status is, what their rights are, and interfere with their ability to operate their own businesses, which are absolutely indispensable to supporting their governmental activities.  We do not give Tribes the power to tax. They can't tax their own land. They can't tax their own citizens. If they are not successful economically, they have to rely on the limited resources given by the Federal Government to do everything from protecting their citizens to providing healthcare for their citizens and to making sure that there is appropriate education for their citizens. They ought to be able to do what other governments do and earn money and run their own affairs.  We allow States to do that. We allow localities to do that. For almost 70 years, we allowed Indian Tribes to do that. Then we took it away from them. They are not even asking for something new. They are just asking for something that was taken from them, in terms of their authority and sovereignty, to be restored to them.  Mr.Speaker, again, I go back to urging the passage of the underlying legislation. I hope that we continue to work on these other issues that my friends have brought up. We are working on them in areas like CHIP, like the DACA question, and like the border security question.  But let's also take our time and pass this very important piece of legislation and restore to Indian Tribes what the National Labor Relations Board took away from them over a decade ago.

855,topic-id,529,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to respond to a couple of my friend's points.  Let me begin by disagreeing respectfully with my friend's assertion that people are having their rights stripped away.  The only people losing their rights here are Indian That is what happened when the NLRB did what it did. Without the direction of Congress or the administration, it decided on its own it would treat Indian Tribal governments different than it treated other governments. So it is those rights to the Tribal governments that we are busy trying to restore.  My friend, who, again, is very good on Indian issues, as a rule, and I understand the competing claims here. So I recognize the tension that is involved in that. But it is not as if Tribal governments don't have their own labor codes and their own standards. Frankly, those have to comply with American law.  Under the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1965, there is absolutely nothing that a Tribal government can do that would contravene the guaranteed rights in the United States Constitution for all  So to suggest that they are somehow violating the rights of American workers, I think, is to mischaracterize who they are and how they have acted. What they have said is, if we are sovereign, if the Federal Government says that State governments and local governments are allowed to regulate their own workforces, then Tribal governments are allowed to do the same.  I want to disagree also with my friend. There are lots of municipal golf courses in the United There are lots of municipal water slides. There are park systems. You can go to the State of Virginia and it happens to own the liquor business in the It has decided it is going to make that a State function. We don't regulate those employees.  So the idea that just because it is a money-making activity, that we then somehow treat it differently, we don't do that to any locality or any State in the country.  We just had an unelected Federal agency decide on its own it was going to do that to Indian It is not doing it to anybody else, just to I would submit that that is fundamentally unfair. Again, nobody's rights are taken away. Every American citizen has exactly the same right.  But if you were to go to work for the Federal Government, you don't have precisely the same rights you do in the private sector. The same thing is true here. If you choose to go to work for a Tribal government, you live within that regime. That regime has to comport with the Constitution and the laws of the United States, and you have not lost your action rights in Federal court if you think there is a violation.  So I think, frankly, this is a case that is crystal clear. You treat everybody the same way, every governmental unit the same way. That is all the Tribes are asking for.

858,topic-id,1778,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, and I want to stress that, while we disagree on this, I appreciate his efforts in Native American issues. He has a record that, I think, is an excellent record overall. We just disagree very profoundly in this case.  I will say this: if you happened to just casually turn on the coverage of the debate at any point, you might wonder what we were debating about. In the course of the debate, we have talked about CHIP, we have talked about the DREAMers, we have talked about the budget, we have talked about We have spent a lot of time talking about a lot of different things other than the information at hand. I don't begrudge my friend. He feels very passionately about those areas.  It is interesting to me that, on the FISA issue, for instance, we will actually have a debate tomorrow. The amendment my friend supports will be in order tomorrow. We will have an opportunity to do that.  I think there are good faith efforts underway on both sides on the DACA issue and on the issue of FISA, particularly on the issue of the budget as well. Again, I wish this place worked a little differently. Sometimes deadlines are like alarm clocks here, but those things are underway.  What we are talking about today is also an effort that has been waged by Indian nations for over a dozen years to try and reclaim part of their sovereignty that was unjustly taken away from them.  I am going to disagree with my friend very profoundly. Nobody's rights have been taken away. Every American's rights are guaranteed by the Constitution of the United The Indian Civil Rights Act of 1965 makes it abundantly clear no Tribe can do anything in contravention and restrict the rights of  The only people who have lost rights in this whole discussion and episode have been Tribal governments who had their right to regulate their labor affairs, the same way we allow States and localities to do it, taken away from them.  It wasn't taken away from them by an act of this We never passed legislation. It wasn't taken away from this because the administration ordered some agency of the executive branch to do something. It was taken away because, acting in a rogue manner, the National Labor Relations Board, on its own, decided it would expand its legal authority.  Well, that is great. They may have a case to make. But that is not what they are supposed to do. They are supposed to operate within the authority Congress gives them. If they think they need a grant of additional authority, they come to Congress and ask for that grant of additional authority. They don't simply, on their own, decide they will willy-nilly violate the rights of a sovereign Native American nation. That is exactly what happened in this case. Frankly, the Tribes have been extraordinarily patient in pursuing the remedy to this.  I think we ought to, today, take the opportunity to rectify a wrong that an agency of the executive branch did without the consent of Congress or even without the consent of the President of the United States at the time and allow Tribes to reclaim the authority that they exercised for over 70 years.  If we think we need to do something different in that regard, that is a fair point to make. If we do, it needs to be the same for State governments and local governments. You don't single Tribes out of sovereign entities and impose something on them that doesn't apply to everybody else that is a sovereign of the United States of  Mr.Speaker, in closing, I encourage all Members to support the rule, but I recognize my friends probably will not, and that is fair enough. That is normal partisan debate.  But with 140, the House is taking steps to strengthen Tribal sovereignty. This body actually has a pretty good record. I worked with my friends across the aisle when we passed the Violence[[Page H103]]Against Women Act, which had a very important component giving Tribes back some of the jurisdiction that they needed to regulate domestic abuse and sexual assault on their own territory.                              {time}  1445  My friends were overwhelmingly supportive and helpful in that measure. It would not have happened without them, so I know in many cases we do agree. But in this case, under this bill, Tribal governments will be able to be excluded from the requirements for employers under the NLRA, just like State and local governments.  This legislation will reverse the bureaucratic overreach of the NLRB and clarify the law once and for all. This bill is a commonsense solution that will clarify the original intent of Congress that the NLRA does not have jurisdiction over Tribal governments.  I applaud my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for this work. We will actually have a split decision over this. There will certainly be some Republicans supporting my friend's position, but by and large, I think this House will do what it did the last time it considered this legislation, and that is, on a bipartisan basis, pass the law.  This time, given the action of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, we have every reason to believe the legislation will be picked up and sent to the President's desk, where I am confident it will be signed.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Polis is as follows:            An Amendment to 681 Offered by Mr.Polis       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       2.

Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.3440.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution. . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

1067,topic-id,1098,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak in support of the Senior$afe Act, which I am pleased is included in the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection My good friend Senator Claire McCaskill and I have been working on Senior$afe for several years now. This bill originated with testimony offered by Maine Securities Administrator Judith Shaw in a hearing before the Senate Aging Committee in 2015. I am the chairman of that committee, and Senator McCaskill was the ranking member at that time. We introduced the bill that year, and reintroduced it in January of 2017. Today, the bill is cosponsored by almost a third of this body, balanced nearly evenly on both sides of the aisle.  I am disappointed to learn that my colleague Senator Warren has filed an amendment that would seriously undermine the Senior$afe Act by restricting its provisions just to liability that may arise under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley If this amendment were to pass, financial service providers that report suspected frauds against seniors could still face liability under other laws or causes of action, which would discourage providers from making these critical reports. I understand that the proponent of this amendment contends that Senior$afe could somehow shield a financial service provider from its own fraud. That is simply not correct.  In order to receive the protections of the Senior$afe Act, financial service providers must train their employees to spot suspicious activity that may indicate fraud targeting seniors, and make good faith, reasonable reports of that suspicious activity to the proper authorities. The bill is clear that it only shields reporting a suspected fraud; there is no protection for committing a fraud.  Combating financial abuse of seniors requires consumers, regulators, law enforcement, and social service agencies at all levels of government to work collaboratively with the private sector. The stakes could not be higher. According to the GAO, financial fraud targeting older Americans is a growing epidemic that costs seniors an estimated $2.9 billion annually. Stopping this tsunami of fraud is one of the top priorities of the Aging Over the years, we have held numerous hearings exposing an endless variety of financial abuses targeting our Nation's seniors. These range from the notorious IRS phone scam that burst onto the scene in 2015, to the incredible ``drug mule'' scam, where trusting seniors have been tricked by international narcotics traffickers into unwittingly serving as drug couriers, and then find themselves arrested and locked up in foreign jails.  Just last week, our committee heard the story of Stephen and Rita Shiman from Saco, ME, who lost more than $1,200 in the notorious grandparent scam. In this scam, fraudsters call a senior pretending to be a family member, often a grandchild, and claim to be in urgent need of money to cover an emergency, medical care, or a legal problem.  Sadly, not all scammers are strangers to their victims--in too many cases, seniors are exploited by someone they know well. Sometimes, that abuse is perpetrated by ``friends'' or family members who are handling the victim's affairs informally. Other times, the abuse is committed under the color of a fiduciary relationship, such as a power of attorney or guardianship.  No matter the scheme, one factor is common to all: The fraudsters gain the trust and cooperation of their victims. Without this, their schemes would fail. The scammers also push their victims to act fast and not to tell anyone what they are doing.  Unfortunately, due to the ruthless cunning of the scam artists, many seniors do not see the red flags that signal fraud. Sometimes they are too trusting or are suffering from diminished capacity, but just as often, they miss the signs because the swindlers who prey on them are extremely crafty and know how to sound convincing. Whatever the reason, a warning sign that can slip by a victim might trigger a second look by financial service representatives trained to spot common scams, who know enough about a senior's habits to question a transaction that doesn't look right. In our work on the Aging Committee, we have heard of many instances where quick action by bank and credit union employees has stopped a fraud in progress, saving seniors untold thousands of dollars.  Let me give you an example. In 2016, an attorney in the small coastal city of Belfast, ME, was sentenced to 30 months in prison for bilking two elderly female clients out of nearly a half a million dollars over the course of several years.  The lawyer's brazen theft was uncovered when a teller at a local bank noticed that he was writing large checks to himself on his clients' accounts.  When confronted by authorities, he offered excuses that the prosecutor later described as ``breathtaking.'' He submitted bills for ``services,'' sometimes totaling $20,000 a month, including charging her $250 per hour for 6 to 7 hours to check on her house, even though his office was just a 1-minute drive down the road.  In another example, a senior citizen in Vassalboro, ME, was looking to wire funds from his account at Maine Savings Federal Credit Union to an out-of-State location, supposedly to bail out a relative who was in jail. Something about this transaction did not sound right to the credit union employee. She asked the customer, and he said he had received a call from an ``official'' at the jail, but that official had instructed him not to speak to anyone about this. The official, of course, turned out to be a con artist.  Fortunately, the credit union worker recognized this as a scam, and her quick thinking saved her customer from falling victim and losing his savings.  These stories demonstrate the critical nexus that financial institutions occupy between fraudsters and their victims. Their employees, if properly trained, can be the first line of defense protecting our seniors from these criminals. Regrettably, various Federal laws can inadvertently impede efforts to protect seniors because financial institutions that report suspected fraud can be exposed to litigation. The Senior$afe Act encourages financial institutions to train their employees and shields them from lawsuits when they make good-faith, reasonable reports of potential fraud to the proper authorities.  There is no doubt that financial fraud and scams targeting seniors is a growing problem. In 2016, the Aging Committee heard testimony from Jaye Martin, the executive director of Maine Legal Services for the Elderly, who told the committee that her organization had seen a 24-percent increase in reports of elder abuse in just 1 year. Many of these cases involve financial fraud.

2149,topic-id,977,"Mr.President, this week I joined my colleague, the senior Senator from Vermont, Mr.Leahy, in introducing the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention This bill would update and reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act programs, which have provided lifesaving services and housing for America's homeless youth for more than 40 years.  Homelessness is affecting youth in unprecedented numbers. According to a recent study by Voices of Youth Count, an initiative of Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago, approximately 4.2 million young people experience homelessness in the United States each year. Some of these youth may stay away from home for only 1 or 2 nights, and others have been living on the streets for years. Approximately 73 percent experienced a homelessness episode lasting more than 1 month. The study also found that homelessness is as prevalent in rural communities as it is in urban communities.  The Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act would reauthorize and strengthen the programs that help homeless youth meet their immediate needs, and secure long-term residential services for those who, sadly, cannot be safely reunified with family. Three programs--the Basic Center Program, Transitional Living Program, and Street Outreach Program--help community-based organizations reach these young people when they need the most support. These programs help runaway and homeless youth avoid the juvenile justice system, and early intervention helps these young people escape victimization.  As chairman of the Senate Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, working to end the scourge of homelessness--in both youth and adults--has been one of my top priorities. According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, there has been a 27-percent drop in chronic homelessness since 2007. We must build on this success so that homeless youth have opportunities to succeed just as other youth. This bill is an important step in that direction.  The RHYA programs have produced powerful success stories. In 2015, the Housing Appropriations subcommittee held a hearing during which Brittany Dixon, a former homeless youth from Auburn, ME, testified about her personal experience as a homeless youth. After becoming homeless at age 18, she connected with New Beginnings, a service provider in Lewiston, ME, where[[Page S1835]]she received the help and support she needed to develop critical life skills and become self-sufficient. She went on to earn a college degree and obtain a full-time job as an education technician at an elementary school.  New Beginnings has used RHYA resources to connect with youth who need food, a safe place to sleep, health services, and education support. More than 135 young people were served at its 24-hour youth shelter in 2016, where they gained the support to return home safely, find independent living options, and deal with trauma, substance abuse, and mental health challenges. The Street Outreach Program, which would be reauthorized by our legislation, allows New Beginnings to operate an outreach drop-in center that reaches more than 500 youth annually.  Staff at Preble Street, a youth shelter in Portland, leveraged a grant from the Transitional Living Program, also reauthorized by our bill, to support First Place, a program that helps young people break out of homelessness and plan for independent living. They work with local landlords to secure affordable apartments for youth who cannot safely reunite with their families and help them develop the life skills they will need to achieve their goals.  For more than 25 years, Shaw House, in Bangor, has served Maine youth living in five rural counties. The Basic Center Program, BCP, reauthorized in our bill, helps Shaw House offer food, clothing, and other basic needs assistance, with the goal of increasing family reunification and reducing youth homelessness across In fiscal year 2014, 94 percent of the minors who entered BCP exited these programs safely and appropriately, and 69 percent were reunited with their families. One of the improvements in our bill would allow BCP grantees to serve youth for up to 30 days, instead of the current 21 days.  Teens run away and become homeless for many reasons. They are also at high risk of victimization, abuse, criminal activity, and death. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children estimates that, in 2017, 1 in 7 of nearly 25,000 youth reported to them as runaways were sex-trafficking victims. In Maine, recent reports show that, of the more than 10,000 reported human-trafficking cases last year, 26 percent involved minors. Several hundreds of these victims identified as runaway or homeless youth. This population is at greater risk of suicide, unintended pregnancy, and substance abuse. Many are unable to continue with school and are more likely to enter our juvenile justice system.  Our bill focuses on this tragic problem by supporting trauma-informed, wraparound services for victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation. Congress has passed legislation in recent years to combat these horrific crimes and support survivors, and the policies and tools included in the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act are important pieces of the Federal response to human trafficking.  Homeless young people need access to safe beds at night and oftentimes services during the day. A growing number of homeless youth identify as According to the Voices of Youth Count report, LGBT young people are twice as likely to be homeless. Our bill would ensure that those seeking services through these Federal programs are not denied assistance based on their race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.  The Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act will support those young people who run away, are thrown out, or are disconnected from families. A caring and safe place to sleep, eat, grow, and develop is critical for all young people, and the programs reauthorized through this legislation help extend those basic services to the most vulnerable youth in our communities.  I thank Senator Leahy for his leadership on this bill and urge my colleagues to support it.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-20-pt1-PgS1834-3.txt,2121,S.J.

Today I am proud to rise in support of the STOP School Violence Act, which I believe will be a critical step forward in preventing future school shootings like the tragedies we witnessed in Marshall County, Kentucky, and, of course, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland,                              {time}  1330  In the wake of the Marshall County shooting, I heard from the families of victims and other members of the community that their top priority was enhancing physical security, whether that means installing metal detectors, hiring school resource officers, or making other evidence-based improvements to prevent and mitigate school violence.  This bill will provide resources to schools so that they can do just that while also supporting training for students, teachers, and local law enforcement to identify and prevent violence in our schools.  The Marshall County community is resilient. As we continue to mourn the loss of two young lives in our community along with those in Parkland, we will also fight to protect our students, educators, and communities. I believe the STOP School Violence Act will help defend our schools from those who wish to inflict harm on others, and I urge my colleagues to support this important and bipartisan bill.

2038,topic-id,1152,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.3249, the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act of 2017.  I would like to thank Chairman Goodlatte and the entire Judiciary Committee for their efforts on this legislation and working through the process to bring this to the floor.  I wanted to set out some recent headlines from the in-depth reporting by The Washington Post on the rise of the MS-13 gang problem in the Washington metropolitan area, which includes Maryland, D.C., and Virginia, and why this legislation is needed.  ``MS-13 is `taking over the school,' one teen warned before she was killed.''  ``She told the girl she'd see her in hell before stabbing her. Now, she's guilty of an MS-13 murder.''  ``'People here live in fear': MS-13 menaces a community 7 miles from the White House.''  ``Police: MS-13 members in Maryland stab man more than 100 times and decapitate him.''  This is from my local paper, the Loudoun-Times Mirror:  ``MS-13 gang members convicted in gruesome murder of a Leesburg teenager.''  In this particular case in Leesburg, Virginia, the teenage boy, Carlos Otero-Henriquez, was stabbed over 50 times and his body was dumped in a quarry miles away in West  The Acting U.Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Tracy Doherty-McCormick, had this to say after the murderers were convicted: ``The hallmark of MS-13 is extreme violence. This brutal kidnapping and murder is a tragic reminder of the impact MS-13 has on communities here in northern My hope is that our efforts to investigate and prosecute this case will send a clear message: Violence will be aggressively prosecuted.''  This, and many of these other cases, are why we need the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act, which authorizes $50 million, but targets 30 percent being directed toward already-established regional gang task forces.  As we know, MS-13 is a transnational gang that has been found not only here in the Washington metropolitan region, but in Los Angeles, Long Island, Houston, and other cities throughout the country.  The Washington Post has highlighted how the 2014 border surge contributed to the MS-13 gang problem writing: ``The violent street gang is on the rise in the United States, fueled, in part, by the surge in unaccompanied minors.''  The unaccompanied minors, who often fled their native country to get away from the gangs, arrive here only to find themselves targeted by those very same gang members they were fleeing.  MS-13 preys upon these youngsters in their own community--and let me emphasize, it is their own community that they are victimizing--who may not have much of a family structure, and, in effect, MS-13 tries to become their family or threaten them with death if they don't.  Last summer, when I went on a ride-along with our Northern Virginia Regional Task Force, I was able to see their good work right in front of us. There was a young man on the sidewalk of Sterling Boulevard in Sterling, Virginia, just miles from here. The gang task force noticed him and turned around and decided to stop him and see what he was up to. With years of experience, the officers knew the MS-13 indicators.  The boy looked about 16 years old, from what I could tell, but it turned out he was actually a 22-year-old gang member. He was covered in MS-13 gang tattoos. When he lifted up his shirt when they asked him to do so, he showed all of the particular signs of MS-13, from his head to all over his feet.  It turns out he had been jailed in El Salvador for murder when he was 16 and had been deported from the United States twice for engaging in violent crime.  As it turns out now, when they come to the border, we don't have the law to be able to stop them. Fortunately, this House did pass a law back in the fall, on a bipartisan basis--it is over in the Senate now--to be able to stop these gang members from getting in the country in the first place and being able to deport them quicker. But in the meantime, we need to increase the work and the support for these regional gang task forces.                              {time}  1545  We also saw the technology they use. They can use something along the lines of an iPad or an iPhone where they put this gang member's fingerprint on there and immediately it comes to light, as shown in the international records, that he was a murderer and that he had been in jail. But they need more of those resources. They only had two of those that they were able to use, and they said every one of their cars needs that kind of resource.  That same night that we were on the ride-along, three other suspected MS-13 gang members were also picked up. This isn't an aberration.  At a town festival in Herndon, Virginia, in my district, the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force told us that they had identified an estimated 200 to 300 suspected gang members who were milling about while our children were getting popcorn, getting on the rides, and there were people coming together to have a hotdog or a hamburger in a community festival.  According to the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force, an MS-13 gang member put a hit out on his own brother because he refused to join the organization. Fortunately, because of the good, intensive work of the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force, they spared this young man from being killed by his own brother.  That is why we need to have these resources that we are voting on today. We need to help on a Federal level.  The community policing involved with the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force includes officers who speak Spanish, understand the gang culture, and help get the kids out of this. They get involved in the education, getting them into the schools. They understand where they are trying to target these young people, and they are familiar with their communities and have developed very good relationships with these communities.  ICE officials complement these efforts by removing the dangerous gang members once identified and allowing the task force to work in our highest risk schools and communities to prevent gang violence.  The Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act would direct this additional Federal funding toward these gang task forces so that our gang task forces--which are comprised in my area of 13 local, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies--can really make the best antigang efforts in this three-pronged approach that they engage in: education, intervention and prevention, and enforcement.  Mr.Speaker, I have seen firsthand the good work these gang task forces can do to remove these gang threats from our community, so I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I thank you for the opportunity to speak to this.

1327,topic-id,789,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to this bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to the committee.  If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended, and you are going to love it.  My amendment would prohibit Federal agencies that regulate financial institutions from tailoring their regulation of the financial industry at the request of and the personal gain of the President, the President's family members, or senior executive branch officials; something that ought to concern us in light of recent headlines.  This is a simple prohibition that in any other era would pass for common sense. Unfortunately, we have become inured to the daily outrages emanating from this White House, and we are learning how much our democracy depends on the morality and ethical behavior of individuals in the absence of institutional restraints.  When the President calls his friend to tip him off, if that is what happened, to a major announcement about steel tariffs, and that friend dumps affected stocks, there is no mechanism to prevent that from happening.  It just shouldn't happen. Morality and ethics dictate as much.  When a senior White House employee repeatedly violates the Hatch Act, allegedly, we depend on the President to punish and rein in that kind of behavior. If he doesn't, nothing happens, and the message to the rest of the Federal Government is that the politicalization of government institutions is okay as long as it is the President who approves your motives.  Now, of course, this institution, a coequal branch of government under our Constitution, could create consequences, but, of course, we won't.  Instead, we will continue to turn a blind eye to activities and behavior that are dangerous to our democracy, Mr.Behavior that should concern any patriotic  In predicting inaction by this body, I am not engaging in idle speculation.

And not so much as a whimper from the  A year ago, one might have said Congress would never pass the President's tax plan without insisting on first seeing the President's tax returns and how he might stand to benefit or not from the actions we took.  Well, we did just that. And in the process, we exploded the deficit by close to $2 trillion for good measure.  This should go without saying, but the corruption that is emanating in this time, in this administration, is not normal. It is not how the government should be run.  Neither President Trump, Jared Kushner, nor Ivanka Trump has divested entirely from their personal businesses. And our appreciation for divestiture as an anticorruption measure only grows in its absence.  The President's son-in-law and senior White House official, Jared Kushner, has been freelancing meetings with foreign governments while also seeking financing from those countries for his distressed property at 666 Fifth Avenue in He is taking meetings with financial institutions in his official capacity, apparently, and then turning around and securing, apparently, hundreds of millions of dollars in loans for his family business from those same institutions. This is not normal. It is not how government should be run.  We should not be selling our foreign and domestic policies to the highest bidder at a real estate auction. This Congress could hold hearings, could issue subpoenas, could create real consequence for these actions, but we see and hear no evil.  The Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on which I sit, is missing in action. We have requested multiple subpoenas for information from the White House on everything from General Flynn's activity while serving as National Security Advisor to Jared Kushner's conflicts of interest, or apparent conflicts of interest, and inability to obtain a security clearance.  Not a single subpoena request has been granted by the majority. The majority won't even give us a vote on those requests. It may seem tedious[[Page H1584]]and repetitive, but we need to get back to the basics of government oversight.

1047,topic-id,546,"Mr.President, today is 1 month to the day from a tragic shooting in Parkland, FL, where 17 high-school-aged students lost their lives. As so many of my colleagues have done, I come to the floor to remember them, to honor their loss, to speak to their classmates, colleagues, and families, and to share from the experience of my own home State of  This morning, today, there are high school students across our country and across my home State of Delaware who are walking out of class to try and draw the attention of those of us in Washington to the urgent need that we work across the aisle to tackle the plague of gun violence that affects communities all over this country. That is why we see young people not just across the country but including in my home State of Delaware demanding that we take action. We need to answer their call.  Let me speak to my hometown of Wilmington, Just last month, 5 people--5 people, last month--under the age of 21 were shot in Wilmington,[[Page S1699]]and 2017 ended as one of the worst years ever for gun violence and homicides--197 individuals shot, 32 wounded fatally.  If I could, I wish to read the names of 31 individuals who were victims of gun violence in the city of Wilmington in 2017. We are working--Federal, State, and local officials; police departments and community and civic leaders--to try to tackle these challenges, but some of the core causes can only be addressed here. We need to find a way to work together, to respect each other, to compromise, and to tackle the very real epidemic of gun violence in our country.  These 31 Delawareans lost their lives in the city of Wilmington to gun violence in the year 2017: Dariberto Velazquez Mendez, age 32; Santanu Muhuri, age 64; Jermaine Francois, age 34; Charles Mays, age 66; Jamiere Harris, age 21; Kayden Young, age 21; Ainsley Cumberbatch, age 23; Jamiel Congo, age 23; Keevan Hale, age 38; Tajuane Helton, age 41; Richard Crosby, age 30; Yaseem Powell, age 18; Tyree Robinson, age 23; Bryan Brooks, age 29; Tynesia Cephas, age 16; Joquon Coverdale, age 22; Derrius Jackson-Paul, age 23; Sherman Pride, age 22; Shamar Lindsay, age 25; Cyree Watson, age 22; David Bailey, age 23; Nycire Mills, age 23; Kai'Mel Ennals, age 20; Barry White, age 19; Allen Melton, age 28; Albert Hazzard, age 33; Dwayne Grimes, age 19; Justin McDermott, age 18; Andrew Pennewell, age 25; Shawn Lockhart, age 29; and Keanan Samuels, age 20.  The facts of all of these different episodes of violence and loss vary widely, but the conclusion must be the same: We have to find ways to listen to each other, to work across the aisle, and to stop deadly shootings in our country.  I am encouraged that many of my colleagues today have introduced legislation that would take meaningful steps to tackle gun violence and make all of us safer. We must act. We must listen to the voices of young Americans demanding that we do our job and make our country safer.  I yield floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2018-03-14-pt1-PgS1696-4.txt,1984,S.J.

1833,topic-id,1176,"Mr.President, I join my colleagues on the floor this afternoon to address the mounting concerns we have with the foreign policy of the Trump administration. I want to thank my colleague, Senator Menendez of New Jersey, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and comment at the outset on two things that have been widely said that I don't think are true.  First is that Democrats are bottling up the President's vitally needed nominees for senior ambassadorial positions[[Page S1824]]or senior Department of State nominations and that we are holding key nominees.  Frankly, nothing could be further from the truth. Earlier today, in a business meeting, our Foreign Relations Committee, which works well on a bipartisan basis, voted out a whole series of Ambassadors, treaties, and Assistant Secretaries of  Second, I heard it said by some pundits that Democrats wish President Trump ill, that we are working to do everything we can to hold him back and prevent him from being successful.  Let me start by saying that I think all of us know that we are strongest when we stand together and work together. All of us have at some point heard the old adage that politics should stop at the water's edge, and nothing would make me happier then to see our foreign policy, our military, and our diplomatic efforts succeed around the world.  I do not wish our President ill or our State Department a lack of success, but I think it deserves mentioning for the few minutes I am taking on the floor today that President Trump, who promised as a candidate to be unpredictable and nontraditional, has overperformed in that category. His foreign policy has been defined by inconsistency, volatility, unpredictability, and at times, a failure to advance our values. This comes exactly at a time, as my colleague from Connecticut was just reciting, when our allies and partners crave stability and leadership and when the threats to our democratic way of life from Russia and China are on the rise.  Trump's ``shock and awe'' style of governing was demonstrated recently by his abrupt firing of the Secretary of State in a tweet and his further humiliation of the Secretary of State in stories that dribbled out about exactly how and when and where he was fired. We should not be conducting foreign policy in the same way that one might host a reality TV show like ``The Apprentice.''  In just a year, as I have attended a variety of conferences and meetings around the world, I have been struck by the number of ways in which the President has undermined alliances and friendships that have taken decades to build. Let me briefly review a few of the ways our European and Asian allies have been puzzled or confounded--by our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership; by imposing a travel plan on citizens from majority Muslim countries; by withdrawing from the Paris climate accord; by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum, including against our close North American and European allies; by questioning our commitments to NATO; and by denigrating an entire continent when discussing the value of potential immigrants from  Real and consistent leadership around the world that reflects American values is needed now more than ever. In the dozen countries I have visited for regional security conferences in the past year, I have heard the same from our vital allies. Senator McCain and I traveled to Halifax in Canada and to Singapore in Southeast Asia for a series of bilateral meetings of representatives of close and trusted allies. Senator Flake and I have traveled to Senator Graham and I have traveled to the Middle In all of these trips, what I have heard is that our allies are concerned, that they need reassurance about how and where we stand, and that in many cases, yes, they are beginning to move on past us and to reach accommodations with China or Russia, having concluded that we are not committed to engagement with the world.  Every time I go on a visit to a foreign embassy--an embassy of the United States overseas--I sit down with our Foreign Service officers and I ask about their work and service, and I am overwhelmingly impressed with the professionalism and dedication of our career development professionals and our diplomats. Yet, overwhelmingly, the big number of vacancies at the State Department and a budget that proposes a more than 30-percent cut in the State Department and USAID have had a significant, demoralizing impact on these people whom we count on to advance America's interest and values around the world.  Let me also say briefly that on the continent of Africa, where I have spent a great deal of my time on the Foreign Relations Committee, we are missing Ambassadors to some of the biggest and most important countries--South Africa and Tanzania being just two, for example. It is a continent where China's pervasive presence is not being countered by an America that is robustly engaged. Why does this matter? Because in this century, Africa will become the fastest growing and largest market for our goods and should be the continent in which we have the closest alliances and partnership. But instead of building partnerships and helping to extend markets here at home, the Trump administration is squandering the current momentum and watching from the sidelines as democratic norms deteriorate.  As a member of both the Appropriations and Foreign Relations Committees, I was gravely concerned that for a second year in a row, the Trump administration budget proposed deep cuts in diplomacy and development. We must recognize that while these investments serve a humanitarian purpose, they also make us stronger by spreading American values, safer by building coalitions, less susceptible to terrorism by creating a more stable world, and more prosperous by creating stronger export markets for our goods. If we want to remain a global leader, we need a strong State Department and USAID that are sufficiently funded.  Let me turn to the matter of Russia before I conclude. Throughout his administration, President Trump has not only turned away from some of our critical allies and weakened our commitments to international coalitions but has also refused to head-on, clearly address the real and multifaceted threats we face from  Russia's activities, as has been testified to by senior administration officials over many hearings, now are directly interfering with our democracy--our last election and likely our next election, as well as those of our closest allies throughout the world. Rather than sending a clear and forceful signal to Russia that our political affairs are not to be meddled with, President Trump has instead at times turned aside from this challenge and failed to address it.  Let me conclude by simply saying that now more than ever, the United States must lead in the world, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee on a bipartisan basis to advance our interests.  Thank you, Mr. With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2018-03-20-pt1-PgS1813-2.txt,1984,S.J. RES. 54--MOTION TO DISCHARGE,2018.0,20.0,March
647,topic-id,3445,"Mr.President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification, the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations  In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.

Also      included are four (4) MK 29 missile canisters, U.     Government and contractor representatives' technical      assistance, transportation, engineering and logistics support      services, and other related elements of logistical and      program support. The estimated total case value is $133.3      million.       This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy      and national security of the United States by improving the      security of a major ally that has been, and continues to be,      a force for political stability and economic progress in the      Asia-Pacific region.       The proposed sale will provide Japan with an increased      ballistic missile defense capability to assist in defending      the Japanese homeland and U.personnel stationed there.      Japan will have no difficulty absorbing these additional      munitions and support into the Japan Maritime Self Defense      Force (JMSDF).[[Page S102]]       The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not      alter the basic military balance in the region.       The principal contractors will be Raytheon Missile Systems,      Tucson, AZ (SM-3); and BAE Systems, Minneapolis, MN (MK 29).      There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection      with this potential sale.       Implementation of this proposed sale will require annual      trips to Japan involving U.Government and contractor      representatives for technical reviews, support, and oversight      for approximately five years.       There will be no adverse impact on U.defense readiness      as a result of this proposed sale.

The proposed sale will involve the release of sensitive      technology to the Government of Japan related to the Standard      Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA missile. The ship- or ground-     launched SM-3 Block IIA is the most recent iteration in the      SM-3 family. It has two distinct new features: larger rocket      motors that will allow it to defend broader areas from      ballistic missile threats; and a larger kinetic warhead. The      kinetic warhead has been enhanced, improving the search,      discrimination, acquisition and tracking functions, to      address emerging threats. Once enclosed in the canister, the      SM-3 Block IIA missile is classified The optics      hardware and signal processor are classified       2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain      knowledge of specific hardware, the information could be used      to develop countermeasures which might reduce weapons system      effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with      similar or advanced capabilities.       3. A determination has been made that Japan can provide      substantially the same degree of protection for sensitive      technology being released as the U.This      proposed sustainment program is necessary to the furtherance      of the U.foreign policy and national security objectives      outlined in the policy justification.       4.

Also      included are eight (8) MK 825 Mod 0 RAM Guided Missile Round      Packs (GMRP) tri-pack shipping and storage containers; RAM      Block 2 MK 44 Mod 4 Guided Missile Round Pack (GMRP); two (2)      MK 32 Surface Vessel Torpedo Tubes (SVTT) triple tube      launchers; two hundred and fifty (250) rounds of AA98 25 mm      high explosive and semi-armor piercing ammunition; seven      hundred and fifty (750) rounds A976 25mm target practice and      tracer ammunition; four hundred and eighty (480) rounds of      BA22 57mm high explosive programmable fuze ammunition; nine      hundred and sixty (960) rounds of BA23 57mm practice      ammunition; containers; spare and repair parts; support and      test equipment; publications and technical documentation;      personnel training and training equipment; U.Government      and contractor representatives' technical assistance;      engineering and logistics support services; installation      services; associated electronics and hardware to control the      launch of torpedoes; and other related elements of logistics      and program support. The estimated cost is $98.4 million.       This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and      national security of the United States by helping to improve      the security of a strategic partner. Mexico has been a strong      partner in combating organized crime and drug trafficking      organizations. The sale of these ship-based systems to Mexico      will significantly increase and strengthen its maritime      capabilities. Mexico intends to use these defense articles      and services to modernize its armed forces and expand its      existing naval and maritime support of national security      requirements and in its efforts to combat criminal      organizations.       Mexico intends to use the weapon systems on its Mexican      Navy Sigma 10514 Class ship. The systems will provide      enhanced capabilities in effective defense of critical sea      lanes. The proposed sale of these systems and support will      increase the Mexican Navy's maritime partnership potential      and align its capabilities with existing regional navies.      Mexico has not purchased these systems previously. Mexico      will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its      armed forces.       The proposed sale of this equipment will not alter the      basic military balance in the region.       The equipment will be provided from U.stocks. There are      no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this      potential sale.       Implementation of this proposed sale will require annual      trips to Mexico involving U.Government personnel and      contractor representatives for technical reviews, support,      and oversight for approximately two years.       There will be no adverse impact on U.defense readiness      as a result of this proposed sale.

The MK 32 SVTT system is UNCLASSIFIED, but the system      has one classified firmware card that controls launches. The      system is currently in service in the U.Navy and in      various other foreign nations that utilize shipboard launched      torpedoes. The firmware card is essential to the ability of      the system to successfully launch torpedoes when directed by      the shipboard command and control system.       2. The RGM-84L Harpoon Surface Launched Block II missile      system, to include publications, documentation, operations,      supply, maintenance, and training to be conveyed with this      proposed sale have the highest classification level of      The Harpoon Block II missile is a non-nuclear      tactical weapon system currently in service in the U.Navy      and in 29 other foreign nations. It provides a day, night,      and adverse weather, standoff surface-to-surface capability      and is an effective Anti-Surface Warfare missile. The RGM-84L      incorporates components, software, and technical design      information that are considered       3. The following components being conveyed by the proposed      sale are considered sensitive and are classified      CONFIDENTIAL:       a. The Radar Seeker       b. The GPS/INS System       c. Operational Flight Program Software       d. Missile operational characteristics and performance data       These elements are essential for the Harpoon Block II      missile to selectively engage hostile targets under a wide      range of operational, tactical and environmental conditions.      The version being sold to Mexico is not the Coastal Target      Suppression land attack missile version.       4. MK 54 All-Up-Round Lightweight (Warshot) torpedoes and      associated support equipment, training, test equipment, and      technical support; Recoverable Exercise Torpedoes (REXTORPs);      and Exercise Torpedoes (EXTORPs) are associated with this      sale. The MK 54 Lightweight Torpedo (LWT) can be launched      from surface ships, helicopters, and fixed wing aircraft. The      MK 54 LWT is an upgrade to the MK 46 The MK 54 LWT      contains new sonar, guidance and control systems with modern      technology. The new guidance and control system uses a      mixture of commercial-off-the-shelf and custom-built      electronics. The warhead, fuel tank, and propulsion system      from the MK 46 torpedo are re-used in the MK 54 configuration      with minor modifications. The MK 54 is highly effective      against modern diesel and nuclear submarines. It has advanced      logic that allows it to detect and prosecute threat      submarines operating in challenging littoral environments. It      is also effective in the presence of advanced countermeasures      that may be deployed by threat submarines. The assembled MK      54 torpedo and several of its individual components are      classified The MK 54 operational software is      classified as SECRET as is any hardware upon which the      software has been installed. Mexico has not requested nor      will it be provided the source code for the MK 54 operational      software. The MK 54 has a feature referred to as ``Memory      Scuttle'' that erases the operational software at the      conclusion of any exercise firing so that the software will      not be compromised if the torpedo is not recovered after the      exercise firing. Possession of MK 54 Torpedoes and associated      equipment should not lead to any vulnerability disclosures.       5. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain      knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the      information could be used to develop countermeasures or      equivalent systems which might reduce weapon system      effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with      similar or advanced capabilities.       6. A determination has been made that the Government of      Mexico can provide substantially the same degree of      protection for the sensitive technology being released as the      U.This proposed sale is necessary to the      furtherance of the U.foreign[[Page S104]]     policy and national security objectives outlined in the      Policy       7.

1115,topic-id,1198,"Mr.President, I wish to thank the Senator from New Jersey, my good friend, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for his comments.  Today we met with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, a very impressive young man who is transforming the country. We talked about the importance of our relationship, no doubt, but we strongly, strongly pushed back on what is happening right now in Yemen and asked them to take strong corrective action. I was there when this occurred, and I certainly expressed the same.  We also talked about the enrichment they are pursuing and some of the concerns that exist there. I want to thank the ranking member for his leadership and the words he just spoke.  Let me just speak to the debate we are having on the floor. This is a very entrepreneurial move. I don't say that to be pejorative. I know one of the Members is on the Judiciary Committee that is bringing this to the floor. I can imagine some highly important judicial issue not being debated in the Judiciary Committee but just being wafted to the floor for a debate. I know that is not the way the Judiciary Committee operates.  One of the other Members is on the Energy and Natural Resources I can imagine some complex cap-and-trade bill being offered, and instead of it being worked through the committee--or some ethanol bill or some other type of bill--instead of it being worked through the committee, somebody just decides to bring it directly to the floor. That is what is happening here today.  I certainly don't shy away from this debate. I appreciate the fact that Mitch McConnell understood that very few Members of our body--unless they are on the Foreign Relations Committee, Armed Services Committee, or happen to take a particular interest--even know much about what is happening in Yemen, and a lot is happening there. So I appreciated the briefing that took place last week to give Members a sense as to what is occurring there, but the proper way to deal with these issues is to deal with them in committee.  One would think that maybe there is some Yemen legislation that the committee is holding and not acting on. That is not the case. Any of these Members could have offered Yemen legislation relative to this issue, and the committee would take it up. That has not occurred.  So let me tell my colleagues what is happening in the committee. We have a bill that is being worked on by Senator Young and Senator Shaheen dealing with this very issue. They are building support. They are working with the administration to make sure the definitions are correct, and they have had numbers of people involved with them. We plan to have a Yemen hearing in the next few weeks to deal with this issue but also to take up appropriate legislation. That is the way we typically deal with issues of such importance.  Let me say this: This is an issue of great importance. It not only affects the tremendous humanitarian crisis that is occurring in Yemen and the radicalization of the Houthis, supported by Iran--a proxy of Iran--but also Saudi Arabia's own security. It also affects the way we deal with other countries. I think many people here understand fully that right now, or recently, we have been involved in the same kinds of activities with France, as they have dealt with issues in Mali, including refueling and helping them some with intelligence issues.  So this is something, again, that we need to take up in a serious way, and the committee is committed to doing so.  What I hope will happen today is that Members of this body will let the Foreign Relations Committee do its job and that we will bring a bill forward that we can properly debate and amend.  I am hoping that later today, when I offer a tabling motion, Members of this body will respect the members of the Foreign Relations Committee who deal with this issue and let it go back to committee, with the commitment that we plan to bring forth legislation to actually deal appropriately with many of the issues relative to Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and ourselves.  Let me mention one other thing. We have been working for some time to deal with the authorization for the use of military force. It has been an issue that has been before us for many years. It is the replacement and revision of the 2001-2002 AUMF that many people in this body have had concerns about because it has been so long since they were enacted. We have activities that are taking place around the world still based on those two authorizations. We have a markup on an AUMF on April 19 scheduled to try to revise so we can give people an opportunity to weigh in on this issue on the floor.  By the way, the way the AUMF is being constructed at present, when we go into new countries, when we take on new groups, the Senate would have the ability to weigh in on those issues.  So I just would like to say to the body and those who are looking in, we are not shying away from this debate. There has been no legislation whatsoever that has been held up on this topic. Legislation is being introduced soon in a bipartisan way to deal with this terrible issue that is taking place in  We are going to have a hearing. We will have a markup. In addition to that, we are going to have a markup on a new AUMF to deal with the issues our country is dealing with around the world with al-Qaida, ISIS, and other entities that have been associated parties.  With that, I just want to let people know that is kind of the way we deal with things around here. None of us is happy with the current status, but I think a better way for us to come up with a prudent solution to what is happening there is to go through the normal committee process. I hope the other Members of the body will respect that.  I am glad that, by the way, the ranking member--by the way, this policy has been taking place in It started under the Obama administration, the same exact policy. The Senate has acted on it by voting for appropriations, so it is not as if we have not taken action ourselves. We have done that through the We have done that through various State Department authorizations. So we have acted upon it. There are concerns about what is happening there. Legislation is going to be introduced to try to deal with[[Page S1811]]this, and that is the way we deal with complicated issues. No one is shying away from the debate. We just hope to table this and move it back and deal with it in the orderly, appropriate way.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2018-03-20-pt1-PgS1801-4.txt,1825,TOURNEAU,2018.0,20.0,March
1836,topic-id,946,"Mr.President, I have enjoyed hearing the discussion about the item before us. I must say that I would feel a whole lot better about this debate if it were focused on our refueling French jets going into Mali--the same exact debate. I assume these individuals would consider those to be hostilities, but, somehow or another, that doesn't rise to congressional approval.  This one, I think, is politically tinged. Saudi Arabia certainly has issues. They have conducted themselves in manners that we wish were better. The Crown Prince was here today, and all of us who met with him ``demarched'' him, if you will, on the conduct relative to Yet, at the same time, we know that because American folks are involved in refueling and because we are helping, to a degree, with intelligence, we know that less civilians are being killed there. We know that. We know that our being there has affected their conduct.  I wish to talk about process here. The sponsors of the resolution, who I have great respect for, have used a very entrepreneurial method to bring this to the floor, and I don't say that to be pejorative. They have reached into the War Powers Act and pulled out something that was unintended for this purpose. I think everyone understands that, and I think everyone understands that if we don't table this, we will be setting a precedent here. It will be a situation of first impression where from now on, when our Air Force is refueling jets in the air, we are involved in hostilities. I don't think that is a standard that we wish to set.  I want to argue this on a different level. It is hard for me to believe that we would take up an issue of this serious nature and not allow the committee of jurisdiction to work its will. We had a hearing last week that Senator McConnell set up for all Senators to come in and be briefed on His stated reason for doing that was that most people in the Senate don't know much about what is happening in People on the Foreign Relations Committee do, and the people on Intel do, and the people in Armed Services do. But most of the Senate has not really been involved recently in that issue.  Typically, the way we work around here is that the committee does its work. It does its recommendation. It works with the administration, and you come forth with a piece of legislation. Can we imagine, for instance, with tax reform, if we just had some kind of entrepreneurial way of bringing tax reform to the floor without the Finance Committee working, or bringing[[Page S1826]]FISA to the floor without Intel working? That is not the way we are supposed to do things here.  So we have a bill that is being generated right now--it is a bipartisan bill--by Jeanne Shaheen and Todd It may not be the bill we deal with on Yemen, but it is just now being developed.  By the way, I skipped a beat here. I want to refresh people's memory as to what we are voting on. We are not voting on anything but a decision to discharge the Yemen issue from the committee without the committee taking any action, without the committee having any hearings. This is a vote to say that we are going to skip the Foreign Relations Committee and we are going to set precedent here on the floor in this entrepreneurial way and that we have reached into the War Powers Act to find a clause to bring it to the floor, which was never intended for this purpose.  So what I would say to people is that a better way of handling this would be to table this motion, to let the Foreign Relations Committee do the work that you have assigned the Foreign Relations Committee to do. We are going to have a hearing on We have a piece of legislation that is being developed in a bipartisan way, with the Republicans and Democrats, to deal with this issue. Let us work our will in the appropriate way--by the way, in a way that actually will generate an outcome.  In addition, I know there are Members on the floor who have been frustrated, as someone referenced earlier, that the 2001-2002 AUMF is still being used. The Presiding Officer has been very involved in trying to develop a new AUMF that would supersede those two AUMFs and give the Senate and the House the ability to weigh in every 4 years on these types of actions. We are going to have a markup on a bill that our Presiding Officer, Senator Kaine from Virginia, Senator Young from Indiana, and many people have been involved in. That markup is going to take place on April 19.  So, hopefully, the Senate will not only have an ability to deal with a real bill on Yemen that actually will generate a real outcome coming through committee but also will have the ability to deal with an AUMF that will set aside the fact that for years the Congress has not weighed in on this issue.

So, in closing, I would just ask--just like every other committee here in the Senate that hopefully takes its work seriously and does work especially on important matters like this that affect people's lives--that this body would think that a better recommendation would be to table this effort to have this wild West debate on the floor over the course of the next several hours and, instead of doing it in that manner, to give the committee of jurisdiction the ability to work its will with Yemen through hearings, through a process on the committee that would actually bring a bill to the floor that has been thought through and where we had worked with other bodies of government to get it in a place where then it could be amended and dealt with in a more methodical and appropriate way.  I would like to remind people one more time that we also plan to mark up an AUMF on April 19 to deal with the lingering issue of having an open situation where we are still dealing with ISIS and al-Qaida and others based on something that was authorized to be done in Afghanistan years ago.

1842,topic-id,244,"Mr.President, very briefly, I just want to set the record straight. The House of Representatives voted to say that the war in Yemen is not covered by the 2001-2002 AUMF, and I think this body would agree. They did not do as was just mentioned by the Senator from As a matter of fact, they decided not to take up this measure that we are taking up today because they thought it was not a good measure to take up.  I don't want anybody in this body to think that the House has already supported this effort. The House not only didn't support it, they wouldn't take it up because they thought it was damaging to our country's foreign policy.  I hope that today people will join me in voting to table this motion and to let the committee do its work as it is supposed to do. Let's bring something to the floor that will actually have an outcome, and then let's have a debate down the road on the AUMF--the 2001 and 2002 AUMF--which I hope will be given floor time.

58,topic-id,1232,"Mr.President, this last weekend I had the honor of going to Camp David with Members of both the House and the Senate to meet with the President and Vice President and members of his Cabinet to talk about the prospects for 2018. After a very successful 2017, we are now looking forward to what sort of legislation we can do on a bipartisan basis that will help us build on those successes of 2017. Many of these are domestic priorities, but, of course, others are national security in nature.  Our internal strength, of course, affects our diplomacy and military effectiveness abroad, and where we were located, at Camp David, actually demonstrates that. It was, after all, the site for secret talks to negotiate the Camp David Accords, historic peace agreements signed by Israel and Egypt in 1978. What happened on American soil ultimately changed the global landscape, and it wasn't the only time. Over the years, Camp David has come to represent peace. It is a place where leaders put aside their differences to look to avoid conflict.  Nonetheless, today we have to admit, given the global environment, that peace is imperiled. We have recently seen that in Iran, where the largest wave of protests in more than a decade have revealed widespread discontent not only with Iran's economy but also as a result of the actions taken by its military, which has supported Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations around the world. As a matter of fact, Iran is the 1 state-sponsor of international terrorism, which is one reason why many of us blanched at the idea of releasing money to Iran as part of the joint agreement on Iran's nuclear program--money that they could then plow back into their support for organizations like Hezbollah and their aggressive support for terrorist organizations generally.  Last week the Trump administration imposed sanctions on five entities tied to Iran's ballistic missile program. Apparently, Tehran continues to care more about funding its terrorist proxies across the Middle East than supporting its own citizens, and frustrated[[Page S61]]Iranians rightfully have said: Enough already; we are not going to take it anymore.  As Secretary Mnuchin said last week, here in the United States we shouldn't ``hesitate to call out the [Iranian] regime's economic mismanagement, and diversion of significant resources to fund threatening missile systems at the expense of its citizenry.'' The Secretary is exactly right.  Meanwhile, the situation in North Korea remains precarious. That country--and I say this unequivocally--must denuclearize. That is why I recently introduced a resolution with many of my colleagues here in the  The purpose of the resolution is to expressly declare that Congress is unified in its condemnation of the increasingly hostile and intransigent behavior of the Democratic People's Republic of  Since Kim Jong Un took power 6 years ago, he has ordered at least four nuclear tests, including the September detonation of what his regime--and outside experts generally agree--said was a hydrogen bomb.  Despite great efforts made by the United States, including a recent Executive order by the President, North Korea's history as a bad-faith negotiator continues unabated on the world stage. It obstinately violates diplomatic norms and human rights at will and was recently redesignated, itself, as a state sponsor of terrorism.  The resolution I referred to a moment ago asserts that the United States, as well as the United Nations Security Council and our regional allies, should continue to implement the absolute strictest of sanction regimes in an effort to get the regime's attention and hopefully bring them to the table as part of this path forward toward denuclearization. We must continue to exhaust every reasonable diplomatic option necessary to achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.  Our resolution also recognizes that the President has the constitutional responsibility to protect the United States and our allies, but it emphasizes that congressional authorization is necessary prior to committing U.forces to a sustained military operation on the Korean In other words, under the Constitution, the President has his responsibilities and duties, and Congress has its responsibilities and duties, and this resolution recognizes both. We look forward to working together closely with the President in a unified front this year to confront North Korea, as well as rogue actors elsewhere.  President Trump, we know, does not take our national security threats lightly. He has a world-class national security team, with General Mattis, Secretary Tillerson, and Director Pompeo, just to name three. In an important speech last month, the President outlined the four pillars of his administration's national security strategy.  He said the first pillar is to protect our homeland. We can't secure our Nation if we can't secure our own borders, and we can't secure our borders unless we confront, both at home and abroad, the threat of terrorism and ideologies bent on doing us great harm.  Second, the President said that we need to promote American prosperity because the only way we are going to be strong militarily and at the homeland is if we have the resources and economy to pay for it. Economic growth at home is critical for our influence around the globe as well. We, of course, took a big step in this direction by passing tax reform last month, but a lot more needs to be done to continue to grow our economy and to return America to its historic prosperity--like updating and not scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade agreements, for example, and rebuilding our national infrastructure, which was also on the agenda at Camp David this weekend.  The President's third pillar of the national security strategy is to preserve peace through strength. We usually attribute that concept to Ronald Reagan, but of course he is not the first or the last to recognize the joinder of peace and strength. President Trump said in his speech that ``weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unrivaled power is the most certain means of defense.''  I think he is exactly right--which means we have to end the defense sequester that started with the Budget Control Act of 2011. I supported our efforts to rein in discretionary spending, but the fact is, only about 30 percent of the money that the Federal Government spends is actually appropriated, and a little more than half of that is defense spending. I simply cannot in good conscience agree to continue those budget caps for defense spending without considering the increase in risks to our men and women in uniform and our country's national security generally. We have to continue to modernize our military, which we started last year by reauthorizing the Defense Authorization  Fourth, the President's strategy asserts that we have to advance American influence in the world through strong alliances and by championing our core values without apology. As the President said:       A nation that does not protect prosperity at home cannot      protect its interests abroad. A nation that is not prepared      to win a war is a nation not capable of preventing a war. A      nation that is not proud of its history cannot be confident      in its future. And a nation that is not certain of its values      cannot summon the will to defend them.  I couldn't have said it any better myself.  I yield the floor.

SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Bankruptcy Venue Reform Act      of 2018''.     2. FINDINGS AND       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) bankruptcy law provides a number of venue options for      filing bankruptcy under chapter 11 of title 11, United State      Code, including place of incorporation, principal place of      business and assets, or where an affiliate has filed a case      under chapter 11;       (2) the wide range of permissible bankruptcy venue options      has led to an increase in companies filing for bankruptcy      outside of their home States, or the district in which their      principal place of business or principal assets are located,      a practice known as forum shopping, and has resulted in a      concentration of bankruptcy cases in a few districts;       (3) bankruptcy forum shopping prevents small businesses,      employees, retirees, creditors, and other important      stakeholders from fully participating in bankruptcy cases      that will have tremendous impacts on their lives,      communities, and local economies, and deprives district      courts of the United States of the opportunity to contribute      to the development of bankruptcy law in their jurisdictions;      and       (4) reducing forum shopping and manipulation in the      bankruptcy system will strengthen the integrity, build public      confidence, and ensure fairness in the bankruptcy system.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to prevent the      practice of forum shopping in cases filed under chapter 11 of      title 11, United States     3. VENUE OF CASES UNDER TITLE 11.       Title 28, United States Code, is amended--       (1) by striking section 1408 and inserting the following:     ``1408.

Some, not really knowing what was in the bill and people who were determined to find fault with it, were let's just say a little skeptical at first. They wondered what this whole thing was about and who would actually benefit. But now the verdict is starting to come in. Many folks are pleasantly surprised, for the first time in a while, knowing that Congress and Washington, DC, actually have produced something that will make their lives better. They are appreciative because they are seeing the immediate consequences. In response, more than 100 companies have announced they will give wage increases, they will increase their charitable contributions, and they will give bonuses to their employees. One million Americans are receiving money they previously didn't have, thanks to passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  But it is not just about bonuses, of course. We expect that once the IRS updates its withholding tables, wages will rise, too, take-home pay will go up, and hopefully people will see that in their paychecks in As my colleague the junior Senator from Ohio wrote last week, ``With this tax reform, the proof will be in your paycheck.'' Families can spend that extra money any way they wish, of course. That is the point. They can spend it on projects long delayed. They can spend it on their kids. They can give it as an allowance or some modest compensation for chores performed or apply it to their kids' future education, or people may just figure out they want to save for a rainy day. The number is pretty shocking as far as how many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and cannot sustain a $400 loss in income and make things work for them. So this will provide them, if they wish, a little bit of cushion for a rainy day. They can donate it to their house of worship. They can help a neighbor or a friend who has fallen on hard times.  In some places, we are learning that families will enjoy lower utility rates based on what gas and electric companies are doing for their residential customers in light of their new tax savings. In places such as Michigan, Montana, Minnesota, Kansas, Kentucky, South Dakota, and Arizona, the utility regulators in those States are looking at the tax reduction of those investor-owned utilities and how that will calculate into the rate of return that they are guaranteed under the law. But it looks to me as if it will be good news for consumers, that lower heating bills will be the result during the chilly times of the year and lower air-conditioning costs and other electricity costs when spring and summer come around. So it is encouraging to see this sort of perhaps unexpected consequence of tax reform but one that will directly benefit consumers.  This is real, it is significant, and it is like priming our economic pump--a little push here and a pull there because of tax reform, and all of a sudden, the entire engine of the American economy is chugging along and will soon be running at full speed.  In Texas, you can hear the economy humming along healthily, and we should listen. We should listen to the voices of the job creators like one in New Braunfels, which is between Austin and San It is called Rush Rush Enterprises specializes in commercial vehicles. It reported last month that it planned to give each of its 6,600 employees a $1,000 bonus after President Trump signed the tax reform into law--$1,000 each to 6,600 employees. The chief financial officer of Rush Enterprises talked about the additional savings the company would incur as a result of the reduction in its tax rate, which fell from 35 percent to 21 percent. He said:       You've got a choice. We could've kept it and stuffed it in      the company bank account or coffers, or we can share it with      the people. We chose to share it with the people because it's      the right thing to do.  Well, I couldn't be prouder of that demonstration of the great Texas spirit--employers paying it forward.  This gentleman went on to say that his company believes tax reform will be beneficial not only for his office and his employees but also for his community and for overall economic growth. To him, it is about the bigger picture.  New Braunfels, though, isn't the only place where companies are paying it forward. A telecom giant, AT&T, headquartered in Dallas, TX, and two prominent airlines--American Airlines and Southwest Airlines--have responded in similar fashion, offering large bonuses to hundreds of thousands of their employees and promising to make significant capital investments in the future and update their fleet of aircraft--all with the savings they will incur as a result of this Tax Cuts and Jobs  Meanwhile, a restaurant company that owns a chain of popular steakhouses in Texas and elsewhere has announced it will use its savings from lower rates--about $70 million--to improve customer service and to provide additional benefits to its employees. The restaurants will be spending a significant amount of money to make sure the dining experience is more worthwhile, hopefully providing not only jobs to the people who prepare the food but those who serve it and the vendors who sell it. Not only will this legislation have the effect of improving a waiter's and waitress' salary, but I think this demonstrates once again how the impact of tax reform is far-reaching, perhaps in ways we really didn't necessarily think about. But this is what happens when people get to keep more of the money they earn. They spend it in a way that improves their quality of life and improves their economic security.  In Texas, our economy hopefully will continue its steady ascent. In its annual economic freedom index, an organization called the Fraser Institute just ranked Texas as 2 in the country. I am not too happy about that. We don't like being 2 in anything. But we have been in the top five of this list for 11 straight years, and it has been because of our lower taxes, our fiscally conservative approach to spending, and our commonsense approach to regulation that makes it easier for investors and entrepreneurs to succeed. When they succeed, that means more jobs are created and people can do the work that provides them the means to support their family and improve their quality of life. We call that the Texas model. Although it is not particularly unique, you would think it would be common sense. But as they say, here in Washington, DC, common sense is not all that common.  Nationally, the situation is looking up, too, in part because the Trump administration shares this Texas approach. The U.economy added 2 million jobs in 2017, and unemployment is at a 17-year low. Consumer confidence is at an alltime high since it was first recorded--I believe it was about 16 years ago. Over the last two quarters, the economy has grown by more than 3 percent. That is up from roughly 1.9 percent during the previous administration. People are excited to see the economy continue to improve in 2018 thanks to tax cuts and other regulatory reform and a government that is no longer hostile to private business and job creation.  I am glad to hear how many positive steps have been taken over the past few weeks in response to tax reform, but it is early. As I pointed out, it has only been a couple of weeks. I look forward to hearing many more such stories in the days ahead.  I intend to spend this next year, when I travel around the State of Texas, looking for the small businesses and individuals who benefit from this[[Page S85]]important piece of historic legislation. I look forward to coming back to the floor of the Senate to continue to share the stories of this success. Letting people keep more of what they earn, having more take-home pay, improving their standard of living, and making the United States more competitive in the global economy--rather than seeing businesses and investment move overseas, let's see that come back home, which I think we will see in droves, and the American people will be better off for it.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgS84.txt,1692,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2018.0,9.0,March

627,topic-id,2309,"Mr.President, many recall that Christmas came a little early this year--or, I should say, last month--as we delivered comprehensive tax reform to the American people--a historic overhaul of our Nation's Tax Code and the first since 1986, more than three decades. Since that time, the President has now signed the bill into law, and we have already begun to see signs of how tax reform is transforming the economic landscape across the country and making life better for American citizens.  The New York Times reports that job creators are eager for the tax cuts to take effect and that a wave of optimism is surging among them. That is their quote, the New York They report that businesses are ready to create jobs and raise wages. They will invest in new plants and equipment that will bolster economic growth, grow the economy, and help to create more jobs and improve take-home pay.  It is not just the New York Times that sees optimism spreading. There are plenty of real-world examples that illustrate that as well. One healthcare and home products company announced that in response to the tax bill, it would award all employees a $100 bonus for each year they have worked for the company. So if an employee has been at the company for 8 years, the average tenure, that would be an extra $800 in his or her pocket to fix their car, repair a water heater, or replace carpets in their living room.  Two telecom giants recently announced even larger bonuses for hundreds of thousands of their employees, raises of $1,000 each. Now, it may be that these companies are getting ahead of the game, because in a tight labor market, where unemployment rates are relatively low and where economic activity goes up, we know there is going to be more and more competition for good workers, and that means that employers are going to be required to pay more for those workers in that competition for workforce and labor. So it may be that these companies are a little bit ahead of the game, but I expect to see, whether it is done as these companies have done it or not, in a low unemployment rate scenario where there is more competition for workers because more economic activity is occurring, that more jobs are being created and that we are going to see all workers' take-home pay increase as a result.  These companies have also said that they plan to increase capital spending in response to the tax reform we passed last month. Some banks have said they will raise their minimum wage to $15 an hour and donate as much as $400 million to community and nonprofit organizations.  One major airline in my home State of Texas announced that it will give all full-time and part-time employees a $1,000 cash bonus and make $5 million in additional charitable donations. They have also said--because they believe there is going to be an increased number of people flying--that they are going to buy more jets, more planes to accommodate that increase in air travel. This is all good stuff when we are looking at getting the economy growing again and creating more jobs and better wages.  Finally, German economists recently released a study finding that the U.corporate tax rate will now sharply improve incentives for foreigners to invest in America--exactly what we wanted to happen. Of course, this will come at the expense of high-tax countries in So just think of it as their loss is our gain, but that is exactly why we felt it was necessary on a bipartisan basis to reduce what was effectively the highest business tax rate in the world, at 35 percent. That is why people like Barack Obama in 2011 called for us on a bipartisan basis to reduce that rate and to make it more competitive, and the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, and others, and Republicans on our side of the aisle all agreed that this was the right policy. Well, now we are beginning to see that policy pay off as a result of the bill we passed in December, which was signed into law on December 22.  I would say that all these examples are pretty telltale signs that the optimism reported by the New York Times isn't fake news. It is real. Tax reform is changing the economic landscape, paychecks are growing, and job creators are responding in all sorts of positive ways. I think that is a terrific way for us to begin 2018.  Now, for all of us who worry about what is going to happen to our individual paycheck, the good news is that the IRS is now working hard to update its withholding guidance documents and, once it does, Texans and Americans, in general, will begin seeing larger paychecks, more take-home pay hopefully as early as  Well, that is the good news. That is what we were able to accomplish at the end of last year that will hopefully continue to pay dividends in terms of economic growth and take-home pay and more jobs, but we still have a lot of work to do.  Over the next few weeks, we have a very, very full plate. First and foremost is funding the Federal Government and avoiding a shutdown come January 19, when our stopgap continuing resolution expires. It is crucial that both sides come together to ensure that critical government functions are not held hostage to other demands. High on my list is to make sure that we continue to fund our national security and the Department of Defense and continue to pay our warfighters and make sure that they receive the training and equipment they need in order to keep our Nation safe. That is just one of the items, but it is my highest priority.  The second is close to it, and that is making sure we provide natural disaster relief. This last year, we saw what seemed to be an unprecedented array of natural disasters--from wildfires out West to historic rain events like Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Louisiana, and hurricanes in Florida, the Virgin Islands and, of course, Puerto I commend the House for passing the $81 billion disaster relief package last month, but with so many record-setting disasters this last year--first and foremost in my mind is Hurricane Harvey in Texas--we, in the Senate, need to take a little extra time to make sure that all of the varied competing interests are accommodated. In the coming weeks, I am going to continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that Texans whose homes, schools, roads, and workplaces were affected by the storm receive the help they deserve and so desperately need. We are not asking to be treated any better than anybody else, but we are not going to accept being treated worse.  We look forward to working together with our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico, in Florida, out West, and, of course, in Texas and Louisiana to make sure that we do our job and treat everybody exactly the same. The House bill is a useful starting point, but it is my hope that we can improve upon it and make sure Texas can fully recover and rebuild.  Third on my list of to-dos is an important national security program that most people may not have heard much about, which allows the Federal Government to obtain communications of foreign intelligence targets, which is set to expire on January 19. One of the technical advantages that the United States has over any other country in the world is our ability to listen to foreign actors and gather intelligence that will forearm our first responders and our national security apparatus, as well as others, to keep our Nation safe.  This particular law, which has been called the crown jewel of our national security by the Director of the FBI, is known as section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendments Act, an essential safeguard against terrorism and a valuable tool for gathering foreign intelligence, as I have said. We need to work quickly to ensure that it is reauthorized for a long term.  The fourth item on our to-do list is addressing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, or You will recall that back a few years ago now, President Obama decided to try to unilaterally issue an order providing work permits and legal status to roughly 800,000 children, now adults, who came with their parents illegally[[Page S11]]to the United While these are certainly the most sympathetic group of people whom we need to address--and I think we can, and we will in a compassionate and honest sort of way--I am grateful to President Trump for returning the fate of this program where it belongs--in the hands of That is after President Obama's DACA provisions failed in Federal court.  I am confident that both sides can come to an agreement regarding the legal status of these roughly 800,000 individuals who were brought to the country illegally while they were still quite young. That includes 124,000 DACA recipients in my State of Texas alone.  Many of these individuals make valuable contributions and should not be penalized for decisions made by their parents, the legal ramifications of which they could not at such a young age fully understand or consent to. But any such agreement must include corresponding measures regarding an enforcement of our immigration laws.  I think that one of the biggest tragedies in recent years in our country is that the American people have simply lost confidence in their government when it comes to securing the border and enforcing our immigration laws. I believe this provides an opportunity, not only for us to provide compassionate relief to the DACA recipients I mentioned a moment ago but to restore an enforcement of our immigration laws, including border security, the additional personnel, and the technology required in order for us to know who is coming into our country and why they are here and to make sure that they only do so by legal channels.  My hope is that our Democratic colleagues will abandon their threats to shut down the government and will engage with us in good faith, because we stand ready to talk to them and negotiate in good faith as well.  Finally, on my personal to-do list is my goal to pass the bill we call the Fix NICS Act as soon as possible. This is to fix the National Instant Criminal Background Check System that is checked by federally licensed firearms dealers when somebody goes into a store to buy a firearm--whether it is a shotgun to hunt, a pistol to defend themselves, a rifle for hunting, or for home defense. I think it is really important in the wake of Sutherland Springs for us to get this bill passed.  This is the bill I filed after those terrible shootings in Sutherland Springs, which resulted in the loss of 26 innocent lives, with about that same number injured as well. This tragedy was entirely preventable because the individual who committed that heinous act on that day was legally disqualified from purchasing a firearm by the fact that he was a convicted felon, he had been convicted of domestic violence, and he had been committed to a mental health institution. But none of that information was uploaded by the Air Force into the National Instant Criminal Background Check  What did he do when he went in to buy firearms? He simply lied, and he said he had no disqualifying event in his life like those I mentioned earlier--convicted felon, mental health institutionalization, and a domestic violence conviction. He simply lied about it. The background check system failed us and the people who were victims of that terrible day in Sutherland We need to get that fixed.  This is one of those rare times when folks who are ardent believers in the Second Amendment, as am I, and those who are perhaps less inclined to be enthusiastic about the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens can come together and say: Let's at least fix the current law. Let's make sure that if somebody is disqualified from buying a firearm, this National Instant Criminal Background Check System actually works.  I am delighted to say that Senator Murphy from Connecticut, Senator Feinstein from California, and Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader from New York, have joined me and Majority Leader McConnell and so many others on our side of the aisle to say that this is something we can and we should do. I simply cannot face the prospect of looking into the eyes of somebody who has lost a loved one as the result of a preventable mass shooting incident like we saw in Sutherland We have the ability here to pass legislation that will save lives and to prevent people who are legally disqualified from purchasing firearms from doing so.  All of these on this list are just a few of the challenges we face as a new year begins. I think these are things we can address on a bipartisan basis. I know we had some tough fights last year on healthcare and tax reform, and our Democratic colleagues seemed disinclined to help at all to work with us to pass those pieces of legislation. I am hoping that with this new year and, hopefully, the optimism that goes along with it, our colleagues will work with us in goodwill for all and a renewed determination to do what is right, not only for the folks we have the honor of representing but for our entire country.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

660,topic-id,2232,"Mr.President, I admit I wasn't here during the entirety of the comments from our friend, and I saw his to-do list. The only thing missing from that to-do list was to fund our military--or at least I didn't see it on there. In all fairness, maybe he mentioned that in his comments.  We now have 9 days to reach an agreement to keep the government funded, to keep the lights on, to keep paying the salaries of our government employees, and, of course, to fund our military, which ought to be our 1 priority. If we think about things that government must do, funding our national defense is the only thing that we can do and that government can do. There are a lot of other things that government does that are optional or maybe things we would like to do, but funding our military is the 1 priority--or should be.  As the Senate majority leader mentioned earlier this week, our Democratic colleagues persist in the notion that we should only increase defense spending if we increase nondefense spending by the same amount. The parity that the minority leader and the other Democrats call for doesn't make any sense, though. It is apples and oranges. They act as though all government spending is exactly alike and enjoys or should enjoy the same priority, and that is just not true. We know that from our own family budgets or from a small business. There are things we must do, things we want to do, and things we will do if there is money left over. But our friends across the aisle, who are obstructing our ability to get to negotiated budget caps and fund our military, act as though all of that is the same, that must do, want to do, and what you will do if you have money left over--that those are all exactly the same, and that is just not the case. It is not the case in our family budgets, in our small business budgets, nor is it the case for the Federal budget. Not everything is a priority. But we do know that the 1 priority must be the safety and security of the American people by making sure our military is adequately funded.  The Budget Control Act signed into law in 2011 was what I would call a necessary evil. The Budget Control Act provided that we would have a bipartisan, bicameral negotiation and try to come up with a grand bargain.  That was what President Obama liked to talk about a lot--the grand bargain. But some people suggested that was kind of like a unicorn, something that people describe but no one has ever seen--a grand bargain. I wish it weren't true.  The Budget Control Act said that in the absence of a grand bargain, we would have budget caps or sequestration imposed on discretionary spending above certain levels. It proposed separate budget caps for defense and nondefense, and if the budget caps are exceeded, there is an automatic enforcement mechanism called sequestration which imposes across-the-board cuts, which I mentioned a moment ago.  The purpose of this sequestration--or these across-the-board cuts--is to do something in the absence of us doing what we should do; in other words, we should take it upon ourselves to figure out what the appropriate spending levels should be for defense and nondefense, and then we should act to appropriate that money. But this is basically a fail-safe mechanism, which operates as a result of our failure to deal with this in a proactive way, and it has hit our defense spending much, much harder than domestic spending.  As we know, neither our defense spending nor tax cuts are the cause of our deficits and debt. It is the 70 percent of spending that happens in the Federal Government on autopilot. It is the entitlements that have been going up well in excess of 5 percent a year and are causing instability and unpredictability in those important programs, such as Medicare and Social Security, but at the same time racking up huge deficits and debt that future generations are going to have to pay back. Somebody is going to have to pay it back, and it won't be the present generation because we won't be around then. It is simply immoral to continue to see this happen without trying to deal with it.  But back on the matter of the Pentagon, as one op-ed writer put it in the Washington Post last month--he said:       The Pentagon and the welfare state have been locked in      brutal combat for decades, and the Pentagon has gotten      clobbered. . . . Welfare programs--Social Security, Medicare,      food stamps and other benefits--dwarf defense spending.  In the 1950s and 1960s, defense spending was roughly 8 to 10 percent of our economy. In 2016, it was just 3 percent. That is a huge change.  James Clapper, the former Director of National Intelligence, said that in his 50 years in the intelligence community, he had never seen a more diverse array of threats confronting the United States around the world--never in his[[Page S117]]50 years of experience. So we are simply asking our military and our national security personnel to do too much with too little.  It is no surprise that Secretary of Defense James Mattis said last June that ``for all the heartache caused by the loss of our troops during [our] wars [abroad], no enemy in this field has done more to harm the readiness of our military than sequestration.''  More recently, General Mattis said that so far our continuing resolutions have not done even greater damage to our readiness thanks to certain additional or supplemental funding that we voted on. But at the same time, he soberly cautioned that there could be real impact--and it won't be positive, it will be negative--if the problem persists and if the Department of Defense doesn't have a real budget sometime this month.  His remarks echo that of practically every service chief. Together, their views mean we have to act. I don't know who else we would listen to if we are not going to listen to the Secretary of Defense and our service chiefs when it comes to national security because that is their job, and we ought to take their advice and heed their counsel.  Cuts in defense spending have real consequences. Much less money is available for training and necessary maintenance, for example. The length of deployments for our troops grows, and our soldiers are stretched thin. Our military is forced to operate beyond its normal capabilities.  The former Air Force Chief of Staff recently described the Air Force as the smallest, oldest equipped, and least ready force across the full spectrum of operations in our service history. Those are chilling remarks--or should be. More than half of all Marine Corps fixed and rotary-wing aircraft were unable to fly by the end of 2016. I have no doubt that we can turn that around very quickly if Congress were to step up to its responsibilities and adequately fund the military, but that is the status quo unless we act. The Navy fleet currently stands at 275 of the 350 ship requirement. Of our 58 Army brigade combat teams, only 3--3 out of 58--are ready for combat.  Our enemies shouldn't take any comfort in these numbers because, as I said, the United States always pulls together and Congress always acts when they see a national emergency. But it shouldn't take an emergency for us to do our job and to make sure that our military is adequately funded and is ready to fight. As General Brooks in Seoul, South Korea, said, their motto is ``ready to fight tonight.'' That is the kind of world we live in.  Last summer was the perfect example of why, when we draw attention to these numbers, we are not just blowing smoke. Operational accidents in the South Pacific exposed our readiness failures in a dramatic fashion and in a tragic fashion. Ten sailors died when the USS John McCain collided with a 600-foot merchant vessel off the coast of Seven sailors died when the Fitzgerald collided with another vessel off the coast of And the USS Lake Champlain collided with a boat near Korea--although thankfully that time no lives were lost. This ought to be a wake-up call to all of us.  Many have drawn credible correlations between these accidents that have taken the lives of our military servicemembers and our readiness failures, citing studies like the 2015 independent investigation by the Government Accountability That study determined that the Navy's mandate to keep ships afloat in the Pacific was shortchanging crew training and degrading the condition of our ships--in other words, additional readiness failures.  These accidents, by the way, are happening at the same time our national security threats are not going away, as General Clapper's comments would indicate.  We have seen North Korea continue to improve its nuclear and long-range ballistic missile capabilities beyond the estimates of our intelligence community--much faster--and detonate what is widely considered to be a hydrogen bomb recently.  We have seen large-scale protests in Iran--and I hope they continue--exposing the instability of a regime that continues to use its proxies to advance its aims throughout the broader Middle East; in other words, the 1 state sponsor of international terrorism--We ought to encourage the people of Iran to continue to rise up in protest and to change the regime there into one that does not prey on its neighbors in the region.  We have seen a growing China--something that more and more people are realizing is a threat. I know that when we deal with countries like China, frequently we deal with them in the commercial context where we see a business that hires people and we see investments here in the United But what we need to recognize is that they don't do business the way the United States does business. Sitting at the top of every company in China, in the board room of every Chinese company, is the Communist They operate on an all-of-government basis. And it is not just the government; it is also what we would consider the private sector. But, in truth, there is no private sector in China; it is all an arm of the government. It is posing a rising threat to American wages and labor as they erode our industrial base by stealing our technology. And because of loopholes in the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States--the so-called CFIUS process--they are now able to tailor financial arrangements through joint ventures and others in a way to capture our dual-purpose, cutting-edge technology. They then copy it in China and erode our defense industrial base here in the United States, along with the jobs that go with it. So it is a very real and present threat to American wages and workers. It is a threat to our intellectual property edge and the innovation that we are the best in the world at, but they are all too eager to steal it, copy it, and to harm the jobs and the investment in those businesses here in the United  Of course, when it comes to China, there is the threat to human rights in nondemocratic nations like Venezuela and Zimbabwe, which China often has no qualms supporting.  With this diverse array of dangers, we simply can't afford to straitjacket our military by arbitrarily cutting the amount of money we appropriate to fund it. But that is what is going to happen unless we act--and act quickly. The current continuing resolution expires on the 19th of this month.  The truth is, even if we are able to come up with negotiated budget caps for defense and nondefense spending, we are probably going to have to have a short-term continuing resolution to give the Appropriations Committees time to put that into bill text. In other words, we can't just snap our fingers once the decision has been made. It is going to take some time to actually put it on paper.  The bottom line is, if we want to return to having the strong military that we have always had, if we want to continue to lead in the world, if we want to continue to be a force for peace and stability, we have to maintain our military strength. That was the lesson we had to learn again during the last administration when we saw America retreat from its leadership in the world.  There are countries, tyrants, bullies, and dictators all too willing to fill the void left by American retreat, and one way we retreat is when we don't fund the readiness of our military, when we are not ``ready to fight tonight,'' as General Brooks has said, and we need to start with ending this cycle of continuing resolutions and defense sequestration.  So I come to the floor today to call on my colleagues from all across this Chamber, but specifically across the aisle, to quit holding our military hostage to other unrelated demands, and I urge this body to come together in agreement on new budget caps as soon as possible.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

We have a lot to do, especially before the next continuing resolution expires on January 19.  But I don't want to make the mistake of failing to recount the good work we were able to accomplish on behalf of the American people in 2017 because, sometimes, in the hustle and bustle of life, we fail to acknowledge those things that we have actually been able to do, for which we ought to be grateful, and that our constituents need to know about. I would like to take just a few minutes to do exactly that because, unfortunately, in the hyperpolitical and hyperpolarized political environment we live in today--especially with the advent of social media--there are always some naysayers and pundits who want to offer their comments. One of the things I have noticed most about many of those naysayers and pundits when they comment on what is happening here in Washington is how little they know about the facts. The facts matter, and I want to offer those for the public's consideration now.  In January of last year, the Nation was quickly called to order following the inauguration of President One of his first actions was to nominate Neil Gorsuch to the U.Supreme I think most of us were astonished at the quality of this selection, many of us not being familiar with the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals on which Justice Gorsuch served in Denver,  Justice Gorsuch was quickly confirmed in April, and then we moved on to fill other judicial vacancies, which, of course, are the prerogative of the President to make that nomination and to then be confirmed with the advice and consent of the We, like the President, have made filling these judicial vacancies a priority.  The fact is, though, that the Senate is in the personnel business. In other words, our friends in the House of Representatives don't have to vote on confirmation of judges and other Presidential nominees, but we in the Senate have that responsibility. All told, we have confirmed 19 men and women to the Federal bench in 2017, setting a record for appellate judges confirmed during a President's first year in office. Two of them, Jim Ho and Don Willett, I am pleased to say, will serve from Texas on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals that sits in New These are exceptionally qualified nominees--and typical in that description of the types of people that President Trump has selected to serve in the Federal judiciary.  But our work wasn't just confined to confirming the President's nominees. After 8 years of overreach, hundreds of burdensome rules passed during the[[Page S39]]previous administration--many in the waning hours of President Obama's Presidency--were rolled back or suspended. I am glad Congress did its part, using the Congressional Review Act to roll back 15 harmful regulations last year. As much as anything, I think that has contributed to the soaring stock market, the increase in consumer confidence, and the extraordinary rebound of our economy.  As last summer began, we passed a bill funding Texas priorities. It funded things like the National Space Administration programs at Houston's Johnson Space Center, which will advance missions, hopefully back to the moon and eventually to We allowed through that funding to make sure that the Department of Homeland Security had what they needed to hire additional Border Patrol and agents at ports of entry to improve those checkpoints and to add immigration court judges too.  I remember thinking about Hurricane A friend of mine years ago asked the rhetorical question: Do you know what makes God laugh? Then he answered: When we make plans.  Hurricane Harvey is perhaps an example of that, because we were making other plans when we got this natural disaster known as Hurricane  Texas was pummeled with the most extreme rain event in the history of the United States, devastating more than 28,000 square miles along the coast. I, along with the entire Texas congressional delegation, helped secure roughly $30 billion for recovery efforts, but the thing I am most proud of is the way ordinary Texans responded to their neighbors in need. They weren't waiting around for Washington to act first. They wanted to act to help their neighbors, their community, and their  Recognizing we have the Presiding Officer from Louisiana, I just want to make special note of the Cajun Navy that came over from Louisiana to help rescue people off of their rooftops. That is part of what makes not only Texas and Louisiana great, but it is what makes America great, too, when people will come to the aid of their fellow  As Texans tore out sheetrock and molded carpet in their living rooms, Federal resources helped piece together the lives disrupted. Now we have to make sure we complete the task by delivering additional relief not only to Texas but to Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, as well as to those States devastated by the wildfires out The House having passed a substantial disaster relief bill and sent it over to us, I am hopeful that is something we will take up and pass very soon, perhaps as soon as January 19.  I spoke about natural disasters, but now let me turn to a manmade disaster. After the hurricane, Texas was dealt a second blow just 2 months later, when a man opened fire at a church in Sutherland Springs, With multiple convictions for domestic violence, a felony conviction, and a history of mental illness, this individual should never have been able to legally purchase a firearm because, under existing law, those conditions disqualify you from being able to purchase a firearm, if you are a convicted felon, convicted of domestic violence, or have a history of mental illness.  That is why, following this terrible disaster where 26 people were killed, I introduced the bipartisan Fix NICS Act--that is, Fix the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Act--to ensure existing laws are enforced and convicted felons don't exploit our background check system by lying and buying. I am going to continue to urge the passage of this important piece of legislation, which is, as I say, bipartisan, as it should be.  The fall of 2017 gave way to winter and soon came the flurries of snow not only here in Washington but back home in The week before Christmas, we completed comprehensive tax reform--a historic overhaul of the Tax Code and the first in more than three decades.  We said originally that our goals were threefold: One was to make the Tax Code simpler; the second was to make sure everybody in every tax bracket saw a decrease in their tax liability; and third was to make the American Tax Code competitive in the global economy. Until that point, we had the highest tax rate in the industrialized world, which caused companies to move or invest offshore and create jobs in other countries rather than the United States because we had the most burdensome tax in the industrialized world.  As I said, this bill--now law--reduces taxes in all income brackets and boosts the standard deduction and child tax credit. This means that only 1 out of 10 taxpayers will likely choose to itemize because they will actually benefit more from the standard deduction along with the child tax credit. It will allow businesses to add jobs, raise wages, and reinvest in the United States from overseas. For example, a family of four making the median income will see their taxes drop by more than $2,000--a reduction of nearly 58 percent.  Tax reform complements an economy that has already been truly unleashed under this administration. Just since January, the economy has added 1.7 million new jobs, and over the last two quarters, our economy has grown at more than 3 percent--as compared to an average of only 1.9 percent under the previous administration.  While not historic in the sense that the tax bill was historic, there is other legislation we passed with little fanfare but significant impact that I would like to mention.  One is a bill I championed called the PROTECT Our Children Act, which reauthorizes task forces to combat child exploitation online. The second I would like to mention is a bill that tackled elder abuse. A third, called the SAFER Act--which was signed today by the President--reauthorizes rape kit audits and prioritizes the training of pediatric nurses handling sexual assault cases.  I was shocked and chagrined a year or so ago to learn there could be as many as 400,000 untested rape kits either sitting in evidence lockers or in laboratories untested. Now, thanks to the Debbie Smith Act--named after a heroic woman who has championed the funding of Federal efforts to identify and test this backlog of rape kits--that number is far smaller today, but reauthorization of the SAFER Act is important to keep our commitment to victims of sexual assault that we will do everything in our power to help them identify their assailant and bring them to justice, and, at the same time, exonerate people who may be falsely accused because there is no DNA match.  Finally, other legislation I filed and has now been signed into law assists police departments in hiring military veterans. We know our police departments are always in need of good, highly qualified applicants for those important first responder jobs. Once signed by the President, it will streamline the process that Active-Duty personnel and reservist members go through to apply for their commercial driver's license.  We know it is a long and arduous process to apply for a commercial driver's license, so why not take our Active-Duty military who are soon to retire or our veterans and expedite their ability to qualify for a commercial driver's license when they leave the military?  As I said, these bills don't grab big headlines, but they chip away at problems and were passed on a bipartisan basis--which I think puts the lie to the canard that nothing ever gets done in  The job of men and women in Congress is to serve the people who elected us. This last year we made important strides, but our work is just beginning. As I said at the outset, there is much that lies ahead. Many Americans and many Texans are still knocking at the door of greater prosperity. I hope we will make it our New Year's resolution to open that door a little wider in 2018.  I yield the floor.

1082,topic-id,2387,"Mr.President, I have listened to the remarks of our distinguished colleague from Illinois who is the Democratic whip. I agree with a number of things he says and disagree with some others, but I do think we need to keep this in the appropriate context. We are, in fact, talking about a provision of the Bill of Rights, the Second Amendment to the U.Constitution, and I hope we would never treat any of those essential guarantees of American rights that precede the creation of our government casually. It is important that we protect all of our rights. The right to worship according to the dictates of our conscience, the right to petition our government for the redress of just grievances, the freedom of association, and the freedom of the press are also part of the Bill of Rights, just like the Second Amendment to the U. There are a number of things that we can agree on, and I have been talking about one of them for some time now--the so-called Fix NICS bill. It is probably not very well-labeled or branded because ``NICS'' is short for the National Instant Criminal Background Check Basically, what it does is fix the broken background check system to make sure that convicted felons, people who have been dishonorably discharged from the military, people who have been adjudicated mentally ill, people who have committed acts of domestic violence--and a number of other categories--cannot legally purchase firearms. Why? Because current law prohibits it.  We have already passed those laws, but as we saw in Sutherland Springs, TX, one Sunday morning not long ago, 26 people lost their lives and 20 additional lives were forever changed when they were shot by a gunman who had lied and obtained firearms when he was disqualified under the law from purchasing them.  The FBI maintains the background check system, and it wasn't their fault because the background check system is only as good as the information that is uploaded into the background check system. When somebody goes into a store and tries to purchase a firearm and lies, the background check system catches them and they are denied that purchase. That is how it is supposed to work.  Recently, the attitude among some here in Washington seems to be that this bill somehow doesn't go far enough. There are other ideas I am more than willing to debate and vote on, some of which I actually agree with, but none have the bipartisan consensus and support that this particular Fix NICS bill has.  I was just told that now we are up to 70 bipartisan cosponsors. In other words, 70 out of 100 Senators, on a bipartisan basis, support this fix to our broken background check system because they know that if it had been working the way Congress had intended, 26 people would still be alive in Sutherland Springs, TX, and 20 more who were shot and wounded would not have had to suffer those grievous injuries and the painful recovery.  For example, as the Democratic leader--as well as some others--has said: ``If we only pass Fix NICS, we'll be right back here after the next shooting, in nearly the same place.'' He said that ``we won't have done our job.''  Well, as I said, if there are other things that enjoy broad bipartisan consensus, let's get them done. But if the attitude is that we will not even vote on what we agree on because we want to do more, we will never get anything done around here. Why not vote on what we have agreed on, what people are supporting, and then, in addition, we can work on other ideas.  As I said, at least 36 Senate Democrats have already cosponsored the Fix NICS bill. That is 75 percent of the Democratic caucus, and the numbers have been steadily rising. I hope they will go even higher.  I am grateful to the Democratic leader from New He, himself, is a cosponsor of the bill, as is the Senate majority leader, Mr.I have never seen a piece of legislation involving a controversial subject like gun rights get such broad bipartisan support. It is truly unique. We ought to be grateful we have found a place where we have such broad bipartisan agreement and, more important than that, a provision that will save lives in the future.  If the shooter at Sutherland Springs had gone into the gun store to purchase a gun and he lied, had the background check system worked as it was supposed to work, he would not have been able to legally purchase a gun because it would have revealed the fact that he was disqualified from doing so.  Each of these tragedies involves different circumstances. The shooters are always different. They obtain firearms in particular ways and use them to perpetrate their crimes according to different plans and in different settings.  I have already talked about the shooter in Sutherland Springs, who actually was convicted of a felony after choking and kicking his wife and cracking his stepson's skull. He was discharged dishonorably from the military. He was detained in a mental health facility because he was mentally ill. Yet he was able to lie his way into possession of these firearms, forever changing the world of innumerable families in Sutherland Springs,  Under Federal law, he should have been prevented from purchasing these firearms. Were it not for the breakdown in our background check system, he wouldn't have obtained them. He would have been caught lying when trying to buy these firearms and possibly prosecuted, and 26 people would still be living their lives, and the people who were worshipping that Sunday morning at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs would still be doing so in that same location. It has now been turned into a memorial for those who lost their lives that day.  This is preventable loss of life. That is more than enough reason to pass Fix I disagree with those who say that it doesn't do much. If it saves lives, it does plenty. If our system had worked properly--and ensuring it does in the future is what my bill aims to do--Annabelle Pomeroy, the 14-year-old daughter of the pastor at First Baptist, would still be here, and Ryland Ward, a 6-year-old boy who survived, would not have been shot five times.  It is simply incorrect to characterize this bill as a pittance. It is inaccurate to suggest that it really wouldn't do anything, that it somehow is just window dressing or maybe a political fig leaf. That is demonstrably false. Tell that to the families who lost loved ones that day. They wish our background check system had stopped the gunman. Each of them suffered a terrible trauma because it didn't.  It is also not true to say that Washington has been feckless or absent in the wake of not only Sutherland Springs but Las Vegas, Parkland, and all the rest.  On the issue of bump stocks, I agree with the Democratic whip, the Senator from These attachments to a semiautomatic rifle turned it into an[[Page S1723]]automatic rifle. I have never heard of such a thing before, but if automatic weapons are already illegal, why in the world would we want to allow an appliance attached to a gun to turn a semiautomatic weapon into an automatic weapon? I am glad the President has said that those should be regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and be unavailable.  We know that a lot of people lost their lives in Las Vegas; 58 concertgoers in Las Vegas lost their lives because of a man in a hotel room, shooting down into a country music concert. There were 851 people injured. The scope of the carnage was unbelievable.  We have also learned that mental health problems are some of the reasons people do these sorts of things. We passed a law, most notably last December, called the 21st Century Cures Act, which provides new authority for families, when their loved ones are becoming a danger to themselves or others, to apply to a court to get assisted outpatient treatment to make sure they follow their doctors' orders and take their medications. Then we train law enforcement on how to save lives in the event of an active shooter incident.  We know the problem at Sutherland Springs was that the Federal Government hadn't uploaded the information into the background check system, which would have prevented the purchase of the firearm. But we know the problem is present, as well, in the  In Ohio, we learned that there have been failures to upload conviction records from at least 90 municipal courts--one that may have allowed those barred from owning weapons to purchase them in violation of the law.  Since the shooting in Texas, the Department of Defense has retroactively uploaded 4,000 additional records of those dishonorably discharged from the military into the background check system. Under current law, these are people already prohibited from purchasing firearms, but, of course, if the military didn't upload them, no one would ever know, and they would be able to lie and purchase firearms.  One news account stated that since 2015, the number of people barred from owning firearms because they were dishonorably discharged has hovered at around 11,000 people, according to FBI statistics. Now it stands at over 15,000. It is clear evidence that the background check system isn't working the way it is supposed to. We need to make sure that Federal agencies are uploading these records in real time, as they are required to do.  We are taking action in other ways. I am also cosponsor of a bipartisan bill called the NICS Denial Notification It is sponsored by a bipartisan pair of Senators--the Senators from Pennsylvania and This bill will alert State law enforcement about people who lie and try to buy guns. If people go in and lie, the background check system catches them, and then they are turned away. Under current practice, that is never reported to the law enforcement agencies, but it would be if that legislation were passed. When people do this, their actions may be indicative of criminal behavior. That is why the bill would insist that Federal authorities notify State police within 24 hours if it is determined a person has lied in an attempt to buy a gun.  Meanwhile, the Attorney General has announced that U.attorneys will be instructed to more aggressively enforce laws that criminalize gun buyers who lie on their background checks. I think all of this will help be a deterrent, and, yes, I do think it will contribute to the saving of lives.  The Justice Department will also increase the presence of law enforcement officers at schools and review the way they respond to public tip-offs with regard to safety threats.  We know the shooting in Parkland, FL, was a catastrophic failure at almost every level--from the public education system, to local law enforcement, to the FBI, to mental health providers. Looking back at this shooter, local law enforcement actually intervened with him about 40 times. This was a blinking red light. People should have paid attention and done something about it. We are now trying to make sure they have the resources and the training necessary to intervene when people are obviously a danger to themselves and others.  One way we are going to do that is with the bill offered by the senior Senator from Utah, Mr.Hatch--the STOP School Violence This bill would authorize $50 million annually for safety improvements, including teacher training and training students on how to prevent violence and developing anonymous reporting systems for threats of school violence. It would give schools money for physical improvements, such as metal detectors or bulletproof windows or doors. This is a great step. It is not controversial, and we ought to get it done and get it done now.  As the President has said: ``We cannot merely take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference. We must actually make a difference.'' One way we can do that is by passing Fix  Just this afternoon, a diverse community of victims' rights groups, law enforcement officers, gun violence prevention groups, and prosecutors sent a letter to the minority and majority leaders, asking them for a vote on a clean version of Fix NICS before the upcoming Easter recess. They said it would ``improve key elements of the background system, particularly domestic violence criminal history and protective order records.'' That is really an important point because so much of the gun violence we see in America is in the context of domestic violence--people violating protective orders, people assaulting the person they are married to or living with. We need to focus on this and do something about it.  This group of victims' rights advocates, law enforcement officers, gun violence prevention groups, and prosecutors call the Fix NICS bill a bipartisan, bicameral, commonsense, and noncontroversial bill. So why can't we pass it? Why can't we do it today?  They made a point to note in their letter that the vote should be clean; in other words, not conditioned upon or attached to other controversial measures we can't pass. I think they are absolutely right. I hope all of us will listen to this good advice and get this done.  We tried to get an agreement a couple of weeks ago to take up the bill and vote on it. If we did it today, it would pass this afternoon, but there was an objection to doing so, saying, well, there are other things we need to do too. Perhaps that is true, but to condition what can pass--what does enjoy broad bipartisan support and what will save lives--on things that will not pass and that aren't achievable means we have a strategy of either everything or failure. That usually ends up with us going back home emptyhanded, having nothing to show for our efforts.  The people we represent deserve better. This institution should step up and listen to those who are calling upon us to do something, and doing something that will save lives, while respecting the rights of all Americans under the  I yield the floor.

1112,topic-id,2530,"Mr.President, this week we are discussing, among other topics, the sad fact of sex trafficking online. The reason is because yesterday we voted to advance a piece of legislation called SESTA, or the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers The purpose of this legislation is crystal clear. We want to put an end to this abominable practice, and we want to stop shielding or protecting those web platforms that promote it.  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation. Over the past year, like many of my colleagues, I met with law enforcement and victims' rights groups across the country who talk about this as a continuing problem. I met with technology providers who want to end the practice but want to make sure they maintain their independence from Federal regulation writ large. I have been in regular contact with my colleagues over at the House to make sure this bill is considered and passed in a timely fashion. I think it is fair to characterize the negotiations as delicate.  A small group of Senators, including our colleague John McCain, the senior Senator from Arizona, wanted to make sure that everyone understood what this bill does and what it does not do. What it does do is to protect our children. It provides justice to victims, and it makes sure that Federal laws don't protect those who profit from sex trafficking online. What it does not do is somehow to stymie free speech. It does not restrict web platforms from publishing objectionable content.  For example, under the Communications Decency Act, now websites have to screen for child pornography. That is one of the explicit exceptions to the Communications Decency Act, which basically provides immunity to these web platforms from liability. What we are doing is adding to that human trafficking, and it is appropriate that we do so.  This does not discourage websites that are already taking steps to proactively remove improper conduct and police their own networks. I would say to those who do: Keep up the good work.  Today the internet and other forms of technology have made certain forms of predatory behavior easier to engage in. This bill addresses this development head-on. It would allow sex trafficking victims to have their day in court by eliminating Federal liability protections for technology providers who knowingly facilitate online sex trafficking. It would allow State and local law enforcement to investigate and prosecute providers that violate Federal sex trafficking laws.  This bill was introduced last summer after a 2-year inquiry by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which produced a report. That report found that not only had sex trafficking run rampant in certain online spaces but also that some websites had tried to cover it up.  Well, no longer. Last fall, the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously approved SESTA, the bill on the floor that the House passed last month. Now it is our turn.  Senator Portman, the junior Senator from Ohio, has been this bill's greatest champion since its inception. I believe he was one of the members of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which produced the report I mentioned. He has been involved in this issue for a long time. He has been informing us time and again of the ways in which sex trafficking has morphed from the street corner to the smartphone.  In the committee's investigation, one website in particular came up time and again, and the name is no stranger to the Senate or the It is backpage, a notorious publication now online that is responsible for three-quarters of all child trafficking reports.  It eventually became clear that even though that site was actually helping to sell young women for sex, and even the victims and their families were suing backpage, none of the lawsuits were successful because of what some people are coming to believe is an outdated immunity protection for technology providers under the Communications Decency Act, which I mentioned a moment ago.  The original law was intended to protect free speech online, which is important. I am a firm believer in the First Amendment, as I know we all are, but free speech is no license to engage in criminal activity.  At last count, 67 Senators have joined our effort as cosponsors. We are joined in support of SESTA by anti-human-trafficking advocates, law enforcement, State attorneys general, the civil rights community, faith-based groups, and tech companies like Facebook and  Our colleague from Oregon has introduced two amendments, which I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose. The first would appropriate new money for the Attorney General to investigate and prosecute website operators that criminally facilitate sex trafficking. The problem is that this would violate the blue slip rule and subject the bill to a point of order. In other words, there are constitutional issues raised about where that sort of legislation would originate. It has to originate in the It would almost certainly guarantee the demise of this legislation. In other words, it is a poison pill. It is not that we will not support funding to prosecute traffickers. In fact, we will provide ample funding through the Department of Justice later this week. It is that those funds should be appropriated through the usual process and then handed over to State and local officials who can use them effectively.  The second amendment that will be offered is the ``Bad Samaritan'' amendment. This would prevent websites from being held accountable for any efforts to moderate content, even when those efforts are taken in bad faith or obviously intended to miss their mark and instead protect sex traffickers. In some States courts have found that websites like backpage might be held liable when they selectively edit sex trafficking ads to make them more difficult to be identified by law enforcement.  The ``Bad Samaritan'' amendment could protect platforms like backpage.com from liability for bad-faith editing practices, leaving victims with even less of a recourse than they have today. Simply put, it could eviscerate the steps we are taking in I am confident that our colleague does not intend this result, but that would be the consequence of adopting either one of those amendments.  So I hope my colleagues will join me in voting in favor of SESTA this week and opposing these two amendments. That is the best way we can ensure that these websites and online platforms can be held accountable for facilitating sex trafficking.  Mr.President, later today the Senate will be voting on a privileged resolution that I spoke on yesterday, offered by three of our colleagues. Simply put, it would direct the President to cut off all U.support for the Saudi-led coalition in  Now, some people may be looking at a world map to figure out where Yemen is and what the import of this conflict may be, but suffice it to say that this is another proxy war being conducted against the United States and its allies by Iran, now in Yemen, just to the south of Saudi Arabia, our ally.  So as to the motion to table, I was interested to hear my friends from Connecticut and Vermont suggesting that the motion to table would stop debate. Well, that is not exactly true. What it will do is to facilitate full debate and full consideration of the merits of the underlying resolution, starting with the Foreign Relations It is very unusual for resolutions like this to come immediately to the floor, where 100 Senators vote on it, because, frankly, not all of us are as up to speed on the details of this or what the unintended impact might be as the Foreign Relations Committee that is set up for the purpose of examining legislation with regard to our international relationships in matters like this.  This is an important and timely matter, as high-level Saudi officials are in Washington this week. The Crown Prince is scheduled to meet with President Trump today. I met with him this morning, along with other members of the Senate Foreign Relations  Saudi Arabia is an important partner in our counterterrorism operations and as a counterpoint to In Yemen, we see both terrorist operations--that is, ISIS and al-Qaida--and Iran actively deploying missiles and using Yemen as[[Page S1808]]a launching pad to shoot missiles into Saudi  I mentioned that this support for our Saudi coalition is narrowly circumscribed. It takes the form of intelligence sharing, military advice, and logistical support, including air-to-air refueling. This is part of a plan that started under the Obama administration and now has continued under the Trump administration not to put American troops on the ground--boots on the ground, as we frequently refer to it--but rather to facilitate for our allies by working by, with, and through those allies to address the threat not only to them but ultimately to the United States and to peace in the region.  The role we play in Yemen is clearly a noncombat support role, and it is meant to minimize civilian casualties by improving the processes and procedures and increasing compliance with the international law of armed conflict. In other words, we are trying to help them target the terrorists and the Iranian-backed rebels and not innocent civilians, something they are not able to do as well without our assistance.  Contrary to the resolution's sponsors' claims, the United States is not engaged in hostilities in Yemen, as it has been traditionally understood, since it is not in direct conflict with the Houthi rebels. We are not fighting the Houthi rebels. U.soldiers are not fighting the Houthi rebels directly. We are providing support.  Proponents of this legislation rightly point out that there is a humanitarian crisis in Unfortunately, what they sometimes leave out is that the humanitarian crisis only started when the Iranian-backed rebels overthrew the existing government. Our military assistance is helping the Saudis with their targeting to help prevent civilian casualties, to restore law and order, and to create conditions necessary to provide aid.  Let's remember, too, that it was President Obama who first implemented the refueling and logistical support policy. This is not a political matter. There is no real difference in the way that the Obama administration and the Trump administration provide this support by, with, and through our allies the Saudis and the  It is clear why this has been the policy of the last two administrations. Yemen is a place of great geopolitical concern. When I visited Bahrain recently with our colleagues--the U.Fifth Fleet is housed in Bahrain--we heard concerns about a chokepoint near an area called the Bab el I probably butchered that pronunciation, but we have all heard more frequently about the Straits of Hormuz, through which a lot of the world's commerce and oil flow.  Bab el Mandeb is off to the west of Yemen, only 18 miles at its narrowest point, connecting the Red Sea to the Indian That is one of the reasons why it is so important geopolitically--because 3.8 million barrels of oil pass through it each day, many of them in route to the Suez Canal and beyond. Bab el Mandeb shows the geopolitical importance of Yemen in the surrounding region. When rebels attempt to shut down shipping in this passage, the impact is global, including on the United States, and our Nation has every right to be concerned.  I fear the resolution I mention deals with our shared concerns in the wrong way. We all want to avoid civilian casualties. Most everyone is aware that Yemen has been suffering from a severe humanitarian crisis for years, including a terrible cholera outbreak. But if we were to remove U.involvement and logistical support for the Saudi coalition, the humanitarian crisis would likely get even worse.  The Department of Defense has critiqued the resolution on which we will be voting on the grounds that it would undermine our ability to foster long-term relationships with allies in the Gulf region. We also benefit from increased interoperability, burden-sharing, and strong security architectures throughout the world. In other words, the alliances we have in the Middle East fight the common enemy of ISIS and al-Qaida and try to contain Iran, which has been at war with the United States since 1979 in the Iranian Revolution in one form or another. All of these are on the table and all of these should be matters of our concern, but they are best considered, at least initially, in the context of the Foreign Relations They can then make a recommendation to us, and we can have the sort of fulsome debate that people have come to expect in the Senate, I hope, on matters of global importance. So all of the reasons I have mentioned here suggest that the need for our auxiliary and limited role in Yemen remains important.  Secretary Mattis, the Secretary of Defense, has said that a withdrawal of our noncombatant support could embolden Iranian-backed rebels in the area, enable further missile strikes on Saudi Arabia, our ally, and threaten the shipping lanes in the Red Sea, like the one at Bab el All this combined could stoke the embers of an even greater regional conflict in the Middle  So I hope our colleagues will vote for a tabling of this resolution, which does not cut off debate but just moves that debate, at least initially, to the Foreign Relations Committee, where, under the able leadership of Chairman Corker and Ranking Member Menendez, I have every confidence that they will explore every nook and cranny of this issue and come out with a reasoned and reasonable recommendation to the Senate and the Congress on how the U.Government should conduct itself.  I believe in a strong congressional role when it comes to wars and military conflict. This has been a fight, though, that has been going on for a long time between the executive branch and the legislative branch. We have the ultimate tool. We can cut off money, but that is a rather blunt instrument. I think this administration, like previous administrations, needs to recognize that the Congress is a partner in making these decisions, not an adversary. It is important that we each play our respective role, and I am confident that we will play that role responsibly, which is really what this is all about.  If the Senate takes this vote and passes this resolution, we lose the chance for that kind of careful, deliberate, informed consideration that starts in our standing committees. We lose the chance to have the Senate Foreign Relations Committee issue a thoroughly researched recommendation.  So I hope our colleagues will vote to table the resolution and not to close off debate but to insist that this debate take place, at least initially, where it belongs, in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and that this debate then continue among all 100 Members of the We will be better informed, we will be better prepared, and we will be better able to prevent unintended consequences from taking a rash action like voting for the resolution today.

1728,topic-id,420,"Mr.President, 2 days ago, the President of the United States announced his decision to replace Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with CIA Director Mike I respect and admire both of these men immensely.  I just want to take a moment to talk about Secretary Tillerson's public service. I know his entering government after his long and illustrious career in the private sector was quite a transition, but he provided able leadership to the Department of State during a period of transition from one Presidency to the next and a period of diplomatic turbulence. He worked hard to strengthen and, in some cases, repair our global alliances.  I have known Secretary Tillerson for a long time. He is a man of character who has led the Boy Scouts, which continues to be one of his abiding passions--developing young men as persons of character, and I respect that. At the same time, he advanced his own career as the head of one of the largest businesses in the world at the pinnacle of success, as we count success. I wish him the best, and I hope his statesmanship, professionalism, and deep and abiding friendships spanning the globe are remembered and maintained after he is gone from public life.                       Nomination of Mike Pompeo  Mr.President, I also want to say a few good words about my friend Mike After graduating first in his class at West Point and then graduating from Harvard Law School, he had a successful career in law and business before transitioning into public service. As a Member of the House of Representatives, he represented Kansas's Fourth Congressional District and served on the Permanent Select Committee on Then he was named by President Trump, as we know, to lead the Central Intelligence  Director Pompeo is a terrific guy, smart and well respected by all.

1744,topic-id,2395,"Mr.President, I am pleased to learn that Senator Cory Booker, our colleague from New Jersey, is the 73rd cosponsor of the Fix NICS bill, which I have introduced and which I hope will be passed out of the Senate soon. This bill is designed to fix the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which, if it had been working the way it was designed to, would have caught the shooter at Sutherland Springs, perhaps saving the lives of 26 people who lost their lives in that little Baptist church outside of San Antonio; 20 more were shot and will suffer those wounds the rest of their lives.  Today the news brought us the fact that apparently there had been a recommendation by mental health professionals that Nikolas Cruz, the shooter in Parkland, FL, be committed for involuntary treatment, but apparently that never materialized. That was the recommendation, but it never actually happened. If that had happened, under the current law, his name would have been included in the Florida upload of background check information, and that would have prevented him from legally buying a firearm.  So we are starting to see the different data points that begin to paint a picture of the sorts of things that we could do here in Washington, DC, to save lives in these future mass shooting events. We know the President has said to the Department of Justice that he wants bump stocks banned. Of course, that was the instrument used to kill dozens of people in Las Vegas and injure 851 more.  So by addressing things like the background check system, improving the mental health response, eliminating the bump stock--which takes a semiautomatic weapon and makes it operate essentially like an automatic weapon--and by providing assistance to our schools so that they can harden themselves against potential attacks, we can begin to see a picture of the sorts of things we ought to be doing to prevent future mass shootings like the one we saw most recently in Parkland, It is simply our responsibility to make sure we do everything we humanly can.  I know that after these horrific events, people throw up their hands and say: We need to do something. Well, we need to do something that matters and that will save lives in the future. I think we now begin to have a picture of the sorts of things we can do, starting with the passage of the Fix NICS background check system. It is the only piece of legislation I know of that now has 73 cosponsors, with Senator Booker of New Jersey being added as the 73rd today. It is the only bill I know of that has that kind of broad, widespread support and that will actually, if implemented, save lives.  Mr.President, this week we will be discussing another important subject--one that perhaps people do not want to hear about; rather, they would prefer that it not exist at all because it is a manifestation of evil. The subject is online sex trafficking. Unfortunately, it happens in the shadows of our society. Today, the internet and other forms of technology have made certain forms of predatory, perverted behavior easier to engage in without getting caught.  The legislation we are voting on this week aims to protect our children, provide justice to victims of human trafficking, and to make sure Federal laws do not protect profiteering web domains where sex trafficking occurs.  The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, or SESTA, would allow sex trafficking victims to have their day in court by eliminating Federal liability protections for technology providers that knowingly--knowingly--facilitate online sex trafficking. It would allow State and local law enforcement to investigate and prosecute providers that violate Federal sex trafficking laws.  I am proud to be one of the original cosponsors of this legislation and to have been working on it with my colleagues to get it to this point today. The bill was introduced last summer after a 2-year inquiry by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which culminated in a report. The report found not only that sex trafficking has run rampant in certain online spaces but also that websites have tried to cover it up. Well, no longer. Last fall, the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously approved SESTA, and the House passed it last month. This week, it is our turn.  Senator Portman, the junior Senator from Ohio, has been this bill's greatest champion since its inception. He has been informing us time and again of the ways in which sex trafficking has moved--as he likes to say it--from the street corner to the smartphone. He spoke on the floor earlier this year and reminded us that even as technology develops and gives us new opportunities to learn, to innovate, and to connect with one another, it is not an unalloyed good. In the wrong hands, by the wrong people, it can be misused. As Senator Portman urged us, we need to shine a light onto the ``dark side of the internet,'' an area he called a ``stain on our national character.'' He is absolutely right, of course. The buying and selling of young people for sex is a moral scourge, and how we respond is a measure of our national conscience.  In the committee's investigation, one website in particular came up over and over and over again; that is, backpage.com, which is responsible for perhaps three-quarters of all child trafficking reports--three-quarters. It eventually became clear that even though that site was actively helping to sell young women for sex and even though the victims and their families were suing backpage.com in response, none of the lawsuits were successful because of what some people are coming to believe is an outdated immunity for[[Page S1775]]technology providers under a Federal law known as the Communications Decency Courts have repeatedly emphasized that the broad reach of one section of that statute protects websites that help to buy and sell underage girls for sex. Judges across the country have said it is up to Congress to change the law, and now it is our time to do just that.  The original law was intended to protect free speech, which, of course, is important. I, of course, like all of our colleagues, am a firm believer in the First Amendment, but free speech is no license to engage in illegal activity. Free speech can't be used as an excuse to offer young people into sexual servitude. And the internet cannot be a safe place for terrorists and child sex traffickers.  At last count, 67 Senators have joined this effort as cosponsors. We are joined by anti-human trafficking advocates, law enforcement organizations, State attorneys general, the civil rights community, faith-based groups, and tech companies like Facebook and We have all made clear that we stand behind  I hope our colleagues will join me in voting for this important legislation this week and ensure that websites and online platforms can be held accountable for facilitating sex trafficking.                            Yemen Resolution  On another matter, Mr.President, this week, the Senate may vote on a privileged resolution offered by three of our colleagues--the junior Senators from Utah, Vermont, and Connecticut--which would direct the President to cut off financial support and other support for the Saudi-led coalition in This, of course, is a proxy war, in many ways, between Iran, which has intervened in the civil war in Yemen, and--not only to allow the Saudis the means to defend themselves against incursions and attacks by the Houthis, Iranian-backed rebels, but also to facilitate our relationship with the Saudis and the Emirates, which is very important in terms of our anti-ISIS and anti-al-Qaida effort, with cells of these organizations located in Yemen too.  Our support, of course, is already narrowly circumscribed--our support for the Saudi-led coalition in General Mattis, our Secretary of Defense, has described this as our alternative to putting American boots on the ground. We operate by, with, and through our allies by providing logistical support, intelligence, and some technical advice. Currently, in Yemen it takes the forms intelligence-sharing, military advice, and logistical support, such as air-to-air refueling. This is very clearly noncombatant support, at least as traditionally defined and historically known, and it is meant to improve processes and procedures and increase compliance with the international law of armed conflict.  The very support we are providing aids in mitigating civilian casualties and the deteriorating humanitarian crisis brought on by the Iranian-backed I know the Presiding Officer has been leading the charge on addressing the humanitarian crisis there, which is mind-boggling, to be sure.  Contrary to the resolution's sponsors' claims, though, the U.military is not engaged in hostilities in Yemen, as that term has historically been understood and applied, since it is not in direct conflict or exchanging fire with Houthi forces. Of course, we all share a concern with what is at stake in Yemen and in Saudi Arabia and in the gulf region but also civilian casualties, which this resolution creates problems with. Almost everyone is aware that Yemen has been suffering from a severe humanitarian crisis for years. Were we to remove U.targeting and logistical support from the Saudi coalition, then the humanitarian situation could get even worse than it has been.  Both political parties recognize the important role the United States plays in support of our partners' efforts to push back against the malign forces that have been coalescing in In fact, President Obama was the one who first implemented the refueling and logistical support policy that remains in effect today.  In 2016, Senator Menendez--now the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--criticized the international community's failure to address the Iranian-fueled conflicts that included support to a Houthi insurgency that helped topple the internationally recognized Government of Senator Menendez went on to say: ``I have a sense we are creating a permissive environment.''  I agree with Senator Menendez that we should not abandon our partners and leave a ``permissive environment''--a vacuum, a void--for bad actors to fill.  If there is one lesson that I thought we learned after 9/11, when 3,000 Americans were killed when two planes were hijacked--actually, four were hijacked; two went into the World Trade Center, one into the Pentagon, and one landed in Pennsylvania because passengers on the plane overwhelmed the hijackers--what we learned is that what happens in the Middle East does not stay in the Middle What happened in Afghanistan is that the Taliban provided a safe haven for Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida, and they used that safe haven to train and export their terrorist attacks against countries around the world but primarily against the United That is what happened on 9/11/2001.  That is why we can't allow a safe haven, a void, in Yemen, not to mention the fact that Iran continues to use proxies in places like Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, among others, to try to fight the United States in a low-grade war that has been going on literally since 1979. I should mention Iraq as one of those countries as well.  It is precisely because of the delicate and desperate situation in Yemen that I am making the argument that any consideration to withdraw U.troops from fulfilling their limited auxiliary role in this conflict would have broad impacts on our global partnerships and counterterrorism efforts. It is not a decision to be made in haste or a decision to be made lightly; therefore, I believe the idea deserves the careful consideration of the committee of jurisdiction, the Senate Foreign Relations If the Senate takes this vote without adequate preparation and deliberation and passes this resolution, we lose that chance for careful consideration. We lose the chance to have the Senate Foreign Relations Committee issue a thoroughly researched and deliberated recommendation to the entire  Even more troubling is the prospect that this resolution could set a precedent--one in which a few Members' preferred policies are prioritized over the normal Senate procedures and more thoughtful committee deliberation, with unintended global impacts. Yemen is not the only place where we are addressing challenges to peace and to our country by, with, and through allies, without Americans engaging in direct hostilities. So this would have unintended global impact.  Secretary of Defense James Mattis has voiced his concerns over this resolution. In a letter to congressional leadership, he said that new restrictions on the U.military could increase civilian casualties and jeopardize our partners' cooperation on counterterrorism efforts. On top of that list would be the Saudis and the Emirates, among others, and other people are watching as well. And it will reduce our influence in the key region.  He warned that a withdrawal of our noncombat support in Yemen could embolden rebels in the area, enable further missile strikes on Saudi Arabia, and threaten shipping lanes in the Red Sea--one of the key chokepoints for international commerce--right there on the western border of All this combined could stoke the embers of an even greater regional conflict in the Middle East with unknown consequences. More importantly, it would damage U.credibility and strengthen Iran's position in Yemen and throughout the Middle East more broadly.  I hope our colleagues will think soberly and thoughtfully about this resolution and insist that a fulsome debate take place where it belongs, initially, and that is within the Senate Foreign Relations I have talked to Senator Corker, the chairman of that committee. He will speak for himself, but I think he certainly believes that the committee can help the Senate make a good decision after giving the committee an opportunity to have hearings and to consider all the intended and unintended consequences of this resolution.  I know our colleagues who have offered the resolution mean well and their intentions are good, but sometimes--particularly in the area of[[Page S1776]]international conflict and global interactions with different countries--our actions beget an unintended consequence. I think it is good to be safe in the first place and to take this matter through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where I have every confidence that Senator Corker, as the chairman, and Ranking Member Menendez can guide the members of that committee through a process that will help us in the end to make a better decision.

This bill seeks to ensure that the DHS gets access to biometric and biographic data collected by the United States Government to carry out its counterterrorism efforts.  Since 9/11, the Democratic members of this committee have been committed to bolstering terrorism information sharing within our government. Today, terrorist threats are decentralized, spreading beyond al-Qaida, al Shabaab, and ISIL to a patchwork of small cells and lone wolves who stand ready to carry out violence to our country at their whim. Increasingly, this threat also includes homegrown violent extremists and domestic terrorists.  Ensuring that the DHS has access to biographic and biometric data on individuals associated with a terrorist organization is critical to comprehensive assessing of all forms of terrorism and threats to our government.  This legislation also requires that the DHS report on how the data is being received and utilized for screening and vetting purposes.

317,topic-id,796,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to talk about the national debt and our shared future. Our country has been on an unsustainable fiscal path, regardless of which party has been in power, and we all know this. As a result, our national debt is the largest it has ever been.  As of this week, the national debt is in excess of $20 trillion. This works out to be an average of $62,670 debt for every man, woman, and child in the United It is outrageous. It is a completely unacceptable amount of debt, and we have it because of irresponsible governing and a lack of political courage here in our Nation's  Sadly, this Congress has chosen to continue this irresponsible and unsustainable fiscal course. The tax cut legislation that Republicans rammed through the Congress last month will add $1.45 billion to our deficit over 10 years, estimated, and over $2.2 trillion to our national debt. We are going in the wrong direction.  But there is something I think that I have learned about this tax legislation last month, and that is that it seems that deficits matter under Democratic administrations, but under Republican administrations, deficits don't matter at all.  So when it comes to lifting our debt ceiling later this year, I would expect or hope to see every Republican who voted for the tax bill that adds $2.2 trillion to our deficit--our debt to vote to increase the debt ceiling, seeing as deficits no longer matter.  Let's think about this $2.2 trillion tax bill that will add to our debt. That is $2.2 trillion in additional moneys that our children will have to pay for unless we do something. We can be fiscally responsible, and we must be fiscally responsible. But to act to change this course, we must stop digging this hole bigger.  I had a farmer friend who once told me: Jim, I've got a theory about holes, and that is, once you find yourself in one, just stop digging. Sometimes you think if you dig harder and faster, you're going to get out of it. Just stop.  Mr.Speaker, this will be difficult, especially considering the opportunity we missed to put the Nation back on a fiscally responsible path with the tax reform effort last year. Yet there are important steps that we can take--and Congress should--to balance our budget and to keep it from getting worse, like the amendment proposed by Representative Stephanie Murphy from Florida, a balanced budget amendment.  We should also move to implement targeted reforms on government spending, both mandatory and discretionary spending, in ways that contribute to economic growth and invest in our future. It is tough work. It requires political courage and the willingness to reach across the aisle, for Democrats and Republicans to join hands and jump, in essence, on these tough decisions.  The last time we had such an opportunity to address the challenge was in March of 2012, when Congressman Jim Cooper from Tennessee presented a budget resolution similar to the recommendations under Simpson-That plan would have reduced the deficit over $4 trillion over a 10-year period.  Sadly, the political courage was in short supply then on that day, as it is now. There were 38 of us who were willing to support the plan. I was attacked by political groups on the left and on the right for taking such a vote, but that vote was the right thing to do and I was proud to take it.  Congress has a chance to do the right thing now. Congress has to come together. We need Democrats and Republicans to put our Nation's fiscal house back in order for the sake of all  The Blue Dog Coalition, of which I am a co-chair, has a long history of standing for fiscal responsibility, even when it was hard. Bridging the divide between Republicans and Democrats, both in Congress and this administration, is what we must do.  So as we are debating today how to put together the votes for the concurrent resolution to fund our Nation's budget for the rest of this year, let's think about this. Let's work together. What a novel concept.

In the last 18 months, the United States intelligence agencies and our allies abroad have decisively concluded that Russia interfered with our elections. We have sworn testimony from men and women with impeccable records, Democrats and Republicans alike. Their testimony overwhelmingly states that Russia interfered in our elections and that Russia has done so as well in other Western democracies for years.  Russia's goal with election interference is to destabilize Western democracies. Destabilizing our democracy will weaken our ability to defend ourselves against foreign adversaries like Russia, China, and  Democratic institutions and systems are the foundation of how we govern ourselves and defend our borders.

1534,topic-id,287,"Mr.Speaker, I also rise today to speak about U.trade and the recently raised tariffs on steel and aluminum.  We all want to secure American jobs and increase the opportunity in the U.economy, but raising far-reaching tariffs will do just the opposite. The most likely effect of raising tariffs will be other countries adjusting their trade measures to protect their economies and their workers. This is known as a trade war, and no one wins in a trade war.  What's more, American agriculture is always the target of international reactionary and retaliatory trade behavior. California agriculture, which I am a strong advocate of and represent, feels the most intense direct pain from these tariffs. California farmers and ranchers earned roughly 44 percent of their total revenue from international trade in 2016.  But this pain will radiate across the country. Manufacturers, processors, merchants, and farmers will face negative impacts to their businesses as foreign markets close, which will cost both American jobs and profits.  Yes, we have an international trade imbalance that must be addressed, but raising these tariffs, I think, is the wrong strategy, plain and simple. This is why both Republicans and Democrats have publicly expressed grave concern with these recent actions.  The way to address these trade imbalances is to successfully renegotiate and modernize NAFTA and other trade agreements with our European allies. The President and Congress must work together on trade agreements; it is that simple.  Our best approach for successfully renegotiating trade agreements in a way that serves the entire Nation is by Republicans and Democrats coming together and putting in the hard work required for bipartisan negotiations, serious policymaking, and getting the job[[Page H1702]]done.

51,topic-id,1726,"Madam President, I thank Chairman Grassley for his leadership on this issue and for offering the SECURE Act, which I and some of the other Senators have supported.  I wish to continue this debate where Senator Tillis left off. We have heard a lot today about the so-called DACA Program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, and the negotiations in which we are currently engaged. Hopefully, those negotiations will reach a solution that will satisfy all the parties and give certain legal protections to the DACA population.  We have heard a lot today about border security and the wall. I want to focus on one other element of a needed, negotiated solution, and that is chain migration--putting an end, once and for all, to chain migration. When you give legal status to an illegal immigrant, that is a permanent change in law; it will never be reversed. Therefore, you can't simply accept some window dressing at the border--1 year of funding for demonstration or pilot projects. You have to have a permanent change in return for a permanent change, and an end to chain migration will be one of the most important permanent changes to U.immigration law in 52 years.  What is chain migration? Under the current law, which dates back to 1965, if you are a citizen, you can bring any one of your relatives to this country, not just your spouse and your unmarried minor kids--your nuclear family--but also your adult kids and their spouses and their children and your adult brother and your adult sister and your parents and then their siblings and so on and so forth. That is why it is called chain migration. Each person is a potential link in a never-ending chain. The vast majority of people who immigrate to our country legally every single year do so for the sole reason that they just happen to be related to someone who is already here.  We have heard a lot of talk about the American dream in recent days--that we are a nation of immigrants; it is part of our core, and that is absolutely right. We are a nation of immigrants. We are a nation where blood ties are not supposed to dictate the path of your life, where you can fulfill your dreams. But we have an immigration system that does the exact opposite--an immigration system that favors the ties of blood, the ties of kinship, the ties of clan, and the ties of tribe. What could be less American than that?  As a result, we have also had a massive wave of low-skilled and unskilled immigrants, over the last 52 years. Today, of the million-plus immigrants who come here every year, only 1 in 15 comes here because of education, job skills, or a job offer. That means we have thousands and thousands of workers, with absolutely no consideration for what it means for the workers who are already here--the workers who are American citizens, who are earning a wage. In many cases, the most recent immigrants are going to face competition from the next wave of unskilled immigrants, so we are putting downward pressure on their wages--the wages of people who work with their hands and work on their feet, who hold the kinds of jobs that require you to take a shower after you get off work, not before you go to work.  Blue-collar workers have begun to see an increase in their wages over the last year for the first time in decades, and that is in no small part because of the administration's efforts to get immigration under control. But it is not enough to stop there.  The real question is, who should our immigration system work for? It should work for the American people, the American worker. It should be crafted for their benefit, not for the benefit of foreigners. We should have an immigration system that fulfills the needs of our economy, that focuses on jobs and wages for American citizens here, whether your parents came over on the Mayflower or whether you just took the oath of citizenship last week. This is not some radical position. Liberal Democrats used to believe in that.  I understand that in this debate most of the attention is focused on the population of about 690,000 illegal immigrants who came here, through no fault of their own, as young children 15, 20, 30 years ago. I think the concern for them is very understandable. President Trump has shown it. My colleagues have shown it today. I share it as well.  President Obama did them a real disservice by unilaterally and unconstitutionally--therefore unsustainably--giving them legal status in this country to work. President Trump did the right thing by recognizing that President Obama lacked that authority and shouldn't have put them in that position. But nobody in the Senate--I think I can speak for my other 99 colleagues. Nobody is eager to see these people face deportation. Yet, at the same time, if we are going to give them legal status, we have to recognize that inevitably, as an operation of logic, there are two negative consequences that flow from that. You can say that you don't mind them, but you can't say that they don't exist.  First, as you have heard from so many others, you are going to encourage parents from around the world who live in poverty, oppression, strife, and war to illegally immigrate to this country with their small children in hopes of giving their children American citizenship sometime in the future. That is dangerous, and, in my opinion, it is immoral to offer those kind of inducements.  Second, as I have explained, you will create a whole new category of American citizens who can now get legal status for their extended families--to include the very parents who brought them here in violation of law in the first place. As part of this debate, we have often heard the old line that children ought not to pay for the crimes of the parents. Well, if that is the case, can't we at least agree that parents can pay for the crimes of the parents? They are the ones who created the situation in the first place.  President Trump has said, as I have noted, that he wants to protect the DACA population. But at the same time, he has said repeatedly: We must build a wall and secure our border and end chain migration. I agree that we have to build a wall on our border.  I have to say, it is a little amusing to see how our Democratic colleagues have changed their tune on this point. First, they were complaining for weeks that the President hadn't written a border security plan yet. They kept asking for a punch list. A punch list is what your contractor provides you when he is done building your home[[Page S57]]but not quite done with every single technical spec. The administration provided that to them just last week.  Now they are complaining that it is too expensive: It is outrageous, in the words from the Senator from I want to point out that although the President's proposal would cost $18 billion--it is over 10 years, so $1.8 billion a year--the Senator from Illinois has proposed a naked amnesty bill that would cost $26 billion over 10 years. That is right; $18 billion is too much to secure our southern border to build a wall and provide more agents and buy more technology, but $26 billion to provide more welfare for illegal immigrants after they get amnesty is A- I would also point out that a lot of Democrats supported the Secure Fence Act just over a decade ago--building over 700 miles the physical barrier on our southern border. Maybe I can propose new grounds for starting negotiations. How about we simply agree as a baseline that we will fully fund the hundreds of miles of physical barriers that the Senate minority leader voted for just 12 years ago?  They also supported the so-called Gang of 8 bill 5 years ago, which also would have built hundreds of miles of physical barrier on our southern border. What has changed since then?  All that being said, building a wall will help stop illegal immigration, but it will not fix all the problems to the law itself. That is why I have said, as the President has said, we also have to deal with that second consequence--ending chain migration.  One trial balloon I have heard floated in recent days is that a negotiated piece of legislation could eliminate the immigration preference for the adult, unmarried kids of legal permanent residents, green card holders. That is perfectly fine. We should do that, for sure. But to act as if that alone would end chain migration is preposterous. It will delay a very small part of chain migration--only delay, only delay a very small part--about 26,000 of the more than 300,000 people who come here a year through family preferences. It doesn't even touch the preference for the adult, unmarried children of citizens or parents or siblings of citizens and green card holders alike.  In other words, once these young people in the DACA population become citizens, then they will be able to get legal status for their relatives, which means, far from stopping chain migration, it will actually accelerate the naturalization process and the chain we are trying to stop in the first place.  The time has come to end this foolish, unwise, and, indeed, dangerous policy, as we saw just a few weeks ago in the most recent attempted terror attack in New York, which had at its initiating point someone who had come into this country because of chain migration. Not a single advanced, industrialized nation has such a lax immigration policy as we do when it comes to immigrant families--not Canada, not the United Kingdom, not France, not Germany, not New Zealand, not  If we are actually going to fix this problem--if we are going to do right by the American worker, if we are going to promote the American dream and American ideals, then it is time for these mindless family preferences and chain migration to come to an end.

938,topic-id,830,"Mr.Speaker, last October, President Trump loudly proclaimed that the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, was ``virtually dead.'' He said it was finished, it was gone. This was after the pummeling that this law had been taking over 2017 in the unsuccessful effort by the Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care  Again, last October was a critical moment, because enrollment was about to commence for 2018's policy year, and the Trump administration announced that they were going to cut in half the time that people would have an opportunity to go out and learn about rates, to talk to get enrollment help, and also to sign up for different plans. They also cut the marketing budget by 80 percent and eliminated funding for folks at the State level to actually provide face-to-face assistance. So it all looked pretty grim back in October in terms of what that would result in in terms of enrollment for 2018.  Well, as a famous resident from the State of Connecticut, Mark Twain, once infamously said: Rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.  Yesterday, the Connecticut exchange, the Connecticut Access Health Exchange, announced their enrollment numbers for 2018. Rather than going down, even though they were only able to enroll people in half the time there was in 2016, and even though they had no budget in terms of trying to actually promote and advertise, their enrollment went up. It went up by 3 percent in terms of the number of people who signed up for Anthem Blue Cross plans, for ConnectiCare plans, and for Medicaid plans.  Again, it was done because of this amazing grassroots, organic effort by libraries, by community health centers, by human service agencies, by hospitals that went out and took on the task of getting the word out that, in fact, the Affordable Care Act was still alive and that people would have access to affordable health plans. Sure enough, it resulted in an increase in health plans.  Interestingly, the young invincibles, the young enrollees that everybody predicted were going to abandon the program because the enforcement of the mandate was going to be relaxed by the IRS actually had a very strong, healthy number.  Coming from a State that is known for its insurance history--it was the insurance capital of the world--the fact of the matter is that getting those young enrollees, those young members to sign up for these plans, in fact, portends well for 2019 and beyond.  This morning, The Hill newspaper reported that for ObamaCare insurers, actually, their financial prospects are looking much better for 2019 because the system has stabilized.  Now, again, there is still work that could be done. There is a bill, H.3748, a Medicare buy-in, which would allow people 50 and up to voluntarily sign up for Medicare, again, using subsidies if they qualify or paying the full cost, which would still be 40 percent less than the plans that are on exchanges throughout the country for people 50 and up. It would not affect the deficit, and, in fact, arguably, it would strengthen the Medicare trust fund because you would get a younger population into the Medicare  So there is work that we can do that is optional, voluntary, in terms of trying to provide more choices for individuals out there; but, clearly, what happened yesterday in Connecticut and throughout the country in terms of enrollment figures, that despite the active efforts by the Trump administration to undercut and sabotage this law, in fact, shows that the law has a life of its own, that, in fact, people are voting with their feet in terms of still trying to get access to the critical needs of every human being and every American, which is access to healthcare.  I want to particularly congratulate Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman, who spearheaded this effort in Connecticut and yesterday stated: This just shows how valuable the Affordable Care Act is to thousands of residents in Connecticut; also, Jim Wadleigh, the director of the exchange, who, again, was not distracted or demoralized by the comments coming out of the White House but still plunged forward and still persistently and determinedly went out and made sure that people got the real information, the real facts, the real news so that they could, in fact, take an opportunity to protect themselves and their families from the inevitable problems of sickness and accident, that every American and every Member of Congress enjoys through their health benefits, for every resident in the State of  It is time for us to stop the attack in terms of a program that has provided millions of Americans coverage and opportunity to healthcare. We should work together on bills like H.3748, a voluntary, deficit-neutral attempt to try and strengthen and provide cheaper alternatives for people 50 and up and small businesses. That is the way forward, not this persistent, nonstop hyperpolitical, hyperpartisan attack[[Page H23]]on a bill that has made a huge difference to millions of                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgH22.txt,1836,OFFSHORING GOP TAX SCAM,2018.0,9.0,March

When Chris Kliemen was named head coach at NDSU 3 years ago, he inherited a tradition of excellence and made it a dynasty. Merriam-Webster defines ``dynasty'' as ``a powerful group or family that maintains its position for a considerable time.''  Well, Mr.Speaker, winning six national championships in 7 years certainly meets the second half of that definition. And anyone who knows Bison football knows that they are a family. It is what makes them special.  Quarterback Easton Stick was named the Game's Most Outstanding Player, but it was the Bison defense that shined the brightest on Saturday, holding James Madison University's explosive offense to a season low 241 yards and just 13 points.  Perhaps it was linebacker Nick DeLuca who put it best when asked how the Bison defense was able to respond so spectacularly in so many difficult situations. He simply said: ``Just remain focused and calm.''  Good advice, Nick, in football and politics.

1088,topic-id,1434,"Mr.President, the time to vote has come, and we are a few minutes over. This is one of those times when the Senate is on a very tight timeline, so I will have the majority of my speech put into the I just wanted to respond in one quick way to some of the comments my colleague from Ohio has just made.  A lot of attacks on this floor have been made saying that this bill rolls back the regulatory authority of the Federal Reserve and exposes all of our large banks to much greater risk or much less supervision than they would have had before and on and on. We knew these attacks were coming. They came in the Banking Committee when we had the markup on this bill.  Basically, I want to read a series of questions and answers I had with the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve about these types of allegations being made about the bill--a bill which is designed to deal with credit unions and community banks and the smaller sector of our economy, not the big banks--all these attacks about rolling back the protections against big banks.  I asked Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell whether it was accurate, if this bill were passed, that the Federal Reserve would still be required to conduct supervisory stress tests for any bank with total assets between $150 billion and $250 billion to ensure that it has enough capital to weather economic downturns.  He answered: Yes, it is.  I asked, if this bill were passed, whether it was accurate that the Federal Reserve would still have sufficient authority to apply any prudential standard--let me repeat that--any prudential standard to a bank with between $100 billion and $250 billion in total assets if the Fed determined that was appropriate.  He answered: Yes, that is true.  I asked whether it was accurate that this bill does not weaken oversight of the largest globally systemic banks.  He answered, correctly, that yes, that was correct.  Then I asked whether it was accurate that the Federal Reserve applies enhanced standards to international banks based on their global total consolidated assets--meaning that our bill would not exempt banks like Deutsche Bank and Santander from section 165 of Dodd- He answered: That is correct.  I want to repeat this, because this keeps coming up. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve said that this bill does not exempt G-SIB foreign banks, such as Deutsche Bank and Santander, and that we do not eliminate the ability of our Federal Reserve to correctly and properly supervise our banks.  We are going to go back and forth over this, but this bill is designed to protect community banks and credit unions. That is why we have such bipartisan support for it.  Mr.President, we have been able to highlight the benefits of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act on the Senate Floor over the last week, and I am glad we have the opportunity to continue that discussion this week.  I have been very encouraged by my colleagues' support for this critical piece of legislation. I thank each of those Senators, including many members of the Banking Committee, for their support, interest, and involvement in the many discussions, hearings, and personal conversations we have had to improve this bill. I also thank all those who voted on the motion to invoke cloture on substitute amendment 2151, as modified, to 2155.  Since the bill passed out of the Banking Committee, supporters have worked in good faith to include provisions that different Members have offered, including those who do not support the bill.  The substitute amendment we offered last week reflects the additional provisions that the bill's supporters were able to agree on, collectively.  To ensure that everyone understands what the substitute amendment does, let me take a few minutes to explain the changes from the bill that passed out of committee.  This amendment makes both technical and substantive changes to further improve economic growth, regulatory relief, and consumer protections.  This substitute makes changes to the appraisal provision in our bill to add definitions and provide detail on criteria for efforts to document and contact appraisers.  It also strengthens the HMDA provision by adding a ``bad actor'' prohibition, limiting the universe of lenders who can take advantage of the relief to those that do not have ratings of ``need to improve'' on their last two CRA exams or one rating of ``substantial non-compliance'' on their last CRA exam.  It adds further consumer protections on who can take advantage of transitional licenses and adds liability protections for government officials who carry out their official duties.  It modifies a provision by raising the threshold from $15 billion to $20 billion for those Federal savings associations that wish to take advantage of charter conversions.  It modifies the existing provision dealing with applying the Expedited Funds Availability Act, which governs bank deposit holds, to add Guam to the list of American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands which would receive the benefit.  It clarifies the current international insurance provision so that the Treasury, Fed, and Federal Insurance Office report to Congress on studies regarding consumer and market impact of international insurance capital standards is only required with respect to final standards.  It also changes the date at which point Treasury and Fed reporting requirements on international insurance regulatory and supervisory forums terminate from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024--this aligns with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors' planned timeframe for implementing its insurance capital standard.  It promotes construction and development on Main Street by ensuring that the Federal Reserve appropriately treats certain commercial real estate loans in its rules.  It helps reduce identity fraud by directing the Social Security Administration to accept electronic signatures as consumer consent for financial institutions trying to verify customer ID and root out synthetic ID fraud.  It uses part of the Fed's discretionary surplus as a pay-for.  It expands the existing credit freeze provisions by increasing the circumstances where Americans can get a free credit freeze, and clarifies that an incapacitated person receives the same protections as a minor under the age of 16.  It also adds a provision that gives free and ongoing credit monitoring to Active Duty servicemembers who are serving and sacrificing for our country.  It adds a provision which helps protect veterans from predatory lending by requiring VA lenders to demonstrate a material benefit to consumers when refinancing their mortgages.  It adds a section requiring Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac to establish a process for validating and approving credit score models, and requires FHFA to establish standards and criteria for such processes.  The language requires that any credit score model must meet a series of criteria related to predictiveness, accuracy, safety and soundness, and other metrics in order to be approved, to ensure that this will not undermine the quality of underwriting at Fannie and  The substitute adds important reports: a GAO report on Puerto Rico foreclosures; and a report on children's lead-based paint hazard prevention and abatement, which is a serious issue in many of our  It also makes permanent certain protections for members of uniformed services under the Servicemembers Civil Relief  It also makes further clarifications to the section about enhanced supervision and prudential standards for certain banks, by lowering the asset threshold above which banks have to pay assessments and requiring the Fed[[Page S1729]]to adjust such charges to reflect the fact that the cost of supervision and regulation of certain institutions will be reduced as a result of this legislation.  It also clarifies that this bill does not affect the legal effect of the Federal Reserve's final rule on foreign banking organizations, and the bill does not limit the Federal Reserve's legal authority to require intermediate holding companies, apply enhanced prudential standards, or tailor regulations for certain foreign banking organizations.  The amendment also adds a new Encouraging Capital Formation title, which includes five capital formation and securities bills that passed the Senate by unanimous consent last year, as well as a bill to help companies take advantage of further ways to raise capital and ease burdens on certain publicly traded investment companies.  Lastly, the bill provides additional protections for borrowers and cosigners of private student loans, and requires the Treasury Department to study and promulgate best practices for higher education financial literacy.  All of these additions improve the bill and strengthen the core themes of the existing provisions; namely, improving economic growth, regulatory relief, and consumer protections.  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this amendment.                      Amendment 2152 Withdrawn  ",CREC-2018-03-14-pt1-PgS1696-4.txt,250,THE TAX SCAM AND THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,2018.0,14.0,March

We have had the opportunity to highlight this bill over the[[Page S1730]]last 2 weeks, and I have been very encouraged by my colleagues' support for its critical results.  Again, I thank each of the Senators who support this bill--including many members of the Banking Committee--for their interest, involvement, and the many discussions, hearings, and personal conversations we have had to get to this point.

Since the bill passed out of the Banking Committee, supporters have worked in good faith to include provisions that different Members have offered, including those who do not support the bill. The substitute amendment we introduced last week reflects the additional provisions that the bill supporters were able to agree to.  The final bill we are about to vote on today is the product of careful negotiations and good, old-fashioned statesmanship. The majority of us in this body recognize that our community financial institutions have been struggling to keep up with the regulatory demands coming out of Washington and that it was time to revisit current law and make changes where necessary.  While there are certain provisions that I would like to have included in this bill, I believe the package on which we were able to reach consensus is an important step in the right direction and will deliver much needed relief and economic growth to Main Street  When this bill is signed into law, it will right-size regulation for financial institutions, including community banks and credit unions, making it easier for consumers to get mortgages and to obtain credit. Those are the real victims of this regulatory overreach--individuals who find it difficult to get access to credit, to get a loan for college, to get a mortgage for a house, or small businesses seeking to start up or to expand that cannot get necessary access to capital not because they are not creditworthy but because the system we have created makes it so that our smaller financial institutions that do the relationship banking throughout so much of America don't have the ability to serve them anymore. It also increases important consumer protections for veterans, senior citizens, victims of fraud, and those who have fallen on tough financial times.  This bill has received widespread support for good reason. The cycle of lending and job creation has been stifled by onerous regulation. Absent excessive regulatory burdens, local banks and credit unions will be able to focus more on lending and in turn propel economic growth and create jobs.  Not to be overlooked, this is also an important moment for bipartisanship and working across the aisle to legislate. Many people are worried about the gridlocks in This bill shows that we can work together and can do big things that make a big difference in the lives of people across this country.  Those who support this bill have recognized that, with the right regulation, tailored regulation, we can promote local economic growth through our Nation's smaller financial institutions.  I will end with this: This bill was a bipartisan compromise. The changes are common sense, and it will allow financial institutions to better serve their customers and communities, while maintaining safety and soundness and important consumer protections. At a time of intense political polarization, we have proven that we can work together to get things done.  This is good for small financial institutions, good for small businesses, and good for families across America, and I encourage my colleagues to support its passage.

Mr.Speaker, I want to take a few minutes to express my concern about the way the Government of Iran has trampled on the rights of its people to express their discontent with the current regime, which has resulted in at least 21 deaths and more than 450 arrests. It is, quite frankly, disturbing the way the Iranian Government has used its military might to show an unacceptable and a disproportionate amount of force to quell and to attempt to control protests.  Additionally, Iran's judiciary has disregarded the rights of protesters to express themselves and to peacefully assemble, by threatening harsh punishments. I have read reports that the[[Page H68]]government has blocked the Internet and social media services which, I believe, constitutes a violation of fundamental rights of free speech.  People in Iran are suffering. Their economy is stagnant, and their wages aren't keeping up with the costs of living. People are hungry, and they have grown weary of a radical and a corrupt regime set on sponsoring terrorism and pursuing an ill-advised plan for nuclear capabilities rather than focusing on improving the lives and stability of the people and their nation.  The people of Iran were hopeful that Iran would see some relief from the sanctions and would see economic improvement after their government entered into a deal in 2015 regarding its nuclear program. But because of widespread corruption and failed economic policies of Iran's Government, as well as its failure to live up to its commitments to the international community, Iran's people have only continued to suffer from poverty, high unemployment, and inflation.  It should be no surprise to the leadership of Iran that its people are calling for change because of its failure and poor leadership that have led the people to protest.

In fact, in 2010 I was working at RightNow Technologies in my hometown of Bozeman, We were growing a technology company there. We were creating good, high-paying jobs in Montana--in fact, about 500 jobs there.  While I was working to grow jobs back home in Montana, President Obama and a Democratic majority in the House and the Senate were passing legislation that stifled job creation--in fact, costing our economy billions of dollars and penalizing small local banks and credit unions for the wrongdoings committed by bad actors on Wall  I am talking about Dodd-Since Dodd-Frank's passage, the number of federally insured credit unions in Montana fell by over 10 percent. The number of Montana State chartered banks fell over 34 percent, from 64 to 44. This is no surprise because Dodd-Frank empowered more than 10 Federal agencies to write more than 400 new rules, imposing 27,000 mandates, many of which fell on these local banks and credit unions.  These small community businesses don't have the ability to keep up with the onslaught of these new rules, new regulations, and guidance constantly coming out of Washington following Dodd-Frank, and the customers are suffering.  Small local banks and credit unions are uniquely capable of knowing their customers and providing tailored financial services to meet their customers' individual circumstances. Dodd-Frank stripped this customer advantage away by making prohibitively difficult any loans that don't comply with the cookie-cutter regulations.  It is interesting that in that debate back in 2010, many Republicans warned our colleagues on the Democratic side about this, but virtually every Democratic Senator then voted for Dodd-This difficulty fell particularly hard on Montana's entrepreneurs, who are self-employed and don't typically have wage income.

2063,topic-id,295,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to offer my support for H.4263, the Regulation A+ Improvement I greatly appreciate my colleague, Representative MacArthur, for this bill and for our chairman for moving it through our committee, and, frankly, my colleagues from across the aisle who came together to recognize the need for this bill.  As has already been stated, this has broad implications for small capital companies. I spent the past 15 years, prior to coming to Congress, growing small manufacturing companies, and I can greatly appreciate the challenge of raising capital. This is another means of doing that, but I want to highlight another area that it might be suitable.  With approximately $4 billion of capital raised worldwide in 2017, it is fair to say that initial coin offerings are just another great way for startups to raise capital and grow their businesses. ICOs in Regulation A+ could work great together, and with Mr.MacArthur's bill, they can work even better.  An example of this harmonization is the investor-based A+ allows investors of any wealth to participate. This Democratic process is a pillar for ICOs in terms of the premise behind distributed ledger technology.  Another provision is anti-money laundering. A+ requires the validation of investors, as well as background checks on the principles of offering companies. This goes hand in hand with improving the credibility of ICO business practices and reducing the risk of loss.  Compliance with A+ would mean a disclosure memorandum, not just a white paper. A+ provides ICO entrepreneurs and their startups with a viable path to compliance with SEC security regulation. So it is important that we have guardrails established in this explosive new industry, while not hampering the ability to grow the business. I urge my colleagues to support this vital legislation.

1632,topic-id,639,"Mr.Speaker, 1 month ago today, a man brutally murdered 17 children and educators in Parkland, He killed these innocent people using a semiautomatic, assault-style weapon. These weapons, designed for the battlefield, are easily available across this country.  It has been 19 years since the Columbine school shooting. That massacre shocked Our country debated that shooting and the causes for months, for years. But in what has become an all-too-familiar pattern, Congress did nothing to address the factor that makes these massacres so deadly, the easy access to guns.  You see, after Columbine, the gun lobby knew that they were in trouble, so they put a whole lot of time and a whole lot of money into confusing the issue. They said: ``It's not guns. It's bullying. It's not guns. It's the lack of school security. It's not guns. It's our violent culture, music, and video games.''  Well, other countries have all of these things, but other countries do not have mass shootings like ours because other countries have responsible gun safety laws.  Today, 1 month after the Parkland shooting, we are, once again, discussing guns. Today, as after Columbine, the gun lobby knows that they are in trouble because this time these children who survived the Parkland shooting are not trying to return to the way life was before the shooting. They are taking a stand. And, yes, we do stand with them.  See, these children believe that they can change the world. They should, and they are. I mean, after all, isn't that what we taught them: that when they see something wrong, they do something about it?  So the gun lobby is going back to their same old tactics: It is not guns; it is the fact that the teachers don't have guns.                              {time}  1045  How surprising that the gun lobby solution to school shootings is to buy more guns. But as a former law enforcement officer who has been trained in active shooter situations, I can tell you that arming teachers is a dangerous and disturbing idea. We should prevent mass shootings and not complicate them.  I can tell you that having multiple armed individuals present in an active shooter situation only complicates the response. Arming teachers would lead to taxpayer-sponsored shootouts, endangering outscaled and outgunned teachers, putting our children at risk.  We already ask our overworked and underpaid teachers to do too much. A national survey of teachers found that, if offered the choice to carry a firearm, most would refuse. Many have said they would quit.  The solution to gun violence is not shootouts between teachers and school shooters. Instead, we can finally take serious but real measures addressing gun safety.  We should stop this absurd idea before it becomes reality. Congress should move swiftly to prevent the administration from shifting tax dollars meant for antiterrorism programs to buying guns for teachers. I had hoped to incorporate this commonsense idea in a bill scheduled to come before the Homeland Security Committee last week, but I was blocked for doing so, and that is why, last night, I introduced a new bill to put the idea into law. Money for fighting terrorism should stay where it is, and our teachers should be allowed to teach.  We saw that in my own congressional district in Orlando, Florida, the result of lack of action where 49 people were killed and 58 still suffer life-changing injuries when they were gunned down in a nightclub. See, everybody, living in a country that we say is the greatest country in the world should have the right to go to church, to go to school, to go to a mall, to go to a movie theater without being gunned down.  Mr.Speaker, we should take action after this shooting and do our jobs to protect our children and serve our communities.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-14-pt1-PgH1550-2.txt,2320,TAX REFORM BILL AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION,2018.0,14.0,March

982,topic-id,740,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend from New  Mr.Speaker, the trauma that my community in Parkland, Florida, experienced was not unique. Gun violence tears apart American communities on a daily basis. So, no, what happened on February 14 when 14 students and three teachers were hunted in their schools with an AR-15 assault rifle by a former student, that wasn't unique.  But the problem of gun violence in America is a uniquely American problem. It is an epidemic. It is a complex problem. There are many facets. But we know what we need to do, and I am committed to taking any step to getting any new policy across the finish line that will make our kids safer.  This bill, the STOP School Violence Act, is a good bill. It will not solve our gun problem. It won't ban bump stocks or require Americans to be 21 to buy a gun, fix our broken background check system, or get weapons of war--the weapons of choice for mass shooters--off our streets and out of our communities. But it will help troubled students who need help get help, and it will help teachers and law enforcement identify potential threats before it is too late.  Before we vote, I would like to make a few things clear. First, this isn't a response to the tragedy at Marjory Stoneman In fact, Congressman Rutherford and I introduced this bill a week before the shooting. The programs in this bill are based on rigorous, evidence-based evaluation. They are proven to help reduce isolation and identify kids who need help.  We had no idea at the time that we wouldn't be able to move fast enough to stop this tragedy. We had no idea that we would have an urgent need to help get more American schools access to these programs. But since Congress has failed the American people by ignoring the deadly scourge of gun violence, since we failed the families of Stoneman Douglas just like we failed the families of Sandy Hook, Columbine, and so many others, we owe it to students and teachers across this country to at least give them tools to help identify dangerous behavior.  The failure of Congress to take action in response to gun violence has left the American gun violence debate in a ridiculous place. Armed teachers in every hallway? Is that what we want education to be in America? I am glad this bill includes a specific prohibition against the use of grant dollars to arm school personnel, including teachers, or to train school personnel to use firearms.  Since Congress has failed the American people by ignoring the scourge of gun violence and failed the families of Stoneman Douglas, the failure of Congress to take action has left us in this position of debating gun violence where we are hesitant to even take small steps. This is a small and important step.  I have heard civil rights concerns related to racial profiling and discrimination associated with threat assessments in anonymous reporting, and I am sensitive to those. Congress should never be in a position to make this serious problem worse with new programs to expand the discrimination already entrenched in our school system and society as a whole.  I know the evidence shows that discriminatory discipline in schools can have dramatic, long-term effects on academic performance and wide-ranging impact. But this bill, Mr.Speaker, does not perpetuate discriminatory policies. Zero tolerance and other questionable discipline policies are not evidence based, and, as such, would not be considered a proper use of grant funds.  STOP School Violence program grants are not intended to be used to discipline students. Instead, threat assessment intervention protects potential victims and addresses the underlying problems to make schools safe for everyone. Finally, studies on evidence-based school threat assessment intervention practices have shown that these programs actually decrease racial profiling, bullying, suicides, and suspensions.  I am proud of the bipartisan work that has gone into this bill, and once we have taken this step--this astonishingly modest yet important first step--we must finally do our jobs and work together to make meaningful changes toward stopping the epidemic of gun violence in this country. I know that this does not go far enough in terms of what we need to do. I understand that. I believe it deeply. But it is an important, bipartisan step that we should take today.

335,topic-id,1144,"Mr.President, for the past decade, health policy, unfortunately, has proven to be one of the most bitterly partisan issues. It doesn't have to be this way.  I want to take a few minutes to discuss some health-related issues that Congress left unfinished before the holidays: providing relief from the medical device tax, reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program, funding for community health centers, and doing more to address the opioid crisis. Each has strong bipartisan support and could provide help to our constituents now.  First, many of us, on both sides of the aisle, agree on the need to provide relief from the medical device tax, which went back into effect on January 1. The medical device tax is one of these issues that leaves most Hoosiers scratching their heads. First adopted as part of the Affordable Care Act, the device tax was one of the few issues Republicans and Democrats agreed needed to be fixed, and in 2015, with bipartisan support, President Obama enacted a 2-year suspension of the tax.  The argument was really pretty simple. The medical device tax was making it harder for innovative companies to invest in the research and development of new technologies, and, in the process, we were stifling job creation. If there was a question as to whether this was the case, the last 2 years provided evidence. When we agreed to suspend the tax in 2016 and 2017, manufacturers used that additional money to hire new workers, invest in research and technologies, and continue producing innovative, lifesaving products in the United  For example, Zimmer Biomet, headquartered in Warsaw, IN, my home State, used the money from the device tax suspension to invest in new innovation to improve musculoskeletal health across the world. They were also able to upgrade their manufacturing equipment and facilities. Perhaps more importantly, these investments not only supported existing jobs, but they also helped to create new jobs--new, good-paying jobs.  Yet, despite this evidence, despite this strong bipartisan support for repeal, and despite a wide-ranging package of changes to the Tax Code becoming law in recent days, Congress has failed to address the medical device[[Page S93]]tax, which went back into place on January 1.  As we again discuss the policy priorities that were left unaddressed in 2017, I strongly urge my colleagues to work with me to quickly and meaningfully address the medical device tax. This would allow these innovative companies to make the long-term investments that not only lead to life-changing technologies but support thousands of high-paying jobs across the country, including in my home State of  Another issue that has garnered bipartisan support is a healthcare program that covers millions of our children. We must reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program--also known as CHIP--that expired in  I have long supported the CHIP program. It provides health coverage for millions of kids, including nearly 115,000 children from I am not alone in my support for this program. The fact is, CHIP has had strong bipartisan support for the past 20 years, and Democrats and Republicans in both the Senate and the House have shown they support a 5-year reauthorization of the program. That gives States the certainty they need to plan their budgets and provide high-quality care to these children.  Despite this shared commitment for the program and agreement on the need for a long-term reauthorization, we were only able to fund the program through March before Congress departed for the holidays. This short-term extension bought some time, but according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services--CMS--some States will start running out of money after January 19. This means families and States will very soon face the harmful consequences of congressional inaction.  Just last week, the Congressional Budget Office said that funding the CHIP program for the next 5 years will cost significantly less than previous estimates. This program is vital to our families and vital to our children. We should reauthorize the CHIP program right away.  Like the CHIP program, community health centers have enjoyed long bipartisan support for the high-quality care they provide to our families. Also, like CHIP, the funding for community health centers expired on September 30, leaving many health centers across Indiana worried about if they will have the resources they need to continue to serve  We have the ability to work together now to ensure that our community health centers can continue to provide cost-effective, high-quality healthcare to people all across the country.  Finally, we have demonstrated a common desire to address the needs of the opioid and drug abuse crisis. It is a scourge. It took the lives of 63,000 people just in 2016--63,000 of our brothers and sisters, our husbands and wives, our sons and daughters. It is a heartbreak that is crushing the entire country.  I welcomed President Trump's declaration of a public health emergency, and both Republican and Democratic Senators have highlighted the need for Congress to do even more to help those struggling with addiction.  Like many other States, the opioid epidemic has been particularly devastating in underserved areas in Indiana that lack adequate treatment providers.  Senator Murkowski and I have partnered on a bipartisan bill that would encourage addiction treatment professionals to serve in underserved areas by making addiction treatment facilities eligible for National Health Service Corps student loan repayment and forgiveness.  We can show our commitment to increasing access to treatment by reauthorizing the National Health Service Corps program, which expired in We also must recognize that a meaningful response to the opioid crisis will require robust and meaningful funding to help our communities as soon as possible.  I have often said that most people think Congress can do something to help make life better--to provide working parents with the peace of mind that their children can grow up healthy and to instill confidence in our communities so that they will have the tools they need to respond to this heartbreaking crisis. At the very least, Congress should not make this situation worse.  By failing to take action in 2017, medical device companies are once again paying a counterproductive tax that inhibits growth in  On all of these issues--medical device taxes, our families and our children and this opioid crisis, community health centers--we can work together as Democrats, as Republicans, but more than either of those, as Americans to make sure that our families can get decent healthcare, to make sure that no one else dies because of this terrible opioid scourge we are dealing with.

Assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts, CBO      estimates implementing H.1486 would cost $112 million over      the 2018-2022 period.

1188,topic-id,251,"Mr.President, thank you. I thank the chairman and my colleagues from Wisconsin for their support of this bipartisan legislation, which I introduced in January and filed as an amendment to 2155. As the chairman stated, as a result of the 2016 regulation, many of the FHLB system's captive insurance members have had or will soon have their membership terminated. Our legislation seeks to ensure that captive insurer affiliates of institutions that are active providers of private capital in the mortgage market are eligible to restore or continue their membership.  Their membership is crucial to reliable access to low-cost funding for home mortgages and affordable housing initiatives in For the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, these members serve as an important source of private capital in the mortgage market. Their membership broadens access[[Page S1786]]to credit to financial institutions that would otherwise not be able to access credit through their local markets and creates a reliable source of liquidity for affordable housing initiatives.  Our bipartisan bill only seeks to redress those captives that were previously granted FHLB membership prior to February 19, 2016. By allowing captive insurers to continue to invest in mortgages and mortgage-related securities through the FHLB system, they can continue to provide both credit and liquidity to the market. Such sources of private capital are critical to the long-term financing of the FHLB system, and therefore, eligibility in the system should be preserved. Our legislation will achieve this purpose. I wish to turn to my friend from Wisconsin, Senator  ",CREC-2018-03-19-pt1-PgS1785-3.txt,2123,IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2017,2018.0,19.0,March
1149,topic-id,463,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I would just note that the Orderly Liquidation Authority is an authority to bail out big banks, consistent with the bailout that the ranking member voted for in, I believe, 2008, that the chairman, I believe, voted against.  When we talk about those who use rhetoric to say they don't support big banks, but then actually vote for them, I think that is a hard note to take.  But I rise today to support H.4545, the Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act, a bipartisan measure introduced by Mr. This bill would amend the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act of 1978, a long time ago, by updating the definition of financial institutions, establishing new requirements for the final examination report process, and creating an office of independent examination review, giving some independence here, some common sense.  These updates are critical because, in 1994, Congress directed Federal regulators to establish an independent intra-agency appellate process for institutions to seek the review of examination ratings, adequacy of loan loss reserve, and clarifications on loans.  I agree that these entities should be reviewed to ensure that they are financially sound. We want to make sure that we prevent failure so we don't have folks across the aisle voting for bailouts. However, we are hearing from our community financial institutions, the ones that serve most of my district in Wisconsin, that the avenues needed to appeal these determinations are limited. The process is secretive, and the regulators are overempowered.  The intra-agency review process has also been criticized as not being independent because the regulatory determinations are reviewed, not by a third party, but by the employees of the same regulator handing down the verdict. So this is the judge, the jury, and the executioner.  I was a prosecutor, and when I presented a case to a jury and they found someone guilty, I didn't make the defendant appeal the verdict to the same jury that found him guilty. They have got to go to a third-party appellate process, independent reviewers. That is the way the American system works and should work in this scenario as well.  Our community bankers explained that they feel victimized. They feel retribution for challenging the outcomes of these exams, and that is a bad thing. Add to the fear the fact that these examinations lack transparency, and now we have real problems to contend with which is why the solution is so bipartisan. The chairman mentioned 16 Democrats on the committee voted for this commonsense piece of legislation.  That is why the bill is so important. It will embolden our community banks by creating an independent auditor to ensure fairness and transparency.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

It gives them a little bit of freedom.  Importantly, the office would also review regulators' procedures to make sure that their written examination policies are being followed and adhered to.  Lastly, the bill would provide a right to a hearing upon appeal. The decision as to whether the appeal is heard on the record will be left to the petitioner. Again, you are getting due process. We want due process. That is something we all fight for. No one disagrees on that. Why can't we offer that to our small community banks and credit unions that oftentimes feel victimized?

It was 7 years ago that I sent a letter to President I was joined in that letter, incidentally, by Senator Dick Lugar, a Republican from In that letter, I asked President Obama: Can you find a way to protect these young people?[[Page S134]]  We passed the Dream Act on the floor of the We passed it on the floor of the We have never managed to pass it in both Chambers in the same year. And the President created the DACA  The DACA Program has been a success. Approximately 800,000 Dreamers have come forward and received DACA protection. Let's allow them to be part of America as teachers, as nurses, as engineers, as first responders, and even serving in the U.military.  But on September 5 of this last year, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration was setting out to repeal DACA, to put an end to it. That same day, President Trump called on Congress to come up with a solution to legalize He challenged us. He said to the U.Senate and House: Pass a law. If this is a good idea, pass a law.  It has been more than 4 months since the President issued that challenge. The Republican leadership of Congress has not proposed any legislation to legalize DACA as the President asked.  The deportation clock is ticking for these young people who are protected. Already, 15,000 have lost their DACA status. Beginning on March 5--the deadline that initially was imposed by President Trump--every day for the next 2 years, 1,000 DACA young people will lose their ability to work legally in the United States and will be subject to being deported from this country.  Who are they? Some 20,000 of them are teachers in our schools who would lose the right to work legally and have to leave their classrooms. Nurses would leave their patients. First responders would leave their posts. And 900 soldiers would lose their ability to volunteer to risk their lives for America's future.  This isn't just a looming humanitarian crisis; it is an economic crisis. More than 91 percent of DACA Dreamers are gainfully employed and paying taxes. Many of them are students; yet they are still gainfully employed because they don't qualify for Federal assistance for higher education, so they have to work jobs, sometimes many jobs.  The nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reports that DACA-eligible individuals contribute an estimated $2 billion a year in State and local taxes. The Cato Institute, a conservative operation in Washington, estimates that ending DACA and deporting DACA recipients will cost the economy $60 billion and result in a $280 billion reduction in economic growth over the next decade.  Poll after poll shows overwhelming bipartisan support for the FOX News found that 79 percent of Americans support a path to citizenship for Dreamers, including 63 percent of Trump voters.  The answer is clear. It was 16 years ago that I first introduced the DREAM Act--bipartisan legislation to give these young people a path to citizenship. In July of last year, I introduced the most recent version with my colleague, Senator Lindsey Graham of South We need to pass the Dream Act, and we need to do it now, before January 19.  Over the years, I have come to the floor to tell the story of the I can give a pretty nice speech here, but these stories tell the story of this issue more than anything I can add to them. These stories show what is at stake when we consider the fate of DACA and the Dream  Today, I want to tell you about this young lady. Her name is Evelyn Valdez-This is the 107th Dreamer story I have told on the floor. Evelyn was 6 months old when her family brought her from Mexico to Houston, She was quite a good student. She graduated 11th in her high school class of 650. She took all advanced placement classes and was a member of the National Honor She was a member of the color guard in the marching band and regularly volunteered at homeless shelters and animal shelters.  It wasn't until she began to apply for college that she finally learned her immigration status. She wasn't like the other students with whom she had grown up and shared classrooms and experiences. Evelyn is undocumented, but it didn't stop her--she was going to pursue college.  One of her teachers believed in her because she was such a bright student and wrote her a letter of recommendation to go to college. She was accepted into the University of She received multiple awards while in college, including the Excellence in SI Leadership and Mentoring Award, the American Society of Plant Biology Award for Outstanding Research, and the Outstanding Biology Leadership  The summer after her freshman year, she was offered a great research opportunity through the National Science Because of DACA, she was allowed to work legally in the United States, and she was able to pursue this important research. That opportunity was in plant water transport research in This is where Evelyn fell in love with ecology and plants.  She graduated magna cum laude in 2016 with a bachelor of science in biology. Today, she is a second-year Ph.student at the University of California, Irvine, in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary She is researching the effects of climate change on the interactions between plants and soil. Evelyn's dream is to continue her research as a scientist and to become an advocate for strategies to mitigate climate change.  In September, the American Association for the Advancement of Science wrote a letter opposing the White House decision to rescind Here is what they said:       Many DACA students make significant contributions to the      scientific and engineering enterprise in the United States .      . . high-achieving young people in DACA contribute in many      ways to our nation. Many are studying to become scientists,      engineers, medical doctors and entrepreneurs. Given the      administration's decision, we urge Congress to craft      legislation that provides long-term protection for these      young people who seek to continue their education and      contribute to society. . . . Our nation needs an immigration      policy that advances U.innovation and prosperity, and      stays true to foundational American goals that seek      contributions to society from all.  The Presiding Officer and I had a unique invitation yesterday. I would just say that as a Member of the House and of the Senate, I have never been invited to a meeting quite like the one we had yesterday with the President in the Cabinet Room of the White It was the President's idea. I don't know if it was a spur-of-the-moment idea, but it is one that came together very quickly in a few days.  I think there were almost 26 of us--Democrats, Republicans, House and Senate Members--who were called together by President I was kind of surprised, but there I was sitting right next to the President of the United It was only the third time we had ever spoken. The other two times, incidentally, were about DACA and the Dream Act, as you can probably guess. He invited me to sit next to him as we talked about this issue.  Then he did something that was really unusual. I have been to some meetings with the President in the Cabinet Room with President Obama and President George Usually, what happens is, the cameras come in, the President says a few words, then the staff tells them to leave, and they reluctantly pull out and leave. Yesterday was quite different. The President told the press they could stay, and they did, for almost an hour. The conversations between the President of the United States and Members of Congress were shared with the American people. I had never seen anything quite like it.  I kind of liked it, to be honest with you. I think there was a lot of candor in the room. People were expressing their points of view, and there were many different points of view, but I think I came away from that meeting with more hope than ever that we can do something about DACA and the Dream The President told us he would like to see it done. He added, though, there were things he wanted to be a part of it. One of them dealt with border security, which has been a priority for all of us from the beginning.  We want to establish--both political parties want to establish that we are committed to border security, and we are. How you define it, what it costs, and how it is implemented--some of these things we can define in our agreement; others will be left to future efforts by Congress and the  Then he talked about the family unification, and that is an issue that is very delicate. It is one that, as my colleagues can imagine, really hits home.[[Page S135]]It is very personal as to whether a member of a family can bring someone they love--some relative in their family--to the United Even if they decide to bring them--incidentally, they may be waiting 30 years, in the case of those who are seeking entry into the United States through family visas; 80 years, from China; 160 years from Some of these things are unrealistic and will never happen, but to talk about family unification really strikes home with a lot of families.  I want to hear the President's point of view, but I want to deal with this in the most sensitive and sincere way. We don't want to flood the United States with people who are any danger to us, 1, or nonproductive citizens, but we certainly want to see families unified.  There is a question about diversity visas. I will not go into it because it is a long story--the creation of this program, where it is today, and where it might be in the future.  Here is what I do believe after yesterday's meeting. I believe President Donald Trump called for that meeting because he wanted to let the American people know he was serious. He wanted to show them he could be a President presiding over a table with 24, 25 Members of Congress from both political parties and tackle a sensitive, delicate, challenging issue. He wants to show the American people he can lead. I want to help him lead if the goal is to make sure DACA and the Dreamers ultimately have their chance to be part of America's future.  I am willing to work in good faith with the President to compromise, whatever it takes, to bring this forward. There are so many lives hanging in the balance, and this is one of them--this wonderful, brilliant young woman who wants to make not only the world a better place but America a better place. She simply wants the chance to be here and be part of America's future. We can give her no less.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.

584,topic-id,1648,"Mr.President, it has been less than 2 weeks since we convened in the Senate, and those of us who have returned to the floor of the Senate may not notice any change, but there is a significant change. If you take a close look, one desk has moved from that side of the aisle to this side of the aisle. There are currently 49 Democratic Senators after the swearing in of our colleague, Senator Doug Jones of Now it is 49 to 51. It is almost as close a break as you can expect or even anticipate in a deliberative body.  It is an indication of more than just the acquisition of one additional Democratic We are moving closer and closer to parity, closer and closer to one another, and, I hope, closer and closer in solving problems. I think that was a message of the Alabama election; among other things, the American people want to see us work together. They have given us 49 and the Republicans 51. I think they expect that to be a signal that we should finally sit down and do something to solve the problems facing our great I feel that as I go home--of course, I run into my loyal Democratic friends who have their own political views, but the vast majority of people say: Can't you work together and solve something? Can't you do something for this Nation? I believe we can, and this month we must.  You see, on January 19 there is a deadline looming. It is only a couple of weeks away. On January 19, we have to make some very momentous, historic decisions about the rest of this year and beyond. One of those is where we will spend the taxpayers' dollars. How much will we spend on the defense of our Nation? How much will we spend on other agencies, which, I would add, also defend our Nation? That has to be decided by 60 votes. Do the math. As whip on the Democratic side, I have said that I learned basically all I needed to know about this job in the first grade. I learned how to count to 60.  On January 19, we need at least 60 Senators to agree on the spending program for this country moving forward, not just the Department of Defense but the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the Department of State, and so many other critically important agencies.  The second thing we need to do is long overdue. The fiscal year, the operative fiscal year for the Federal Government starts on October 1. We are a long way from October 1, 2017. We still don't have a budget. We still have not brought the appropriations bills to the floor of the Senate for consideration.  I am not going to be partisan about this. We failed as Democrats in bringing those appropriations to the floor in a timely manner as well. We have to do something about this process, but we certainly have to face the reality that we are steaming through this fiscal year without a budget. We have taken last year's budget and continued to live by last year's budget. Reflect, for a moment, if you did the same thing for your family. If you were determined to spend in January of 2018 exactly what you spent in 2017, you would think to yourself: That makes no sense. The utility bills are different. I may have a different mortgage payment. A lot of[[Page S5]]things have changed. But we can't change until we pass a budget bill. That, too, is facing a January 19 deadline. Again, it will require 60 votes.  Here are two major issues--the caps on spending and the budget for our government, which need to be passed by January 19 on a bipartisan basis. It is time to come together and face not only those two overarching issues but the long litany of issues that Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader, raised in his opening remarks.  There are so many other elements--the Children's Health Insurance Program, affecting tens of thousands of kids in my State of They told me when I was home: Senator, we are running out of money to provide basic medical care for kids across Why haven't you done your job to reauthorize this program, as well as the program for community care clinics? These clinics are critically important for healthcare for thousands of families in my State and across the  There is one more issue that I am going to raise, as I have so many times, standing in this particular place on the floor, and that is the Dream The DREAM Act is a bill I introduced 16 years ago to give young people brought to the United States as infants and toddlers and children--they have grown up in this country, have no serious criminal issue they have been involved in, and have graduated from our schools--a chance for a future in America, the only country they have ever known. They are the  President Obama gave them a chance with an Executive order called He said: You can come forward, submit a $500 filing fee, go through a criminal background check, and we may give you--it is our decision--2 years of temporary protection to stay in this country. You can work in this country, stay here without fear of deportation on a 2-year basis. So 780,000 young people stepped forward and did that and were approved. Now they are working across America, and 900 of them serve in the U.military. They are undocumented by legal standards, but they have sworn their loyalty to this country and are willing to die for this country. What more could we ask of a young person to prove their loyalty to that flag and to this Nation? Nine hundred of them are now protected by  Then President Trump announced on September 5 of last year that he was going to eliminate that program, eliminate that protection as of March 5 of this year. The clock is ticking; the days on the calendar are turning. There are 900 in our military; 20,000 are teachers across America in grade schools, elementary schools, and high schools--at all levels--and 20,000 of them protected by DACA will lose their ability to teach starting on March 5 of this year because of President Trump's decision and his announcement.  He challenged us. He said: Look, I don't like this Executive order by the previous President; now pass a law. Pass a law and do something about it.  He asked us to do that months ago, and we have done nothing--nothing. I believe that by January 19, we need to take this up as one of the critical issues on our agenda. It is absolutely essential.  Let me add as well that this President has been critical of immigration. I couldn't disagree with him more. He has taken an approach toward immigration that I believe denies the very basis and foundation of this great  I have said it before, and I say it with pride: I stand here on the floor of the U.Senate representing the great State of Illinois, the son of an immigrant to this country. My mother was brought here at the age of 2--she was a Dreamer in her era--and she grew up in America, raised a family, and had a son who was sworn in to the U.She lived long enough to see that. That is my story. That is my family's story. That is America's story. Sometimes I wonder if the President has heard that story or paid attention to it.  Immigration has been at the heart of who we are as The diversity of this great country, when it has come together in citizenship, has been a force to be reckoned with around the world throughout history. I still believe that as much this day as I have ever believed it.  I may not be able to convince the President, but President Obama and others did plead with him to think about these young people, these Dreamers, those protected by Do you know what President Trump said about the Dreamers? Do you know what he said in one of his famous--sometimes infamous--tweets? He said we should ``show great heart.'' ``Show great heart,'' President Trump said, to these young people.  That is why I am here today making this statement on the floor--it is not a long speech; I have spoken many times in the past--to plead with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, in this closely divided Senate, to get this job done before January 19--not just for the 780,000 who took advantage of President Obama's Executive order but for those who were eligible and afraid. There were many thousands who were eligible for this program but afraid to sign up for it, to turn themselves in to the government, and they held back. They are eligible. There is nothing to disqualify them otherwise. Let's give them the same opportunity to be part of the future of this great That is what I believe we can do and should do.  There are 49 Democrats and 51 Republicans--carefully divided. Can enough of us meet in that aisle to create a real majority, a bipartisan majority, to solve this? I am convinced we can, as Senator Schumer said earlier. Our Acting President pro tempore has weighed in on it, and I thank him for his efforts, his personal efforts, on this issue. We have had long meetings. Sometimes we agreed, sometimes we didn't agree, but that is the nature of the Senate, the nature of compromise, and the nature of a process that the American people are begging us, Democrats and Republicans, to engage in, in a positive way by January 19 of this month.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2018-01-03-pt2-PgS4-4.txt,326,ALLEVIATING STRESS TEST BURDENS TO HELP INVESTORS ACT,2018.0,3.0,January
614,topic-id,893,"Mr.President, on September 5 of last year, Attorney General Sessions announced the repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, which has been called The same day, President Trump called on Congress to come up with a solution to ``legalize DACA.''  The history of this issue I have explained many times on the floor, and I will say it briefly. Seventeen years ago, I introduced a bill called the DREAM Act, which said that if you were brought to the country as an infant, a toddler, a child, and you were raised in America and went to school here, had no problems of any serious nature with the law, that you would be given a chance to become a citizen of the United  Many of these children, of course, didn't have a voice in the decision of their families to come to this country, and this is the only country they know. They have gone to our schools. They have graduated from our schools. They stood up in the classrooms of those schools each and every day and pledged allegiance to that flag. It was their flag and their country. Many of them didn't learn until they were in high school, that technically, in the eyes of the law, this wasn't true; they were undocumented. They were illegal in the eyes of the law.  So what I tried to do with the DREAM Act was to give these young people a chance--a chance to become part of America's future and to become, ultimately, earning their way to legalization and earning their way to citizenship. That was the DREAM We have passed it at various times in the We passed it in the House over the years. We have never done it at the same time, same year.  So I called on President Obama and asked him if he would issue an Executive order and do something to help these young people. He created DACA said to the young people: Come forward, pay your filing fee, go through a criminal background check, and we will let you stay in America for 2 years at a time, renewable, and we will let you work in this country. Well, more than 780,000 young people did that. They signed up, paid their fee, went through the background check, and received that protection. Then came President Trump who said: That is the end of the program. We are not going to protect these young people any longer.  Well, whatever happened to those 780,000 DACA-protected young people? Many of them are in school, they are in college, law school, medical school. Some of them joined our military. That is it. They went and took the oath and said: I will serve this country. I will bear allegiance to this country. I will give my life for this country in the U.military. Nine hundred of them are in the military today.  DACA is going to be eliminated as of March 5 of this year by President Trump, which means they will be asked to leave the U.military, to stop this volunteer service to our Another 20,000 are teachers all across this[[Page S12]]country. High schools, grade schools, you name it, they are teaching, trying to find a way to help other young people do better with their lives. They lose their jobs when DACA expires and their DACA protection expires.  Thousands and thousands of them are doing important work, including as engineers, as police officers in training, as medics. These are people who are making this a better country, and all they have asked for is just a chance to be here and to be part of our future, but President Trump said: It is over. Now, Congress, do something about it.  Do you know what we have done since September 5, when the President issued that challenge? Take a look at this empty floor. That is what we have done--nothing. Despite the President's challenge, despite the lives of all these young people hanging in the balance, we have done nothing. That is why I come to the floor today. This has to come to an end. We have to do the right and just thing for these young people. We have to make those who are eligible for the Dream Act, those who are eligible to be part of our future--we have to give them a chance, and that is why I come and ask for help today.  I can tell you we are losing about 1,000 of these young Dreamers each week. Their protection under DACA expires. What does it mean? It means that at any moment of any day, a knock on the door could mean they would be deported and many times other members of their family with them. Their lives in the United States would come to an end, and many of them would be deported to countries they have never ever known. They might have been there as infants. Perhaps it was Mexico; maybe it was They knew it, not personally, but only through family stories, and they would be sent to these countries, many times with no family, no connections, sometimes with no knowledge of the language that is spoken there.  They believe they are I think they should have a chance to become Americans in the full sense of the law.  (",CREC-2018-01-03-pt2-PgS11.txt,326,1600,2018.0,3.0,January

1081,topic-id,1637,"Mr.President, most people cannot remember what happened in the first grade--I have vague memories of being a first grader--but there are certain things that may happen even at a young stage in your life that will be remembered.  My 6-year-old granddaughter, who attends first grade in Brooklyn, NY, a few weeks ago was told by her teacher what to do if a shooter, if a gunman came into the first grade classroom. My little granddaughter was told: Don't stand by the window; you could get shot. If they enter the classroom with a gun, get down on the floor.  Is there any sane person in America who believes that is what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they wrote the Second Amendment to the Bill of Rights--the right to bear arms--that we would have reached a point in America where the prospects of gun violence in the first grade classrooms and all the way through school, through high school, and college would become a reality in America? I can't imagine anyone in their wildest dreams would have imagined that possibility.  Today is March 14. On February 14, a gunman went into a high school in Parkland, FL, and killed 17 people--14 students and 3 members of the faculty. It is not the first, by any means. Ten years before it, at Northern Illinois University, a gunman killed five there and injured many others. The list goes on and on and on.  This gunman who went into Parkland, FL, wasn't carrying a handgun. He was carrying an AR-15. It is a semiautomatic weapon that he was able to embellish with a high-capacity magazine that could kill 30 people at a time.[[Page S1721]]  Why? Why on Earth would that man, 19 years of age, be allowed to buy a weapon that was created to be used by the military--a military assault weapon, a weapon that sometimes our police may need, but hardly ever an individual American could need or want to buy for a legitimate sporting or hunting purpose?  But he did, and 17 were dead after that rampage.  There has been a lot of reaction to that--more than I expected, I will be honest with you, because mass killings have become way too common in Something happened there--something we saw across America today. High school students in that high school came out and said: Enough, we are fed up with the laws of this land and the politicians who refuse to change them. We are fed up with the fear that comes with just going to school in We are fed up with those who say the Second Amendment requires us to live in fear.  They have marched in towns across America today. They have marched on They have come to my office and visited with me. I believe they have become a major force in the national debate. I commend them. I encourage them. I hope they will continue.  What can we do? You know, politics is tough. It ain't beanbag, as they used to say. There are forces like the National Rifle Association and the gun lobby that threaten the political existence of Members of Congress if they vote the wrong way. I know they came after me when I was a Member of the They almost got me. It was a tough election year. I managed to survive it, but they poured money in and tried to beat me. I have never had their support since, and that is OK with me. But for a lot of Members of Congress, they are just not willing to risk it, not willing to anger the National Rifle  Do you remember when President Trump had the meeting 2 weeks ago? He called in the students and parents and others. He let the cameras roll, and they continued the meeting so America could witness it. He admonished the Members of Congress there: Don't be scared of the National Rifle Don't be petrified by the We have to do something.  President Trump came out for universal background checks. In a way, it is not a very bold and courageous position because 97 percent of the American people agree with it. Even gun owners agree with the premise that we should do everything in our power to have a background check to keep guns out of the hands of convicted felons and mentally unstable people. The President came out for that 2 weeks ago, and he also said: Why in the world do we let someone 19 years of age buy a military assault weapon? We don't need these assault weapons.  I thought to myself: What a break; here is a Republican President who is finally standing up to the gun lobby and supporting positions that are overwhelmingly supported by the American people.  My fellow Senator who is now presiding over the Senate has shown that on a bipartisan fashion we can move forward on universal background checks. He came together with Senator Manchin of West Virginia on a measure that I supported and one that I think we should revisit. I felt so encouraged 2 weeks ago.  Well, what has happened since? That group left the White House and a couple of days later, the National Rifle Association came in for lunch and the President reversed his position. It is nothing new. I saw him do exactly the same thing on DACA and He reversed his position and now, instead of universal background checks that will keep guns out of the hands of those who would misuse them, they are supporting a bill that is good but is not all we need, called Fix NICS, which fills some of the information in the background checks for purchasing firearms.  The 17 lives in that high school in Parkland, FL, are worth more than this weak response by President Trump and by some in We must do better.  Let me tell you that the issue here is more than just the safety of high schools. A few weeks ago--in fact, a day before the shooting in Parkland, FL--an amazing member of the Chicago Police Department, Commander Paul Bauer, was downtown for a training session and heard on his radio an alert that there was a fugitive escaping. Being a man of duty, he responded to join in the pursuit and was cornered in a stairwell by a man who pulled out a gun with a high-capacity magazine, shot him six times, and killed him right in that stairwell. This was an amazing police officer with a great wife and daughter, from Bridgeport, in the city of Our whole city was in grief over that loss.  They tried to figure out where the gun came from? Where did that criminal get that gun? It was purchased legally outside Madison, It was then sold, without a background check, to another person who, in turn, sold it on the internet with no background check to a person with a record of felony arrests and convictions. It completely defied the system and made the argument again, sadly, of why universal background checks--not just at Federal licensed dealers but also at gun shows and on the internet--are absolutely essential. The Fix NICS bill does not solve that problem. We must solve that problem.  Secondly, on the military assault weapons, today at the Senate Judiciary Committee, we talked about the impact of an assault weapon and a bullet that is fired. Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, who has followed this terrible incident in Parkland and has spoken out so eloquently, reminded us that firing a bullet in a handgun may mean that that bullet passes through your body and injures an organ. Firing a long gun, a rifle, or a semiautomatic weapon like the AR-15 does dramatically more damage. The bullet may enter your body in a small way, but it comes out on the other side with a wound the size of an orange and, in the process, tumbles through your body, ripping through tissue, ripping through arteries, ripping through organs, and creating a situation that is difficult and sometimes impossible to repair.  Why would anyone need a weapon like that? You sure don't need it to go hunting. If you need an AR-15 to go shoot a deer, for goodness sakes, you ought to stick to fishing. You obviously don't have the skill necessary. To own it just to own it? Some do. They are collectors, I imagine. But opening those sales to 18-, 19-, or 20-year-olds makes no sense whatsoever, and that is what the students from Parkland and around the country are saying today. I couldn't agree with them more.  As for high-capacity magazines, why do you need 30 rounds? Why do you need 60 rounds? What is that all about? It is being used in weapons that are designed to kill other human beings--not just a few, but many.  As for bump stocks, I never heard of a bump stock until a few months ago, when the Las Vegas mass shooting occurred, killing innocent people at a country and western concert. We have banned machine guns in America for decades. Well, leave it to the firearm manufacturers. They found a way to create a mechanism that takes a semiautomatic weapon--meaning that you have to pull the trigger each time for each round--and turns it essentially into an automatic weapon, where you can hold the trigger and use the recoil and it just sprays the bullets until you empty the magazine, with something called a bump stock.  I can't imagine why we haven't just flat out passed a bill to ban bump stocks after what happened in Las Vegas, but this Congress, this Senate is frozen by the gun lobby.  All across America today, young people are stepping up. I asked a teacher, ",CREC-2018-03-14-pt1-PgS1696-4.txt,326,1600,2018.0,14.0,January

1117,topic-id,1311,"Mr.President, this afternoon there is going to be a vote on the Senate floor which is of historic importance. It is rare that I use those words to describe what is going on in the Senate It is equally rare for us to actually take up an issue and debate it in this Chamber, but this afternoon we will face a critical vote.  I can recall, as can most Members, many votes we have cast in the course of service in Congress, both in the House and the Senate, but the votes that cause loss of sleep and worry, time and again, are votes involving war. You see, part of my responsibility in the Senate, shared by my colleagues, under article I, section 8, is to actually vote to decide whether the United States of America shall go to war.  The Founding Fathers were explicit. They wanted to give to Congress that responsibility so Members of Congress could represent their constituents--House districts and States--whom we all represent. That created an opportunity--in effect, an obligation--for us to really measure this grievous, important, historic decision against the feelings of the families who would be asked to support a war with their tax dollars or with the lives of people they love.  I can recall, back in 2001, what occurred on 9/11. Those of us alive on that date will never forget it, but I also recall that a year later we faced a decision right here in the Senate Chamber about whether, as a result of 9/11, we would go to war against Iraq and  There was a long debate about whether we should invade If you will remember, the leaders of the government told us there were weapons of mass destruction which threatened the region and the world, including the United States, and if we didn't move into Iraq and take out Saddam Hussein in his capacity, we would leave the United States in danger.  The debate went on for a long period of time, and the final vote was cast in the early morning hours in October of 2002. I remember it well and, for reasons I can't explain, I stayed on the floor after the vote. There were only two or three Members of the Senate still here. It was one of those moments where we had voted to go to war and weren't certain about what the next step would be. There were 23 of us--1 Republican and 22 Democrats--who voted against the invasion of I think it was one of the most important votes I ever cast.  The representations about weapons of mass destruction turned out to be false. We had no intelligence to back up that assertion. Yet that was the reason we were off to war. Well, here we are, some 16 years later, still engaged in a war in I don't believe there is a single Member of the Senate who that night cast a vote for the invasion of that country who believed that 16 years later we would still be engaged in a war in  Subsequently, there was a vote on the invasion of It was a different circumstance. We believed Afghanistan had literally been the sourcing point for the terrorists who struck us on 9/11 and killed 3,000 innocent The argument made by the administration was, no one can do that to the United States of America without paying a price. I joined the overwhelming bipartisan majority supporting the invasion of Afghanistan to go after Osama bin Laden and al- I voted against invading I voted for the invasion of I can tell you, I would never ever have been able to stand here and say, with any certainty, that 16 years later, we would still be engaged in a war in Afghanistan, but we are.  The obvious question to ask is, In 16 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan and other places in the world, how many other times has the United States and the House of Representatives come together to debate the wisdom of a decision about continuing a war or declaring a war? The answer is none--not once.  For 16 years, we have been observers and bystanders, through Presidents of both political parties, and the Congress has stood by and observed military action being taken all over the world.  Brown University did a survey called the Costs of War Project and recently published data saying that the United States fought terror in 76 countries, between October 2015 and October 2017, using its own troops and bases, through training of host country counterterrorism forces or through drone and air strikes.  In 76 different countries, we are engaged in military operations. How often has the Senate or the House come together to debate the wisdom or to even question whether those military actions were authorized? I think none. Perhaps someone could point to one, but I can't think of one time we have done it.  This afternoon is going to be different because we are being asked, as Members of the Senate, whether we are going to exercise our constitutional authority and responsibility when it comes to an ongoing war in a country most Americans couldn't find on a map--the country of  Yemen now is embroiled in a civil war and an invasion by Saudi Arabia, and we are part of that military operation. There has been no vote in the U.Senate on those military activities. There is a loose connection to al-Qaida, which was referenced in the invasion of Afghanistan, as a rationalization for going after this terrorist operation now being found in Yemen, but there is more to that war in Yemen than just the presence of al-There is an ongoing surrogate battle between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the United States is engaged. I believe we are engaged because of our friendship with Saudi Arabia; some have argued because we sold them the planes we are now refueling.  At the very least, we ought to bring this case to the American people. That is our constitutional responsibility, and that is why this vote is important: Because we took an oath--each of us--when we became Senators, to uphold the Constitution of the United States against enemies foreign and domestic. That Constitution says the people of the United States--the ones I represent in Illinois, the ones who are represented in Oregon or in Texas--are going to have a voice in this decision through us, through our debate, through our decision.  I thank the Senators who have brought this matter to the floor today: Mr.Lee, a Republican Senator from the State of Utah; Mr.Sanders, a Democratic Senator from Vermont; and Mr.Murphy, another Democratic Senator, from I have joined in cosponsoring this effort. It really is going to put us to a test to justify what we are doing in Yemen today.  What is happening in Yemen has been characterized by the United Nations as the worst humanitarian crisis in the world--and that is saying something. Some 8 million people are dying of famine in Yemen because of this war. Some 16 million are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance immediately.  This is no skirmish. This is not just an exchange of fire. This is carnage and destruction the likes of which the world has never seen, and we are part of it. If we are part of it and should be part of it, then we should make that decision as a Senate and a House of Representatives, as the Constitution requires, but going to the bleachers, standing by the sidelines, and watching more and more military operations take place around the world without asserting our constitutional responsibility is a mistake. That is why I have cosponsored this measure this afternoon and look forwarding to voting for it to move forward.  I yield the floor.

Mark's commitment to the town of Normal can be seen in every corner of the city, and that work will not be forgotten.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-15-pt1-PgS1763-2.txt,326,1600,2018.0,15.0,March

Ideal told me that, if the credit union could return to a more normal, reasonable processing time, their members would be better served and the process would be more efficient.  My colleague from Colorado has heard similar examples from his constituents, too. That is why he introduced the TAILOR Act, to change the way agencies regulate our small town financial institutions that are telling us time and time again they need relief.  Representative Tipton's legislation will direct the Federal regulatory agencies responsible for regulating our local Main Street financial institutions to consider a few factors when they are regulating, such as the impact their actions have on the ability of banks and credit unions to serve their customers, the risk profile and business models of the institutions they regulate, and the necessity and appropriateness of the regulations they are imposing.

2029,topic-id,350,"Mr.President, today I wish to honor and recognize the outstanding service of Mark Booth on his retirement after 31 years of public service at the Congressional Budget Mark's expertise as a forecaster and modeler has made him an invaluable contributor to CBO's analysis of the budget outlook. Since 2003, Mark has been chief of the revenue estimating unit of CBO's tax analysis division, overseeing its forecasts of tax revenues and cost estimates of legislative proposals.  Mark came to CBO in 1986 from the private sector, where he began his career as a forecaster and analyst. He took over responsibility for CBO's corporate income tax projections and quickly demonstrated his analytic skills. As a result, Mark's portfolio continuously expanded, as he soon also became the lead analyst for CBO's projections of individual income taxes and Federal Reserve System's earnings. In addition, Mark joined the tax analysis division's cost-estimating team, overseeing assistant analysts to produce timely estimates of legislative proposals. Over those years, Mark won the CBO Director's Award for Exceptional Service, the agency's highest recognition for work by a CBO staffer, twice.  In recognition of Mark's abilities and breadth of experience, he was promoted to the position of unit chief for revenue estimating in 2003, and he has overseen the division's projections and cost estimates ever since. As head of the revenue estimating unit, Mark has led his staff in providing high-quality and timely projections of revenues and analysis of budget issues. Mark has made valuable contributions to numerous reports, testimonies, and cost estimates in just about every subject area covered by CBO, including the economy, energy, transportation, and healthcare. He also has served a crucial role in trying to make CBO's analysis more transparent, preparing several background papers that describe CBO's methods of forecasting revenues and evaluate the agency's projections record.  I know my colleagues join me in extending our thanks and appreciation to Mark for his service to our We wish him well in his retirement from CBO and hope he will continue in future years to lend his expertise to the analysis of important tax policy issues.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-15-pt1-PgS1763-3.txt,1542,FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION FAIRNESS AND REFORM ACT,2018.0,15.0,January

677,topic-id,653,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss the positive impact the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will have on Iowa farmers.  Of course, our Iowa agricultural economy is really important, and those men and women who are serving as farmers, ranchers, and growers in the State of Iowa mean the world to me, coming from a farm my family had in Southwest  We all understand this has been a very challenging time for farmers in our rural communities. The community I come from in Southwest Iowa has just 10,000 people in our county. Many of them have faced the challenges of the economic downturn. Since their peaks in 2012, corn prices have declined by 60 percent and soybean prices have declined by 47 percent. My neighbors are hurting, folks. Farm income has nearly been cut in half since 2013.  A lot of our producers are hurting, especially our young and beginning farmers who have gotten their start just in maybe the last 10 years or so, but, fortunately for our farmers, our ranchers, and our growers, tax relief is on its way. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will provide sweeping tax cuts for farmers and rural communities, allowing our producers to keep more of those hard-earned dollars.  About 95 percent of farms are organized as passthrough businesses, such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corps. These businesses are taxed under individual tax rules and will benefit from lower tax rates for every income bracket. On top of that, they will see significant relief through a new 20-percent deduction on passthrough business income. The law also provides relief from the costly individual mandate which forced many farmers to choose between buying an expensive ObamaCare plan through their State exchange or being fined.  Now, just a couple of years ago, I remember a very intense conversation I had with a beginning farmer in Northeast When he was purchasing his insurance through the State exchange, the cost had more than doubled. He was shaking he was so upset about it, and he explained to me the additional cost of that individual policy was his truck payment. There was no room in his budget for the additional cost of that insurance policy so he had to make that choice: Do I purchase through the individual exchange or do I make my truck payment? Fortunately, within this bill, we have that relief. He can make that choice, and the choice is his on whether he makes that truck payment and forgoes the insurance or whether now he can do without that type of insurance and not be fined because he was too poor to afford it.  In addition, the bill dramatically expands section 179 expensing and allows 5 years of 100 bonus depreciation. Both of these changes will foster much needed investment in farms throughout  The law also preserves a number of important tax provisions for farmers, including the interest deduction, cash accounting, and the use of like-kind exchanges for property.  Last, but certainly not least, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubles the Federal estate tax exemption while preserving the stepped-up basis. The death tax can have a devastating impact on family farms. Over 90 percent of farm assets cannot be sold easily without losing value. Especially as we continue to experience a downturn in that ag economy, family farmers are sometimes left with no choice but to sell land or the equipment they use to farm that land when they are forced to pay that tax.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a big step in the right direction for agriculture. I am thankful to the President for his leadership and to my colleagues in the Senate and the House for helping get this long-needed bill done. On behalf of agriculture, thank you.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

Our theme tonight is the history of the CBC and the legacy of Martin Luther Next week we begin the celebration of the birthday of Reverend Martin Luther  King was not only a great man but a great patriot, who loved America and the ideas of the underpinning of our democracy.  To kick off our discussion, I want to open up with two King comments that really capture our current political climate and what is at stake. The first quote is: ``We may have come over here on different ships, but we are all in the same boat now.''  The second quote is: ``Of all forms of inequality, injustice in healthcare is the most shocking and inhumane.'' Martin Luther  When we think about this great Nation and our leaders before us like King, who came together to lay a framework for equal pay, fair wages, healthcare, equality in housing, so much more we are reminded of what is at stake and how much we have to lose in this current political climate. We have a lot to lose under the current administration's destructive policies.  King would be greatly disappointed at many things going on in this country right now that affects all of our communities.  We are in the business of doing no harm, but we must continue to fight to show results and solutions to help move our neighborhoods forward. King fought to move our neighborhoods forward when the odds were stacked against him. There are many examples of his life, legacy, and lasting impact in the city of Philadelphia, which is in the Second Congressional  Take, for example, the King memorial and mural at 40th and Lancaster Avenue--he had a rally of 10,000 people when King was there--and the yearly luncheon that the late Delores Tucker sponsored in honor of Martin Luther  It is important to recognize his connection to Pennsylvania and the divinity school in Chester in Delaware  King came many times to the city of Philadelphia and to the Commonwealth of He had a huge influence on a lot of us.  On this April 4, 50 years later, when I was in junior high school, entering high school in 1968, he had a huge affect on me. He was someone who walked with kings and queens.

I remember that opportunity when I was down in Alabama on that Edmund Pettus Bridge--along with him and my good friend and colleague from Alabama, Terri Sewell--that I thought to myself, I said: ``Self, here I am with Congressman Lewis.''

They are very serious issues.  But as I seek to tie together last week's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order with tonight's theme, it is important to remember that, when the Kerner Commission report was issued, and even today, Black women had to deal with racism and, add to that, sexism.

1573,topic-id,752,"Mr.President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator Capito, to introduce the Stopping Suspicious Orders of Opioids  In 2016, the opioid epidemic caused more than 42,000 deaths in the United  In 2017, this epidemic was declared a public health emergency.  Now, more than 400 State, local, and Tribal governments have filed suits (some consolidated, some individual) against opioid manufacturers and distributors for their alleged roles in fueling and perpetuating this devastating crisis. The U.Justice Department, or DOJ, has filed a statement of interest in these lawsuits, which are currently pending.  As our Nation struggles to effectively address the opioid epidemic, one thing is clear: there is no silver bullet.  Yet, it is also clear that law enforcement can play a critical role in preventing and reducing overdose deaths.  That is why we must ensure that law enforcement has and uses the necessary tools to hold opioid manufacturers, distributors and others accountable when they fail to properly disclose to the Drug Enforcement Administration, or the DEA, opioid orders that are suspicious because of their size, frequency, or patterns. This simple disclosure could prevent millions of prescription opioid pills from ending up on the black market.  Unfortunately, current law has inadvertently created a standard that is too high for DOJ to meet in order to take immediate action against those who fail to make these disclosures to the DEA or who fail to adequately protect against diversion.  For instance, the DEA has told my staff that under current law, in order to immediately stop a drug manufacturer or distributor from distributing opioids, a pharmacy from dispensing opioids, or a practitioner from prescribing opioids, it must prove that the distribution, dispensation, or prescription of the drugs directly resulted in an immediate and substantial likelihood that death, serious bodily harm, or abuse of a controlled substance occurred.  For this reason, the bill Senator Capito and I are introducing today would change the standard in current law to make it easier to immediately stop potentially dangerous shipments of prescription opioids. It would allow DOJ to take action when it can demonstrate that an opioid manufacturer or distributor's lack of control over a prescription opioid would likely result in the drugs winding up in the hands of someone other than the intended recipient or on the black market.  This change will compel opioid manufacturers and distributors to be more vigilant in their efforts to report and stop the delivery of suspicious orders of opioids as well as to protect against diversion. In the absence of such vigilance, our bill would allow DOJ to immediately stop the delivery of opioids.  Our bill further ensures that bad actors are held accountable by establishing backstops and consequences for when opioid manufacturers, distributors, dispensers, and prescribers fail to take corrective action.  Under current law, if there is no immediate threat to the public health or safety, opioid manufacturers, distributors, dispensers and prescribers can submit a corrective action plan to DOJ before their registrations can be revoked or suspended. DOJ does not have to accept this plan, but if it does, current law does not outline a timeframe by which the plan must be fully implemented or consequences for failure to do so.  Given the magnitude of the opioid epidemic, this is unacceptable.  That is why our bill would require those who manufacture, distribute, dispense or prescribe opioids to fully implement any plan that is accepted by DOJ within 30 days. Failure to do so will result in the immediate suspension of a registration until the reinstated proceedings to deny, revoke, or suspend the registration permanently have concluded.  Mr.President, I have been struck by the seemingly countless examples of opioid manufacturers and distributors that have done little to safeguard[[Page S1767]]against diversion that have been raised in hearings, roundtables, and in the news over the last several years.  The example most often cited is that of Kermit, West Virginia, where, over a two year period nine million opioids were delivered to a single pharmacy. Between 2007 and 2012, 780 million oxycodone and hydrocodone pills were delivered to pharmacies throughout that state. This resulted in 1,728 fatal overdoses that were largely preventable.  We cannot allow this to happen again.  The bill Senator Capito and I are introducing today will strengthen current law by providing law enforcement with the additional tools it needs to better and more proactively combat the opioid epidemic and hold bad actors accountable.  I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important legislation.

1823,topic-id,579,"Mr.President, I rise to participate in the discussion on the conflict in  In 2015, I received a phone call from a Saudi official informing me that the kingdom was about to take military action in The official said the conflict would not last long. They would launch airstrikes to push the Houthis out of Sana'a, restore Hadi to power, and broker a political compromise. That was nearly 3 years ago, and the conflict has since grown into the world's worst humanitarian disaster.  More than 10,000 civilians have died, and more than 40,000 have been wounded. More than half of Yemen's healthcare facilities have been destroyed. Three-quarters of the population--almost 22 million people--need humanitarian assistance. Eleven million require urgent assistance to survive, which means they are close to starvation.  The situation for children is especially dire: 1.8 million children under the age of 5 are malnourished. Of that, more than 400,000 are so malnourished that they are now 10 times more likely to die.  On top of the bloodshed and famine, the people of Yemen are facing a horrific outbreak of cholera. More than 1 million cases of cholera have been reported, potentially the worst cholera outbreak in world history. More than 2,200 people have died from it, almost one-third of whom are children. Cholera has spread because more than 80 percent of the population lack clean drinking water.  We can't turn away from suffering because we are a party to this conflict. The United States is providing intelligence, military advice, logistical support, and aerial refueling to Saudi The fact is, we are enabling a major proxy war between Saudi Arabia and  We do all that despite there being no military solution. This has not been a brief war. It has turned into a major war that must end. The longer we permit suffering to continue, the more innocent men, women, and children are going to die. Instead of facilitating endless fighting, we should be pushing for reconciliation.  I have personally urged Saudi and Iranian officials to meet to discuss their differences. To my great disappointment, they have refused to do so. Iran is expanding its influence across the Middle It continues to arm Hezbollah, back President Assad in Syria, and support the Saudi Arabia and its partners will not back down. Just last week, Crown Prince Salman said his nation would pursue the same nuclear capabilities as What does that say to us?  Their fight in Yemen offers no military solution. Only a political resolution will end this miserable war.  It is time we separate ourselves from this bloodshed. The United States must make it clear that we will not continue to support unending conflict. That is why I support the Sanders-Lee resolution, which would require the United States to stop refueling Saudi and Emirati aircraft.  Now, this seems like just a small step, and it certainly will not immediately end the war, but it is a deeply symbolic one. This resolution will send a clear message that we will no longer enable this proxy war.  There is no reason a diplomatic solution can't be found to end this violence, and a strong push for reconciliation will save the lives of thousands upon thousands of men, women, and children in Yemen, but that peace is only achievable if we speak with one voice and pass the Sanders-Lee resolution, otherwise we will continue to enable this barbaric war.

1989,topic-id,571,"Mr.President, today I wish to speak on the important topic of women's health, which has been under attack by the Trump administration.  Through its policies and the actions of its officials, the Trump administration has undermined women's health at every opportunity.  In the first year of the Trump administration, we have seen attempts to block access to Planned Parenthood, restrict women's access to birth control, legislation to ban certain medical procedures, the creation of new government offices to undermine women's healthcare, and judges nominated who openly oppose women's privacy rights.  Scott Lloyd, the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, ORR, is the perfect illustration of this deeply disturbing trend.  Federal court documents and extensive media reports show that Mr.Lloyd has used his official office to prevent unaccompanied minors at ORR shelters from accessing legally available reproductive healthcare.  In one case, a 17-year-old young woman, referred to as Jane Doe, was transferred to an ORR shelter after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. While in government custody, Jane Doe discovered she was pregnant and sought access to an abortion. She satisfied all requirements under Texas law and secured her own funds to pay for the procedure. In spite of this, ORR officials repeatedly blocked her from accessing care. Jane Doe went to court and was granted approval to obtain the procedure. Nevertheless, the Trump administration's Department of Justice cruelly appealed the decision, alleging that the government has an interest in blocking her personal decision.  Since Jane Doe's case, it has been uncovered that Trump administration officials have directly intervened in other similar cases. There are reports that Mr.Lloyd has denied young women access to their lawyers. Additionally, he has implemented policies that violate young women's medical privacy rights. It is also concerning that, as someone with no medical expertise or training, Mr.Lloyd has personally pressured young women about their medical options. In court documents, Mr.Lloyd acknowledged that he has never approved a request for the procedure and even admitted that he has denied such requests in the cases of rape victims. This is shocking, particularly considering that many of the young women who come into ORR custody have fled sexual and gender-based violence in their home countries.  On top of that, some of these young women go through harrowing experiences along their journey to the United States, during which they are at risk of being trafficked, kidnapped, and raped. Blocking them from making their own determinations about their health and bodies only adds to the trauma they have already experienced.  In light of Mr.Lloyd's shocking actions, I have called on him to resign.  I find it appalling that the Trump administration believes women--undocumented or otherwise--do not have the right to control their own bodies and make their own healthcare decisions. Young women do not lose their right to make their own healthcare decisions just because they are in government custody.  ORR is responsible for protecting the well-being of the most vulnerable people: those who have been tortured, children who arrive in the country alone and without a parent, and individuals fleeing persecution.  It is imperative that the leader of this office uphold this mission, rather than advancing his own personal, political agenda. We have an obligation to treat young women in government custody with the dignity and respect they deserve.  The Trump administration needs to stop attacking women and start recognizing their right to control their own bodies, medical decisions, and destiny.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-19-pt1-PgS1786.txt,1332,HONORING OFFICER RYAN MORTON,2018.0,19.0,January

The University of California is also a national leader in scientific discovery and medical advancement, enabling transformational solutions for healthcare and the environment, enhancing our Nation's defense while reducing the global threat from terrorism, and addressing other emerging national security and energy challenges. It established itself in the fields of nuclear physics and biotechnology, revolutionized agriculture, and helped the movie industry mature, all of which are now multi-billion-dollar industries.

Mr.Speaker, one of the reasons that tax reform was so important to me, and one of the things that I campaigned so hard for is growing up in a community where we lost our manufacturing backbone, where we lost our job base.  We saw families just begin to lose everything. They began to lose their homes, their cars, their small family businesses. We saw a generation move away from our communities to look for better opportunities because the jobs simply weren't there.  I know that every single job is important. So every time that we are able to do something in this great Nation to create the environment, where this is the best place on the planet to do business, and we can grow jobs, it is good for our communities; it is good for our friends; it is good for our families; it is good for our neighbors. It makes our community stronger.  One of the things about tax reform that is so important to remember is not simply about lowering the rates, but it is about helping American families, because now companies are now making decisions based on their employees and what is best for their bottom line, not arcane provisions that exist in the Tax  So every time that I hear someone from the other side say, ``All we did was give a tax break,'' I think it is being disingenuous. I think, quite candidly, it shows a lack of willingness to dig down into what this tax reform is really about; and that is changing how American companies operate so they can be very competitive on the world stage, so that they can make this place the greatest place in the world to do business and hire more of our friends and our family members, your neighbors, in the best-paying jobs on the planet.

The benefits are clearly more than just crumbs. They are meaningful to every single family.  I think one of the things that I see--and I am beginning to see more and more of--is not just simply that an employee is getting a bigger paycheck, which is great, but that enthusiasm that they have; because not only are they being rewarded for the job well done, but they are now seeing new opportunities because of growing businesses that they never had before.  It is exciting and it is wonderful to see our friends, our family, and our neighbors, the people who we care about, who we represent, being affected in a positive way.

Sergeant Lonnie ``Calvin'' Allen,  Today, Mr.President, I will recall the life and service of Sergeant Lonnie ``Calvin'' Allen, Jr., a native of Bellevue,  Calvin grew up in a military family. His father, Lonnie Allen, Sr., was a senior master sergeant in the Air When Lonnie was assigned to Offutt Air Force Base in Bellevue, both he and his wife Sallie thought they would be there only for a short time. However, they enjoyed ``the good life,'' and soon after the birth of their two sons, Nuru and Calvin, they decided to stay.  As a young child, Calvin spent much of his time in the kitchen. His mother still talks about how Calvin learned to cook at the age of 5. Sallie has vivid memories of Calvin in the kitchen in the early mornings or on the weekends, experimenting with new recipes or dishes. There were times when she would still be in bed and Calvin would bring her food or a new dish to try. She said that he was always open to trying new things, whether it was in the kitchen or elsewhere. This also pertained to sports, where Calvin played basketball and football, ran track, and wrestled.  Calvin also had a caring attitude, which extended to church on Calvin was widely known amongst the congregation at Mount Carmel Baptist Church in He often volunteered to be an usher and displayed his musical talent in the choir. Calvin had a personal and very open relationship with God, and he happily shared it with everyone he met.  Throughout his high school years at Bellevue East, Calvin spent much of his time with friends and family. Sallie recalled many video game parties and sleepovers at their house, which would end with many of Calvin's friends sprawled out on the Allen living room floor.  Calvin was a member of a close-knit family who spent time playing games together. Whether it was card games or board games, the competitive spirit would always come out in the Allen boys. They loved to compete.  After graduating from Bellevue East in 1998, Calvin enrolled at Northeastern Junior College in Sterling, CO, to study criminal justice. He long envisioned a career in law enforcement and thought this would be a good starting point for him to launch his career.  After completing 2 years at Northeastern, Calvin enrolled at Colorado State to finish his criminal justice degree. Soon after enrolling at Colorado State, however, he returned home to Calvin's vehicle had been involved in a wreck, which left him without any means of transportation. Due to this, he enlisted in the Army as a way to pay for a new vehicle, while also pursuing his law enforcement career while serving his country. Sallie still laughs about the fact that Calvin returned to Nebraska due to a wrecked car. Although many expected he would follow in his dad's footsteps by enlisting in the Air Force, Sallie knew better. Calvin wanted to pave his own road in the  Following his enlistment, Calvin soon shipped off to Fort Benning to complete his One Station Unit Training for the infantry. Shortly after graduation, he was assigned to a station in It was in Germany where Calvin met his wife, Brigit, a German native. After dating for some time, Calvin was assigned to Fort Drum in New York as part of the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Infantry, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Brigit came with him to New York, where they wed in 2004.  Shortly after their marriage, Calvin served in Iraq for the first time, and Brigit moved to Bellevue to be closer to Calvin's family while he was deployed. After a brief stint at home, he deployed to Iraq for a second time. In August of 2005, Calvin was stationed near  During Sergeant Allen's second deployment, patrols became increasingly dangerous. At the time, the Baghdad area experienced a large increase in suicide bombings and sectarian fighting. On May 18, 2006, while on patrol in Baghdad, Sergeant Allen's Humvee was struck by an improvised explosive device, killing him and three other servicemembers.  Sergeant Allen's memorial service was held at the Capehart Chapel in Over 500 people attended the standing-room-only ceremony to pay their respects, including over 200 Patriot Riders, who lined up with American flags. Calvin was laid to rest on May 30, 2006, in Arlington National Cemetery--the day after Memorial  Fellow friend and Air Force Bill Eckley talked about how Calvin was a man of honor.

As a 14-year FBI special agent, including significant time as a counterterrorism agent, I am an eyewitness to the importance of this program and the deliberate and lawful manner in which it is used.  The fact is, section 702 is a critical tool that the intelligence community uses properly to target non-U.persons located outside of the United States to acquire information that is vital to our Nation's security.  Equally as important, this crucial program has operated under strict rules and has been carefully overseen by all three branches of our government to protect the privacy and civil liberties of all  As we have seen, both in our country and abroad, proper surveillance and law enforcement is vital to protect us against terror attacks, especially lone attacker scenarios. As terror groups like ISIS continue to lose territory in Iraq and Syria, our intelligence community has warned that we will see more of these one-off attacks as opposed to more traditional conspiracies.  At a hearing of the Homeland Security Committee, I asked FBI Director Chris Wray about this program as part of our national security posture. He said, despite the high volume of threats, there are few dots that can actually be connected in regard to these ``more loosely organized situations.'' Information already lawfully obtained by the FBI is crucial in, as he said, understanding ``which threats are real and which ones are more aspirational.''  Section 702 allows the national security professionals to query information to determine whether a tip from State or local law enforcement or others is credible, and it begins the process of marshalling resources to head off potential threats.  Allowing section 702 to expire would leave America vulnerable at a time when we need this protection the most. As Director Wray clearly stated: ``If 702 is walked back, we will be . . . starting to rebuild the wall that existed before 9/11.''

A recent report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, entitled, ``DHS' Controls Over Firearms and Other Sensitive Assets,'' found that, between fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2016, personnel from DHS and its components misplaced a total of 2,142 highly sensitive assets, including 228 firearms and 1,889 badges.[[Page H51]]  DHS is charged with the safety of our Nation and its citizens. The OIG report indicates that not only are there some DHS personnel not being held accountable for failing to safeguard their sensitive assets, they are also not receiving proper training on how to properly safeguard and keep track of such equipment. Given the importance of DHS' mission, this is unacceptable, Mr. H.4433 follows the OIG's recommendations and requires DHS' Under Secretary for Management to promulgate a departmentwide directive to DHS personnel aimed at achieving adequate security over DHS firearms and other sensitive assets. H.4433 mandates that this directive include descriptions of what equipment is classified as a sensitive asset, requirements for securing Department-issued sensitive assets, and recordkeeping requirements for reporting lost or stolen firearms and other assets.  H.4433 also requires DHS to update its Personal Property Asset Management Program Manual to include procedures and training on how to safeguard assets, both on and off duty, in accordance with the directive.

However, this is not the time for finger-pointing; this is a time for healing, and, more importantly, this is a time for action.  We were elected to Congress not to hide from tough decisions, not to be afraid to tackle tough problems. Mr.Speaker, we were elected to lead, and lead we must.

Keeping our communities safe and protecting the Second Amendment are not mutually exclusive concepts. We can advance both and preserve both simultaneously. All we need to do, Mr.Speaker, is be willing to do what every American wants us to do, which is put away ideology and come together in a bipartisan fashion.

We said: Never again.  I am calling on my colleagues to have the same response to school shootings: Never again.  Mr.Speaker, the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, of which I am a proud member, has developed a well-thought-out list of 10 legislative proposals that help us achieve this goal, to protect our kids, to say never again to this needless violence.

60,topic-id,1707,"Mr.President, over the past couple of months, we have seen a lot of effort with regard to immigration reform and in particular to address the situation of the so-called DACA kids, the Dreamers who were brought here through no fault of their own and are now protected--many of them--through the DACA But those protections will run out on March 5. In fact, some have lost their protections already. So there is a great impetus and urgency to deal with this program.  I have said from the beginning that in order to establish a long-term resolution and to provide regulatory certainty, a true DACA fix must be a bipartisan solution. Over the past year, the two big items this Chamber and the Congress have dealt with--healthcare reform and tax policy--have been done under rules of reconciliation, meaning that if we could get a bare majority of Republican votes, that would be enough, if we could keep all the Republicans together. That is no longer the case with our approach to We are not under rules of reconciliation. It will require 60 votes, meaning that only a bipartisan solution will do. That is why I have been working on such a measure with my Republican and Democratic colleagues in Congress, as well as the White  As I have said repeatedly, on this issue, I believe that the President's instincts are better than some of the advice that he gets. I truly believe that he does want a solution for these young immigrants. I hope we can get there. We will have a meeting tomorrow at the White House--a bipartisan meeting--to try to get a little farther down the road.  Let me stress that a lot of words that are highly charged are thrown around this immigration debate. No word is perhaps more highly charged than the word ``amnesty.'' That has been thrown around by a number of my colleagues. I would suggest that is not the case here with the DACA kids. Amnesty, by definition, is an unconditional pardon for a breach of law. I don't think a child who was brought across the border by the parents has committed a violation of the law--not the child; certainly the parents but not the child. To provide relief for those kids and to allow them to stay in the only country they know I don't think should be called amnesty. Yet that highly charged word is often used. To suggest that anyone pursuing a bipartisan solution is proposing amnesty I think is misleading, and it sets back the cause of trying to fix the situation.  A proposal that we are drafting--this bipartisan group--offers a pathway to citizenship for only a specific group of young immigrants--as I mentioned, those who were brought here through no fault of their own. These are immigrants who are serving in the military, who are seeking education, who are holding good jobs. They will be required to continue to do so before they[[Page S63]]can have a chance to earn citizenship. As for the parents of these young immigrants, nobody can deny the fact that they did break the law, and any bipartisan proposal on DACA cannot and will not reward them for this behavior.  I agree with the President when he said that dealing with DACA is a very difficult subject but that we must do so with heart. I believe that has been the case for those in this Chamber who have tried for 16 years to get a solution for these kids.  We have to prioritize border security measures, obviously, to determine which ones are sensible to include in a DACA measure. We will go beyond simply dealing with these DACA kids with some border security measures, but we have to find out which ones are sensible and make sense to include in this limited measure and table those that should be considered for the future.  I have been part of comprehensive immigration reform efforts in the past. I look forward to being part of comprehensive immigration reform efforts later this year, but this is not that. We have a very specific purpose to achieve before the 5th of The commitment we got was to have a bipartisan bill on the Senate floor by January 31. I believe we need to have that in order to have enough runway to get this done by March 5.  The White House, after much urging on our part, finally sent a list over as to what should be considered part of the border security plan. As I mentioned, many of these items need to be addressed. Maybe all of the items need to be addressed, but they need to be addressed as part of a larger, more comprehensive effort, not the limited fix we are going to do before March 5. I am all in when it comes to comprehensive immigration reform. I look forward to that debate. But we have to understand that we can't do it all before March 5 if we are going to protect these kids.  Some will say: Well, we get to March 5, if we can't do it, then we just kick the can down the road again with some other protection.  I think the courts have made it clear that what was done prior to this--the DACA Program itself--was not constitutional, and should we simply say we are going to extend that program now, it would be found unconstitutional by the courts. This is a real deadline, and we have to meet it. We have to focus specifically on protecting these DACA recipients. I think Republicans, Democrats, and the President all want this. The question is, Are we going to, just over the next couple of weeks, talk about bigger, broader issues that need to be dealt with but have no chance of being part of legislation?  In 2013, I participated in what was called the Gang of 8. We negotiated for 7 straight months nearly every night. We were in We as Members negotiated--and our staffs did as well--much longer hours and into the weekends. Then we brought that piece of legislation to the Judiciary Committee, where we debated it for a couple of weeks. I think we amended it more than 100 times. Then we brought it to the House floor for another couple of weeks and amended it several more times before passing it by a vote of 68 to 32. That was a long process--hard-fought compromises in that legislation. To suggest that we can go through a similar effort in the next couple of weeks--it simply isn't going to happen. The list the White House brought forward is simply something that we ought to consider for comprehensive reform but not for this specific fix.  With regard to the border itself, we all know that we need additional infrastructure on the border. I represent We have some 375 miles of border. Some of the border has good barriers in terms of fences. The closest thing we have approximating a wall is these old landing strips from World War II that we put on their end and cemented in. They are opaque. You can't really see through them. We have them in a number of the communities along the border. We have been taking them out because they are not very effective and putting fences in place of them because we need to have visibility to the other side of the border.  Most of what the President is talking about along the southern border is a fence. We do need more fences. In the Gang of 8 bill, I think we authorized 700 miles of additional and improved fencing. Nobody is suggesting we don't need additional infrastructure or barriers on the border. The question is, How much do we provide for it in this legislation?  The President has made a request in the budget for about $1.6 billion for the coming year. I think that will result in about 74 miles of fence between Texas and I think that is a good place to start. How much we authorize going forward will be very much in debate.  I know that during the campaign, the President talked long and hard about building a wall, but every time he mentioned building a wall, he talked about Mexico paying for it. We all know--and many of us knew at the time--Mexico was not going to pay for that wall. They are not. That is why the President is asking for $18 billion of U.taxpayer money to fund that wall. To suggest that the President hasn't changed his position and that we are dealing with a proposal that we have known was coming from the White House simply isn't true. It has changed. The President initially said that Mexico would pay for it. That is not the case. The U.taxpayers are going to pay for any infrastructure on the border. That is as it should be. If we are putting up the border fence, we ought to pay for it. To suggest that nobody has changed their position is simply not true.  Deals like this where you need 60 votes necessarily involve compromise. No party, no individual is going to get everything they want. The White House will not get everything they want. The Democrats in Congress will not, and neither will the This will be a compromise.  I am simply suggesting tonight--let's get real about the time involved between now and when we have to fix this and not think that we can simply kick the can down the road and put in some temporary fix, some kind of bridge later that will protect these kids. Those protections will run out on March 5 and may be done at that point. Let's get serious. Let's all get serious, Republicans and Democrats, and not come to the table with unrealistic expectations about what can be done and what can be part of this legislation. Let's have something that we can put on the Senate floor by the end of the month to leave sufficient time to get this fixed by March 5.

Millions of members of the LDS Church around the globe mourn his passing as we celebrate his life.  There is much that can be said about what President Monson taught us from the pulpit. There is much more to be learned about what he did when he wasn't speaking--the sick whom he visited, the weary he sustained, the jobless he aided, and the homeless he sheltered.  A reoccurring theme throughout his life and his ministry was ``the rescue.'' He spoke movingly of a painting he had seen in a gallery in England that featured, as he described it, ``heavy-laden black clouds and the fury of a turbulent sea portending danger and death. A life from a stranded vessel gleaming far off. In the foreground, tossed high by incoming waves of foaming water, a large lifeboat, men pulling mightily on the oars plunging into the tempest. On the shore stands a wife and two children, wet with rain and whipped by wind. They gaze anxiously seaward.''  ``In my mind,'' President Monson said, ``I abbreviated the name of the painting. To me, it became ``To the Rescue.''  Throughout his life, President Monson went to the rescue of those in need. He possessed a genuine love for those who were sad, downtrodden, and less fortunate.  He was quoted as saying:       I firmly believe that the sweetest experience in mortality      is to know that our Heavenly Father has worked through us to      accomplish an objective in the life of another person.[[Page S33]]  This, he took to heart. In his early years of church service, President Monson presided over a congregation with 85 widows. Although he was their appointed church leader for just a few short years, the love he felt for those widows was evident. He continued to visit each widow throughout her remaining life and was present at the funeral for each of his dear friends.  He encouraged all of us to ``extend the hand that helps and the heart that knows compassion.'' My colleagues here would be interested to know that President Monson often quoted Abraham Lincoln saying: ``If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend.''  President Monson's example of service and rescue was recognized by many world leaders. In an effort to promote America's spirit of generosity, President Ronald Reagan appointed him to his Task Force on Private Sector President Monson met with religious leaders of all faiths to talk about the welfare program of the church, which has been recognized as being highly successful in its scope and in its mission.  In closing, President Monson's daughter, Ann Monson Dibb, observed how her father embodied the Scripture in James that reads: ``Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.'' There is no better description of the life and legacy of Thomas May we do the same by rushing to the rescue of those in need.  I yield the floor.  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The list of companies nationwide that have announced pay raises, bonuses, and 401(k) contributions is growing. Companies that weren't able to invest more in their employees in the past have found renewed confidence in this Nation's economic future.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle proclaimed that this bill was a tax scam that would only profit the rich. These baseless claims are the very epitome of fake news, and nothing could be further from the truth.  Already, more than a million Americans have received bonuses because of our efforts to reform the Tax $900 billion is being distributed to hardworking American taxpayers by job creators as of today.  Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we have witnessed companies begin to reinvest in the future of employees. In fact, Aflac announced it will increase 401(k) matching from 50 percent to 100 percent for the first 4 percent of employee contribution, on top of issuing one-time bonuses to employees.  Our job creators are so inspired by the reforms we worked hard for, and those who are working toward retirement will enjoy these benefits for years to come.  While some in this Chamber stated that tax reform would lead to Armageddon, I would like to point out that, for many, tax reform has brought about what Reagan called morning in America again. Proponents of the status quo and naysayers claimed that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would cost taxpayers. That is simply not the truth.  Even modest increases in GDP growth caused by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will substantially contribute to a leveling off of the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office stated, for every one-tenth of 1 percent increase in GDP, nearly $270 billion in revenue is added over 10 years.  Most importantly, hardworking American taxpayers will now keep more of their hard-earned cash. Estimates show that married couples taking advantage of the new standard deduction in the Fifth District of North Carolina may receive a tax cut to the tune of $1,834. That is no small sum.  Mr.Speaker, I am pleased that House Republicans kept our promise to bring about more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks in 2017, and I look forward to this continued success in 2018.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgH21-5.txt,1791,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2018.0,9.0,January

Mr.Speaker, today I rise to recognize the life-affirming and lifesaving work done across the country by pro-life pregnancy centers.  I have the privilege of representing the New Hope Pregnancy Compassion Care Center in Yadkinville, North Carolina; and I am proud to share the testimony of a young woman who perfectly encapsulates what these care centers do.  She writes: ``The day I found out I was pregnant, I was very upset and didn't know what to do. I had so many different emotions and knew that it was going to be very hard, especially with me still being in college. I didn't know how I was going to tell my parents, my family, or my church. After having two positive pregnancy tests, I decided to go to Compassion Care This was one of the best decisions I could have ever made.  ``When I got there, I took another pregnancy test and it was positive. After that, I ended up having an ultrasound. After I seen my little baby on the ultrasound, I was lost for words. I had so many emotions and felt like I had no one. After my ultrasound, I ended up talking to a staff person about life and about this new baby. I told her how scared I was to tell my parents and how bad of a person I felt because of this. Even though this baby was not planned by me, God had planned it for me. She explained to me that even though I was still in college and still living at home, that she knew that I could do this and get through this. After we talked for a while about my life, the new baby, and religion, we prayed together.  ``I ended up going home after that and telling my parents. It was very hard for them to cope with at first, but eventually they accepted it. I started going back to Compassion Care every week after that to take classes that offered videos about pregnancy and babies. Watching those videos helped me so much because it was a lot of new information that I did not know.  ``I earned points every time that I came to watch these videos by watching them and doing homework sheets. The points I earned I could use to buy stuff in the store. The store had many different items that I could get. I got maternity clothes, baby clothes, diapers, wipes, and toys. These items helped me tremendously.  ``Without Compassion Care offering these classes and items, I wouldn't have known what to do. I have learned so much stuff that I didn't know before and they have given me the best support. I absolutely love everyone there and appreciate everything that they have done for me. I just recently had my daughter, and she has become my entire life.  ``I know one thing, though, if I would have not been involved with Compassion Care Center, I would not have been able to do this.

422,topic-id,512,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  As we destroy the caliphate in the Middle East, foreign fighters and terrorist sympathizers have fled the battlefield and are looking for new ways to spread their hatred, recruit new followers, instill fear, kill innocent people, and disrupt our way of life.  The December 11 bombing at the New York City Port Authority Bus Terminal was the second terror attack in New York in less than 2 months and a grave reminder of the reality of this threat.  Given this current environment, at the direction of Chairman McCaul, I led a task force to identify specific national security challenges and examine how terrorists might infiltrate our homeland and bring harm to our people. Subsequently, we produced a report with a series of solutions to fix any identified weaknesses that may be exploited by our enemies.  This report resulted in several pieces of legislation that have come before the House today. To that end, my bill, the Counterterrorism Information Sharing Improvement Act, seeks to enhance the current information-sharing environment that exists within the Federal and military communities. Throughout the task force, we heard time and time again about the incredible amount of biometric and biographic data being pulled off battlefields in Syria and Iraq, as U.forces and our allies continue to roll back the territories once held by  It is often DOD personnel that encounter ISIS fighters on the battlefield, which often leads to the collection of valuable data. However, if these fighters and their associates move back to the West or try to enter the U.S., the DHS becomes the primary entity that will engage them. Therefore, it is critical that the data recovered by the DOD in the battlefield is able to reach the DHS and its systems for effective frontline screening and vetting of known or suspected terrorists.  In order to verify we are utilizing this information to support our counterterrorism efforts, we must ensure that the Department of Homeland Security gets access to that data in a timely manner, particularly so that it can be used for screening and vetting purposes. My bill directs the President, acting through the Secretary of Homeland Security, to ensure that the DHS has access to biographic and biometric data collected by the U.Government on individuals associated with a terrorist organization. The bill also directs the Secretary to report to Congress on these efforts.  The U.must prioritize any opportunity to identify bad actors outside the country and expand our ability to identify and deter threats before they reach the homeland. Unfortunately, information-sharing challenges among U.agencies can prevent valuable information from becoming available for frontline screening and vetting. Not only is this a bureaucratic challenge, given the number of separate government agencies and components involved, but legal capacity and technical issues exist as well.  This bill will address these challenges and create improved collaborations between the Department of Homeland Security and its other Federal and military partners.  Mr.Speaker, I therefore urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

298,topic-id,2651,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to talk about a couple of issues here on the floor of the I really have two things I want to talk about today. One is the incredible tax bill that was passed by the Congress and signed by the President just before Christmas, a tax bill that has profound effects on the American economy, most of them negative and bad, but also a tax--I will use the word ``scam''--that will really--well, if you happen to be superwealthy, it is terrific.  I guess, Mr.Speaker, the President, when he went to his Christmas party at Mar-a-Lago, spoke to his guests, most of whom I suspect were rather wealthy, and he said: I just made you a whole lot richer.  Indeed, he did. So we will talk about that in a little more detail.  I also want to talk about the ongoing Mueller investigation. On the floor of the House, from time to time, many of my colleagues from the Republican side come here to the floor, or on cable television, and attack Mueller, attack the FBI, and anybody else who happens to be standing nearby, in an effort to discredit the special counsel's investigation of what happened in the 2016 Presidential election.  It seems to me that here in America, since the very first days of our constitutional government, we have always said that we are a country of laws and that the laws dictate what we do.                              {time}  1800  We are not a country of individuals that dictate what happens but, rather, a country of laws. What is happening here in this effort to discredit the Mueller investigation is to move away from that nearly century and a half of profound importance in how people govern themselves not by the will of an emperor or the will of a king or even the will of a President, but we govern ourselves by the laws that are enacted by elected representatives: Senators, Members of the House of Representatives, in the case of the National Government, or legislatures, county commissioners, county supervisors, or city council members.  We are a country ruled by laws that are enacted by the citizens; however, the effort to discredit, to derail, to stop the investigation of the appropriate entity--in this case, the Department of Justice, acting through the special counsel--is contrary to the fundamental foundation of the way in which we govern ourselves. That is to say that that discrediting, that effort to stop the investigation of whether laws were broken, disobeyed, or not followed completely undermines the foundation of our government and our relationship as individuals.  None of us want to be subject to the whims of an individual like a king or an emperor or a We want them--in this case, the President--to act through the law, that is, to follow the law and, in this case, an agency within the executive branch, the Department of Justice, to carry out its responsibility to determine if the laws have been followed, if there has been a breach of law, if there has been some other element that is contrary to the rule of law. It is that simple.  So I would ask my Republican colleagues here in the House of Representatives and in the Senate and those who are constantly on cable television who are attempting to knock down the Mueller investigation, to discredit his investigation, to discredit the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies of the Federal Government to slow down, to stand back, and to let the operation that is fundamental to our well-being, that operation of enforcing the law to occur and see where it goes, let the investigation play itself out and not get caught up in questions of whether the Steele dossier was the reason for the investigation. It was not.  Clearly, today, we have learned from Senator Feinstein, whom I thank and whom all of us should thank, for making public the 10 hours of testimony from Fusion GPS available for all of us to see so that we can, as individuals, judge the validity of the charge that has been made that somehow the Steele investigation is all that this is about. It is not. It was not and is not. It is about information that came to the FBI from multiple sources, including counterintelligence information developed by our intelligence agencies. That then led to the investigation and eventually to the establishment of a special counsel.  So take a deep breath. Let this process unfold. Let the facts lead the way. Let the development of those facts be done, and let us then judge the outcome of the investigation.  It seems to me that a lot of the heat that has been put on the FBI and the Mueller team comes from a fear that there is something to fear. So the question should be asked: What is it that you fear?  Why is it that you are doing so much to try to waylay, discredit, stop the investigation?  Is there something that you know that the American public should know?  Is there something that you fear that Mr.Mueller will find out about the 2016 Presidential campaign, about connections to Russia?  Do you know something that would cause you to so aggressively try to stop the investigation? Perhaps you do, in which case, come to the floor and share with us.  I will let it go at that. It just seems to me that we ought to recognize that we are a nation of laws. We are not a nation of a king or an emperor or of a We are a nation of laws in which the President's task is to faithfully carry out the Constitution and the laws. If you don't like the laws, come here and change them or go to the Supreme Court and get a ruling that somehow that law is not constitutional. That is the way we should do it.  So enough of that. I have taken a few moments to look at this profoundly important issue about the very nature of government in the United  Let me take up another issue, which I actually opened on for just a few moments, and that was tax policy.  I have stood here on the floor before, many times, and talked about the tax bill as it was being developed, and I raised the alarm that somehow this tax bill would not be good for American families and working men and women in  I always want to start this discussion with this placard. Those of you who have followed me on the floor may have seen it before, but I want to frame what I am concerned about. I want you to understand the scope of this discussion and why it is of concern. I found this to be an extremely useful way to frame my values and, I think, to frame the values of my colleagues in the Democratic  What is it that we want to accomplish?  What is the value that we put forth?  What is our goal?  What are we trying to do with our public policy statements?  What did we attempt to do with our unanimous opposition to the tax bill that the House of Representatives and the Senate passed and the President signed?  This is the framework. If you would, this is the statement of values. It[[Page H73]]comes from Franklin Delano That is actually etched in marble at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial here in Washington, D.These are his words: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much.''  Let me repeat that: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.''  For myself, and I know for my Democratic colleagues, this is the touchstone. These words are the touchstone about our policies, about the programs that we push forward. These words are the touchstone that give us a foundation upon which we then analyze the legislation and come to a conclusion to vote ``yes'' or ``no.''  In our analysis of the tax scam, we found that that legislation, now law, failed this test. It failed the fundamental test.  Did that legislation help those who have little or did it add to the abundance of those who have much?  The answer is this from the Joint Tax Committee: during the 10-year life of this legislation, the result of the tax scam is that 83 percent of the $1.5 trillion goes to the top 1 percent.  How can that be? How could it be that a piece of legislation that has been enacted and is now the law of the land will, over the next decade, shift more than $1.5 trillion to those who are already the richest men and women in this Nation, if not in this world?  Why? Why would we add a king's ransom--no, a national ransom--to those who already have 80 percent of the wealth of this Nation?  Why would we do that? Why?  Why would we ignore this test?  We didn't. We Democrats did not. We said ``no'' 186 times because it fails the fundamental test of fairness.  We know across this Nation, it is in economic study after economic study, that America has concentrated wealth in the handful of the top 1 percent to an extent only seen once in America's history before this time, and that was the Gilded Age at the turn of the 19th century. Never, other than now and then, did so few have such a high concentration of America's wealth.  Now, there are those who would argue that is a good thing because all of that wealth will be spent and trickle down to the rest of There is not one economic study anywhere that says that trickle down will actually happen; but, rather, what the tax scam bill does is to continue the concentration of wealth for the next decade.  So what of the poor, what of the elderly, what of the students in school who are borrowing vast sums of money so they can get an education?  What of the men and women who have been able to acquire a health insurance policy through the Affordable Care Act because they were able to have that cost of the premium subsidized?  What of those people?  The working men and women of America were dealt a very, very bad hand. But, Mr.Speaker, as the President said when he walked into his club for a Christmas party after signing the bill: I have made you so much wealthier.  So here we are. We had meetings today with military. We need to build new nuclear bombs. We need to build new missiles. We need new ships. We need new tanks.                              {time}  1815  Whether they do or not, you can debate, but there is an incredible demand for money from the military. By the way, we need to fight wars. We need to prepare for conflict on the Korean  Need, need, need, we need--yes, they do need. Not all of it. I would disagree with much of it, but nonetheless, enormous demand.  And in this tax bill, where is the money for that? Where is the money for the military?  If you are a military hawk, ask yourself: Where is the money?  It went to the top 1 percent and American corporations that already had $2.5 trillion of cash stashed away in their treasury. They didn't need more money. They were not even investing what they had, yet they received even more as a result of this tax scam.  So what is the purpose of all of this?  Oh, did I mention that in this bill--for that family out there that was able to get health insurance for the first time so they could have a baby, so they could have an operation that they needed, so they can have continuing access to preventative care, do you know what was in this bill? Do my colleagues understand what was in this bill?  Six, seven, eight million of our American families will lose their health insurance as a result of this bill, and all the rest of us are going to wind up paying anywhere from 10 to 20 percent more premium cost as a result of the language that was in this bill that restricts and literally guts the Affordable Care A test of our progress.  So what did the tax scam do?  It shifted a king's ransom--excuse me--a Presidential ransom to those who already have much, the top 1 percent. There you have it, 83 percent of it. And it purposely harms millions of Americans because they will lose their health insurance as a result of the language of this bill that guts the Affordable Care Act's programs.  How could it be? How could we do that?  We Democrats didn't. We said: This is bad public policy.  Now, guess what. That was step one of what I like to call the Texas Two  Do you know what step two is?  Step two is to suddenly wake up and realize: ``Oh, my, we have just added $1.5 trillion plus interest, maybe another 3- or $400 billion of interest to the national debt. Oh, my goodness. We have to do something,'' they say.  In fact, it has already been said by our esteemed Not the gentleman that is in the chair at this moment, but Mr.He has already said: We have to take the next step now. We have to cut entitlements.  Oh, my, the entitlements, we have to cut them in order to deal with the huge new deficit that was created by the tax plan. Wait a minute. Mr.Speaker, you just created the deficit and now you want to go after entitlements. Time out.  Do we understand what an entitlement is? Do we know what an entitlement is?  Let me tell you. Social Oh, we are talking about seniors. Social  You mean we have got to cut entitlements, Social Security? Oh, Mr.Speaker, that is what you want us to do? You want us to cut Medicare?  You are suggesting we do that by raising the eligibility age, not from 65, but maybe 67, 68. And you just cut the ability for these people to get health insurance at the same time? How does that calculate?  In my mind, it doesn't.  Did I mention Medicaid?  You know those programs--Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, education--those are entitlements.  That is what you want to cut? When 60, 70 percent of Medicaid goes to seniors, nursing homes, other disabled people, extended care, and nursing home facilities, that is what you want to cut?  Guaranteed, as sure as I am standing on the floor at this moment, that is the second step.  And I am not dreaming this up.

Staying with the infrastructure, the Democrats have proposed several different ways to pay for the infrastructure program. Two of those, or one big one, is now gone.  American corporations held $1 trillion--I think, almost $2 trillion--of profits offshore. In the tax, bill that money cannot be retrieved. It is going into the coffers of the corporations if they bring it back to the United States, with a very small tax.  One of the proposals brought forward by the Democrats was to repatriate, bring that money back to the United States and use it to support infrastructure, to use it to pay for immediate bonds, that we could then sell those bonds and use that money for infrastructure investment. That, of course, is gone as a result of the tax bill.  There is another proposal that really, I think, dovetails with the extraordinary ramp-up of the stock market. A lot of that has to do with transactions, billions of transactions every day. A small fee of less than one one-hundredth of a penny on each transaction would raise billions of dollars and go directly to deal with what is a problem in the stock market, and that is computerized gambling that goes on in the stock market.  There are other ways that we have proposed to raise the money, but one of the things that I fear is that the President is going to come up with a plan that saddles working men and women of America with the infrastructure cost.[[Page H75]]  Already, working men and women pay for most of the infrastructure. They are the ones who are driving the cars, paying the fees and so forth. This, we have to tackle. We need to do it in a bipartisan way as Mr.Jeffries has suggested, but we ought to do it in a way that tries to claw back as much of that unnecessary wealth that has been transferred to the superwealthy.

Little oil spills in the rivers and lakes and harbors are cleaned up using that fee. It is about $400 million a year--small, but absolutely essential.

384,topic-id,652,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about a horrible tragedy that took place in the early morning hours of December 31 in Douglas County, CO, when most Coloradoans were waking up and preparing for a celebration that evening to bring in the new year. Hours later, a gunman would open fire on Douglas County sheriff's deputies in what has been described by law enforcement as an ambush-style attack.  The gunman injured two citizens as well as Sheriff's Deputies Michael Doyle, Jeff Pelle, Taylor Davis, and Castle Rock Police Department Officer Thomas O'A fifth officer, Douglas County Sheriff's Deputy Zackari Parrish, heroically gave his life during this ambush in an attempt to save the lives of others.  Deputy Parrish was 29 years old and is survived by his wife, Gracie, and their two young daughters.  Zack's lifelong dream was to become a police officer. He attended Arapahoe Community College Law Enforcement Academy part time while he worked full time at a bank so he could make these dreams come true. Following graduation, Zack served for 2 years as an officer at the Castle Rock Police Department and spent the last 7 months as a Douglas County sheriff's deputy. His selfless nature and devotion to his family and friends was a testament to his tireless drive to protect his community. He was what every officer strives to be--dedicated to the job, persistent, and detail oriented.  At a vigil to honor Zack earlier this week, his fellow deputies shared Zack's ``knack for finding things other cops missed.'' They spoke of ``how he always wanted to chase the bad guys'' and how, even when it was time to go home, Zack would ``stay late to make one more check on patrol.'' His family and friends spoke of how Zack was known for his ``bear-sized love'' and even more so for his bear-sized hugs.  These are the qualities of those who righteously wear the blue uniform. These are the qualities that keep the rest of us safe and sound. These are the qualities of a hero. Zack, like all law enforcement officers, went to work each and every day being prepared to walk that thin blue line.  Colleagues at the vigil spoke about how Zack was not only dedicated to the difficult parts of the job but also to lifting the spirits of his fellow officers. According to his fellow deputies, Zack was known as the guy who would ``hunt for the best Christmas lights.'' It is that kind of passion, good nature, and of course love for his community that Zack will be remembered for.  As we saw on New Year's Eve, while the rest of us spent time with our families and friends, our brave law enforcement officers were protecting our communities. Their sacrifice is why we were able to celebrate with our loved ones.  We owe so much to Zack and the law enforcement officers across Colorado and across the country for their service. When a tragic event like this unfolds, I am often reminded of the words of LTC Dave Grossman, who wrote that American law enforcement is the loyal and brave sheep dog that is always standing watch for the wolf that lurks in the dark.  Regardless of their personal safety, our law enforcement officers run toward the danger. They are always there to help others serve our communities, and often through the worst of times, they provide hope and safety to our families, including mine, including yours.  I continue to pray--and let all of us continue to pray--for the other four officers and two citizens who were injured in the attack. We must continue to honor Zack's memory and support his brothers in blue as they continue his work and support his dearly loved family as they begin the new year in a way they never could have imagined. We honor his legacy and those who serve.

813,topic-id,710,"Madam President, up until about 8:58 this morning, we believed in Colorado that States rights would be protected. Up until about 8:58, maybe 8:55--until Twitter told us otherwise--we believed the will of Colorado voters would be respected. Why did we believe that? Because of conversations I had with then-Senator Jeff Sessions prior to his confirmation as Attorney General about what would happen with Colorado's marijuana policy.  At the time, prior to his confirmation, then-Senator Sessions told me there were no plans to reverse the Cole memorandum. Then-Senator Sessions told me marijuana simply wasn't going to be on President Trump's agenda; that it was something they weren't going to deal with; it was something President Trump simply wasn't going to focus on.  That was back in the spring of 2016, and up until 8:58 this morning, that was the policy. One tweet later, one policy later--a complete reversal of what many of us on the Hill were told before the confirmation and what we had continued to believe the last year. Then, without any notification, conversation, or dialogue with Congress, completely reversed.  Now, perhaps the Department of Justice didn't think this would be a big deal. I understand Attorney General Jeff Sessions' opposition to the legalization of marijuana. I opposed the legalization of marijuana in Colorado, but this is about a decision by the State of We were told that States rights would be protected and not just by the Attorney General, then the nominee to be Attorney General, we were told that by then-Candidate Donald  In Colorado, in July of 2016, then-Candidate Trump was asked if he would use Federal authority to shut down sales of recreational marijuana in States like Then-Candidate Donald Trump said: ``I wouldn't do that.''  When then-Candidate Trump was asked if he thought Colorado should be allowed to do what it is doing, he said: ``It's up to the Absolutely.''  That was then-Candidate Trump's position. I would like to know from the Attorney General what has changed. What has changed President Trump's mind that the Cole memorandum would be reversed and rescinded? What has changed the President's mind? Why is Donald Trump thinking differently today about what he promised the people of Colorado in 2016 to reverse course today? What changed? I would like to know that. I think the people of Colorado deserve to have that answer.  Without the Cole memorandum, legal businesses, operating in accordance with States rights and laws, are now operating under a cloud of uncertainty. Thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in revenue are at risk, and certainly the question of constitutional States rights is very much at the core of this discussion. I believe what happened today was a trampling of Colorado's rights and its voters. Sure, this was a heavily debated issue, something I have already said I opposed, but the people of Colorado spoke, and they spoke loudly, and I believe that if the same question were asked today, they would even have more support for the decision they made several years ago.  I agree with President Trump that this decision should be left up to the people of Colorado and other States, and I call on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to explain to me why President Trump was wrong in 2016, what changed their minds, and that they reverse their decision to withdraw and rescind the Cole memorandum and that they reimplement and reinstate the Cole memorandum. Until that happens, I think I am obligated to the people of Colorado to take all steps necessary to protect the State of Colorado and their rights.  That is why today I will be putting a hold on every single nomination from the Department of Justice until Attorney General Jeff Sessions lives up to the commitment he made to me in my preconfirmation meeting with him--the conversation we had that was specifically about this issue of States rights in Until he lives up to that commitment, I will be holding all nominations to the Department of  The people of Colorado deserve answers.

431,topic-id,1320,"Mr.Speaker, 39 years ago, a collective nightmare was foisted[[Page H67]]upon the people of the nation of Iran, and so when roughly 2 weeks ago, while on recess, I became aware of the courage manifest in the action of the Iranian people in standing up to a brutal totalitarian regime, I immediately contacted our office and suggested that we secure this Special Order hour, and reached out to a number of my colleagues, several of whom join me today, to speak loudly and clearly on behalf of the United States and the nearly 6 million people represented by myself and the individuals who will speak here today in support of those who would stand up and risk their very existence for those most basic human rights, which we as Americans take, tragically, for granted.  As I stand in this well, Mr.Speaker, in cities that the bulk of Americans have never heard of, in Isfahan and Karaj and Tabriz and Mashhad and Tehran, indeed, tens of thousands stand in the face of a regime with a record of destroying not only freedom but life itself in the instance of those who would stand up and demand freedom, stand up and demand basic human rights and dignity.  Mr.Speaker, to put this into perspective, if you were to take the population of the nation of Iran circa 1979 and compare it to the population of the United States circa 1941 and then align the numbers of Americans killed in combat during the entire Second World War, it would proportionally be roughly equal to the number of people who have given their lives at the hands of the brutal Iranian regime inside the borders of Think about that for a moment. Roughly 60,000 during the coup d'etat revolution in 1979, about 12,500 from 1981 to 1984, almost 33,000 during the 1988 uprising. We don't know how many were murdered in 2009, when this Nation stood silent as Iranians, brave, took to the streets to demand self-determination and toleration; that a regime should not be able to dictate how one worships, who one marries, what one believes; that people should be given basic rights to self-determination.  Today, we know very little about what is going on in Iran except for the brave women and men who are confronting challenges that we, by virtue of the fortune of our birth as Americans, will hopefully never have to confront. We know that roughly 50 have been murdered; we know that roughly 3,000 are imprisoned.  This time, I will not be silent. I have spoken with Iranian Americans of all different facets from a number of different groups. I ask these Iranian Americans, as well as those resisting within Iran and Iranians disbursed across the globe, to set aside their political differences and join together for the common goal of deposing a regime that murders its own sons and daughters to a tune that is comparable to the total number of American combat deaths during the Second World Enough is enough.  Today, I stand beside an image of Habib Habib was the former captain of the Iranian national soccer team. He and 40 others were executed in 1984 at the Evin Prison for having the temerity to criticize their government. He was 29 years old. The evidence indicates that he was tortured before he was executed.  In fact, again, as we stated earlier, over 12,000 people were executed by the Islamic Republic Security Forces just from 1981 to 1984.  Next is a young woman who tragically became something of an international folk hero for those who were paying attention, in that she had the temerity to stand and protest during the Green Revolution in 2009, suggesting that the Iranian people had a right to self-determination, when she was publicly, on film, murdered in the streets, 26 years old. The United States remained silent. The second of three children from a middle class neighborhood, she had the courage to stand up and point out injustice when she saw it, and paid with her life. Indeed, the protesters with whom she marched shouted, ``America, you are either with us or with the mullahs,'' and we did not respond.  Today, I am responding. This administration is responding.  The Iranians, with whom I have spoken across a diverse sect of opposition, do not want tanks and bombers and missiles, nor do I, having worn the uniform of this Nation, but while we can't rule out any particular alternatives, all they ask is a word of support; that when we act legislatively in this body and in the Chamber down the hallway, we have the follow-through to ensure that our actions are backed up; that unlike the 1990s, when the Iran Sanctions Act was passed, we don't let our so-called European allies turn a blind eye as their corporate entities continue to do business with the IRGC that uses the money generated through this business not only to murder their own citizens but to fund the likes of Hezbollah, and fast forward to current day, create instability, peril, death, and destruction literally across the entire region from the Mediterranean to the Khyber  There is no blind eye being turned this time.  Next we see Shekar A nurse, she was arrested, imprisoned, and tortured for rendering medical assistance to other Iranian brothers and sisters who were brutalized by the revolutionary guards in the streets of She was tortured viciously at Evin Prison, served a significant portion of a prison sentence, 7 of 15 years, before being executed along with nearly 33,000 others circa 1988.  Now, three names, three faces, three stories, probably 30 seconds to a minute on each. Let me put this into perspective, Mr.If we were to take 5 minutes to show the pictures and speak briefly on every individual murdered by the mullah regime in Iran, we would be here for over a year going 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  I don't stand here saber rattling, suggesting American military action. I stand here suggesting that what my Iranian-American friends and what people of Iranian dissent who are dissidents throughout the world have suggested to me is that if the American Government will stand up and say, ``We stand with you against these mullahs,'' that is the support that they need to continue the movement to see that there is a regime change, which leads to self-determination and democracy in Iran and the lifting of a dark cloud of terror from across the globe.  Don't believe me? I was born in 1972, and I have grown up with the perpetual mention of There are those who think that Hezbollah is something that has been around for a long time, but I point out today that Hezbollah is actually younger than the mullah regime; that, in fact, the mullah regime created Hezbollah; and Hezbollah has the unique distinction of being one of a very few terrorist entities that has actually killed human beings on every single inhabited continent on planet  No trade with Iran, no money to the IRGC; no money to the IRGC, no money to Hezbollah; no money to Hezbollah, we have self-determination in Lebanon, we have less of an oppressive interference in Iraq, we have more stability in Syria, and we have freedom in Enough is enough.

If we were to spend 5 minutes on each of the individuals murdered by the Iranian regime since that regime took power some 39 years ago, we would be here 24/7 for over a year. If we were to name each country and spend 1 day where Iran and their proxies, such as Hezbollah, have taken human life, we would literally be here for months, 1 day per country.  Mr.Yoho articulated basic concepts of natural law, that people are endowed by their Creator with fundamental rights to include the right to life, the right to freedom, and the right to pursue happiness.  Mr.Duncan, Mr.Rothfus, and Mr.Rohrabacher spoke to the JCPOA, and the circumstances surrounding it, how our Nation turned its back on the multibillion-dollar criminal enterprise wholly subsidized by Iran that is Hezbollah, making a bad deal, ignoring trafficking of deadly narcotics throughout the world and, indeed, in our own country to get a worse deal.  I stand with my colleagues who renounce the JCPOA, and I would point out that it is my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, the broad bipartisan opposition to the JCPOA, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which I have referred to repeatedly, and only somewhat jokingly, as the ``Joint Comprehensive Piece of Something, JCPOS.''  But if you want to see the JCPOA go away, the best way to do that is to empower the people of Iran to empower themselves, and that is why I thank my colleagues, one and all, for standing with me here today to speak loudly and clearly. Mr.Speaker, it is my hope that people watching at home will take to social media where the youth of Iran have fomented this revolution, that hashtags such as #freeiran, #iranprotests and #iran will pick up steam, that the world can communicate with those who risk their very lives to assert their basic, fundamental, and Creator-granted rights of[[Page H72]]life, liberty, and the right to pursue happiness by showing them that we support them.  Mr.Speaker, I would point out that Mr.Gohmert so articulately spoke to the role of Rouhani in Iran and the fawning Western media that speaks to his role as a moderate. Mr.Speaker, Mr.Rouhani, quite literally, represents the mullahs, and so, as such, that would be as if suggesting that Mr.Goering or Mr.Goebbels was a moderate There is nothing moderate about the leadership of this regime.

442,topic-id,1247,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Mr.Garrett for yielding.  It is important that we discuss what has been going on in I recall I was on Active Duty in the United States Army back when President Carter stood by and basically encouraged the taking out of the Shah of No prince according to his own conduct, but he made a statement welcoming the Ayatollah Khomeini back to Iran as what he called him, I believe it was a man of peace. He could not have been more wrong.  There has been less peace because the Ayatollah Khomeini took over a state government, a national government, and a powerful military than any time since World War They have been the largest state sponsor of terrorism. They have, we have been told, probably provided most of the IEDs that have killed and maimed Americans fighting for freedom in the Middle East, especially in  They have worked to stir up trouble all over the Middle East, north Africa, and have created massive mayhem, and they are looking to do even more. And with the $100 billion or more that President Obama sent to Iran, they have been able to make more IEDs to kill more Americans, create more havoc, and stir up more sentiment against the United States since that unconstitutional sending under a treaty that was never ratified was done by the last administration.  Some have blamed President Trump for the problems in That is a bit ridiculous. The problems are the radical Islamist leadership in In fact, the same people that would like to blame President Trump are some of the same ones who hailed the $100 billion sent under a treaty that was never ratified that would be used to kill innocent people around the world, including  The people of Iran are to be congratulated for saying: Enough is enough.  There is a great article from Commentary magazine titled: ``What the Iran Protests Have Already Achieved.''  Sohrab Ahmari says: ``More than 1,700 arrests and at least two dozen deaths later, the Tehran regime seems to have suppressed Iran's latest mass uprising. Scattered protests and skirmishes continue nationwide, according to the citizen-journalists who, braving regime violence, continued to post footage on social media. But for now, the demonstrations don't seem to be growing in numbers or frequency. Yet outside observers tempted to write off the movement should recall that the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the Shah began decades earlier. There were lulls through the years, which tempted President Carter at one point to describe the Shah's Iran as an `island of stability' in the Middle  ``Whatever the ultimate outcome, however, the protesters have already accomplished a great deal and shattered many myths in the Let's review their achievements:  ``First, the Iran protests showed that the people are not rallying to the regime under the press of President Trump's hawkish rhetoric.''                              {time}  1745  ``Far from being `swept up in a wave of nationalist fervor,' as The New York Times' Thomas Erdbrink reported a few weeks before the uprising, Iranians still detest their corrupt, repressive regime. As my colleague''--and this is the author, Mr.Ahmari, speaking--``Noah Rothman has noted on our podcasts, Americans have an almost religious conviction that world events revolve around the U.and specifically the White To be sure, America remains the most important Nation on the world stage. Yet the average Iranian doesn't wake up in the morning cursing Donald Trump for trying to undo the nuclear deal. More likely, he curses the fact that he can't even afford eggs to feed his children, and there are more proximate actors whom he blames for that: namely, the mullahs.  ``Second, the uprising revealed, once and for all, that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has been no moderate, and that the reformer versus hardliner distinction is meaningless. Ever since he came to power, Rouhani has been the subject of adulation among members of the Western foreign policy establishment. The media attached the `moderate' and `reformer' labels to Rouhani on the night of his first election, in June 2013, and refused to remove them even as evidence mounted that he was no such thing. There was Rouhani's leading role in the violent repression of the 1999 student uprising; his support for the post-2009 crackdown; his long record of anti-American rhetoric (`the[[Page H71]]beautiful cry of ``Death to America'' unites our nation'); his decidedly immoderate cabinet; his work overseeing Iran's campaign of assassinations targeting dissidents abroad; and much else of the kind.  ``But now Iranians themselves are plainly telling the West that Rouhani is no moderate. Their slogans--`Not Gaza; Not Lebanon; My Life Only for Iran' and `Let Syria Be; Do Something for Me'--are a reminder that Tehran has continued to underwrite terror and bloodshed across the Middle East during the 4-plus years of Rouhani's The people have also been chanting, `Reformists; Hardliners; the Whole Game is Over.' Let's hope the same realization soon dawns in Washington and  ``Third, the protesters put the lie to the Obama administration's claims about the 2015 nuclear deal. Remember when senior Obama officials reassured Americans that Iran would use the sanctions relief under Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to improve the lots of its people? Here is how Obama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew put it in an April 2015 address: `Many Americans, and many of our closest allies, are understandably concerned that Iran will use the money it receives as a result of sanctions relief to fund terrorism and support destabilizing proxies throughout the Middle We share those concerns, and we are committed to maintaining sanctions that address these activities, even after Iran takes the steps required to get relief from nuclear sanctions. But it is important to note that the connection between nuclear sanctions relief and Iran's other malign activities is complicated, and most of the money Iran receives from sanctions relief will not be used to support those activities.' ''  I would interject here he had absolutely, 100 percent, no basis for making such ridiculous statements.  ``Two months later, Colin Kahl, a National Security Advisor to then-Vice President Joe Biden, told the Truman Center: `It is our assessment . . . that the Iranians are not going to spend the vast majority of the money on guns. Most of it will go to butter.' ''  I would insert here he had no basis whatsoever for making such statements.  The article said: ``Millions of jobless and impoverished Iranians now beg to differ. It turns out that the regime was happy to spend the JCPOA''--the Iran treaty that was never ratified--``funds on Hezbollah, Hamas, the Yemeni Houthis, and other nasties, even if that meant Iranians would go hungry. And those hungry people aren't mistaken about the roots of their hunger. Iran remains the world's top state sponsor of terror, according to the U.State Deal opponents warned of this, only to be brushed aside by Obama and his media allies. The Trump administration now has an opportunity to correct course, by walking away from Obama's bad deal. The American people are under no obligation to finance Iran's terrorist statecraft.  ``The mullahs would have no one to blame but themselves. The Iranian people, defeated but unbowed, are sure to have another day.''  So, Mr.Speaker, let me just add here: God bless President Donald Trump for recognizing the Iranian treaty for the horrible deal it was and is to peace in our time.

515,topic-id,865,"Mr.Speaker, we keep hearing about action that needs[[Page H76]]to be taken on the Deferred Action for Childhood I have spent a lot of time down on our Nation's southern border, and I was quite pleased, last year, when Border Patrol friends told me information indicated that, after President Trump was sworn in, the number of people coming into the United States illegally slowed to a trickle, that it was a dramatic decrease, and that continued for awhile. But, during the summer, as discussion about DACA started coming out, I was told, and, apparently, the numbers indicate, the surge began anew.  What I have heard over the years is anytime anyone in Washington starts talking about amnesty, legalization of any kind for people who have come into the United States illegally, there is a fresh surge across our border.  I have been told by border patrolmen, they hear people talking who have come in illegally--whether before processing, during processing, after processing, during the holding procedure, it is made very clear, since they are willing to come into the country illegally in violation of United States laws, that they want to get here before there is any legalization. And it makes sense, as I am told, that they are willing to come in in violation of U.law. They are also willing to say that they came in a previous time and, you know, backdate it, different identity, different date they came in, whatever is required in order to get legal status.                              {time}  1845  I appreciate hearing from my constituents, I always do, and I appreciate getting the opinions and thoughts of constituents from my district, the First District of They are always welcome.  In the last couple of days, I have gotten a stack of petitions in my office regarding a push to support what they are calling a clean Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals reform, but it raises some questions. The best I can tell by the words ``clean bill,'' they mean one that provides amnesty with no strings attached. However, all these petitions have been provided, actual names and addresses are only on a handful of them, many have names written in the same handwriting in ink, and there are numerous unsigned blank petitions in the stack we were provided.  In addition, I want to point out that, every time DACA legalization is mentioned, we have greater surges of people into our country illegally; and every time there is a surge, there are people who die trying to get into this country illegally, bodies found. We have the reports of a dramatic number of young girls, even some boys, who are pulled into sex trafficking, drug trafficking, as a way to pay off their debt to the drug cartels that control the area of the border that they were allowed to come across by the gang that brought them across.  It should be noted, every young person in America has dreams. The best way to achieve the greatest number of dreams for the greatest number of people in the United States is if we enforce the law across the board fairly.  I keep being amazed, and I have asked questions at our hearings:  So why did these people come into the United States illegally?  Well, because there are more jobs and opportunity.  No, but why did they leave where they left, where they fled?  Well, there was no opportunity there.  Why was there no opportunity? Why were there no jobs there?  Well, there is so much corruption. They don't enforce the law fairly.  So what we are being asked to do, instead of using political efforts to get these countries that people have fled to fix their political system, we are supposed to change our laws here so that those who have been working--I have helped some people 17 years trying to get into the country legally--they will be treated unfairly, because they have been trying to do things legally, in favor of people who violated the law to get here.  It kind of seems like we are being asked to become the kind of country they fled, where the law is not enforced fairly across the board. It sounds like the ultimate irony.  Until our border is made secure, we should not be discussing passage of any legalization bill. We should stop talking about legalization until the border is secure. When the border is secure, then we can work things out.  It is so ironic to me, the very people who are demanding a big amnesty, legalization, whatever you want to call it, say, ``We don't want a wall, we don't want the border secure,'' which means we will have to come back and have this discussion in the next couple of years all over again.  It was supposed to have ended in 1986. We will get border security in return for the amnesty. We got the amnesty, and we didn't get the border security.  I am joined by a friend, a very dear friend, who wrote speeches for his hero, a hero of mine, Ronald Reagan, who knows very well what happened in 1986.

It seems pretty clear, after our effort to create a democratic republic in Iraq, that if a nation's people have not been properly prepared and educated to maintain a democratic republic, they won't keep it. It seems pretty clear from the places we have been together.  I will never forget Christian friends that I made in west Africa, who sat me down at the end of the week and said they wanted me to understand that they were so thrilled when we elected our first Black But since he was elected, they said: We have seen America get weaker and weaker, and we wanted to make sure you took a message back to Washington that we are Christians, we know where we go when we die.

But I ask: What would be better? What better neighbor would we be to continue until so many come in, our system fails and goes bankrupt, as California is doing now?  Or would we be better to say: Let's build a wall where it is necessary. Let's totally secure our border. Let's cut off the 70 to $80 billion that is flowing from the United States into the drug cartels of Mexico, that allows them to corrupt the Government of Mexico and the local governments and terrorist people and put police heads on stakes to terrorize us. Let's cut off that 70 to $80 billion, however much it is.  Let's totally secure the border. And people who love their Mexican heritage are--other countries in Central and South America, they love their heritage, but they can't make it.  Why don't we help cut off the corruption by cutting off the flow of money out and drugs into our country? Why don't we work on that? Wouldn't that be a better neighbor to our friends to the South?  There is no reason Mexico is not one of the top 10 economies in the world. They have got the wonderful people, hardworking folks. They have got the resources. They have got a fantastic location.

We are told that the folks in the deep state have made very clear they want what they call a clean reauthorization. Nothing clean about it when you look at how 702 is spent.

It goes through this scenario.  Sometime in early 2016, Admiral Rogers--talking about Admiral Mike Rogers, not the Mike Rogers that was here in Congress--became aware of an ongoing and intentional violation of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Section 702 surveillance, specifically item 17, which includes the unauthorized upstream data collection of U.individuals within NSA surveillance through the use of ``about inquiries,'' where they do a surveillance of someone foreign, capture American citizens, which would violate our Fourth Amendment rights, except that those names are masked and, supposedly, all kinds of efforts to protect that, so it is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment, supposedly.

1179,topic-id,3215,"Mr.Speaker, with so much going on these days in the way of investigations, we still have Robert Mueller, special counsel--of course, he was supposed to look into potential illegal collusion between President Trump and Russia, and it has morphed into basically whatever he wants to pursue.  It is kind of like the investigation that James Comey as the Deputy Attorney General recommended that the then-Attorney General John Ashcroft should recuse himself, which he followed that advice, and then Mr.Comey was able to appoint his very dear friend and his child's godfather, Patrick Fitzgerald, to be the special attorney.  Special attorney, special counsel, and Mr.Comey apparently knew at the time the investigation began that the person who leaked Valerie Plame's identity as CIA agent was named Richard Armitage, somebody they did not want to go after even though it was supposed to have been a crime. But they weren't interested in the crime. They were interested in nailing a person or persons.  And it really appears that is not only what Patrick Fitzgerald did. He wanted somebody's hide, and apparently it was Dick Cheney's. He might have settled for Karl Apparently, the offer was made more than once. It was reported that Fitzgerald was offering Scooter  If you can just give me anything that will convict Vice President Cheney, then we will make sure you don't have anything to worry about.  But Scooter Libby was not going to lie to get himself out from under the gun, and as was reported, a witness against him, Judy Miller, later believed, when she found some notes, whoops, Libby had not lied as she apparently thought. Apparently, he was innocent, just as he had contended and, apparently, would have walked away without any problems, without the full force of the Federal Government going after him if he had just given him anything--that is Comey's child's godfather--given him anything that would have allowed him to convict Vice President  It appears Mueller's investigation now has ceased looking for a crime involving Trump and Russia and is focused on just finding something--kind of like the effort that Comey's buddy--if it is Comey's buddy, since we are told that Comey and Mueller are basically joined at the hip, then it must have been Mueller's friend, too. But they wanted Vice President Cheney, and when Scooter Libby wouldn't lie and do that, well, they convicted him of lying when, apparently, he did not lie. He was innocent.  You can go back and find these type of things in Robert Mueller's wake, whether it was as the assistant U.attorney in charge of criminal investigations in Boston when they were found later to have had people who worked for Mueller who were in bed with Whitey Bulger, the mob leader, and Mueller kept insisting that these four people who were framed by FBI agents should remain in prison and not be paroled. Two of them died in prison. There was ultimately a settlement, but Mueller couldn't be bothered with a settlement because of the actions of the people who worked for him.  Just like he went after Hatfill, claiming that he was the anthrax killer, and some say that was the highest profile case this FBI Director had handled. Others would say it was the prosecution and conviction of Ted Stevens, U.Senator, which we later found out was a frame-up. The FBI is reported to have hidden evidence that completely exonerated him and manufactured evidence. After that came to light, his conviction, all of the case was dropped, as it should have been, well before it was ever even pursued. But they got the intended result.  The trial, a week or so before his election, he was convicted and, therefore, lost the election. Kind of like what Mueller, as FBI Director, had his FBI do to Curt Weldon whom I saw stand at this podium numerous times and talk about the FBI had some information before 9/11 that showed that they could have stopped it, something like that. But he just kept beating up on the  I didn't have any idea whether what Curt Weldon was talking about was true or not, but I do know that just a few weeks before his reelection, after he had been easily reelected a number of times and after he was shown to have a decent lead over a very good Democratic opponent, 3 weeks before the election, the FBI stormed his daughter's office, and Mueller's FBI had leaked the information, apparently, because the place was covered up with reporters of all kinds so that they could document the raid on Curt Weldon's daughter's office.  Shortly thereafter, protesters with signs showed up at Curt's office, claiming that he had been caught red-handed, and the implications were clear from the FBI that Curt Weldon was guilty of something, and that brought about his defeat by about 2 percent.  As I understand it, the year after that raid on the Weldons, the FBI contacted Curt Weldon's daughter and said: You need to come pick up all this stuff up.  There was never a grand jury that we know of. There was no indictment. There was no real investigation. Mueller's FBI got tired of Curt Weldon making allegations from this podium I am standing at now, and they silenced him as a  There is much more, but we find out, and there is an article in the American Thinker by Daniel John Sobieski, and it talks about Uranium It says: ``Back in July, I called for a criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's collusion with Russia to turn over control of 20 percent of our uranium supplies to Russian interests in return for some $145 million in donation to the Clinton Now it turns out that there was one, an FBI investigation dating back to 2009, with current Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller up to their eyeballs in covering up evidence of Hillary's collusion, bordering on treason, with a Vladimir Putin's Russia.''  ``Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion, and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin's,'' says a report by the  John Solomon, Alison Spann of the Hill, said this:  ``Federal agents used a confidential U.witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings, and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.''  So from today's report, we find out that the investigation was supervised by then-U.Attorney Rod Rosenstein, who is now President Trump's Deputy Attorney General, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who is[[Page H1695]]now the Deputy FBI Director under President  Robert Mueller was head of the FBI from 2001 through September 2013, until James Comey took over as FBI Director in 2013. They were both involved in this Russian scam being that this case started in 2009 and ended in 2015.  Let me insert parenthetically, Mr.Speaker, I don't know who recommended the U.attorney investigating Russian collusion with Hillary Clinton and with the trucking firm, with others here in the United States, but whoever recommended Rod Rosenstein to President Trump as Deputy Attorney General should be fired, whoever that was. They are not there to help President  Further down, the article says: ``Tuesday, on Fox Business Network, `Lou Dobbs Tonight,' Breitbart editor at large and the author of `Clinton Cash,' Peter Schweizer said there needs to be a Federal investigation into the Russian uranium deal then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's State Department approved after the Clinton Foundation receiving $145 million from the shareholders of Uranium . . .''  So it is rather interesting. The article goes on to point out that about the investigation into Hillary Clinton, and it points--it quotes from Schweizer, saying: ``A lot of people don't realize it now, in parts of the Midwest American soil is owned by Vladimir Putin's government because this deal went through.''  He goes on and makes some interesting observations.  At the conclusion, he says: ``Actually, we no longer need an investigation of Hillary Clinton and Uranium This FBI investigation in conjunction to what we already knew is prima facie evidence of criminal corruption and intentionally putting of American national security at risk for personal financial gain.''  Then this article from Lee Smith, March 13, titled, ``Robert Mueller's Beltway Cover-Up.'' This points out that if the deep state here--and it does cross party lines. They wanted somebody to effectively cover up all of the leaks, each one of which is a crime punishable by time in prison. If the deep state here in Washington wanted somebody who could protect all of these criminals who are working in intelligence, or FBI, that regularly leak information to hurt people who threaten their power here in Washington, then they could not have a better person as special counsel than Robert Mueller, as overseen by Rod  It points out that ``Mueller took his job not at the behest of the man who by all accounts he is likely to professionally and personally disdain, Donald Trump, but of the blue-chip Beltway elite of which he is a charter member. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed him nearly a year ago to lead an investigation without parameters. That's because Mueller's job is to obscure the abuses of the U.surveillance apparatus that occurred under the Obama administration.  ``The fact that someone at the level of former FBI Director was called in to sweep up the mess left by bad actors in the Bureau and Central Intelligence Agency and other parts of the intelligence bureaucracy suggests that the problems are even worse than previously thought. And that means the constituency from Mueller's political intervention is enormous.''  Mueller is said to believe that the Eric Prince meeting, the reference back in January of 2017 with the Russian banker--that would be well after the election, obviously--was to set up a back channel with the                              {time}  2130  But that makes no sense. According to the foundational text of the collusion narrative, the dossier allegedly written by former British spy Christopher Steele, the Kremlin had cultivated Trump himself for years.  So what is the purpose of a back channel when, supposedly, Vladimir Putin already had a key to the front door of Mar-a-Lago?  Further, the collusion thesis holds that the Trump circle teamed with high-level Russian officials for the purpose of winning the 2016 election.  How does a meeting that Erik Prince had a week before Trump's inauguration advance the crooked election victory plot?  It doesn't. It contradicts it. Erik Prince may well be involved with questionable practices that would make people's blood run cold--and he talks some about Erik Prince--but the idea that whenever anyone who supported Trump, or even voted for him, met with a Russian national, the dish on the menu was treason is the stuff of Cold War ``B'' movies. But it is also evidence of something more than prosecutorial overreach.  The fact that Mueller has zeroed in on Prince points to a key motive behind his ongoing investigation. And he talks about Prince was thrown into the middle of Russiagate after an April 3, 2017, Washington Post story reported his meeting with the Russian banker.  But how did anyone know about the meeting?  After the story came out, Prince said he was shown specific evidence by sources from the intelligence community that the information was swept up in the collection of electronic communications and his identity was unmasked. The U.official or officials who gave his name to the The Washington Post broke the law when they leaked classified information.  Then on further it says Mueller presumably knows whether Prince's name was indeed unmasked and then leaked to the press, and that the leak was a crime. Mueller certainly knows that most of the case he has regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election was built by abuses of the foreign intelligence surveillance apparatus and other related crimes that are punishable with jail time.  The identity of Trump's short-term National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, was swept up and leaked to the press in the same way as Prince's. It was leaked to the same newspaper, The Washington As I explained last week, the identity of Attorney General Jeff Sessions was also unmasked from an intelligence intercept and leaked to The Washington The fact that the FBI had secured a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant on Carter Page was also leaked to The Washington The warrant on Carter Page was secured on the basis of findings in the Christopher Steele dossier, an unverified piece of opposition research paid for by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National  As Director of the FBI during the post-9/11 period, when foreign intelligence surveillance and its abuses made regular, front-page headlines, Mueller knows exactly how the system can be abused and what the penalties are. He also recognizes that Russiagate is evidence of how it was abused and who abused it, including some of the same people he worked with during his 12-year tenure as FBI  The purpose of the Mueller inquiry is, therefore, not to investigate the most ludicrously seeming charges in the Christopher Steele dossier, but to protect the institution of the FBI, former colleagues, as well as the National Security Surveillance Therefore, the inquiry has to cover up the sinful origins of the collusion narrative itself, which was borne in repeated abuses of power and subsequent crimes committed by U.officials in the intelligence bureaucracy and the Obama administration.  So, Mr.Speaker, regardless of what anybody thinks of President Donald Trump--and I know there are some Republicans who are unhappy that he was elected President and want him gone at all costs. And I know that most of the Democrats I know, it just grieves them to no end that he was elected; they want him gone at all costs. But at some point Members of Congress in the House and Senate have got to wake up to the fact that we have crimes being committed in the FBI and in our intelligence apparatus. There are people who are being paid with government checks who are out to destroy people who disagree with their power grabs and their crimes.  This article points out Mueller's investigation has got to drag on as long as necessary to prevent any of the people who have committed the crimes of leaking and other crimes--leaking, lying, perjury, obstructing justice, trying to create an insurance policy to take out a sitting President of the United It is time we wake up.  When elected officials in this city have to fear for their political lives by[[Page H1696]]people who they have given power in the FBI, DOJ, CIA, NSA, then the system is broken. It is out of control. And it is how you lose a democratic republic like we have, or like we used to have. It is time to get it under control.  Mueller is not the answer. He is the problem. He is the poster child for the problem that he has created during his entire tenure. And if he had any decency, he would have never accepted this special prosecution on anything involving Russia because he had been involved in that investigation and because he remained silent or perhaps spoke up to keep it hush-hush.  But he and Rosenstein both, they should have stopped the sale of 20 percent of our uranium to a national enemy. Apparently the Obama administration was so intent on that reset because they felt like, you know, George Bush just overreacted; all Putin did was invade Georgia, one country invading another smaller, weaker country. They felt like Bush overreacted and said: You shouldn't be doing this; put some sanctions in place.  So they wanted to show: We are just fine with you invading adjoining countries. Maybe even those that don't adjoin. But, sure, at least adjoining countries.  Whether they knew it or not, they gave the green light to Putin to invade Crimea, to invade And they gave the green light--they had to know this, because it was part of what they did--to the sale of 20 percent of our uranium to a country that most recently had its dictatorial leader bragging that he had missiles that he could put those nukes on that the United States couldn't stop. And those nukes can be tipped--at least 20 percent of them--with what Hillary Clinton, Mueller, Rosenstein had to be complicit in giving them, in letting them have.  This is serious stuff. But until the leakers and the abusers of our intelligence system are brought to justice, then nobody who believes in representative government is safe. We end up like China, like Russia, where you are scared to death of the people behind the scenes, behind the government, or even the dictatorial leader because you know they made you and they can destroy you.  And when the free press is not free, they are complicit in the assisting of the committing of crimes by gladly accepting the leaks, publishing them to complete the crime, we are in big trouble.  So I would say, if Mueller had any decency, he would just resign. And he doesn't even have to explain how wrong it was for him to accept the appointment. I had hoped that the damage he did to the FBI would have come to an end when his 10 years were up. But, oh, no. President Obama was so thrilled with the things he was doing, he extended his term 2 years and pushed it through  People wouldn't listen to me when I said: Oh, no, this is not a guy you want for 2 more years. He has done enough damage.  And any Republican who says, ``Oh, he will be fair,'' is either desperately wanting President Trump gone or is intentionally ignoring the facts of Mueller's background from the days as the assistant U.attorney in charge of crime in Boston, up through the present.  There are a lot of innocent people who lie in his wake. Some of them got multimillion-dollar settlements for the damage Mueller did to them, but most didn't even get an apology. Mueller couldn't be bothered with how many millions were paid out in Boston because of what he oversaw. He couldn't be bothered with the $5.8 million that was paid to Hatfill because the FBI, under Mueller, and under his direction, apparently--from what the article said, he took direct oversight over the Hatfill investigation, assuring, when there was no evidence that he committed any wrong, that he was still the one.  It is time that Mueller's investigation come to an end. I think Lee Smith had it right. I think the article by Daniel John Sobieski had things right. We have already had an investigation of Russian collusion, and it was done by U.Attorney Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Robert Mueller, and they shut her down, shut up the information so the Clinton Foundation could be the beneficiary. And goodness' sake, they were big-time beneficiaries.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-19-pt1-PgH1694.txt,1801,CONGRATULATIONS TO NATIONAL MERIT SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENTS,2018.0,19.0,March

1359,topic-id,3551,"Mr.Speaker, it is nice when we can talk across party lines about someone's excellent level of service. It has been an honor and privilege to serve with Marcy Kaptur my 13 years here in  Unfortunately, I want to move from talking about someone with ethical, upright, and righteous scruples to talking about a former FBI                              {time}  2015  I had concerns back when Robert Mueller was FBI And some people have forgotten, but one of the things that he implemented as FBI Director that I have heard from FBI agents around the country caused a great deal of concern was what he[[Page H1602]]called a 5-year up-or-out policy, which, in essence--it is more complicated than this, but basically anyone who found themselves in a supervisory position within the FBI offices anywhere in the country, in the world, they were in a supervisory position for 5 years. At the end of that 5 years they had to either come to Washington and most likely ride a cubical, sit at a desk, or they could get out of the  Most of the honorable, wonderful agents we had in the FBI across the country that so many people here in Washington with the FBI like to point to--why? Because they can point around the country to upright, moral, ethical, honest FBI agents so that you don't look at the top of the FBI as it has been here. Since I have been here in Congress both under the Bush administration followed by the Obama administration, there have been problems at the top of the  The first time I had an opportunity to question Mr.Mueller, FBI Director Mueller, after getting to Congress in 2005, I was not aware of all of the problems that Director Mueller was creating within the FBI, and so I paid deference, in effect, to his service in the military, in I felt like he deserved that. But then, as I have said about other individuals, no matter how grueling someone's service may have been, Vietnam or elsewhere, it still doesn't give them a right to harm my country either through negligence or intentional misconduct.  This 5-year up-or-out policy--people didn't realize what I was understanding and realizing from around the country--was doing massive damage to the Federal Bureau of And I kept wondering, ``Why would he do this?''  Now, I understand here in Washington it wouldn't be a bad policy. If you are in a supervisory position for 5 years in Washington, maybe you ought to be bounced out into the real United States, outside this surreal District of Columbia for government service, the paradise for bureaucrats. That would have been a far better policy for the FBI, for probably any bureaucracy here.  For many of the departments and agencies in Washington, that wouldn't be a bad idea: If you are in a supervisory position in Washington, D.C., for 5 years, at the end of the 5 years you have to go out to the real world, go out to the United States itself, in one of the offices out there and deal with real people in real situations rather than this bubble in Washington, D.C., inside the beltway.  That might have been a good policy, but that is not the one that Robert Mueller utilized.  As I wrestled with that--why would someone implement a policy that forced some of the best people in law enforcement, happened to be in the FBI, in a supervisory position, force them out, why would an FBI Director do that?--it became clear. And I believe it was NPR that had an article, I believe it was, about this policy of Mueller's and how, I believe it was in part of 2007, Mueller's policy ran off around 140 or so supervisors in our FBI offices.  From the FBI agents I knew who were in supervisory positions around the country, some had 20, 25, 30 years of experience. So when one thinks about 140 FBI agents with absolutely priceless, invaluable experience in law enforcement around the country, and Mueller runs them off not because they are unethical--all the cases of which I am aware, they were very ethical. They were good law enforcement officers.  And for those who have been in law enforcement, whether Federal or State or local, I think most would agree with this comment that it takes probably 5 years before someone in law enforcement can gain the respect of other law enforcement officers, and especially if that officer, that agent is with the FBI; because there are too many local, State law enforcement who have dealt with FBI agents who came in, wanted to make a name for themselves, the local officers would do the research, they would do the real tough police work going out, knocking on doors, talking to witnesses, only to have their work, when they finally find the culprit, have, as I have heard local law enforcement talk about, the FBI swoop in, have a press conference, and take the credit for the local work.  So that is a reputation, fair or unfair, that local law enforcement often are thinking about when they see a new FBI agent come into town. They are watching to see: Is this person going to be a selfless team player, strictly in the pursuit of law and order and the rule of law, or are they going to come in and use my work to make a name for themselves?  Over 5 years or so, the FBI agents would gain respect. I have seen it, read about it, and I know that that has, too often, been the case. It takes a while to build that kind of respect among local law enforcement and also to build that kind of respect in the criminal community so that they know that is a no-nonsense person, that the FBI agent is not about ego; it is about following the law and making sure everybody else does.  Yet here Robert Mueller comes in as FBI Director, and he is putting in place a policy that is getting rid of the best of the best that we have in the Federal Bureau of  And some say, well, you may not realize, but he was a Bush appointee. I know he was. And he took office as Director of the FBI shortly before 9/11, so it would be a bit unfair to blame Robert Mueller for failing to see what was coming on 9/11 because he had just simply not been in office that long.  But Director Mueller implemented this policy. And as I struggled with why he would do this--he is running off thousands of years of experience. I mean, just in that, about, three-fourths of 1 year, 2007, where it was maybe, I believe, about 140 supervisory agents who Mueller ran off--not for unethical conduct, not for inefficiency or inability to be a good law enforcement officer, no. He ran them off because they, perhaps, had too much experience.  Anybody who has concern about their own self-image and perhaps--I mean, I was wrestling with why somebody would run off thousands of years of experience within the FBI, and what I kept coming back to is perhaps there is some kind of insecurity that would cause a Director to be concerned that there would be people within the FBI that might not be complete yes-men, who might have more experience and, because they have been there 20, 30 years, be able to say: Director Mueller, I know this appears to be a good idea. That is what we thought 20 years ago or 15 years ago. We tried that, and it failed. And let me explain to you why, and perhaps I can help suggest a better policy or a better approach to this criminal case or this type of case.  When you start running off thousands of years of experience within the FBI, you are creating a great vacuum for experience within the So that could create situations, and did, where you could have people who were the special agent in charge in the supervisory position for 5 years, and then, because of Mueller's policy and them not wanting to take their family to Washington, D.C., and sit in some cubical or sit at some desk, be a yes-man--they wanted to be law officers.  And so, in many cases of which I had heard, FBI agents said: I am not going to sit in a cubical for I am a law officer. I am about investigating and enforcing the law. So I am getting out. I am going to make more money where I am going. I would rather have stayed in the That is where my heart is. That is where I wanted to be. But Mueller is forcing me out. Yeah, it will be better for my family. I will have better hours. I will make more money. But I am not going to I want to be here in real America making a difference here.  Those are the kind of people that Robert Mueller ran off. Maybe it was his insecurity. Maybe, some have said, it was a God complex. I don't know. But I know, in my heart, I believe Robert Mueller did more damage to the FBI than all of the FBI Directors put together since Edgar And it is dangerous when one person runs off so many people.  So when we came to find out--and again, this was during the Bush administration, the second term. Alberto Gonzalez was the Attorney And we had been assured that this very dangerous--dangerous because it was so easily manipulated and abused, but it was called the National Security Letters, They were like a subpoena, except without the formalities.  Under this law that created what are called the National Security Letters, someone in the Justice Department[[Page H1603]]could simply write a letter to an individual, to a company, to a bank, and say: I am writing this under Federal law regarding National Security Letters that allows me to just simply send a letter to you, sign the letter, and direct you to deliver to me all of the documents you have regarding this person or this company, whatever the case might be.  They would also put into the letter what the law said, that if the recipient of the letter leaks or tells anybody about that letter, then they have violated the criminal law of the United States and they can be put in prison for leaking, for saying that they had received a letter from the FBI or Justice Department asking for documents.  That is a powerful weapon for the U.Congress to hand over to the Justice Department, and especially if it is utilized by one lone FBI agent.  Well, we have been told in Judiciary Committee repeatedly by FBI Director--we have been told informally, talking about the NSLs, National Security Letters, no, there are no known abuses of the National Security And then there was an inspector general investigation just to see whether there had been any abuse of these National Security  The report came back from the inspector general that there were potentially thousands of abuses of the National Security Letters where an FBI agent just sent the letter and, under the Fourth Amendment under our Constitution, there was no probable cause that a crime was committed.                              {time}  2030  There was no evidence that this individual committed a crime. The FBI agent just wanted to find out more about this person; maybe do a fishing exercise to see if there might be something that the FBI agent might investigate.  Perhaps the FBI agent, maybe he didn't like somebody in the community, so he wanted to see if there was anything out there, maybe in his banking records, or in his dealings with other companies. So he sends a national security letter, says give me all the documents you have on this person.  In my mind, that is a violation of every American's constitutional rights. It was a gross deviation from propriety. It violated what FBI Director Mueller told us about how the NSLs were being used as an investigatory tool, and a lot of us got very upset. And I think, to a large degree, that is why the Attorney General ended up stepping down.  In retrospect, it really should have been Robert Mueller who stepped down. They were his FBI agents. He failed to control; he failed to provide proper supervision. And I can't help but think perhaps a contributing factor, maybe the contributing factor to all of the widespread abuses of this power that Congress gave the Justice Department could well have been, probably was because FBI Director Robert Mueller decided to get rid of thousands of years of experience.  These are the agents, the supervisors, the people with the most experience that could have told a younger, inexperienced FBI agent: You may be tempted to do this, but that would be an abuse. Don't even try it. Don't even go there.  But because Mueller had stripped the FBI of thousands of years of experience, there were not the ``gray hairs'' or the ``no hairs'' that were out there to mentor younger FBI agents. Sure, there were some around, but not like there would have been had there been such insecurity or whatever it was that caused FBI Director Robert Mueller to do such terrible damage to the ranks of the  This is a guy that we were told: He will be an absolutely perfect special counsel. Well, I knew as soon as I heard that he was being appointed that this was a mistake; that this is a guy that did such horrendous damage to the FBI's ranks, to their experience level.  In fact, as I mentioned to FBI Director Mueller on one of the occasions where I was given the chance to ask questions during our Judiciary Committee hearing, in essence, I said: Director, do you realize that if you really applied your 5-year up-or-out policy to everyone in the FBI in a supervisory position, since you think it is such a good idea, you, Director Mueller, would have had to have left before September of 2006?  But instead of being consistent in the way he treated himself as he treated such invaluable FBI agents when he ran them off for no reason other than possibly insecurity, not only did he serve 10 years as FBI Director, which was an insult to all of those he ran off after 5 years, but then President Obama said: Hey, I am going to extend you 2 years.  An ethical, fair man, I believe, would have said: I am sorry, President Obama, but I was so vicious in the way I implemented this 5-year up-or-out policy and ran so many good agents off, it would be inappropriate, not only for me to have served 10 years, but to add 2 years on top of that, 12 years. But Robert Mueller did not do that. He was not fair across the board. He was not consistent.  That brings me back to--here is a report, March 15 of 2012, by NPR, the headline is: ``Report: Prosecutors Hid Evidence in Ted Stevens Case.''  Now, Ted Stevens, as I recall, was the longest serving Republican in the Senate back in 2008. Senator Stevens was running for re-election, and he was considered by many to be one of the most ethical, upright Senators out of the 100 who were in the U.Yet Mueller's FBI decided, apparently, to take out this patriotic, honest, honorable U.Senator by what I consider to be abuse of the justice system.  This article from NPR says, it starts with this:  ``A blistering report released Thursday found that the government team concealed documents that would have helped the late Stevens, a longtime Republican Senator from Alaska, defend himself against false-statements charges in 2008. Stevens lost his Senate seat as the scandal played out, and he died in a plane crash 2 years later.  ``The 500-page report by investigator Henry Schuelke III shook the legal community, as law professors described it as a milestone in the history of prosecutorial misconduct.  ``Investigators weren't talking But Brendan Sullivan, who defended the Senator, had plenty to say. `The extent of the corruption is shocking,' Sullivan says. `It's the worst misconduct we've seen in a generation by prosecutors at the Department of Justice.''  But it is important to note, Mr.Speaker, that this was an FBI case, and it is difficult to believe that the Director of the FBI would have not been personally monitoring, if not personally dictating instructions in such a politically sensitive case as a long-term, sitting U.Senator; that if you are going to use and manipulate the Department of Justice to take out a U.Senator, you should be extraordinarily sure that you have a legitimate case.  But I don't have the information that would indicate what briefings FBI Director Mueller had over the investigation, but I would humbly submit, Mr.Speaker, either Director Mueller got regular briefings on the investigation and development of the case against Senator Ted Stevens, or he was incompetent in not even bothering to keep abreast of developments in a case that would be so politically sensitive.  But this article says: ``The report''--by the Inspector General--``is based on a review of 128,000 documents and interviews with prosecutors and FBI agents on the hot seat.''  But sadly, the FBI, under Mueller, pushed this case, this investigation, to a head so that it was capable of being tried before the 2008 election in November and, in fact, Stevens was convicted just days before the election, and then I believe he only lost the race for Senate by a couple of thousand votes or so.  But the report says that prosecutors should have shared information that might have obliterated the witness' credibility against Stevens, and they had evidence that their key witness had told the same story 55 different times; but that the FBI got evidence that their key witness had had a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl and then asked the girl to lie about it under oath. And so it is easy to see how he would have been manipulated.  But after telling the story that would have acquitted Ted Stevens, as he should have been acquitted we now know from all the evidence, actually, they were able to push the witness into changing his story immediately before trial in order to testify against Stevens.[[Page H1604]]  Like I said, we do not know exactly what Mueller knew, didn't know, but he surely had to know when the FBI agent who was assisting his supervisor in the case, when he did an affidavit, signed it under penalty of perjury, indicating the improprieties of the agent in charge of the case, which is named Kepner, Director Mueller had to have known that one of his agents said: I cannot live with this prosecutorial misconduct. This is figuratively what he said.  The agent in charge, the FBI agent in charge, hid evidence that would have proved what I believe, beyond a reasonable doubt, Ted Stevens was not guilty. Not just raised a reasonable doubt; would have proved he was not guilty.  As the Alaska Dispatch News asked in their headline from their article in September 2016--actually, June 6, 2012, then updated September 2016, their headline asked: ``Why is lead FBI agent in botched Ted Stevens case still employed?''  So we do know, under Mueller's FBI, that he did such horrific damage, running off thousands of years of experience, years later, after one FBI agent had such pangs of conscience that an innocent man, Ted Stevens, was convicted when he was 100 percent not guilty, the agent that was the whistleblower had been run off from the That had to have been with Mueller's consent. He was removed from every criminal case, which means you need to get out because you are not going to have a job.  Yet the agent, Kepner, who was in charge of the investigation, manufactured evidence, hid evidence, according to these reports, and she was still working in the criminal division of the  So when anybody talks to me about how fair and ethical and upright Robert Mueller is, I don't buy it. I have seen the damage he did to the I have seen the damage he created by not allowing his FBI agents to be trained to recognize radical  Sure, after the FBI got notice under Mueller that Tsarnaev, the Boston bomber, had been radicalized and he was a threat to lives and U.security, oh, yeah; they sent out an FBI agent to talk to him. And apparently he said: Oh, no, I am not a terrorist.  And then they went the extra step to talk to his mother who said: Oh, no, he is a good boy. He is not a terrorist.  But because of Robert Mueller placating the Council on American-Islamic Relations that was a named party co-conspirator supporting terrorism, he placated CAIR, and he had the training materials for our FBI agents purged so they didn't know what to look for. That is the reason the Boston bombers were on the loose. He needs to resign and go home.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-14-pt1-PgH1601.txt,1801,"ECONOMIC GROWTH, REGULATORY RELIEF, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT--",2018.0,14.0,January

I guess to borrow a bit from Shakespeare's account of what Marc Antony said: I come not to bury Marcy Kaptur, but to praise her.  I got to know Marcy back during the economic disaster where investment banks brought us to the brink of ruin. And though we come from different backgrounds and we have different ideas at times about the best way to go forward, I always know that Marcy Kaptur will be honest with me, that she cares deeply about the country, and that is her driving concern. It is actually easy to talk to people in this body--even across the aisle--when their driving concern is in the best interest of the country.  We shared a passion back after the problems in late 2008, in that I saw someone who was ethical and actually righteous who wanted to see that those who caused the problem that brought us to the brink of ruin were not rewarded, and that also we didn't end up punishing those who had no fault.  I am still concerned that she and I were not able to see that the problems were not rewarded and the innocent were not punished. I am not real proud of how our parties together responded to that crisis, but through all of that, and in the years intervening since, actually 10 years--it was back in 2008--I have come to build my respect for Marcy Kaptur and know that this is somebody--agree or disagree, and we often disagree--but she is going to be honest, and that she has that passion in her heart to do what is best for the country.                              {time}  2000  There are people who have attributed the comment to different people over the years.

So here on the floor, it is important that we hear from each other and we get different viewpoints in arriving at what is best for the country. But one thing I have grown to understand and know is that when I talk to Marcy Kaptur, it is somebody who I know will be straightforward, agree or disagree, will be honest, and will be honorable; and that is not a bad way to approach things.

971,topic-id,428,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.4909, the STOP School Violence Act of 2018. Violence at our schools makes students feel vulnerable in a place where they should feel comfortable to learn, grow, and be happy.  To curb violence at our Nation's schools, the STOP School Violence Act provides a multilayered approach to identify threats and prevent violence from taking place on school grounds.  It provides much-needed resources to train students, teachers, and law enforcement officers on how to recognize and quickly respond to warning signs, and provides funding for technology to keep schools safe.  Eighty percent of school shooters told someone of their violent plans or exhibited warning signs. The bill before us today will ensure that students,[[Page H1560]]teachers, and law enforcement will learn how to identify at-risk behaviors, properly assess threats, and intervene appropriately before a tragedy strikes.  The STOP School Violence Act provides funding for training to prevent student violence against others and self, including training for local law enforcement officers, school personnel, and students.  Prevention training gives students and school personnel the ability to recognize and respond quickly to warning signs of school violence and includes active shooter training.  The bill provides funding for technology and equipment to improve school security and prevent attacks. This includes the development and operation of anonymous reporting systems, such as mobile apps, a hotline, and a website. Funding may also be used for metal detectors, locks, lighting, and other technologies to keep schools safe.  The bill also supports the acquisition and installation of technology for expedited notification of local law enforcement during an emergency.  The legislation also contains funding for school threat assessment and crisis intervention teams so that school personnel can respond to threats before they materialize.  Finally, the STOP School Violence Act provides funding to support law enforcement coordination efforts and, in particular, those officers who already staff schools.  The version of the bill before us today is the result of a collaborative effort of many of my colleagues who worked with Mr.Rutherford to incorporate many of their ideas.  I would like to point out the important contributions of Representatives Susan Brooks, Coffman, Chabot, Granger, Rodney Davis, Messer, and Bost, including many key elements of legislation that they have introduced into this bill that have made the bill stronger.  Finally, I want to thank Mr.Rutherford and the bipartisan group of cosponsors for their work on this important bill, and I urge my colleagues to support H.4909.

546,topic-id,492,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of 676, to urge support for this bipartisan resolution to help stop terror.  Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce and my good friend Ranking Member Eliot Engel for their leadership on this issue, and I am glad that this bipartisan resolution has proceeded swiftly to a vote on the House floor.  Mr.Speaker, the revolution of 1979 marked an enormous step backwards for global security and for the basic rights of the Iranian people, the longest suffering victims of this corrupt terrorist regime.  From its very beginnings, the Islamic Republic of Iran, under the control of its Supreme Leaders, has repeatedly violated the fundamental human rights of its own citizens.  In August, the U.Special Reporter on the Situation of Human Rights in Iran highlighted the Khamenei regime's many ongoing abuses, ``including the arbitrary detention and prosecution of individuals for their legitimate exercise of a broad range of rights; the persecution of human rights defenders, journalists, students, trade union leaders, and artists; a high level of executions, including of juvenile offenders; the use of torture and ill treatment; widespread violations of the right to a fair trial and due process of law, especially before revolutionary courts; and a high level of discrimination against women and religious and ethnic minorities.''  Beginning late last month, protestors across the country have taken to the streets to decry their dismal economic prospects; Iran's costly, aggressive, and destabilizing actions throughout the region; and an antidemocratic regime that stifles their rights and aspirations and supports terror. These brave men and women, engaged in peaceful demonstrations, have every right to demand change from their corrupt and oppressive terrorist government.  While Iranians live under a brutal, authoritarian mullahcracy at home, their government insists on bankrolling terror throughout the region. Iran has capitalized on sanctions relief, bolstering its arsenal of conventional arms and its illegal ballistic missile program, and increasing the funding of heinous terrorist organizations and proxies in Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq, as well as propping up the murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad in  As the world's leading sponsor of terror, Iran provides more than $800 million, annually, to Hezbollah and recently renewed its support for Iranian-backed forces are also attempting to gain a foothold in Syria, right up against Israel's border, to threaten our vital ally and the leading democracy in the region.  There should be nothing partisan about having the backs of brave men and women anywhere who risk death to speak out for what is right and against a terrorist regime. This bipartisan resolution condemns the regime's censorship, violent crackdowns, and systematic repression. We must send a clear message to Iran that its destructive behavior throughout the Middle East will not be tolerated.  Mr.Speaker, the time has come for the people of Iran to enjoy their fundamental right to a peaceful and democratic government. I urge each of my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan resolution to help stop terror.

48,topic-id,1300,"Mr.President, I rise with my colleagues to offer remarks about the current status of the negotiations on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA Program, as it is known in the U. Unfortunately, this body still isn't closer to a legitimate and fair deal that accomplishes two goals: First of all, to promote and protect the interests of the American people in a lawful immigration system and, two, provide a fair and equitable solution on  Back in December, I introduced a bill, along with Senators Cornyn, Tillis, Lankford, Perdue, and The bill, with the acronym SECURE Act of 2017, was a product of months of discussion between this Senator, these other Senators I just named, and the White Our plan, simply put, has five pillars.  First, based on the hard work and leadership of Senator Cornyn, our bill provided real, robust border security by mandating the construction of tactical and technological infrastructure at the border.  Second, our bill took meaningful steps to end the lawlessness of dangerous criminal aliens by cracking down on sanctuary cities, ending the misguided catch-and-release policies of the previous administration, and, finally, taking steps to address intentional visa overstays.  Third, our bill took steps to eliminate many of the ``pull'' factors that encourage people to immigrate illegally by permanently authorizing the E-Verify Program and by taking meaningful steps to reduce immigration court and asylum adjudication backlogs.  Fourth, thanks to the leadership and advocacy of Senators Graham, Perdue, and Cotton, our bill eliminated the phenomenon known as chain migration and made a major downpayment toward transitioning to a merit-based immigration system.  Fifth, and finally, our bill provided a bipartisan solution to protect undocumented young people brought to the United States as children by adopting Senator Durbin's Bar Removal of Individuals who Dream and Grow our Economy--that has the acronym BRIDGE  Our plan was fair, serious, and bipartisan. Most importantly, it was and is pro-As I have continually said since the bill's introduction, this group of Senators is ready and willing to negotiate with our counterparts in good faith and to find an equitable solution to the DACA situation that incorporates our bill's five pillars of reform.  I said negotiate. I had at least one Democratic Senator infer that I could not negotiate in good faith because I did not vote for the Gang of 8 immigration bill in 2013. So, sadly, our good-faith offers have consistently been rejected by Democratic leadership. Instead, they decide to engage in a game of brinksmanship.  So I ask several questions: Why doesn't Democratic leadership negotiate with us? Because we refuse to simply pass what is referred to as the Dream Act, as is, with no proportional border security and interior enforcement majors. As the Democrats see it, it is take it or leave it, their way or the highway. This isn't good faith, this isn't negotiating, and that approach is doomed to failure.  I have to ask: Why do my colleagues in the Democratic leadership refuse to even consider measures that would beef up border security and interior enforcement? Do they want people to continue to immigrate to this country illegally? Do they want sex offenders and human traffickers to continue to manipulate[[Page S54]]our porous border and enter our country unchecked? Do they want criminal illegal immigrants--people like Jose Zarate, who murdered Kate Steinle, or Eswin Mejia, who killed Sarah Root, to roam free in our country? Are they comfortable allowing criminal alien gangs like MS-13, whose motto happens to be ``kill, rape, and control,'' to continue to terrorize immigrant communities?  I am assuming--in fact, I am hoping--the answer to all of these questions is a resounding no. If that is correct, then why does Democratic leadership refuse to discuss the border security and interior enforcement provisions in the SECURE Act?  Despite the hysteria and the hyperbole you may hear from pro-amnesty, open-border immigrant advocates, the SECURE Act does not contain draconian enforcement measures. If anything, our bill contains the commonsense security and enforcement measures this body has been debating, discussing, and considering for years.  Our bill adds new Border Patrol agents, U.attorneys, and judges to make it easier to apprehend, prosecute, and deport illegal entrants and criminal aliens. We authorize money for critically necessary port of entry and exit improvements so we can know who is here, how long they are here, and when they left--if they left.  Our bill increases criminal penalties for human smugglers, these offenses that are committed by repeat offenders, often resulting in death, resulting in human trafficking, and including even sexual assault. We also increase penalties for criminal aliens who commit a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime.  Our bill makes clear that individuals who engage in acts of terrorism, criminal gang members, aggravated felons, and drunk drivers are not admissible to our country, and makes it clear that they can be put into expedited removal if they somehow make it into our country.  Finally, our bill permanently authorizes the voluntary E-Verify Program, and it also provides incentives for employers to participate in that voluntary program. It doesn't make E-Verify mandatory. It just provides employers certainty by making the program permanent.  I hope, as I described these things, they are seen as commonsense measures. Why would my colleagues on the other side ever want to oppose those provisions? It wasn't that long ago that many Democrats supported border security and interior enforcement. I would like to list some quotes from recent Democratic Presidents who supported some of these propositions.  In his 1996 State of the Union Address, then-President Clinton championed his actions to crack down on illegal immigration. He proudly noted his administration was ``increasing border patrol by 50 percent . . . [and] increasing inspections to prevent the hiring of illegal immigrants.''  In 2006, then-Senator, later President Obama spoke in favor of enhanced border security and enforcement measures. He acknowledged, even then, that ``we need tougher border security, stronger enforcement measures . . . [we] need more resources for Customs and Border Agents, and more detention beds.''  When speaking in favor of the Secure Fence Act, Mr.Obama said: It would ``certainly do some good'' and would go a long way in ``stem[ming] . . . the tide of illegal immigration in this country.''  Do my colleagues no longer agree with former Presidents Clinton and Obama? Do they no longer believe we need to stem the tide of illegal immigration?  My colleagues on the other side consistently talk about how DACA kids shouldn't be used as bargaining chips for any potential deal. What about the innocent American citizens they are using as bargaining chips? What about the thousands of victims every year of crimes committed by dangerous criminal aliens? Do the lives of these people not matter as well? Does the safety of these people, the happiness of these people, the well-being of these people deserve to be bargained away?  This group of Senators whom I have named who are going to participate in this colloquy remain ready and willing to negotiate in good faith and to make tough sacrifices in order to find common ground on this issue. Our counterparts need to be willing to do the same. I am asking them, pleading with them, in all sincerity, to sit down and have an honest conversation.  Let's strike a deal that is fair to all, including to law-abiding Any deal cooked up by this poor man's version of a Gang of 8 that doesn't have real border security, doesn't have real interior enforcement measures, and doesn't have the other pillars of reform in the SECURE Act--well, it is pretty simple: That is no deal at all, and I will not support that.

1748,topic-id,1356,"Madam President, I rise today to bring to my colleagues' attention an issue that is important to millions of individuals who understand that American citizenship is something that ought to be treasured.  The American people understand that our citizenship is a blessing and shouldn't be given away cheaply. Unfortunately, for too many years, this body has witnessed the perversion and degradation of a program that sells--yes, we sell citizenship to some people.  This program originally had a good purpose. In return for investing money in underserved areas and creating good-paying American jobs, immigrant entrepreneurs could eventually become U.citizens. Sadly, in the last decade, this program has been hijacked by big-moneyed New York City real estate interests--to be specific, the Real Estate These developers now take almost all the foreign investment from this program, and for the last few years, they have actively prevented this body from enacting any reforms and needed reforms.  For those who are not aware, I am talking about the EB-5 Regional Center I have been fighting in a bipartisan way for years to reform this corrupt and scandal-clad program. I have been fighting to protect our national security, to ensure foreign investment is going to the most deserving areas, and to make sure that American citizenship isn't sold at rock-bottom prices in order to feed the addiction of New York interests to cheap money. But no matter how hard I fought, each and every time we tried to reform this program, these same moneyed interests have used their political influence and political connections to block any meaningful reforms. This is sickening and is exactly why most American people sometimes question what we do here in Washington,  After more than 3 years of trying to fix this broken and scandal-plagued program, I have finally come to the conclusion that it can't be fixed, and since it can't be fixed, the EB-5 Regional Center Program needs to be terminated. Let me explain to my colleagues and directly to the American people exactly how I have reached that conclusion.  Several years ago, I started working with then-Ranking Member Leahy of the Judiciary Committee on reforms to the EB-5 Regional Center Through the hard work and dedication of our staffers, we discovered the program is riddled with fraud and corruption and poses a real and serious threat to our national security. I will explain some of those things we discovered.  First, investments can be spent before business plans are approved.  Next, regional center operators can charge excessive fees of foreign nationals in addition to their required investments.  Next, none of the jobs created have to be direct or verifiable jobs but rather are indirect and based on estimates of economic modeling; again, not knowing for sure if jobs are created.  Next, investment funds from foreign sources are not adequately vetted. Gifts and loans from anyone are acceptable sources of funds from foreign nationals.  Next, there is no prohibition against foreign governments owning or operating these regional centers or projects. So let me emphasize--that is right--foreign governments can own businesses that sell our citizenship. Now, think about that.  Another problem is regional centers don't have to certify that they comply with security laws.  Next, there are no required background checks on anyone associated with the regional centers.  Just take this example: One need look no further than the indictment last September of two Chinese fraudsters who stole more than $50 million in foreign investment and managed to sell U.citizenship to individuals on the Chinese Government's most wanted list.  Next, gerrymandering continues in rural and urban distressed areas and, as a result, lose out.  There is no transparency on how funds are spent and who is paid and what investors are told about the projects they invest in.  The list can still go on and on and on, but I have given my colleagues just some examples. I could literally speak for hours about the corruption of the program.  Faced with this appalling list of fraud, corruption, and national security loopholes, for 3 years, I have been working with Senator Leahy and our counterparts in the House of Representatives to produce real EB-5 reform. Our staffers have spent countless hours, nights, and weekends meeting with congressional colleagues and industry stakeholders to hammer out a compromise that is fair to all sides, but our offers have constantly been rejected by the Big Money industries, and related real estate roundtables, every single time--not just this time. We reached a compromise with the vast differences of views to start out but still ended up with a compromise. Somehow, these powerful interests are able step in and stop it. This time has been no different than at least three previous times we have gotten this far.  Let me explain how we have been doing this. For the last year, my staff, along with Chairman Goodlatte of the House Judiciary Committee, Senator Cornyn, and Senator Flake--these teams have worked around the clock to produce an EB-5 reform package. Everyone made numerous concessions in order to reach a compromise. After more than 20 meetings, and of course countless hours of drafting, we produced a reform package that was fair to all sides. Our reforms would reauthorize the Regional Center Program for 6 years, providing the certainty that industry has long said it craves.  Our compromise would have permanently set aside 3,000 visas for rural and underserved urban areas and would have increased the minimum investment amount to $925,000. In recognition of longstanding industry concerns, we agreed to reduce the investment differential between nonpriority areas and priority areas to a mere $100,000.  Finally, we would have implemented a host of badly needed integrity measures that would have cracked down on investment fraud, cracked down on foreign corruption, and cracked down on bad business practices.  Our reforms had the unanimous support of Invest in the USA, the largest EB-5 trade association. Our reforms had the support of the EB-5 Rural Alliance, a group working to ensure that rural America has a fair shake at attracting EB-5 money.  Why are rural areas such a high concern? Because, quite frankly, way back in the 1990s, that was one of the goals of the EB-5 program--to help economic development in rural America, but these reforms weren't acceptable to the Big Money New York industry stakeholders that currently dominate the program. Because Big Money interests aren't happy with these reforms, we have been told they will not become law.  I have laid out a lot here, letting it sink in for a minute. In spite of the fact that reforms were agreed to by[[Page S1779]]congressional offices and had the support of the largest EB-5 trade association, they will not become law because a few EB-5 businesses, with lots and lots of money and lots and lots of political power, have used their political connections and influence, once again--for the third time; maybe even the fourth time over a period of that many years--to reach some sort of reform on a program we have demonstrated--I shouldn't say we have demonstrated--we have repeated what the FBI and national security people and people in the Justice Department have said about the shortcomings of this program.  I said, at the beginning of my remarks, I finally realize this program cannot be reformed. I would have to say this for my present ranking member, Senator Feinstein, she has been telling me that for three or four years: Forget about reforming it; we ought to do away with it. The Regional Center Program is simply too corrupted to be saved, and it needs to be ended.  The American people deserve better than what we are seeing as a result of hard-working Members of the House and Senate trying to reform this program and getting nothing done.  So what happens here at the last minute? It will get stuck in an omnibus appropriations bill to extend it again for a period of time with the same bad practices that are going on. Why does that have to happen when it is so obvious what is wrong?  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Moran).

87,topic-id,343,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Today, we are debating a bill package that follows a very familiar playbook for House Republican leadership.  This bill package is just the latest attempt by my Republican colleagues to push a highly partisan agenda by combining that divisive proposal with noncontroversial items.  Today's bill includes two bills that passed Senate and House Natural Resources Committee by unanimous consent.  One of these bills would make a technical correction to a previously passed Tribal water settlement, and the other would clarify that two pueblos in New Mexico should receive equal treatment when leasing their lands.  Unfortunately, instead of quickly passing these bills and suspensions and sending them to the President to be signed into law, House Republican leadership has decided to take those two bills hostage and combine them with a highly divisive bill that is likely not going anywhere--H.986, section 3 of this legislation--which I do not support.  This political stunt seems doomed to fail. The only thing it will accomplish is wasting everyone's time.  Meanwhile, a list of bills that are critical to Tribes across the country sit in the Natural Resources Committee and are just ignored by the majority.  For example, we could be moving legislation that would protect and preserve Native American cultural artifacts, or legislation that would address issues at Indian Health Service, or legislation to codify meaningful and robust Tribal consultation process; or we could be here today passing the bipartisan bill known as the ``clean'' Carcieri fix.  These bills deserve attention. They are promoted by not only Indian Country, but many, many Members in a bipartisan fashion in this  I hope we can move past these petty political games soon, which people are, rightfully, sick of having to see.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues across the aisle to change course and stop blocking consensus bills from moving through this body by conjoining them with divisive, contentious proposals.

1802,topic-id,1501,"Mr.Speaker, on September 5 of last year, the day after Labor Day, the temperature was 86 degrees in Washington, D.C., so that was a long time ago. On that date, President Trump and his henchmen announced that they were killing the DACA program.  The next day, meeting with my Democratic colleagues, I said I would not support any spending or budget bills that didn't include a Dream Act or some other serious attempt to put Dreamers with DACA in a safe place. That was 6 months ago, and we are right back where we started.  The Republicans have a bill to cut legal immigration and abandon the Dreamers in some semilegal limbo, and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee had a press conference about it yesterday and is touting his bill as the last chance to get something done about  No, this will not resolve We will not support it in exchange for it.  What the chairman did not mention is that his bill is actually about something else: it is about changing the racial makeup of America's immigrants so that more of them are White and fewer of them are from countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin  Analysis by the Center for Global Development of Goodlatte's proposal states the following: ``Hispanic and Black immigrants would be roughly twice as likely to be barred by the immigration cuts as white immigrants.''  The legal immigration cuts would bar the majority of Muslim and Catholic immigrants from coming legally to the United States of  While the President keeps saying that he wants a better class of immigrants coming to America, the cuts would actually substantially reduce the number of university graduate immigrants.  The Goodlatte bill would expand some work visas, but we would only add one university graduate for every seven workers removed by eliminating the family visas and diversity visas.  Now, tell me, how does cutting out hardworking immigrants and guaranteeing that the only available avenue to come and work in America is an illegal one, how does that protect Dreamers? It doesn't.  We are once again chasing bad policies down a rabbit hole, because the real agenda on the other side of the aisle is to leverage the national concern over the plight of Dreamers into a radical reordering of legal immigration to make it whiter.  That is not the agenda of my party and, frankly, not the agenda of my fellow So, with more than 80 of my colleagues, we will release a letter today at a press conference we wrote to the leaders of both parties in the House and the House appropriators. It echos what I started saying 6 months ago: we need a budget or spending measure that includes the Dream Act, a clean Dream Act, and that is it.  This week or next week, we all know we need to pass a budget to keep the government open, and Democrats are clear: our country, our Congress, and our leaders need to figure out how Dreamers get to live in the country they grew up in, the country they love, the country that has invested so much in them and received so much from them.  Don't be lulled into a false sense of security. The Federal courts didn't settle this or give us a permanent solution. They just gave a lot of lawmakers a convenient excuse for inaction.  I am not buying it and neither should you, because also in the spending bill there are likely to be billions of dollars for deportation, detention, breaking up families, and breaking down doors in neighborhoods across the country. That is why our letter says we do not only want a clean Dream Act included in the omnibus, but we want to reduce funding appropriated to DHS' detention and deportation machine, specifically funding for detention beds, deportation agents operating under ICE or CBP, and an end to border militarization.  We oppose any funding that expands the construction of walls or fencing at the southern border. We should, instead, allocate border security resources to modernize the infrastructure and technology at our ports of entry, which would actually benefit our country and our economy.  Mr.Speaker, 6 months after Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions instigated this crisis by proclaiming their desire to deport Dreamers and kicking their safety and security in our Nation to this do-nothing Congress, we now have what could be the last opportunity to actually take permanent legislative action.  Do not be distracted by the President's nativist agenda or the bills in Congress that seek to implement his nationalist view. Do not give up on taking action that is serious and will actually protect Dreamers and the communities that they live in, and do not allow the deportation and family destruction machine to thrive and grow on our watch.  We must take a stand right here, right now, and stand up for what is right and what is beneficial for our I am proud to stand with the majority of Americans and 83 colleagues who have joined me on this letter. The time is now.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 83 Members to House leadership and appropriators.                                Congress of the United States,                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2018.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Rodney Frelinghuysen,     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,     House of Representatives, Washington,     Nita Lowey,     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations,     House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, Chairman Frelinghuysen,      and Ranking Member Lowey: With the newest government funding      deadline on March 23, 2018 looming, tens of thousands of      Dreamers continue to lose their protection from deportation      since President Trump rescinded the Deferred Action for      Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program on September 5, 2017. And      while numerous stopgap measures to fund the government have      been enacted since September of last year, zero legislative      action has been taken to protect Dreamers permanently.      Congress is long overdue in acting on this issue, and the      failure to pass the Dream Act has resulted in countless lives      put in peril. Meanwhile the Department of Homeland Security      (DHS) tears families apart by targeting Dreamers, long-term      residents, asylum-seekers, families and children for      detention and deportation. As the negotiations for the Fiscal      Year (FY) 2018 Omnibus Appropriations bill are ongoing, we      urge you to:       (1) include the bipartisan Dream Act;       (2) reduce funding appropriated to DHS's detention and      deportation machine, specifically funding for detention beds,      deportation agents operating under Immigration and Customs      Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP),      and border militarization; and       (3) oppose any funding that expands the construction of      walls or fencing at the southern border, and to instead      allocate border security resources to modernize the      infrastructure and technology at our ports of entry.       The appropriations for ICE and CBP have come at      significant, detrimental cost to our communities throughout      the country because all immigrants are in the crosshairs of      the Trump Administration's mass deportation agenda. When      agents for both ICE and CBP operate without any discretion or      regard to length of residence in the U.and deep ties in      our communities, the fear and mistrust in our neighborhoods      is heightened. It is an abuse of ICE and CBP funds to rip      fathers from U.citizen children and tear severely ill      children or young infants from their parents' arms. Now more      than ever, we cannot fund the detention and deportation of      valued members of our communities on the border and in the      interior and vulnerable individuals and families seeking      refuge in our country, especially when the key components of      DHS that enforce our nation's immigration laws operate with      negligible oversight.       As Congressional leaders, we must exercise our powers      responsibly to protect the[[Page H1547]]     Dreamers through legislative action and to wield our power of      the purse to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security      does not make immigrant families and communities casualties      of a reckless, indiscriminate detention and deportation      machine.

1935,topic-id,1032,"Mr.Speaker, last week I wrote a letter to Jay Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, asking him about this guy.  This is Carl Icahn, the billionaire, financier, and buddy of our President Donald  It seems that he had a massive amount of stock in a company that sells cranes and equipment, which, in case you didn't know, are made of a lot of steel. Then all of a sudden, Mr.Icahn sold his position in the crane and equipment maker; and 1 week later, his friend, buddy, pal, and fellow billionaire, Donald Trump, announced he was proposing import tariffs on steel and aluminum.  Now, we all know what happens to the stock of companies heavily dependent on steel and aluminum when the President announces he will impose new tariffs. Their stock prices go down a lot.  So I guess you could say that Carl Icahn was lucky to unload his shares, valued at, at least, $31 million, just before the President made his announcement, but I suspect that luck had nothing to do with it.  Here is a Trump insider making a gigantic decision on tens of millions of dollars, and we are just supposed to believe it is a coincidence.  Sorry, but I am not buying it.  So I wrote the chairman of the SEC to request that he investigate. I have not heard back from him, but I hope after he hears this speech, he might have a change of mind.  In the letter, I said: ``The announcement of tariffs on the heels of Mr.Icahn's stock sale is highly suspicious. The close relationship between the President and Mr.Icahn adds to the appearance of wrongdoing.''  So I think the SEC has an obligation to investigate, because it looks bad. We are talking about the President of the United States, and the people have a right to know that things are on the up and up.  Let's remember that Mr.Icahn left as an adviser to Trump at the White House because, we are told, it would raise difficult conflicts of interest, and presumably, just like the President, Mr.Icahn was not interested in selling off part of his empire just so he could appear impartial and demonstrate core integrity to the American people.  The President, who many of us think is profiting illegally from the office--and we have filed Articles of Impeachment because of it--seems to attract a lot of people with deep pockets and shallow reserves of judgment to his side.  Mr.Icahn, who was a notorious corporate raider and vulture capitalist during the Clinton boom years of the 1990s, appears to me and a lot of others to fit this mold.  If there is nothing to hide in this deal, then the investigation will be quick and that will be that, but simply saying this multimillion-dollar stroke of luck was just a coincidence is not flying; not with me, anyway.  Do you know the rigorous reporting of assets that we as House Members have to do to fully disclose our debts and investments?  And all those disclosures are available to the public, and the press goes over them with a fine-tooth comb. Every time a Member of Congress buys or sells a security over $1,000, we have to file a form, and then that gets shared with the public. And if we are late with the filing of the paperwork, we have to pay a fine.  This may seem burdensome, but the important goal here is transparency and to ensure that Members are not using insider information they have access to t personally enrich themselves.  If I was as lucky as Carl Icahn to make a stock trade that my friend had the power to tell me the inside information on and it resulted in me making millions of dollars or avoiding losing millions of dollars, well, let's see, there would be investigative reporters, hearings, an Ethics Committee report, maybe even criminal charges. But for Mr.Icahn and his buddy, the President, nothing; at least not yet.  Let's demand that the friends who circle the White House and the Trump businesses provide the American people with answers and transparency. That is all we ask so that we can have greater confidence in our President and his family that they are not running a kleptocracy like we see in Russia, where those who govern are simply governing to make money.  Mr.Speaker, no tax returns; very little in the way of disclosure; recusals that don't seem to actually be recusals; hotel and business conflicts of interest; and the strong odor of something fishy;[[Page H1612]]those close to the President who are making millions, apparently because of the proximity to the President; those people demand scrutiny from watchdog agencies; and, in this case, it requires an investigation of Carl Icahn by the  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record my letter to the Honorable Jay Clayton, the chairman of the U.Securities and Exchange Commission, of last week.                                    Congress of the United States,                                     House of Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 2018.     Jay Clayton,     Chairman, U.Securities and Exchange Commission,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Clayton: I write to request that you and your      agency immediately investigate possible illegal insider      trading by Mr.Carl Icahn, a longtime friend of President      Donald Trump, who according to his SEC filings sold $31.3      million worth of stock in a company heavily dependent on      steel just days before the President announced plans to      impose import tariffs on steel and aluminum.       According to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)      filings submitted in February, Mr.Icahn disclosed that he      sold nearly 1 million shares of Manitowoc Company, Inc.,      which is heavily dependent on steel to manufacture cranes and      lifts. Approximately seven days later, his good friend      President Trump announced plans to impose steep tariffs on      steel imports. On that news, Manitowoc stock plunged and lost      6% of its value, but Mr.Icahn had already cashed out.       The announcement of tariffs on the heels of Mr.Icahn's      stock sale is highly suspicious. The close relationship      between the President and Mr.Icahn adds to the appearance of      wrongdoing. This is also not the first time Mr.Icahn has      been suspected of using his relationship with the President      for his personal benefit.

2086,topic-id,825,"Mr.Speaker, next Tuesday, March 20, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments for the case NIFLA v. At issue is a California law that requires medically licensed pro-life pregnancy centers to advertise for and to promote the abortion industry by posting notices alerting clients that the State of California provides free or low-cost abortions.[[Page H1589]]  This law blatantly violates the Free Speech Clause of the First The government may never compel anyone, including pregnancy centers, to make statements with which they disagree. This is clearly and blatantly unconstitutional, and courts across the Nation agree.  When abortionists sought to compel the speech of pregnancy centers in other jurisdictions, their laws were not allowed to stand. In fact, in 2009, in my home State of Maryland, a Baltimore city ordinance required pregnancy centers to post signs in their waiting rooms stating that they do not refer for abortions. This January, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that this law is unconstitutional. Judge Wilkinson said that the ordinance compels ``a politically and religiously motivated group to convey a message fundamentally at odds with its core belief and its mission.''  Similar laws have been tried in Austin, Texas; Montgomery County, Maryland; and New York These laws, too, have been partially or fully invalidated. Even the California law in question has already been found to violate freedom of speech.  While the Federal case was advancing to the Supreme Court, a parallel track was being pursued at the State level. In October of last year, Judge Gloria Trask found that the law violated article I, section 2 of the California In fact, she granted an injunction that prevents California from enforcing the law. She said the ``speech required by the FACT Act is unquestionably compelled and content based.'' It forces the clinic to point the way to the abortion clinic and can leave patients with the belief that they were referred to an abortion clinic provider by that pro-life pregnancy center.                              {time}  1815  Now, instead of seeking to silence pro-life pregnancy centers, people in every community should celebrate and support their work. They provide vital free or low-cost care to vulnerable women and children. So today we are here to talk about how pro-life pregnancy centers help mothers in our communities, giving them real choice.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.LaMalfa), who organized this Special Order with me, for comments he might make.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I am proud and pleased to join with Harris in this effort. Now, at this point, 130 of our colleagues have signed on to the petition to the Supreme Court to let them know that we believe this is morally wrong.  What we have: Again, as a California legislator, I have experience with the efforts our State legislators have done in the past and currently with Assembly Bill 775, which is known as the Reproductive FACT Act--fact, indeed--as Harris mentioned, requiring licensed medical centers that offer free pro-life help to pregnant women to then have to post written advertisements promoting the availability of free or low-cost abortions subsidized by the State of  It also requires nonmedically licensed centers to note, in multiple languages, that they do not have a medical provider on staff, which is kind of interesting due to the places that provide abortions having lower standards for medical care and standards for the doctors on staff to have to be overseen. It is very interesting, the double standard for that type of healthcare, as you would call it, versus other healthcare centers at abortion clinics. Yet they want to point out that there wouldn't be a medical provider on staff at these pro-life places, which aren't required to have them anyhow.  So the court will consider whether these disclosures required by the Reproductive FACT Act, by the California Legislature, violate the free speech clause of the First Indeed, it is a blatant violation. The government has no business forcing private citizens or anyone else to promote an ideology that violates their beliefs.  The whole purpose of these pregnancy centers is to provide free pro-life help to prospective mothers, not to serve as a billboard for abortions. If anyone needed further proof of the moral degradation in California's State government, this is exhibit  The Supreme Court must set a precedent, as lower courts have already done, as Harris mentioned.

She knew very little about the emotional, physical, or spiritual repercussions of the choice she was considering. She felt alone, told by her boyfriend to ``get rid of it'' or he was gone.

Again, just reminding, as the gentlewoman said, these are centers that provide true resources to women at a time when they are very, very vulnerable. I can't imagine why a city council or a State legislature, or any jurisdiction, or any legislature would want to--what amounts to--close these centers down, because these are people who believe abortion is wrong.                              {time}  1845  They are not going to refer people for abortions. That is the bottom line. They will close their doors before they will send someone to something that they think is morally reprehensible, and the last thing the State should do is compel them to ever do that. Why we would want to close these centers down that are so vital to our communities is a puzzle to me.

In fact, crisis pregnancy centers outnumber abortion clinics three to one. These are valuable resources in anyone's district, in any town, any county.  What is at issue here is, if you had a nonprofit running a recreation center in your neighborhood and it provided resources to troubled teenagers after school, this would be like the State telling that recreation center, ``Do you know what? You have got to promote a certain religion in your recreation center,'' or, ``Do you know what? You have got to put out certain political pamphlets of one political party on your desk when people come in the door.'' We would be incensed with that.

2104,topic-id,1068,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey very much for his comments.  It is a shame that here in the United States, with the freedoms that we have guaranteed in our Constitution, that this even has to come before a court. It is so clear that it is unconstitutional to compel speech against someone's beliefs--political, religious beliefs. These are what our Nation is founded on, and to compel these clinics to do this is something that shouldn't even enter the thoughts of anyone.  Again, we would never compel any other nonprofit existing on donations and the neighborhood providing things to people in those neighborhoods and communities. We wouldn't think of compelling, again, political speech. We wouldn't think of compelling religious activity.  Yet, here, California attempts to compel these volunteers, these clinics, who work on providing such a valuable choice to the women in their community, to essentially refer for an abortion that is against all the deeply held beliefs of these individuals.  Mr.Speaker, I want to read the stories of some of the women who go to these clinics, because this really is about choice. This is about institutions in a community that offer true choice. Now, these are stories from the pregnancy centers in my community.  So let me first tell you about Mr.Speaker, 19-year-old Miranda came to this pregnancy center with her boyfriend and learned she was 9 weeks pregnant. Miranda worked 9 hours a day as a cashier at a Home She, honestly, was not happy with the positive results of her test. She didn't think she could raise a baby, and nobody had any faith in her.  You see, a year earlier, Miranda had had an abortion. She still cries at the recollection and feels the pain of what she had done. She didn't want to make that choice again, but her circumstances hadn't changed, and she felt that that is what she had to do.  Now, the volunteer counselor praised Miranda for working full time and getting her The volunteer counselor explained how Miranda could obtain healthcare, and how that clinic's Earn While You Learn Program would educate her on prenatal care and parenting, as well as provide her with much-needed baby supplies once the baby was born.  Then Miranda saw the fetal models depicting a 9-week-old fetus. She couldn't believe what she was seeing. She asked so many questions, like: When does the heart start beating? Would it be possible for her to hear the beating heart? When does the baby start kicking?  You see, Miranda explained that the abortion clinic she had been to a year before never told her about the development of the baby. She had been 15 weeks pregnant at the time she aborted.  It was so surprising for her to see the truth in those baby models. Nobody ever told her that her baby had been so fully developed. Miranda said that the best part about coming to the pregnancy center was that they ``told her she could do it.'' You see, she had never heard that before. Nobody had ever told her that. She had a real choice now.  Here is a story about When Laura came to the center 2 years ago, she was feeling nauseated and miserable. The timing of her pregnancy couldn't be worse. She had recently discovered that her mother had been diagnosed with late stage liver disease.  Laura, too, was post-abortive. Her previous abortion was a terrible experience that left her emotionally scarred, of course, as it leaves many women.  She didn't want to have another abortion, but felt she had no choice. She wanted to be there for her mom during her mother's time of need.  Now, the volunteer advocate in the clinic spent lots of time just listening to It became clear that Laura[[Page H1595]]really wanted to keep her baby but was lost in trying to figure out how.  Mr.Speaker, this is a recurring story in these pregnancy centers. There is a reason why they used to be called crisis pregnancy centers. These are women frequently in crisis who want to have that choice but don't see the way out of their circumstances.  Well, this counselor helped Laura navigate through the muddy waters of her life and envision a future with her child.  Soon, Laura's fear began to subside. A sonogram revealed a 7-week-old baby. In a tearful voice, Laura said: ``That is my baby.''  Since then, Laura has returned to the center weekly, participating in their prenatal education classes. She actually moved in with her mother so she could help her through her illness. Laura's hope is that her mom will be strong enough to hold the baby and spend her last days on Earth with her grandchild.  Mr.Speaker, that is the kind of hope that pregnancy centers give women and their families. And, often, two lives are saved in these pregnancy centers: the child's and the mother's.  An unplanned pregnancy can provide an opportunity and inspiration for a woman to get her life back on track; in these two cases, to actually start the family. A pregnancy can give a woman a reason to live, to take care of that child; a reason to go back to school to finish her education, as we heard about Miranda; a reason to reconcile with her family.  As a father of five, and everyone who has been a parent knows this: we know how parenthood truly fundamentally transforms a person well before the child is born.  From the time you know that you are going to have a new baby in the family, as well as every moment afterward, life is precious, life is priceless. Pregnancy centers support women during every step of that journey of providing a new life, a gift from  Mr.Speaker, next week, the Court will hear a case that perhaps threatens the very existence of crisis pregnancy centers and pro-life pregnancy centers in the United I hope that those nine Justices have the wisdom to see that, in America, that a jurisdiction--whether it is California or Baltimore, Montgomery County, or Austin, Texas, or any jurisdiction--that has tried to compel speech in these pregnancy centers is violating our constitutional rights and, worse than that, is really affecting valuable resources in our community, the most valuable resource a woman with a crisis pregnancy can have.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-14-pt1-PgH1588-6.txt,2026,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2018.0,14.0,January

2095,topic-id,500,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman and Representative LaMalfa for hosting tonight's Special Order to draw attention to the wonderful benefits of crisis pregnancy centers.  I would like to share the story of two women. Summer is a smart 17-year-old who is in love with her first love, Although their parents are concerned about how serious they have gotten, they spend as much time together as possible. They soon find out that their college plans are in jeopardy when they discover that they are pregnant.  Tanya is a 40-year-old single mom with three kids. She works at a local restaurant as a server, and she gets by with the help of Federal welfare programs. She has been seeing Sam off and on for the past several months, but they recently broke up. Now she finds out that she is pregnant. She can't handle one more mouth to feed. Abortion seems to be the only option.  Summer's and Tanya's situations are different, yet they both can find help and hope through their local crisis pregnancy centers. Like over 2.3 million women and men across America, they can receive pregnancy tests; ultrasounds; parenting classes; and other basic necessities, such as maternity and baby clothing, through these centers. These vital centers are making a huge difference for so many.  Pregnancy care centers provide a safe haven for women in crisis. In other words, they provide a safe haven for pregnant moms who need love and support as they welcome their babies into the world. There are more than 2,300 pregnancy care centers throughout Some of these clinics provide medical care, housing for expectant moms and their children, and adoption referrals.  I am thankful for the Shiloh Center in Harrisonville, Missouri, my hometown. The Shiloh Center welcomes moms in difficult circumstances, offering hope and help, enabling each mother to choose life for her baby. Like many other centers, the Shiloh Center provides free pregnancy testing, ultrasound services, counseling, and educational resources.  The Shiloh Center also provides prenatal care for pregnant moms, and ensures that new moms are equipped with baby clothes, diapers, and formula for their little ones.  There are thousands of these centers across I would like to highlight the wonderful pregnancy care centers in my district: Crossroads Pregnancy Resource Center in Warsaw, Missouri; My Life Clinic in Columbia, Missouri; Pregnancy Health Center Lake of the Ozarks in Camdenton, Missouri; Door of Hope Pregnancy Center in Clinton, Missouri; New Beginnings Women's Center in Warrensburg, Missouri; Pregnancy Support Center in Lebanon, Missouri; Birthright of Sedalia in Sedalia, Missouri; Free Women's Center of Pulaski County in Waynesville, Missouri; Birthright of Moberly in Moberly, Missouri; Birthright of Nevada in Nevada, Missouri; and Choices Pregnancy Center in Marshfield,  I am grateful to each of these centers for the countless hours of community service and client care lovingly offered to women like Summer and Tanya and thousands in similar circumstances experiencing challenging life circumstances.

1074,topic-id,1149,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss the devastating impacts of climate change in my home State of New Hampshire and across our country. I want to start by commending our colleague Senator Whitehouse, who has been a fierce advocate for this issue and, as of yesterday, had taken to the floor 200 times to call on Congress to wake up and protect our environment.  I am proud to represent a State whose beautiful natural resources strengthen our economy, create jobs, and support our high quality of life, but we are already seeing the real impacts of climate change in New Hampshire--impacts with major consequences.  Last year, the ``National Climate Assessment'' report reinforced what has long been clear: Human activity is the driving force behind our changing climate, and the United States is experiencing more extreme weather events, including dangerous heat, heavier rainfall and more flooding, and larger wildfires as a result, threatening both our long-term economic growth and the well-being of our citizens.  Many people in New Hampshire, particularly on our sea coast, are concerned about what these stronger and more frequent storms will mean for their families, their homes, and their businesses. Rising sea levels and greater precipitation have heightened the risk of flooding on our coasts. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association estimates that New Hampshire sea levels are expected to rise between six-tenths of a foot and 2 feet by 2050 and between 1.6 feet and 6.6 feet by 2100. In just the last 2 weeks, our State has been hit by three nor'easters. This is not normal.  You can see here, the flooding that impacted streets and homes in Portsmouth, NH, during one of these storms. This chart depicts a photo. We have to help our people adapt to these changes, these direct threats they face. This starts with focusing on efforts like coastal resiliency to help vulnerable communities prepare, improving our infrastructure, and developing resilience strategies to help plan ahead of storms and extreme weather events. At the local level, people on New Hampshire's seacoasts are already doing great work to be proactive and address these challenges head-on, so we must support their efforts.  We must also keep working to mitigate climate change, which is why I am continuing to push to cut carbon emissions, conserve and protect our natural resources, and build a stronger clean energy future.  Unfortunately, President Trump has been focused on an agenda that is based on climate change denial and has stacked his administration with climate change skeptics who have placed the priorities on big oil companies over the protection of our natural resources.  According to a recent Politico report, President Trump has chosen at least 20 people to serve as agency leaders and advisers who have publicly disagreed with the settled science on climate change. He has left key positions vacant, including a science adviser at the Office of Science and Technology Policy--an unprecedented move over the last several decades in which the office has existed. This clear disdain for science and failure to acknowledge the reality of the dangers of climate change are seen throughout the administration's policies.  Last year, President Trump recklessly withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement--failing to listen to the voices of environmental and business leaders who supported this agreement. The United States of America now has the distinction of being the only country in the world that is not supporting it.  EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is working to repeal the Clean Power Plan, which is critical to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and helping our citizens, our businesses, and our economy thrive. We have seen several clean air and clean water protections rolled back.  In addition to reversing environmental protections, the administration is taking further steps that can carry extreme risk for our environment. This includes the irresponsible plan to open up 90 percent of our Nation's coastal waters--including New Hampshire's seacoast--to the dangers of offshore drilling.  We are clearly seeing the impacts of climate change. Our citizens are calling on us to act, but the lack of leadership from this administration and the actions they have taken that exacerbate our climate and environmental challenges are--to put it mildly--irresponsible.  We need to take proactive steps to protect our environment, not roll back key protections. We need to help communities threatened by a changing climate, not put the profits of Big Oil first. We need to stand up for science, not deny it.  I will keep working to address climate change and to achieve a cleaner environment and stronger energy future that will help our citizens, our economy, and our businesses thrive. I urge my colleagues to do the same.                   Recognizing Spaulding High School  Mr.President, I am proud to recognize not just an individual but the entire Spaulding High School community as our Granite Stater of the Month for the compassion and commitment to helping others that they displayed following the horrific shooting in Parkland,  In the wake of the senseless violence in Parkland, Spaulding music staff and students met to discuss how they could help survivors and memorialize the 17 lives which were taken at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  During this dark time, the Spaulding students wanted to focus on expressing their love and how to best send comfort to their peers in This led Spaulding students, teachers, and faculty to start an initiative--with the members of the band, the color guard, and the Junior ROTC playing a leading role--to collect money to support the Stoneman Douglas community.[[Page S1716]]  In the days that followed, students passed around buckets to collect donations, with each student giving what he or she could. In an enthusiastic show of support, the Spaulding community raised $3,271 in just 2 days.  Students wanted to do more, so they also presented the Spaulding High School Music Department Glass Eagle Leadership Award to the Stoneman Douglas Music Department, as that is also the mascot of their school. The Junior ROTC group also sent one of its Challenge Coins to acknowledge the Parkland students' bravery and resolve.  Two of the school's music teachers--Joanne Houston and Cheryl Richardson--recently flew to Florida to present the gifts to Stoneman Douglas's principal and vice principal.  The selfless support for Stoneman Douglas by the Spaulding High School community exemplifies the compassion of the Granite  In New Hampshire and throughout our country today, school communities are engaging in walkouts and demanding action to prevent future acts of gun violence. I know members of the Spaulding student body are planning a walkout, too, and I am profoundly grateful to see our young people speaking out and being powerful forces for change.  I am incredibly proud of these young leaders. We, as a country, must meet them in this moment.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

209,topic-id,752,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Collins), my friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.  Mr.Speaker, I stand here today with the rest of my Democratic colleagues in utter amazement at the dizzying dysfunction exhibited by our friends across the aisle. For reasons beyond understanding, we have to vote on the reauthorization of section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act because late last year the Republican leadership chose to prioritize massive tax cuts for their wealthy donors over the safety of American citizens.                              {time}  1500  Like so many other important issues, House Republicans decided to punt on the reauthorization of 702 by simply extending it to January 19 of this year, coincidentally, the same date the government will possibly shut down.  Mr.Speaker, as a former judge and the former vice chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I do occupy a unique vantage point in the ongoing debate between the need to steadfastly protect the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution while also ensuring that those in the intelligence community have the tools they need to keep our country safe from those who wish to do us grave harm.  Putting the finer points on this debate aside for a moment, I can tell you with complete certainty that such a debate deserves to be lengthy and thorough, neither of which have happened here.  I was concerned to learn, if not a bit dismayed, that the House Intelligence subcommittee which has oversight jurisdiction of the National Security Agency did not hold a single hearing on today's bill. In fact, the full committee did not even hold a single hearing on this important piece of legislation.  Think about that. As the Republicans approached the need to discuss the reauthorization of one of the more important tools to fight terrorism that, simultaneously, brings along legitimate and important Fourth Amendment concerns, the majority, in all their wisdom, thought it prudent to hold exactly zero hearings on such an important matter. That is a brazenly inept way to govern.  To add insult to injury, I am told that members of the committee were given about 36 hours to read the bill before having to vote it out of committee.  A side note here: the bill they were given 36 hours to review is not actually the bill we have before us today because the majority had to use a Rules Committee print to fix some of the most troublesome parts of the original bill in order to obtain my friend Ranking Member Adam Schiff's support. Mr.Speaker, without a doubt, that support did not come easily, and important changes were made to the bill as it was presented to the committee in its original form.  For example, Mr.Schiff was able to ensure the Republicans' unmasking language was removed from today's bill. The removal of such language ensures that one of the Republicans' most heinous political stunts is not codified into law. This was and is a significant improvement.  Moreover, the Republicans removed the controversial expansion of the definition of ``agent of foreign power,'' which concerned privacy and technology groups.  Today's bill also addresses what is known as ``abouts'' collection. This is the collection of communications that are not to or from a target but, rather, communications that merely reference the target. The NSA, itself, shut down this collection method earlier this year.  The legislation before us today will allow such collection to resume, but only if the NSA first devises a way of doing so that addresses privacy concerns, obtains permission from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and Congress does not object after a 30-day review period.  Now, this may seem to be a better option than what I am sure many, if not most, Republicans wanted, which is the full-scale reimplementation of ``abouts'' collection, but considering how much difficulty the majority has in simply keeping the lights on around this place, I think it is fair to question their ability to provide meaningful oversight in just 30 days. Again, this is simply evidence for the need to return back to regular order under which bills are fully and fairly considered.  Regardless of where one comes down on this issue, I can assure you that there are Members on both sides of the aisle that are sick and tired of being shut out of important policy discussions concerning subjects like those before us today.

1273,topic-id,1280,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Burgess), my friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.  Mr.Speaker, like my friend from Texas, I was overcome with sadness by the tragic news of Louise's passing, who was not only the ranking member of the Rules Committee, but the first and only woman to have chaired the committee.  For 30 years, Louise poured every ounce of energy she had into serving her constituents in upstate New She never hesitated to speak her mind, and she never wavered in espousing her beliefs. I will always be truly grateful for the time that I had to serve alongside her.  Louise was one of my dearest friends in Congress, having not only served with her on the Rules Committee but also on the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Helsinki  Her legacy speaks for itself. She was not just a champion of women's rights. She was a champion of working families everywhere. This Nation has lost one of our fiercest public servants, and her absence will leave an unfillable void.  Mr.Speaker, I offer my deepest condolences to Louise's daughters: Megan Secatore, Amy Slaughter, and Emily Minerva; her seven grandchildren and one great-grandson; as well as to her friends, constituents, and congressional staff during this extremely difficult time. Her spirit and loving memory will forever live in the Halls of She will be dearly missed.  Mr.Speaker, turning to today's rules, this rule brings the number of closed rules for the 115th Congress to 74. In other words, more than 50 percent of the legislation coming to the Rules Committee has been closed off from an open and honest debate by my Republican friends.  At the beginning of this Congress, we were told by my Republican colleagues that they would run the government in an open manner. They even championed regular order. Well, that spirit has clearly been jettisoned in favor of an overly partisan approach to governing.  By way of example, one of today's bills, H.5247, was introduced last Tuesday, brought to the House floor for a vote on the same day without the committee of jurisdiction holding one single hearing on the bill or Members having the opportunity to offer their amendments.                              {time}  1230  Not surprisingly, the measure failed to pass under suspension of the rules.  What was the response of my friends on the other side of the aisle when the vote failed? Did my Republican colleagues insist that the Energy and Commerce Committee hold hearings on the measure? Did my Republican colleagues on the committee of jurisdiction invite experts to speak on what the consequences would be if this bill were to become law? Did my Republican colleagues work with Democrats to come up with a bipartisan solution?  Madam Speaker, let me tell you what did happen. The Republican leadership ignored the problems with the measure and brought it to the Rules Committee last night for it to be considered on the House floor today.  Now, this flies in the face of regular order, to ask the entire membership of the people's House to vote on something for which no one can honestly say they know what the unintended consequences would be if this bill were to become law.  Bad process makes bad bills, and the process we have witnessed with this bill can't get much worse. Yet it did get worse when the Republican majority blocked the ranking member's, Mr.Pallone's, substitute amendment, an amendment which was both germane and had bipartisan support.  Madam Speaker, the Republican majority took it a step further when they extended the Holman rule for the remainder of the 115th My friends on the other side of the aisle are yet again seeking to scapegoat Federal employees, make cuts to the Federal workforce, and politicize the civil service system that was established to professionalize agencies and offices, all while ignoring the waste and abuses in the reality show of the Trump administration.  Madam Speaker, challenged by the American people to bring up comprehensive gun reform, House leadership instead brings up one bill that hasn't gone through anything resembling regular order and another bill that weakens and undermines a valuable tool that gives financial companies and regulators an opportunity to identify and correct problems before they could lead to another financial crisis.[[Page H1706]]  Every year, roughly 35,000 people are killed by guns. Moreover, 2,700 children and teens are shot and killed, and over 14,000 more are shot and injured every year. That is an average of 47 American children and teens shot every day.  And the effects of gun violence extend far beyond those struck by a bullet. Gun violence shapes the lives of the millions of children who witness it, know someone who was shot, or live in fear of the next shooting. We have witnessed the effects over the last month with the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  This weekend, hundreds of thousands of students and their supporters will descend on Washington, D.C., to demand that the Federal Government take action to stop the epidemic of mass shootings, which have become all too familiar.  No less than this morning when I turned on the television, less than an hour and a half away from here, in yet another school, yet another shooting. Fortunately, it appears that the resource officer there engaged the shooter early on and may have caused there to be less damage, although some people were injured, and one or two critically.  We can no longer ignore what gun violence really is in this country. It is an epidemic.  But do not just take my word for it or the students who witnessed 14 friends' and 3 teachers' lives brutally cut short. The American Medical Association, following the tragedy at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, declared gun violence in this country ``a very public health crisis,'' a crisis which the Republican majority's only answer is to offer thoughts and prayers and further block any Democratic measures to address this crisis and to continue to block the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from even researching gun violence.  Instead of finally making permanent the status of Dreamers in this country as full citizens, the Republican majority ignores their calls and the calls of the vast majority of Americans and, instead, brings up one bill that undermines a valuable early warning system of our Nation's economy and another bill that has gone through a completely closed process.  Enough is enough. President Donald John Trump says he wants to fix this problem. The Speaker says he wants to fix this problem. We on this side of the aisle clearly want to fix this problem. So let's do it already.  Madam Speaker, last week, when I was managing yet another useless financial regulation, I commented and I asked the American public to respond:  Would you rather us stop banks from having stress tests or would you prefer that we deal with the deferred action for children in this country, 800,000 of whom are Dreamers, 120 of whom lose their status every day?  Would you prefer that we deal with the measure that is on the floor today or that we deal seriously with a variety of issues having to do with gun violence in our society, which I have described as an epidemic?  Would you prefer as a priority, America, that we deal with these trivial matters that are going nowhere fast or that we center ourselves and focus on those measures that are vital to the survival, security, and safety of all Americans?  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-03-20-pt1-PgH1704-3.txt,511,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF S. 140, AMENDING THE WHITE MOUNTAIN",2018.0,20.0,January
1275,topic-id,704,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, last night in the Rules Committee, I had dialogue with the author of this legislation and also the ranking member, Mr.I indicated to them that I have very strong sympathies regarding persons who are in the apparent throes of death and seeking some hope, and medication can have its advantages, and experimental medication can have its advantages.  My quarrel with the legislation is that it didn't go through regular order. I don't understand why, with all of the experts. I introduced into the Record in the Rules Committee last night a substantial number of organizations and individuals who have come forward. They all agree that something along the lines of what is being sought ought be undertaken, but it would allow for those persons to have added input into what ultimately may be significant legislation. But my friends on the other side plow right ahead on this matter that I reiterate was brought on suspension last week that failed, and then brought here last night for purposes of a rule along with financial stress legislation.  So it is not that many of us are not sympathetic to the underlying principle that is being offered. It is that it is rank process and that we should not allow legislation to continue to come to the floor of the House of Representatives that blocks out a significant number of persons who may have input that would make the measure be much more salient to a more significant number of people.  It is for that reason that I continue to ask the questions: What are our priorities here? What is the rush with reference to this matter while we are ignoring a significant number of other matters that we could be undertaking?  In addition to that, we were supposed to go to the Rules Committee this afternoon on the omnibus bill; and now, evidently, there is wrangling going on between the parties and bicameral between the Senate and the House, and that measure isn't ready to come to the floor.  Yet we are dealing with something that isn't the highest priority of the moment. I commented last night, anything that will help a person who is facing death is the kind of thing that we would want that person to have that opportunity to deal with. But we have children who have been killed and we have children who are facing the potential for that kind of horror, yet we are doing nothing.  So, Madam Speaker, once again, I rise to appeal to my friends on the other side of the aisle: Please, listen to the American people and do more to help end the epidemic of gun violence that has plagued our Nation and that the American people are demanding Congress to do more.  For example, in a recent Gallup Poll, nearly two-thirds of adults wanted stricter laws on the sale of firearms. According to a recent NPR/Ipsos poll, 75 percent of respondents said they think gun laws should be stricter.  As I indicated earlier, just this morning there were reports of another school shooting just an hour and a half from Washington, D.C., in Great Mills, The American people are begging this body to do something to end this epidemic, so I offer the majority this opportunity:  Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up four commonsense gun safety bills: H.4240, the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act; H.3464, the Background Check Completion Act; H.2598, the Gun Violence Restraining Order Act; and H.1478, the Gun Violence Research  These bills would close the dangerous gun show and internet sale background check loopholes, prevent the sale of guns without a completed background check, ensure that people who are a danger to themselves or others can be prevented from possessing a gun, and lift the prohibition on government-sponsored scientific research on the causes of gun violence.  Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (",CREC-2018-03-20-pt1-PgH1704-3.txt,511,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF S. 140, AMENDING THE WHITE MOUNTAIN",2018.0,20.0,January
1276,topic-id,60,"Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that we can finally do something to address gun violence.

1279,topic-id,564,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I would say to my friend from Washington what I said last night: We would do a great service to Louise's memory if we were to make more open rules here on the House floor; and I will argue for her in that regard.  Madam Speaker, before I close, I want to again reiterate the tremendous loss felt in this Chamber with the passing of our longtime colleague, Congresswoman Louise McIntosh She was a champion of all the issues she cared about and a giant here in the House of Her wisdom will be missed every day.  Madam Speaker, the people's House should be approaching our work in a manner that is fair to all Americans, in a manner where the appropriate committee of jurisdiction holds hearings and markups, in a manner where experts in the field are consulted, and in a manner where Members of both parties have the opportunity to offer amendments and debate the contents of the bill.  The process we are witnessing here today is truly a slap in the face to regular order. A bill that has zero input from members on the Energy and Commerce Committee or that has been the subject of any thoughtful discussion is suddenly on the House floor for a vote.  Now, I respect my friend from Texas' view that last year in the Senate, and even perhaps since that time, and throughout the country, right-to-try measures have passed in several States to some degree. But this particular bill that is on the floor that we are making a rule for has not gone through regular order; and that, then, disallows a significant number of persons who would have an opportunity to have input to what could be legislation that all sides could agree upon. Our failure to undertake to do that is a disservice, in my view, to the institution and to the measure that is being sought to be passed here today.  This is not just an affront to normal House procedure; it is downright undemocratic and emblematic of the Republican majority's inability to govern. I think it will redound to their discredit that they are not allowing this House to proceed under regular order.  As I indicated earlier, more than 50 percent of all of the measures that have come to the Rules Committee and have ultimately come to the floor of the House of Representatives have been under closed rules, which means that Members who represent millions of people in America do not have opportunities to offer amendments that might make the measure better or, at the very least, have their views heard with reference to substantive legislation that is moving through this body.                              {time}  1300  If we continue down this path for the remainder of this session, we will probably break the 100th barrier on closed rules. We have already had more closed rules than in the history of legislating in this country.  That is not fair. That is basically all we are arguing. Open up the process. Let every Member have an opportunity for input on behalf of his or her constituents. It is the right thing to do. What has been happening is the dead wrong thing to do.  Mr.Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.

1461,topic-id,1309,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman from Colorado for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.  Madam Speaker, today's bills would roll back important consumer and financial protections by undermining the effectiveness of financial regulators' ability to conduct important stress tests, create unnecessary hurdles for regulators to contend with in the future, and limit the Federal Reserve Board's flexibility in determining the health and stability of our financial institutions.  Madam Speaker, including these two measures, the Rules Committee will have considered 30 Financial Services bills this Congress, 15 of which were considered under closed rules. Those 15 are part of a much larger closed process that Republican leadership has wielded with brute force to push through the legislative priorities of powerful special interests. Indeed, this week, we witnessed the 73rd closed rule for this Congress, a style of legislating that is as brazen as it is broken.  This critique of the majority's reliance on a closed process is not just some technical point, but, rather, an important one; because when you close out those on your side of the aisle who are not in leadership and those on our side of the aisle from offering amendments, you do not simply silence us, you silence the American people.  And what has this process wrought for the American people?  Well, let's take a look. Bear with me because it is a doozy  First, we witnessed the majority--in what I believe was the most chaotic and convoluted process during my 25 years in the House of Representatives--try to take away healthcare from 23 million Americans.[[Page H1620]]  When they couldn't get that done, the majority then honed in on a tax giveaway to corporate America and the ultrawealthy not only at the expense of the middle class, but also to the detriment of future generations, as that bill will explode our national debt by an estimated $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years.  Just last week, we watched as our Republican friends attacked Clean Air Act protections to give a handout to specified industries to emit more pollution into the air.  Is this what my Republican friends were sent here to do: To take away healthcare from millions of people? To remove important environmental protections that keep America's air and water safe? To limit the amount of stress tests the Federal Reserve Board should run on our biggest financial institutions so that we can avoid another financial meltdown?  Footnote right there. If these stress tests are so bothersome to these big old banks, how is it that they are making all of this big old money?  They don't seem to have any hindrance when it comes to sopping up the resources of this country.  Madam Speaker, my constituents haven't been calling me or writing or emailing my office asking that we consider or pass any of the measures the House will consider this week. On the other hand, they have written to my office asking what Republican leadership is going to do about addressing the gun violence epidemic ravaging our country. I was meeting in my office just an hour ago with officials from Tamarac, Florida, and we received an alert that two schools near the Parkland school were on lockdown.  My constituents have asked about what Republican leadership will do to ensure that the DACA recipients have a pathway to citizenship. They have asked what Republican leadership will do to address our Nation's needs for serious and sustained investments in our infrastructure. Unfortunately, the answer is little to nothing.  Footnote right there. When I came to this Congress 25 years ago, there were 14,000 bridges in the United States of America in need of a repair. Today, there are 56,000 bridges in this country in need of repair.  Madam Speaker, since 2014, there have been over 1,360 mass shootings in Let me let that soak in. Since 2014, there have been over 1,360 mass shootings in  In 2018 alone, nearly 500 teens and over 100 children have been killed or injured by guns. Last month, 14 students and 3 teachers were gunned down at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School by a former student using an AR-15 that he bought legally.  And just 2 days ago, American citizens took to the grounds of this Capitol and placed 7,000 pairs of shoes on the front lawn here at the Citizens placed a pair of shoes for every child killed by gun violence since the Sandy Hook massacre. Regardless of your views on this subject, please let that number sink in: 7,000 pairs of shoes.  Madam Speaker, we should not be considering a bill to reform the Financial Stability Oversight We should not be considering a measure that limits the frequency of stress tests on our financial institutions.  What we should be doing is considering a ban on bump stocks. We should be considering a ban on weapons of war. We should be considering protective orders allowing people to petition a court to temporarily remove firearms from an individual in crisis.  We should be considering a measure to provide for comprehensive background checks, and maybe this time try not to sabotage it by attaching a controversial concealed carry provision to the measure.  Madam Speaker, the Republican majority is also ignoring the plight of 22,000 Dreamers who have lost their protected status since President Trump ended DACA, and the other hundreds of thousands of Dreamers who remain in legal limbo. Every day, 120 of them lose their status.  Madam Speaker, 25 times--25 times--House Republicans blocked a vote on the bipartisan Dream Act, which protects innocent Dreamers from this cruel Republican inaction. Every day of inaction on the part of my friends across the aisle means another day that families are needlessly made to live under the threat of being torn apart.  Madam Speaker, all across America, our infrastructure is in need of repair and greater investment. Every Member in the House of Representatives likely received a visit from members of the National League of Cities around the United States of America, and every one of them is talking about infrastructure needs. Every one of them. Yet the Republican majority has stalled on presenting a single infrastructure bill.  Even President Donald John Trump's infrastructure plan faces an obstacle: his own budget cuts.  President Trump claimed the Federal Government was investing $1.5 trillion to our infrastructure, but, in reality, the White House's plan actually only proposed $200 billion in Federal funding. At the same time, he proposed slashing critical infrastructure funding to the Department of Transportation by nearly 20 percent, and the Army Corps of Engineers' budget by 22 percent.  How does that work, Madam Speaker?  The truth is, it doesn't.  Madam Speaker, we stand here today with a to-do list a mile long and an ocean wide. I suggest the following: that we stop being forced to spend our time checking off items on the wish lists of powerful corporate special interests, and we turn to the business of the American people--Republican and Democrat, independent, conservative, and liberal American people.  For starters, we could work together to end our country's gun violence epidemic, bring relief to DACA recipients, and bring thought-out and serious legislation to the floor that will invest in our infrastructure.                              {time}  1245  Now, I am sure that my friend is either thinking or likely to say that we are here about financial services measures, and he is correct. That is what these rules call for. But what these rules are about, in the final analysis, is a diversion from things that we know are more critical.  Why, then, are we not dealing with prioritized matters that we know that the American people want, rather than those that the corporate greedy, needy, big old businesses want?  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-03-15-pt1-PgH1618-4.txt,511,FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION FAIRNESS AND REFORM ACT,2018.0,15.0,January
1464,topic-id,503,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, it has been one month since the tragic events at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, The district that I am privileged to serve is adjacent to that school, and I have two of my remaining cousins in life that live in Parkland, and I live within 30 minutes of where that school is situated.  A gunman killed 17 innocent students and teachers. Since that heartbreaking day, Americans from coast to coast have raised their voices and said: Enough is enough.  Yesterday, thousands of students from across our country walked out of their classrooms to protest this body's inaction. Two days ago, as I said earlier, 7,000 empty pairs of children's shoes were laid on the Capitol lawn to commemorate all the children who have been tragically killed by gun violence since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. I might add, not only at schools, but in Nevada, in California, in Texas, in South Carolina, in churches, in Orlando bars, these mass shootings are occurring. People don't think it is an epidemic.  My friends on the other side of the aisle did bring a bill to the floor yesterday that I voted for that was also cojoined by my friend, Ted Deutch, whose district is where the Parkland school is. He, too, was involved with that legislation, but it was done to improve school security. Much more needs to be done, and it needs to be done now.  So, today, I offer my colleagues yet another opportunity to show the American people that they value their safety and the safety of their children over the lobbying of the National Rifle Association and the gun manufacturers.  If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up four commonsense gun safety bills: H.4240, the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act; H.3464, the Background Check Completion Act; H.2598, the Gun Violence Restraining Order Act; and H.1478, the Gun Violence Research  These bills would close the dangerous gun show and internet sale background check loopholes, prevent the sale of guns without a completed background check, ensure that people who are a danger to themselves or to others can be prevented from possessing a gun, and lift the prohibition on government-sponsored scientific research on causes of gun violence.  Let me send a message to gun owners in this country. I own a gun. I believe in the Second I don't want anybody to take anybody's gun; but nobody can persuade me that anybody, other than military and police officers, are deserving of having in their possession automatic weapons. I believe every American feels the same way.  Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida?  There was no objection.

1474,topic-id,500,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Madam Speaker, I would advise the previous speaker that I knew Jay Dickey, I served with him here, as did many other Members; and my understanding is that, before his death, he indicated that he thought that his measure that has carried forth was a mistake.  Madam Speaker, my friends across the aisle have clearly demonstrated where their priorities lie. And for the benefit of the American public, if it looks like we are ships passing in the night, then doubtless we are when it comes to priorities.  I would ask anyone in this country and anyone in this House: Which do you think should be a priority? Addressing the gun epidemic in this country or bailing out big old banks with more opportunities to potentially carry us to yet another financial disaster by simply disallowing them having to undergo the stress test that they need?  I listened to my friend when he talked about stress tests, that they don't know how they are going to be tested or what part they are going to--well, my goodness gracious. Kids in school don't know what is going to be on the test; so why should the bank know what is going to be on the test?  But in the deal, when it goes down, whether they know or not, they still are making a ton of money; and, therefore, the regulations aren't affecting them in the way that we make it sound here. And there again, I ask the question: Which is your priority, America? Whether we address gun violence in this country and the epidemic that it is or whether we address these financial services regulatory measures that are more for corporate America than they are for you?  Americans working hard to make ends meet need answers--working hard to get their kids off to school, working hard to make sure they can put food on the table at the end of the day, working hard to ensure that they can put a little money aside for their child's education, working hard to ensure that they can put some retirement money aside.  Footnote there. What are we doing to protect the pensions of people in this country? We are not addressing that. We are addressing big banks.[[Page H1623]]  That they don't have to keep working two or three jobs for the rest of their lives, that is what Americans are looking for.  Well, if they are working hard, then we need to be working hard, and we need to be working hard for them. It is with their interests in mind that we are sent here, and we do a disservice to them and to our country when we abandon that responsibility and consider bills like those put before us today rather than addressing the many, many needs that this country has.  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-03-15-pt1-PgH1618-4.txt,511,TAIWAN TRAVEL ACT,2018.0,15.0,January

54,topic-id,1382,"Madam President, before I turn to the main portion of my remarks, I wish to speak briefly on the situation in the Middle  The protests across cities in Iran reflect the failed leadership of a corrupt regime. The Ayatollah's negligence in denying the basic rights of his own people is inexcusable. Instead of allocating resources to care for families in need, the regime has chosen to use what economic gains it has accrued through the Iran deal to fund terrorism and sectarian violence in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, and elsewhere in the region. I stand with the Iranian people in their demand for prosperity and freedom, and I call upon my colleagues in Congress to do the same.                      Remembering Thomas Monson  Madam President, I wish to devote the remainder of my remarks to honoring the memory of a dear friend, President Thomas Monson, a beloved leader whose love for God and his fellow man defined a lifetime of selfless service. President Monson passed away quietly last week, with friends and family gathered by his bedside.  Today, I join millions across the globe in mourning the loss of an extraordinary man whom, as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we have long looked upon as a prophet, seer, and revelator. I also wish to extend my deepest sympathies to President Monson's family, especially his children--Thomas, Ann, and Although we are saddened by President Monson's passing, we take comfort in knowing that he has been reunited with his wife Frances, his lifelong friend and eternal companion.  President Monson was born in Salt Lake City in 1927 to Spencer Monson and Gladys Condie Growing up during the Great Depression, young Tom was greatly influenced by his parents, who taught him the importance of taking care of others. From an early age, Tom displayed a remarkable concern for the most vulnerable among us, and throughout his life, he showed that concern and worked on solving problems for them.  When Tom was just a boy, he had two beloved pet rabbits, to which he tended every day, but when he heard of a destitute family in his neighborhood, a family so down on their luck that they had nothing to eat for Christmas dinner, Tom did what few little boys would ever do: He gave his two pet rabbits to his neighbors so they could have a nice Christmas meal. Yet, when little Tommy returned home to see his empty rabbit hutch, tears filled his eyes, but these were tears of gratitude for the joy he had felt in helping others. Selflessness, service, and sacrifice--these would soon become the virtues by which Thomas Monson lived his life, and everybody who knew him knows that.  Following graduation from West High School, President Monson attended the University of Utah, where he met Frances Johnson during his freshman year. Around the same time, he joined the U.Navy and served in the waning days of World War After the war, he graduated cum laude from the University of Utah with a bachelor's degree in business management. Shortly thereafter, he married Frances in the Salt Lake  Following graduation, President Monson was hired by the Deseret News to work in the paper's advertising department. He worked in various positions for the newspaper and eventually became the general manager of the Deseret  As he was just beginning his professional career, President Monson was called at the exceptionally young age of 22 to be a bishop of a Mormon congregation. That hardly ever happens in the LDS In this position, he was charged with leading a congregation of more than 1,000 members. Then, at the age of 31, Tom was again called to a leadership position typically reserved for older men when he was asked to serve as president of the LDS mission in Canada and preside over a whole raft of young missionaries. When he was only 36, Tom was called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, among the most influential positions in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day In 2008, he was sustained as president of the church, overseeing the day-to-day operations of a faith with millions of followers. The church witnessed record growth during his tenure as president, with more than 2 million men and women joining the ranks of converts of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Whether as a prophet, as an apostle, as a mission president, or as a friend, President Monson simply took care of people. One particular story stands out among the rest. When he was a young bishop, there were 84 widows in his congregation. During the Christmas holiday, he would visit each and every one of them, ensuring that they were all provided with a good holiday meal. Even after President Monson was released as bishop, he continued to stay in contact with each one of these widows--writing letters, making phone calls, and frequently visiting them in their homes. In fact, President Monson remained so close with each of these 84 widows that he eventually spoke at all of their funerals. That is a real record.  President Monson's example of intimate, individual ministry underscored what was most remarkable about his leadership. Although he presided over a church of millions, his focus was always on the one. Although tasked with[[Page S60]]making administrative decisions affecting thousands of people the world over, his lifelong commitment was to serving individuals in need. Although an expert manager, he was first and foremost a disciple of Jesus Christ, a man of remarkable kindness, unwavering love, and preternatural empathy.  President Monson was a servant first and a leader second. Endless are the stories in which he would drop everything, sometimes even leaving church meetings early over which he was presiding, to visit a grieving widow, bless a sickly child, or minister to a family in need. Both on macro and micro levels, President Monson was intimately involved in building up the Kingdom of God, and he was perhaps the greatest living example of Christ's admonition to find the one lost sheep who has gone astray and take him back to the fold.  Of President Monson's boundless charity, Elder Joseph Wirthlin once said:       Tom has given everything to [those in need], including the      shirt off his back. I mean it! I've seen him give away his      suits and his shirts and his shoes.  President Monson was among the greatest men I have ever known. Service was his motto and humility his hallmark. Countless were the lives he touched as a prophet, father, and friend. He emulated Jesus Christ in every particular, helping all of us draw closer to God by drawing all of us closer to each other.  I am so grateful for the life of my dear friend and for the example he left for everyone to follow. He was a friend of mine. He showed me great friendship and at times stood up for me. I will never forget one time he leaned over to me and said: ``I vote for you.'' That meant so much to me. All I can say is that having his vote was very important to me. The man was one of the greatest men I have ever met on this Earth--a man of humility, a man of effort, a man of distinction, a man of love and compassion, a man who really knew how to work with other people, a man who loved his fellow men and women, a man who worked in a consecrated manner all the days of his life for Jesus Christ and his ministry. I am going to personally miss him. I believe that his imprint on not just the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--commonly nicknamed the Mormon Church--but around the world is going to be very difficult to ever forget.  God bless the remaining family. I hope everything will go well with them. I intend to attend the funeral if I can and hopefully lend whatever I can to honoring one of the greatest men I have ever met in my life, and I have met a lot of really great men and women.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

332,topic-id,1979,"Mr.President, I rise to pay tribute to a trio of excellent staffers, all of whom served with distinction on the Senate Finance Committee for a number of years and who recently left the committee to pursue other ventures.  First, Mr.President, I would like to say a few words about Chris Campbell, a longtime friend and trusted adviser, who until recently served as the Republican staff director on the committee. Last summer, he was nominated and confirmed to serve as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial  I have known Chris for more than 17 years, and I cannot overstate his importance and contributions to my years of work here in the Chris joined my campaign for President back in 2000, where I immediately recognized his talent and leadership abilities and appointed him to be my national field director, although he was relatively young and inexperienced at the time. Needless to say, I don't blame Chris for how that particular campaign turned out. In fact, that same year, I asked him to serve as director for my Senate reelection campaign, which thankfully met with much better results. After that, he came to Washington to serve on my staff on the Senate Judiciary Committee.[[Page S90]]  I have long urged my staffers to get as much education as possible to enhance their understanding and gain new perspectives. I nagged Chris about this during my Presidential campaign. Eventually, after working on my staff for a few years, he wanted to upgrade his bachelor's degree in political science from the University of California at Santa Barbara with an MBA from the Thunderbird School of Global  A short time after receiving his MBA and a brief stint in the private sector, Chris desired to return to public service, and when he returned to Washington, I hired him back without hesitation and asked him to serve as my legislative director, a post he held until 2011 when I took over as the lead Republican on the Finance Committee and appointed him to be the staff director.  During his time on the committee staff, Chris quarterbacked every major effort we undertook. This includes successes like the approval of free-trade agreements, the bipartisan renewal of trade promotion authority and the modernization of U.trade laws, the repeal and replacement of the Medicare sustainable growth rate, and the long-term funding of the Federal highway trust fund, just to name a few.  Of course, his work on the long-term tax reform effort was invaluable. We began our work on tax reform right out of the gate in 2011 and worked with Chairman Baucus and others to drive it forward. Chris was a key part of all of the work we did over the years to advance tax reform. While his move to Treasury came just before the final stages of that effort, I was fortunately able to benefit from his continued advice and counsel as we moved closer to and eventually crossed the finish line.  Chris is a shrewd but effective negotiator and a brilliant legislative strategist. Congressional Quarterly named him one of the seven most influential non-elected people working in Congress, and Roll Call put him on its list of the 50 most influential staffers on Capitol Hill for 7 straight years. Clearly, I am not the only one who recognizes his abilities. I know the other members of the Finance Committee--on both sides of the aisle--have also acknowledged and benefited from his years of work.  Still, even with all of his accomplishments, what stands out most to me about Chris Campbell is his life story. He is a great example of how hard work and education can help a person become much more than what some statistician might predict. Chris grew up in Hemet, CA, as one of six children who struggled--and that is putting it lightly--to make ends meet. He didn't grow up with family connections or powerful benefactors, but thanks to his diligence and determination and no shortage of natural ability, he became one of the most effective and influential staffers on Capitol Hill, and he now serves in a key leadership role in the administration.  While it pained me to see him head off to Treasury, I have been comforted to know that the President knows how to pick the best people and that the Department of the Treasury is being well served.  I personally want to thank Chris for his years in working with me, for his candid and thoughtful advice, and for his commitment to public service. I wish him all the best in his future endeavors, which I am quite sure will be just as successful as his time here.                         Tribute to Becky Shipp  Mr.President, I would like to say a few words about another former staffer, Becky Shipp, who also left the Finance Committee staff a few months ago to pursue another venture.  While I have known Becky for more years than either she or I would like to count, I can tell you that she served tirelessly on the Senate Finance Committee for more than 10 years. She saw chairmen come and go and was an institution here in her own right.  In my time on the Hill, I have come to know many different staffers, all of whom got involved in the government for all types of well-meaning and patriotic reasons. They each have some expertise, some interest, and some motivation that helps them get through the hard times that staff encounter with the stressful conditions and the below-market pay.  I have long said that Senators and staff take on sacred obligations when we come to work here, and I cannot think of many who have taken that sacred obligation to heart more than Becky She spent her time in Congress working on welfare and human resource issues. Her dedication and zealousness in defending the less fortunate should serve as an example to all of us.  While issues surrounding child welfare, child and family services, and foster care programs are often overlooked, anyone in Washington who knows anything about these issues knows that Becky has played a singular role in the creation and preservation of the safety net we now have in place. Too often, welfare issues become bitterly partisan, but during Becky's time here, she always strove to find common ground no matter the personal sacrifice.  Her time on the Hill was extremely productive and impacted far more children and families than most any of us could probably ever count. Still, it was not without moments that, when looking back, seemed pretty lighthearted. One such moment came just a few years ago after many in Congress had become aware of the fact that welfare funds distributed through electronic bank transfers had been used by some to purchase alcohol, food, or other illicit items from strip clubs and other less than savory establishments. Becky quietly began developing a proposal to prevent this type of abuse. Eventually, her idea gained more traction than she thought it would initially.  Once members of the Finance Committee and in the House began to realize the nature of this problem, her proposal caught on like wildfire. The problem was that the Social Security Act did not have a definition for these establishments. After quite a bit of wrangling and putting herself in the shoes of some of the more seedy clientele and business owners, Becky developed a definition, more or less, from scratch. Specifically, the bill, now a Federal statute, prohibited the distribution of Federal welfare funds at ``any retail establishment which provides adult-oriented entertainment in which performers disrobe or perform in an unclothed state for entertainment.'' Now, many have chuckled at the specificity of that definition and at the fact that someone, somewhere had to come up with and write down that type of legal terminology, but Becky was not playing a joke or trying to be facetious; she was addressing a legitimate concern. That story, to me, epitomizes the type of person Becky Shipp is and the type of congressional staffer she was when she worked in the  I am quite certain that, even in her new endeavors, Becky will remain committed to promoting the same type of no-nonsense, proper governance, with an equal eye toward helping those in need to find meaningful work, care, and assistance. While Becky's work ethic, persistence, and friendliness have already been missed on the Finance Committee, I am quite certain that she will continue to do many great things and help many more people.  I personally thank Becky for her years of service and for all that she has done for me, for others in the Senate, and for those in our country who have been in need of a helping hand.                      Tribute to Preston Rutledge  Finally, Mr.President, I want to say a few words about Preston Rutledge, my former tax counsel who was recently nominated and confirmed to serve as Assistant Secretary of Labor for the Employee Benefits Security  Preston began his career in public service as a teenager when he worked in the national forests. Later, he served honorably as an officer in the U.After graduating from law school, he was a law clerk on the Fifth Circuit of the U.Court of Appeals and spent more than a decade working at the IRS, focusing on tax-exempt organizations and employee benefits.  He came to the Finance Committee about 7 years ago. During that time, he worked on a number of issues that many people, quite frankly, consider to be tedious or mundane, but Preston is an expert on these issues, and he has always taken great pleasure in the issues and work before him.  As a staffer, Preston was, more than anything, committed to advancing reforms to our Nation's pension and savings programs in order to ensure a stable and reliable retirement savings system. Toward that end, he was a lead[[Page S91]]staffer in the drafting and passage of key pieces of pension and savings legislation, including the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act, which provided a number of key reforms to our Nation's retirement savings system, and the ABLE Act, which provided savings enhancements for children with disabilities and their families.  Preston's knowledge of tax policy and ERISA issues is unsurpassed. I was not the only one to benefit from and rely upon his expertise. Indeed, the entire Finance Committee relied on Preston whenever these types of issues came up because, once again, there just aren't many people in Washington with that particular focus and expertise.  I wish Preston good luck in his new position at the Labor Department and thank him for the work he performed on the committee. I am confident his expertise, as well as his open-minded and inclusive approach, will help improve the situations of workers and families across the country. I can think of no one more capable to serve in this important capacity.  As you can see, I have been fortunate to have worked with some excellent staffers in recent years--well, really throughout my whole service in the That has been true of my entire time at the  Of course, I have many great staffers still working in the Senate, both in the Finance Committee and in my personal office. I am grateful for each of them as well. I am very fortunate to have them with me as we have some important work ahead of us.  The Finance Committee's current workload is, quite honestly, mind-boggling. There is much to do over the next several months. I will have more to say on that in the coming days. For now, I will simply say, I look forward to working with my colleagues and staff on the vitally important tasks that lie ahead.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1126,topic-id,309,"Mr.President, this new law will also give children and youth already in foster care new protections by making sure children get the services they need in the setting best suited for them. It creates robust standards for foster care providers operating group homes, congregate care, and residential treatment facilities. It will require these types of facilities to be equipped to meet children's needs and provide services that help address the trauma they have faced so they can return to live with family or be placed with a caring foster family as soon as possible. It will also promote a model where children are placed in these types of facilities only when they need specific services that cannot be provided in another setting. Too often, children who can and should be living in families end up in group care simply because it is what is available, not because it is the best place for the child. This law helps tip the scales toward placing more children in family settings where children do best.

Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Bill  ",CREC-2018-03-15-pt1-PgS1742-4.txt,1351,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2018.0,15.0,March
1733,topic-id,766,"Mr.President, I rise in support of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which passed the Senate yesterday. This bipartisan bill protects and boosts the U.economy. I commend Chairman Crapo, members of the Banking Committee, and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for the hard work in getting this particular bill proposal across the finish line.  Making the rules simpler and fairer for small and midsized financial institutions is a commonsense idea that has garnered broad bipartisan support. That is because, done right, it helps hardworking Americans who aspire to invent things, start businesses, and manufacture goods and services--exactly the kind of entrepreneurship and growth America needs more of.  There are plenty of people with different viewpoints on how to improve the financial system. Some, however, say that almost any modification to the 849-page Dodd-Frank Act equates to a bonfire financial regulation, a gift to Wall Street, and so on. I think we need to cut through such patronizing, derisive mudslinging, and instead focus on commonsense solutions for the American people.  Let me tell you a plain truth: The bill the Senate passed yesterday is the result of sensible debate, reasonable compromise, and hard policy choices. Without compromising the safety and soundness of our financial system, it provides regulatory relief to small and midsized banks, credit unions, and financial institutions--the kind most familiar on Main Street in my home State of  Our constituents deserve regulatory relief. Between 2010 and 2016, compliance with Dodd-Frank cost $36 billion and required 73 million paperwork hours. Dodd-Frank alone enacted more than five times as many restrictions as any other law passed by the Obama administration and more than 22,000 pages of regulations.  With their vast resources, large banks could stomach these regulations mainly through automation, but smaller banks could not. Saddled with extra compliance requirements and no material benefit to resilience, many buckled under the weight of these burdensome regulations.  Consider that there are 1,736 fewer community banks today than when Dodd-Frank was signed into law. Since 2010, the number of FDIC-insured commercial banks in Utah dropped from 53 to 42. In a similar timespan, the number of NCUA-insured credit unions in my home State fell from 94 to 66. Over the past decade, the percentage of small business and commercial loans dropped more than 15 percent.  Indeed, 8 years since the passage of Dodd-Frank, it is high time for Congress to reflect and make adjustments, as necessary, to improve our financial[[Page S1762]]regulatory system. Let's focus on resilience and efficiency. This bill does just that.  I would like to briefly highlight three reforms in the bill that benefit our national and local economies. First, the bill provides relief and flexibility to small financial institutions. More small bank holding companies will be able to raise capital, which will help bank lending opportunities for families, businesses, and startups. This policy was based on a bipartisan bill, the Community Bank Relief Act, that I introduced along with Senators King, Nelson, and It is common sense to know that Utah's community banks are different from Wall Street banks, but too often regulations treat them the same.  Second, the bill increases the bank asset threshold for enhanced standards from $50 billion to $250 billion. I have long supported raising or recalibrating the asset threshold. It makes little sense that regional banks undergo stress tests and capital reviews similar to some of the largest, most complex global financial institutions. Similar to the unrealistic expectations put on community banks, this one-size-fits-all approach negatively affected regional banks.  Third, the bill eases the regulatory burden on 5,000 community banks that make up about 98 percent of financial institutions. For small banks and credit unions, this legislation provides relief from some of the requirements from the qualified mortgage rule, allowing them to devote more resources to serving their members rather than spending hours complying with regulatory overreach.  In today's era of extreme partisanship, this bill is a breath of fresh air. What the Senate has been able to accomplish this week is based on practical, consensus-led policy choices. While there remain other reforms that could relieve stress of burdensome regulations, this bill is a much needed start, which is why I wholeheartedly support this legislation.  Members on both sides of the aisle agree that the broad scope of Dodd-Frank created some harmful, unintended consequences. Let's make the rules simpler and fairer, as appropriate but not at the expense of safety. This bipartisan bill does just that, and the American people would be better off because of it.

Today, I want to look at the lower courts because no fewer than 138 positions on the Federal district and appeals courts are vacant. That does not include 33 vacancies that we already know will occur in the next year or so. Everyone must understand both the seriousness and the cause of this crisis.  By itself, 138 is just a number. It is a big number, but it needs a frame of reference or a standard for us to know whether this number of judicial vacancies is normal or a serious problem that has to be addressed. I certainly don't want to be accused of partisanship, so I will rely solely on the standards and criteria used in the past by my Democratic colleagues. Let's first use some Democratic standards to evaluate the number of judicial vacancies that we face today.  One standard is that the Democrats have specifically identified how many vacancies are unacceptable. In February 2000, with a Democrat in the White House, the Democrats said that 79 vacancies were ``too high.'' In September 2012, with the Democrats both in the White House and controlling the Senate, they declared a ``judicial vacancy crisis'' when there were 78 vacancies.  If 78 vacancies is a crisis, what is the label for 138 vacancies? This is the highest judicial vacancy total since September 1991, but more than half of those vacancies were fresh from Congress's having created new judgeships several months earlier. So I think it is fair to say that in either total or percentage terms, we face today the most serious judicial vacancy crisis that anyone in this body has ever seen.  A second Democratic vacancy standard is that, as they did in April 2014, we can compare judicial vacancies today with vacancies at the same point under previous If that Democratic standard is valid, vacancies today are 35 percent higher than at this point under President Obama and 46 percent higher than at this point under President George  There is a third Democratic vacancy standard. In June 2013 and at least as far back as April 1999, the Democrats have complained that the Senate was not confirming enough judicial nominees to keep up with normal attrition. Well, judicial vacancies today are 30 percent higher than when President Trump took office, and, as I said, at least 33 more have already been announced.  Finally, the Democrats have frequently said that the 107th Congress--the first 2 years of the George Bush administration--should be our judicial confirmation benchmark. During that time, the Senate confirmed an average of just over four judicial nominees per month. The Senate has so far confirmed 28 of President Trump's district and appeals court nominees or fewer than two per month.  Take your pick. By any or all of these Democratic standards, we face a much more serious judicial vacancy crisis than in years past. In addition to the gravity of this crisis, however, the American people need to know its cause. I can tell you what is not causing this vacancy crisis. President Trump started making nominations to the Federal district and appeals courts on March 21, 2017, just 61 days after taking office, as you can see on this chart. By August of last year, he had made more than three times as many judicial nominations as the average for his five predecessors of both parties. President Trump has nominated 86 men and women to the Federal bench since he took office 14 months ago.  If the President is making so many nominations, perhaps the problem lies somewhere in the Senate confirmation process. Once again, my Democratic colleagues can help figure this out. In November 2013, then-Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy spoke about obstructing judicial nominees ``in other ways that the public is less aware.'' The Democrats are using such below-the-public-radar obstruction tactics at each stage of the confirmation process.  The first stop in the confirmation process is the Senate Judiciary Under Chairman Chuck Grassley's leadership, the committee has held a hearing for 62 of President Trump's judicial nominees--more than under any of the previous five Presidents at this point. So that is clearly not the problem. The first sign of Democratic obstruction is the unwarranted and partisan opposition to reporting judicial nominations from the Judiciary  In February 2012, 3 years into the Obama administration, the Democrats complained that five nominees to the U.district court had been reported by the Judiciary Committee on a party-line vote. This, they said, departed dramatically from Senate tradition. Today, just 14 months into the Trump administration, eight nominees to the U.district court have been reported by the Judiciary Committee on a party-line vote. The present rate of such party-line votes in the Judiciary Committee is more than four times what the Democrats criticized just a few years ago.  The below-the-radar obstruction tactics continue when the Judiciary Committee sends judicial nominees to the full The Democrats, for example, refuse to cooperate in scheduling confirmation votes. They can't prevent confirmation votes altogether because they abolished nomination filibusters in 2013, but if they can't make judicial confirmations impossible, they are determined to make them very difficult. Here is how they do it.  The Senate must end debate on a nomination before it can vote on confirmation. The majority and minority have traditionally cooperated to end debate and set up confirmation votes. In March 2014, not for the first time, the Democrats said that refusing consent to schedule votes on pending nominees was obstruction. When the minority refuses that consent, the only way to end debate and set up a confirmation vote is by the formal cloture[[Page S1814]]process, which requires a cloture vote and can add up to several days to the confirmation timeline, as seen here.  Since President Trump took office, the Democrats have forced the Senate to take 28 cloture votes on judicial nominations, compared to just two cloture votes at this point under the previous five Presidents combined. Even when cloture is invoked, Senate rules provide for up to 30 hours of debate before a confirmation vote can occur. Nearly half the time under President Obama, a judicial nomination cloture vote was followed by a confirmation vote on the same day. Under President Trump, that has plummeted to 17 percent. The average time between cloture and confirmation votes for President Trump's judicial nominations is more than 55 percent longer than it was under President  When a judicial nomination gets out of the Judiciary Committee, survives an unnecessary cloture vote, and then is subjected to postcloture delay, Democratic obstruction is still not over. In March 2012, the Democrats complained about Senators having voted against nominees to the U.district court who were supported by their own two In fact, the Democrats called this a new standard of obstruction because it departed so far from Senate tradition.  Let's assume for the moment that this Democratic standard is also valid. At this point in the previous five Presidencies--from President Reagan to President Obama--U.district court nominees had received a combined total of 10 negative votes. So far, under President Trump, his confirmed district court nominees have received 72 negative votes.  Two weeks ago, the Pew Research Center released a new analysis showing that President Trump's confirmed judges have ``faced a record amount of opposition.'' In fact, this analysis concluded that President Trump's judges have each received an average of more than 22 negative votes, ``by far the highest average for any president's judges since the Senate expanded to its current 100 members in 1959.'' This level of opposition is more than four times what it was under President Obama--or should I say oppositional delay.  These tactics don't involve high-profile filibusters or headline-grabbing confirmation defeats but, rather, internal Senate rules and unwritten traditions. That is why they operate below the radar. Yet the Democrats have criticized these tactics precisely because they take their toll. Individually and especially in combination, they can add days and weeks to the time it takes to confirm a single judicial nomination even when the final confirmation vote is unanimous.  In November 2013, for example, the Democrats said that taking cloture votes on unopposed nominees amounted to ``obstruction and abuse of Senate rules.'' At that point, almost 4 years into the Obama administration, the Senate had taken one cloture vote on a judicial nominee who was later confirmed without opposition--just one. We are only 14 months into the Trump administration, and the Democrats have already forced the Senate to take five cloture votes on nominees who were later unanimously confirmed. It has already happened twice this month. If doing this once amounted to obstruction and abuse, what would my Democratic colleagues call doing it five times as often in one-fourth the time?  These are just a few of what then-Chairman Leahy called obstruction tactics that the public may not be aware of. Believe me. There is more where these came from. As I said, I want to avoid partisanship. Each of these is a Democratic standard. These are Democratic criteria. If my colleagues who once thought these were valid standards want to abandon them now, then perhaps they were also wrong the first time around. Otherwise, we have to face the conclusions that follow from applying these Democratic standards and criteria.  We face an unprecedented judicial vacancy crisis. Since President Trump is making nominations and the Judiciary Committee, under Chairman Grassley's leadership, is steadily processing them, there remains only one explanation for the vacancy crisis we face today--plain, old-fashioned, partisan obstruction. The Democrats are manipulating this process at every stage, using the very tactics that they have loudly condemned in the past to make confirmations as difficult and time-consuming as possible.  Even in politics, actions speak louder than words. In July 2012, when there were 76 judicial vacancies, Chairman Leahy said that ``we should be doing better.'' Today, with nearly twice as many vacancies, I challenge my Democratic colleagues to put actions to those words.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

221,topic-id,627,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to say ``pause,'' take a step back, reject the rule, and give ourselves a chance to, frankly, do it better.  FISA reauthorization is inarguably one of the most consequential votes we will take in this Congress because the constitutional stakes are so high. Civil liberties are the core of our Bill of Rights, and we are asked to take action that affects them in the name of keeping us safe. I get that.  But it is critical that we get it right. I think we can do better. To make decisions of this magnitude, we should have the most robust process possible, full and open debate, and input from the stakeholders, thoughtful deliberations by the The process for this bill thus far has decidedly not been that, has not been great. It was written and rewritten in secret and with minimal debate or stakeholders' input.  But--this is a big but--I am actually optimistic because I have seen a change in the last few days and I think we have an opportunity here. The administration is suddenly engaged, and we are seeing vibrant debate from stakeholders in the technology sector, civil liberties advocates. Members have had very serious discussions, including here on the floor today, but in the Halls, offering amendments to rules, unfortunately, which are not being allowed--save one.  We are being asked to shut all that down, that opportunity, and push through an extension that will run for 6 years. Frankly, stop and think: 6 years in the world of technology is an eternity.[[Page H110]]  So, for all these reasons, I ask my fellow Members to join me in opposing this rule and, instead, allow the House an opportunity to work its will, to take a little more time, and to do it better because we really do need to wrestle with privacy, with what privacy means in a world where our entire personal lives are stored somewhere online as ones and zeros. Frankly, that is happening at an even faster pace than it is now.  We need to debate how the Fourth Amendment protects us against search and seizures applying to our digital records. We are all being rendered into nothing but a massive storehouse of ones and zeros.  The tensions or balance between civil liberties and national security is a debate as old as this country, but they are not mutually exclusive. They are hard--they are darn hard--but they are not mutually exclusive and they are not impossible.  I know well how many threats we face around the world and I don't take them lightly. The fact that we have not faced another major terrorist attack since 9/11 is a testament to the skill and the hard work of the intelligence community, and I tip my hat to them. I am absolutely committed to giving them the tools they need to keep us safe, consistent with our constitutional rights.  But we live in an era of the most powerful spying tools the world has ever known. Twenty-five years ago conversations were ephemeral. They were conducted in person or over the phone. But now they occur over email or chat and they are archived forever. Our medical, financial, and legal records are all online; so are our photos. Our cell phones track us everywhere we go.  The data available on us is unprecedented, and the fundamental principle of the Bill of Rights is that we have the right to keep our data private. We need new safeguards to ensure that.  So, by rejecting this rule, we have a chance to do it better. In so doing, both keep us safe and protect our constitutional rights.

In fact, I would argue that these Dreamers are the future of a great  Every day these young people add to the strength of our economy, to the vitality of our country. More than 97 percent of DACA recipients are in school or in the workforce.  The DACA Program allowed them to work legally, to get driver's licenses, to go to college, to serve in our military and give back to their communities. DACA helped almost 70 percent of recipients secure a job with better pay, and better pay leads to real investments in our communities and our economy.  After their DACA applications were approved, nearly two-thirds of recipients reported buying their first car, and almost one in six reported buying a new home. DACA recipients also paid billions of dollars in Federal, State, and local taxes. Why on Earth would[[Page S119]]we kick out these contributors to our economy and our country?  The economic impact of removing nearly 700,000 workers from the U.workforce would be staggering. It would cost our economy nearly half a trillion dollars in GDP loss over the next decade. But passing the Dream Act could add an estimated $281 billion to the U.economy over the next 10 years. That, to me, sounds like putting America first.  I stand with these Dreamers, and I always have. One of my first actions when I was in the House of Representatives was to sign on as an original cosponsor of the Dream Act, which would create a pathway to legal status and citizenship for Dreamers who pursue higher education or serve our Nation in uniform. This commonsense, compassionate, and responsible policy is long overdue for a generation of young  Since President Trump made the heartless decision to end DACA, I have held his administration accountable for their mishandling of renewal applications for DACA recipients. My office has assisted Dreamers in New Mexico through the DACA renewal process and is actively participating in meetings with communities and local advocacy groups throughout the  I introduced legislation to safeguard Dreamers' private information, such as addresses and telephone numbers, so the Trump administration can't use those to target them or their families for deportation.  When my office learned that the Department of Homeland Security had arbitrarily rejected hundreds of renewal applications that arrived late because they were delayed by the Postal Service, I pressed the administration to take immediate action to reverse its decision. I am pleased to say that Dreamers whose applications were rejected due to Postal Service delays were allowed to resubmit their renewals for In fact, just last week, the first two DACA recipients in New Mexico, who brought this to my attention with the help of Catholic Charities, were told that they could move forward with their DACA renewal applications.  President Trump's decision means that until Congress passes the Dream Act, these young members of our communities still face deep uncertainty about whether they will be able to stay in school, keep working and contributing to our economy, and remain in the Nation that they call home.  Congress must pass the Dream Act now. Threatening to deport these young people who grew up in America and want to contribute to their Nation will not fix our broken immigration system. Making the American people foot the bill to build an unnecessary and wasteful border wall--which families in New Mexico's border communities have told me they do not want nor do they need--will not fix our broken immigration system.  President Trump and congressional Republicans wasted an entire year trying to take away American's healthcare and then rushing through tax breaks for the superwealthy in the final weeks of the year. By squandering an entire year, they pushed Dreamers aside and put their lives in jeopardy.  I voted to fund the government through the holidays in hopes that Congress could finally reach an agreement to pass the Dream We also urgently need to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, fix wildfire disaster funding, provide disaster relief for Puerto Rico, which is still recovering from Hurricane Taking care of these long-neglected and bipartisan priorities is the bare minimum of governance. Republican leaders in Congress need to take this opportunity seriously, especially if they expect our support.  I will be fighting every step of the way to pass the Dream Act, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do the same.  Since President Trump shamefully pulled the rug out from under Dreamers when he hastily ended the DACA Program, I have spent time meeting with Dreamers in New Mexico, as well as here in You cannot hear their stories without realizing how morally bankrupt the administration's current policy is. It is impossible for me to convey the desperation and the fear they are feeling every day that passes without our passing the Dream  Now is the time to give these young Americans a permanent place in this great Enough is enough. Their patience has worn thin with the President and congressional Republicans using them as political bargaining chips. It is immoral to play politics with the lives of these young  I will say it again. Congress absolutely must pass the Dream Act, and we have an opportunity to do it now.  We should not stop once we pass the Dream Leaders in Congress have waited far too long to finally address our Nation's overall broken immigration system. I still continue to believe that our Nation urgently needs Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform, which includes a visa program that meets the needs of our economy. It is a tough but fair path to earn citizenship for the estimated 11 million people in our country who are undocumented and a plan that ensures community safety and security at our borders.  When I think about immigration, I always wonder how different my own life would be if America had turned my father away when he immigrated here as a young boy. Our Nation's enduring spirit has been built by the hard work and the dreams of so many striving young immigrants like my father in the 1930s and like so many Dreamers today.

1131,topic-id,850,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of H.4545, the Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform  It is a strongly bipartisan bill, having come out of our committee by a vote of 50-10. It is authored by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.Tipton), who serves as the vice chairman of our Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and is, indeed, one of the leaders in the House in bringing regulatory relief to our community financial institutions. I want to thank him for his leadership on this very, very important issue.  H.4545 creates transparency and accountability among regulators by improving the timeliness of examinations, while also creating a new more independent examination appeals process.                              {time}  1315  Madam Speaker, this is about, again, transparency. It is about due process. The Office of Independent Examination Review created under this bill will ensure accountability and fairness for financial institutions during their supervisory examinations. It does so by providing the right for these institutions to obtain an independent review of a material supervisory determination contained in a final examination report.  The creation of this independent review process is particularly important for our Nation's community banks and credit unions that will now be able to appeal their examination decisions without fear of reprisal from their regulator.  By reforming the process for examining financial institutions to ensure it is fair and consistent, Congress will indeed enhance the safety and soundness of the financial system overall while ensuring Main Street businesses can access the liquidity and capital resources they need to grow and create jobs. Again, Madam Speaker, this is why this is so important. Ultimately, this is about ensuring a free flow of credit to Main Street businesses and families.  Many of our community financial institutions have felt a very, very heavy hand of burdensome Federal regulations that were intended--or so we were told--for the largest and most complex institutions; and regulators, unfortunately, seem to ignore congressional directive and apply each one of these standards to our smallest institutions. Thus, yesterday, Madam Speaker, we voted on the TAILOR Act, also authored by the gentleman from Colorado, that would also help ensure these regulations are tailored to the size and complexity of the institution.  Without having due process and fairness in this exam review, the result has been catastrophic. This regulatory burden, of which this is a part, has been resulting in the closing or merger of one community bank or credit union per day, on average. And again, they are not being lost to natural causes.  Our community financial institutions serve as the backbone of our American economy, and we simply cannot afford to lose them. As chairman of the Financial Services Committee, in my sixth year, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are all too familiar with this problem. I hear from credit unions and community banks every day.  I heard from West Community Credit Union in Missouri, who wrote: ``This one-size-fits-all approach is simpleminded and has real consequences. We are beginning to make changes that will negatively impact our ability to continue to serve members in meeting their home equity lending needs.''  In fact, Madam Speaker, we know that a number of banks and credit unions have had to leave mortgage lending because of the regulatory burden.  Then there is County-City Credit Union in Wisconsin, who said: ``Small credit unions are dropping every day. Unless we get immediate relief, there won't be any left. That would be tragic for our members and the very fabric of our country. Please help us, and help us right now.''  I have good news. Help is on the way if we can get a good, solid vote this afternoon.  The CEO of Commonwealth National Bank in Tennessee wrote: ``The fact remains that there are fewer community banks today than there were several years ago, a trend that will continue until rational changes''--for example, like the ones we are speaking of today, Madam Speaker--``are made that will provide some relief to America's hometown banks.''  Again, we are hearing this plea every single day. So there is good reason why H.4545 was reported by this committee with a strong bipartisan vote, 50-10, including a majority support of the Democrats on the committee.  Again, the bill is strongly bipartisan, it is practical, and it is necessary. H.4545 will allow financial institutions, again, to have supervisory determinations reviewed by a newly established independent examination review board. This will allow for uniformity among regulatory agencies, again, while making the overall exam process more fair and more efficient.  The bill does not prevent a regulatory agency from conducting examinations or imposing restrictions on financial exams, but, again, it will restore fairness, due process, and accountability for the sake of our community banks and credit unions; and, more importantly, for the sake of those who still have the American Dream of either buying their own home, starting their own business, or sending that first kid to college, it is imperative that we enact H.4545.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-03-15-pt1-PgH1624-3.txt,1749,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4545, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS",2018.0,15.0,March

1147,topic-id,321,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes to say that I just find some of the comments of the ranking member curious.  I know if she continues this attack on the so-called Wall Street megabanks, I just continue to be so curious why she supports bailing them out? She voted against the Financial CHOICE Act that would have ended bailouts to these megabanks. And so she supports a bailout fund in Dodd-Frank to continue to bail out these banks.  Second of all, if she continues to attack them, I guess I am curious also why she supports the Federal Reserve's program to pay interest on excess reserves. She supports taking taxpayer money to pay the so-called Wall Street megabanks not to loan money to Main Street, something that I have opposed as have many other Republicans on this side of the aisle.  And then to make matters worse, Mr.Speaker, on this interest on excess reserves, these banks are getting almost 10 to 15 times what our constituents are getting on their savings accounts.  In many cases, it is the difference between 0.07 percent, versus 1.5 percent. And so I understand, again, she attacks them, but then I am just curious, why does she find so many ways to support them?  So personally, I think in this economy, there is a need for community banks and credit unions. There is a need for regional banks, and there is a need for global banks as well. What we want is accountability. We want less Federal control, and what we want is more private capital. We want to ensure that there are never more taxpayer bailouts.  And again, as I said earlier, as this so-called parade of horribles was brought to the attention of the House, why is it that a majority of Democrats on her committee support this legislation?

I am sorry that the ranking member has not chosen to be part of that bipartisanship, but over half of the committee Democrats on our committee support it. Why? Because they understand that it is part of our American DNA to have due process.  When we continue to lose a credit union or a community bank every day in America, on average, with their loss, we are losing home ownership opportunities, opportunities to grow businesses.  Because of that regulatory burden, these exams can mean the difference between a credit union being open and not being open. They can mean the difference between a community bank being open or not open. Thus, it means the difference in our constituents getting homes and small business loans and auto loans.  This is common sense. It simply says you ought to be able to appeal an exam, have a third party take a look at it.  Everybody deserves due process in America, including our community banks and credit unions, so that is why it is so important that we enact H.4545. It came out of our committee with a huge bipartisan vote. Let's make sure credit continues to flow throughout  Mr.Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.4545, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

1156,topic-id,472,"Mr.Speaker, again, what we are talking about here is fundamental due process: due process for every American, due process for every institution regardless of its size, regardless of its geography. This is about due process.  As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote: ``Whatever disagreement there may be as to the scope of the phrase `due process of law,' there can be no doubt that it embraces the fundamental conception of a fair trial, with opportunity to be heard.'' He is one of the most famous jurists in all of American history.  We are trying to ensure, again, that a bank examiner or a credit union examiner is not tantamount to judge, jury, prosecutor, cop on the beat, and executioner all rolled into one. There is no due process if your only practical appeal is to the person who rendered the judgment in the first place.  So, number one, it is important that all Americans, all institutions receive due process, which is perhaps why even over half of the Democrats on the Financial Services Committee chose to support H.4545.  The ranking member's amendment would set a threshold here, but her threshold, as she talks about these so-called megabanks, at $10 billion, that is one-half of 1 percent of the size of J. So, Mr.Speaker, I don't believe in too-big-to-fail banks. I know my friends on the other side of the aisle do. That is why they voted for the bailout fund to support these too-big-to-fail financial institutions with taxpayer funds.  I don't believe in too-big-to-fail institutions, but if I did, Mr.Speaker, if I did, it would be limited to maybe eight or nine banks in It certainly wouldn't be applicable to any community bank, credit union, or regional bank.

1295,topic-id,708,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, we were told many, many years ago that Dodd-Frank was passed to deal with the big Wall Street banks, that somehow our community banks and our credit unions would be held harmless because, Mr.Speaker, they didn't cause the crisis.  Now, we can have the discussion of what did--that is a whole different discussion for a different day--but unfortunately, regardless of whatever good intentions there might have been at the time, and I don't offer an opinion as to those intentions, the facts are that, since Dodd-Frank was passed, the big banks are bigger and the small banks and credit unions are fewer. We are losing, on average, a community bank or credit union every other day in  And as we lose them, Mr.Speaker, so do we lose the hopes and dreams and desires of our constituents, of so many[[Page H1577]]hardworking Americans who deserve to buy that car, who deserve to be able to own their own home, who deserve, after working so many years on the assembly line, to finally capitalize their own small business. But none of this is going to happen unless we actually tailor this regulatory burden to the size and complexity of the financial institution, something that, in many respects, was promised by Dodd-Frank but not delivered by Dodd- So I am very, very happy that, today, we have yet another bipartisan bill from the Financial Services Committee that is aimed to promote economic growth, to help hardworking Americans, again, achieve their American Dream, because half of this country is living from paycheck to paycheck, and we need to ease that economic anxiety, and so we have got to make sure that the lifeblood of credit, that capital, is flowing through the system.  It is our community banks in particular that fund our small businesses. Unfortunately, up until the advent of the new administration, Mr.Speaker, small business lending by banks was at a 25-year low, entrepreneurship was at a generational low.  Now, thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we have turned that corner, but we have so much further to go. So a particularly hardworking member of the House Financial Services Committee, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.Tipton), has come to us today with H.1116, the Taking Account of Institutions with Low Operation Risk Act, yes, Mr.Speaker, the TAILOR  Simply put, what this bill does is simply directs the Federal financial regulators to, again, simply tailor their regulations to entities based upon their size, their risk profile, their complexity. It also demands that they have some transparency in this process by requiring that the regulators report to Congress, report to the representatives of ``we the people'' how they have actually tailored the regulations--again, something that was implied, something that was promised in Dodd-Frank but did not actually occur.  Again, Mr.Speaker, every single day we hear from our community financial institutions. I heard from one in New Mexico that said:       You know, we are a $300 million community bank in an area      with high unemployment. Thirty-seven percent of our employees      are active in community organizations, Little League,      charities, and many serve in leadership positions in these      organizations, and we also make tens of thousands of dollars      in charitable contributions every year; but if our bank can't      survive, you take away the local leadership, you take away      the economic engine of our community.  This banker was clearly talking about the regulatory burden.  I heard from one in Iowa:       I am a mortgage consumer lender and also the compliance      officer of a small community bank in rural I have been      in banking for over 30 years and always enjoyed my job until      the last 5 years. The new rules that will be implemented are      ridiculous, and at that time, we may discontinue to offer in-     house mortgage loans.  Unfortunately, Mr.Speaker, my mailbox runneth over.  As our small banks and credit unions go, so goes the American  At a bare minimum, let's tailor the rules and regulations to the size and complexity of the institution so our credit unions, so our banks can thrive and, thus, our constituents can thrive and meet their economic goals and responsibilities.

That is everything to do with the regulatory burden, Mr. I heard from Sara in Eustace in my district. She writes:       I would like to refinance with a cashout option to fix some      storm damage to my property and home, but I found out that it      is not an option for me because the government doesn't      believe I should be able to do this.  I heard from Alan, in Kaufman, Texas, who said:       However, as a small-business owner, I offer owner financing      for real estate to people with little or no credit, but the      overregulation of Dodd-Frank has caused my cost of business      to rise. I am forced to pass that cost on to the consumer.      Regulations cost the consumer, not the business.  So the ranking member wants to know who is for this bill. Well, I can[[Page H1583]]tell you what, Colton is for this bill, Sara is for this bill, Al is for this bill, and, oh, by the way, so is the gentleman from Washington (Mr.Heck), Democratic member of our committee; so is the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.Gottheimer), Democratic member of our committee; so is the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Gonzalez), Democrat member of our committee; so is the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Scott), Democratic member of our committee.

I know that my friends on the other side of the aisle, over a year later, still cannot accept the outcome of the election, which, unfortunately, is a complete slap in the face of democracy.  I know there is an element that works full time on the other side of the aisle to impeach the This is their full-time avocation. Meanwhile, on this side of the aisle, Mr.Speaker, we continue to work in order to try to improve the lot in lives of the common working man and woman.  So we were very proud to work with the President on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that has brought us the lowest unemployment rate in America in 17 years.  Under their economic policies, Mr.Speaker, what we saw were high levels of unemployment. What we saw were stagnant wages. What we saw was 1.6 percent GDP growth when in the postwar era we have averaged 3 percent economic growth. What we saw under their economic policies was that people couldn't make ends meet. Too many were still living paycheck to paycheck.  And now I hear from my constituents. I heard from one the other day who said: Guess what? They just announced at my husband's business everybody is getting a 5 percent pay increase.  I just heard from Michael in Terrell, who is a doctor, and he said: Thanks to President Trump--who they are trying to impeach--thanks to President Trump and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, now I can afford to buy a new ultrasound machine for my rural practice, and I am going to actually hire an additional ultrasound technician.  All due to the President, again, they are trying to impeach.  I heard from Charles in Winnsboro who said: You know what? The new tax reforms will drop my tax bracket by 17 percent, and this will allow me to rebuild my shop that had been destroyed.  And then I look at the employers in my hometown of Dallas, Texas: American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, AT&T, So many of them, Mr.Speaker, are offering $1,000 bonuses. Many are offering increases in minimum wages. Many have increased 401(k) plans. All, again, due to the activities of the Republicans, because not one single Democrat supported the Tax Cuts and Jobs  So I understand how my friends on the other side of the aisle wish to attempt to change the subject because they are probably now embarrassed they didn't support it, because they have seen how much good it has done, how much of a difference it makes.  So if they want to waste the House's time by once again trying to find ways to undermine the President, impeach the President, I know it is a full-time job for many, but on this side of the aisle, we are going to continue to make sure that the lot of the common man and woman is improved.

1580,topic-id,607,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.4566, the Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors  Mr.Speaker, I especially want to thank the gentleman from Maine (Mr.Poliquin), one of the most hardworking, enthusiastic, cheerful members of the House Financial Services Committee for all the work that he has done to advance this very strong piece of bipartisan legislation, which, incidentally, passed the Financial Services Committee again with another strong bipartisan vote of 47-8.  Now, the financial crisis led to questions, both domestically and internationally, about how to address financial stability and create a regulatory framework to mitigate systemic risk, all the while ensuring robust economic growth.  At the heart of this bill of the gentleman from Maine is a recognition that our economy can suffer when we get it wrong, when government attempts to dictate the business models and operational objectives of so many of our businesses. It is also a recognition that one-size-fits-all regulations can stifle economic growth and ultimately harm consumers and harm our constituents.  Current bank-centric standards and assessments to nonbank industries, such as the asset management industry, have needlessly saddled Main Street investors with increased costs while they are trying to save for college or retirement or some other important need, and this is perhaps no clearer than in this stress testing regime.  As a former SEC chief economist observed in 2016, who said that, in the current law, ``stress test the big banks; and, oh, you might as well go ahead and do the asset management companies.'' That is his take of what the law says.  In other words, asset management firms that, again, our constituents depend upon for their retirement security or for their financial planning are now subject to bank regulations simply because they operate under the financial services umbrella, even though such firms plainly have legal, structural, and operational characteristics that make them very, very different from banks.  By the way, none of the asset managers had anything to do with the financial crisis that brought about the legislation that we are debating in the first place. For example, unlike banks, asset managers do not have access to the deposit insurance fund or the Fed's discount window.  If that is not enough for you, Mr.Speaker, here is more. Asset managers are legally separated--legally separated from the funds they manage, meaning that the asset and liabilities of the manager are distinct from the assets and liabilities of the funds.  On the other hand, the bank business model directly subjects the bank to the risks and obligations of its assets and liabilities. Again, applying a one-size-fits-all regulatory structure--in this case, a bank-centric model--is not only bad for the asset management industry, but, far more importantly, for our constituents that they serve, who choose to save and invest.  Registered funds are the investment vehicle choices for millions of Americans seeking to buy a home, pay for college, plan for financial security and retirement. Application of unnecessary, ill-suited, bank-centric stress testing requirements to register funds[[Page H1713]]and advisers will undoubtedly increase cost for these funds and advisers, and, ultimately, this gets passed on to investors without any corresponding benefits that we can discern.  The recent asset management and insurance report issued by the Department of Treasury confirms these concerns. The bill of the gentleman from Maine (Mr.Poliquin) would fix this unequal regulatory structure by exempting certain nonbank financial institutions that have not been designated for supervision by the Federal Reserve Board from the act's stress testing requirement.  Further, in the true spirit of bipartisanship, I want to thank the gentlewoman from New York (",CREC-2018-03-20-pt1-PgH1712-2.txt,1749,1600,2018.0,20.0,January

1583,topic-id,444,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.McHenry), who is the vice chairman of our Financial Services Committee and the chief deputy majority whip.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding time today on this important bill.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors It rolls off the tongue to some, maybe Bruce Poliquin's, the bill's sponsor, but it is an important thing for us to discuss here today.  Now, hindsight bias is a very dangerous thing. It allows us to overstate our ability to predict an outcome, and it is something that lures us into creating a new system that while excellent at solving the last financial crisis or the last crisis, the last event, it fails to see the next event coming.  Now, it is not something that just fortune tellers use. It is not something that just those with an NCAA pool would use to say that all along they knew UMBC would beat It is not just used there. Here in Washington, it is done by bureaucrats that are susceptible to these same fallacies.  So in the wake of the financial crisis, policymakers here in Washington raced to give regulators new tools to help predict future risks so that such a crisis would never happen again.  One of those tools was stress testing. The idea was to provide a method to test financial firms to differentiate between solid institutions that can weather a financial storm and those that would need help. But this crystal ball has flaws. One of the biggest flaws is treating all large financial firms the same, a one-size-fits-all approach, and this includes lumping in nonbank financial firms that don't use leverage with financial firms--bank firms--that do use leverage.  Despite this widely understood concept that capital adequacy standards do not fit neatly into assessing the risks of the asset management industry, for instance, regulators have instead stuck to their rigid methodology to try to square the circle, or circle the square, whatever that phrase is.  Thankfully, Representative Bruce Poliquin has crafted a very solid bill to address this truth and bring it into reality legislatively. The stress tests built after the financial crisis do not work for nonbank financial firms. This is a security show rather than security in fact.  Thus, in a world that constantly throws big and unexpected events our way, understanding the limitations of[[Page H1715]]predicting risk is one of the most important steps we can take to avoid future harm, and that is what this bill does. I encourage my House colleagues to vote in support of and in favor of it.  ",CREC-2018-03-20-pt1-PgH1712-2.txt,1749,STRENGTHENING AVIATION SECURITY ACT OF 2018,2018.0,20.0,January

Mr.Speaker, once again, I want to encourage all of my colleagues to support H.4566, the legislation from the gentleman from I want to commend him once again. He is one of our most hardworking members on the committee, and he cares passionately about his constituents in  I also want to commend him for once again working on a very bipartisan basis. He has managed to change his bill from its original concept many times to try to garner more support from the other side of the aisle.  With the acceptance of the ranking member's amendment, again, I am hopeful that we will have a very, very strong vote in the Again, this came out of committee with a very strong bipartisan vote of 47-8.  Mr.Speaker, very often we debate regulation. I think that now, fortunately, we have a 3 percent growth Tax Code which has been passed by Congress, but, unfortunately, I do not believe we have a 3 percent growth of finance in the banking system.  That is important. It is important to our constituents who still need credit to buy that first home, a factory worker who needs to get their transmission repaired so that they can go to work, some parent trying to send a kid to college, or people trying to plan for their retirement.  Too often, I think we have a dichotomy between regulation and deregulation, when the real dichotomy is between smart regulation and dumb regulation. It is always incumbent upon us in Congress to look very carefully at these regulations. Sometimes they look very good on the chalkboard, but in reality, they don't quite render the results or benefits that we had hoped for. So we always have to take a look at what this is doing not just to consumer and investor protection, but what it is doing to economic growth as well.  I agree with the ranking member. Stress testing is a good concept. It is one of the reasons why banks and other financial firms typically stress-test themselves daily, weekly, monthly, annually.  What doesn't make sense, though, is that there be no recognition to the cost that it imposes, as the gentleman from Missouri, the chairman of our Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee, was very articulate in reminding us that these submissions can cost us millions and millions of dollars. The reports are not measured in pages; they are measured by the pound. There can be 10- and 20-pound submissions of paper that we wonder if anybody ever reads.  But what especially doesn't make sense is trying to apply a bank stress test to a nonbank financial institution, particularly an asset manager. I know the ranking member was talking a little bit earlier about using an analogy to auto inspections: It makes no sense to have the home inspectors inspect your auto; it makes no sense to have the auto inspectors inspect your home.  The gentleman from Maine is ensuring that whatever stress test is applied, it is applied properly to the business model that needs to be tested for its potential stress of our financial system.  So, again, I just want to commend the gentleman from Maine for his hard work, and I urge all Members to vote in favor of H.4566 because, indeed,[[Page H1717]]maybe it is not a catchy title, but it is an accurate title. As we alleviate stress test burdens, we do help investors.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Hudson). All time for debate on the bill has expired.

I want to thank the ranking member for working with the majority side in order to advance this, again, as a very strong bipartisan vote in the House, which I hope and anticipate with the inclusion of this amendment.

2052,topic-id,845,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H.4263, the Regulation A+ Improvement  I want to thank the sponsor of this bipartisan legislation, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.MacArthur). He has been a huge leader on all capital formation issues within our committee and in this He is a real asset. His business acumen is well positioned to help serve us, and his leadership on this bill should be commended.  Mr.Speaker, although small companies are at the forefront of technological innovation and job creation, they often face significant obstacles in obtaining funding in our capital markets. These obstacles generally stem from the disproportionately larger burden that securities regulations, written principally for large public companies, instead place on small companies when they seek to go public.  In 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, known as JOBS Act, sought to modernize and better tailor some of these regulations, including A, under our securities law. Reg.[[Page H1635]]A is a longstanding exemption from SEC registration that permits public offerings without formal registration as long as certain conditions are met.  Prior to the JOBS Act, a small company seeking to use A was limited to raising $5 million of securities in a 12-month period. As you can imagine, over time, Mr.Speaker, A offerings became increasingly rare due to the relatively small offering size that was available and a requirement that A securities still comply with 50 different State securities law registration and qualification requirements.  Title IV of the JOBS Act attempted to address the antiquated Regulation A by directing the SEC to update it, which the SEC did in 2015, under the moniker A+, by creating two tiers of Regulation A offerings and allowing certain securities to qualify for preemption from State securities law.  Under the second tier, the SEC increased the amount companies can offer from $5 million to $50 million. Mr.MacArthur's legislation only pertains to the Tier 2 limit.  Since A+ was implemented in 2015, small businesses have increasingly been able to use this tool to raise much-needed capital to expand their businesses and create new jobs in our economy. According to the SEC Office of Small Business Policy, as of November 2017, 69 completed A+ offerings had raised a total of $611 million.  Unfortunately, the $50 million cap leaves significant opportunity on the table for our startups, opportunity that could be better realized if the limit were increased to $75 million, which the Treasury Department has recommended as a potentially less costly alternative for startups to raise capital. Moreover, increasing the A+ limit will better position companies that want to use the exemption as an on-ramp to list publicly to bear the corresponding compliance burdens and still invest in jobs and growth.  Mr.Speaker, more and more, we have seen IPOs of companies with products that we use every day--Uber, Facebook, Spotify, Snapchat--come after the company is already valued over $1 billion. For everyday investors, this often means missing out on some of the most dynamic growth stages of the company that would provide the highest rate of returns for them and their family, all while the wealthy, accredited investors and venture capital firms can invest early, and they get to rake in the better rates of return.  With regulations disproportionately stacked against them, it isn't surprising that small companies so often are choosing to stay private. Many have no other choice. Again, after all, the SEC has estimated that the costs of going public, on average, are $2.5 million in regulatory costs for undergoing an IPO and annual compliance costs averaging $1.5 million thereafter.  Those costs stand in stark contrast to the $111,000 the SEC says is the average legal and auditing cost for A+ offerings. In other words, by utilizing A+, small businesses can raise significant capital while saving more than $2 million--$2 million that can be invested in jobs and research and other growth opportunities. This is why A+ is so important: it provides a more cost-effective way to raise equity capital early on in the growth stages of these companies.  Additionally, A offerings enjoy preemption from State securities laws. Mr.Speaker, I hope every Member pays close attention to this. They may not know it.  In 1980, when a startup computer company, by the way, called Apple decided to go public, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts decided the stock was too risky and barred its sale to individual investors in the Today, Apple's market valuation is almost $1 trillion. It is an American iconic brand and one of the largest companies in the world. And it is, again, potentially going to be the first public company with a trillion-dollar market cap. If you had bought 45 shares of Apple when it was offered at its IPO, by the end of last year you would have over $394,000. That is hardly crumbs, Mr. In short, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It is a very smart but modest improvement in a popular JOBS Act provision.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-03-15-pt1-PgH1634.txt,1749,"ECONOMIC GROWTH, REGULATORY RELIEF, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT",2018.0,15.0,March
2053,topic-id,596,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.MacArthur), the sponsor of this legislation and a hardworking member of the Financial Services  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I am proud to advance this bill--this bipartisan bill. I am grateful for my Democratic cosponsor, Congresswoman Sinema; Democratic Congressman Gottheimer; and Republican Congressman Hollingsworth, for joining me in this effort.  The purpose of this bill is pretty simple and pretty narrow. Seven out of ten new jobs in this country come from our Nation's 28 million small businesses. When we help those businesses grow, we help them create new jobs.  I think of the biopharmaceutical companies in my home State of New Jersey as an example of companies that desperately need capital to continue to grow, and that growth creates new jobs. The Federal Government cannot do everything, but we can surely help these companies grow in our country.  The 1933 Securities Act laid the groundwork that all interstate security offerings have to be registered with the It was cumbersome, it was expensive, so that Congress made some exceptions. Regulation A allowed a limited amount of offerings for Main Street investors, and Regulation D allowed unlimited offerings for accredited investors. This bill is working at Regulation  Over time, those limits have gone up periodically. The last time it was lifted was effective 2015. It was raised to $50 million, and it has been helpful. It has created growth. It has created new jobs.  This bill is a modest improvement, raising that $50 million to $75 million. This was contemplated in the original JOBS Act, where we raised it to $50 million. In that law, the SEC was required to either increase the $50 million or to explain to us why they weren't doing it. Their deadline for doing that expired at the end of 2017. So this is an overdue increase, and I think it is high time that we do it.  I could offer a lot of anecdotes of how this benefits companies. I thought I would offer the one that is closest to home, my own story.  I was fortunate enough to buy a fairly small business in 2002. I did three capital raises in the years that followed. The first was for $12 million, the second was for $75 million, the third was for $500 million. And those capital raises continued during my period of ownership of the company.  I can tell you, without any question, the smallest capital raises were the hardest for me. It is much harder to raise this much money than it is to raise this much. When I was raising a lot of money, I had a lot of interested parties. When I was raising the smaller amount, it was difficult.  What this bill does is allow growing companies to have another point in the market where they can raise money. It is not just banks or private equity funds; it is regular, Main Street investors.

2067,topic-id,732,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I again want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.MacArthur), an entrepreneur, someone who brings years and years of experience in capital formation of building a business to help grow jobs and our economy.  H.4263, again, is, in part, an expansion of the JOBS Act, something that was signed into law by President Barack I didn't agree with that particular President on many occasions, but he got this right, and this has been something good for the American economy.  But what I fear is that, if we don't go forward, we end up going backwards. And what we hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle is: Let's keep the status quo.  But, Mr.Speaker, the status quo is what brought us a 1.6 percent economy. The status quo is what brought paychecks to become stagnant. The status quo ensured that Americans did not recover their savings from the great financial crisis.  Now we have the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and now we have 3 percent economic growth; now we have the lowest unemployment rate in 17 years; now we have seen the greatest growth in paychecks in almost a decade; now we are seeing 90 percent--90 percent--of wage earners seeing a bigger paycheck, better take-home pay, because of the economic policies of this Republican Congress and of the Trump administration.  So the gentleman from New Jersey has brought us, really, in some respects, an important but modest proposition: that we ought to increase the threshold for Reg A+ to $75 million.  Again, we don't know where the next Uber is coming from. We don't know where the next Spotify is coming from. We don't know where the next Apple is coming from. But do you know what, Mr.Speaker? We all know they need capital. And this is a valuable alley, chain, path in order to bring capital into our startup businesses.  Now, a constant theme we hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle is consumer protection. Do you know what? Back in the 1980s, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts decided to protect their people from this fly-by-night company called Apple, which now is looking at an almost $1 trillion market cap valuation, and had you invested at the IPO, you would have a 45,000 percent rate of return. You could buy a home; your children could buy a home; your great-grandchildren could buy a home. You could achieve your American But a government decided: No, you are too stupid to make this investment decision on your own. We must protect you.  Nothing--nothing--in the bill from the gentleman from New Jersey alters the vast, vast array of consumer protection laws that are already on the books. Nothing in H.4263 prevents the Department of Justice from pursuing criminal prosecutions of fraud. Nothing in the bill impacts the SEC's ability to pursue civil actions for those[[Page H1640]]who engage in fraud, negligent misrepresentations, negligent transactions.  Nothing in this bill prevents the SEC from entering into cease and desist orders and imposing civil liabilities for those who violate SEC rules. Investors get to pursue Federal civil actions against those who defraud them, those who make untrue statements. So there are plenty of very important laws that are on our books.  What we shouldn't do, though, is protect our hardworking constituents from the ability to make decisions for themselves and participate in these early growth companies that now are only restricted to accredited investors. It is only the wealthiest who get to make these decisions. Well, in the land of the free, maybe a few more should, and maybe we ought to have a few more Apples, a few more Ubers, a few more  I want to thank, again, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.MacArthur), who has been a great leader in capital formation and job creation on our committee and in this Congress, and I want to urge all Members to adopt H.4263.

2072,topic-id,568,"Mr.Speaker, when I have said something incorrect, I wish to correct myself in front of my colleagues in the public. I earlier said that my colleagues were trying to give us status quo. I wish to correct myself. This motion to recommit is worse than status quo. It would take us back even further.  The gentlewoman from Ohio should admit when she is wrong. She is wrong when she says this will not kill the bill. This will kill it. It will gut it. It will bury it 6 feet under. I think she knows that. So she is entitled to her opinion about what A+ should be, but she absolutely eviscerates the bipartisan bill that is before the  Because many who are watching this may somehow think, ``Oh, my Lord, there are no consumer protections for A+ offerings,'' the basic requirements that are applicable to both Tier 1 and tier offerings include company eligibility requirements, bad actor disqualification requirements, issuer disclosure requirements, ongoing reporting requirements.  And then for Tier 2 offerings, additional requirements: providing audited financial statements; requirement to file annual, semiannual, and current event reports; and limitation on the amount of security nonaccredited and accredited investors can purchase.[[Page H1641]]  Then those that are offered on an exchange have to adhere to the exchange's listing standards, including corporate governance requirement, background checks on the management and board, shareholder approval of certain corporate actions, and the list goes on.  Mr.Speaker, I think there is a good case here. Anybody who picked up a newspaper recently would find out that, yesterday, the SEC charged Theranos with raising more than $700 million from investors through exaggerated and false statements about the company's technology.  Guess what. In announcing the enforcement decision, here is what the SEC noted:       The charges make clear that there is no exemption--no      exemption--from the antifraud provisions of the Federal      securities laws simply because a company is nonpublic,      development-stage, or the subject of exuberant media      attention.  In other words, the SEC was thoroughly able to do their job, and they were ready and willing to investigate and bring enforcement actions, as they well should. This is part of their job, investor protection. But guess what. So is capital formation. Capital formation is part of the mission of the That is why it is so important that we not protect our constituents against great investment opportunities, like Apple, like Uber, and like  So when we have so many Americans who are still living paycheck to paycheck, when they finally get a little savings together, shouldn't they be able to invest in great opportunities of early growth companies? Shouldn't these early growth companies have access to capital?  I think so.  You can't have capitalism without capital. Let's get more capital circulating in the system. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has done so much good, but we need so much more. We need capital circulating the system, particularly for our startups and our early growth stage companies.

2059,topic-id,369,"Mr.Speaker, I, too, want to add my congratulations to Mr.MacArthur for continuing to find ways to improve Mr.Obama's and this committee's excellent work on the JOBS Act from some 8 years ago. We have learned a lot. We have seen the benefits of the JOBS Act, and today we have a chance to make it even better by improving A+.  I appreciate Mr.MacArthur's personal story about his entrepreneurship and how this is an opportunity for more investors in our country and more capital for our entrepreneurs.  Mr.Speaker, this week I attended a meeting where people asked: Why do we need more public companies?  Gosh, that is an easy rhetorical question.  Because we have half the number of public companies we had during the Reagan administration, and we need them for our young people to invest in. We need them for our union workers to have an earning asset in their pension fund.  So we need more public companies in this Nation to share the growth and prosperity of this That is what this legislation is all about.  I thank Mr.MacArthur for his very straightforward, bipartisan, commonsense increase in the authority from $50 million to $75 million for young, growing companies to raise money under A+.  Former SEC Commissioner Dan Gallagher advocated the increase in the offering threshold to even $100 million before the SEC adopted their final rule.                              {time}  1445  Mr.Gallagher expressed his disappointment that this offering threshold was not raised in the final rule from that original statutory cap of $50 million.  We have support through the commission and through the staff for raising this amount, Mr.Speaker, to help our entrepreneurs. Expanding A+ to include offerings up to $75 million will allow private companies to consider a mini-IPO under A+. This will give us more competition for capital, driving down cost of capital, driving up the number of opportunities for people to take advantage of going public, growing a prosperous company, and sharing that equity with investors through their exchange-traded fund, through their pension plan, through their 401(k) plan. We want more opportunities to share our Nation's prosperity.  I thank my friend, Mr.MacArthur, for his thoughtful work, and I thank our chairman for his leadership on the committee.

At some point in the recent past, each of our ancestors made the courageous decision to leave his home in search of a better life in Each of them took a risk. They didn't know what awaited them in this country, but they believed that through their own hard work and determination, they could succeed.  My mother took a huge risk when she brought my brothers and me to this country. Leaving her entire family behind, she packed our belongings into one suitcase, and we set sail for We grew up poor, but Mom worked so hard every day to build a life for us in this country. She worked minimum-wage jobs with no health insurance. We moved apartments and schools every few years. Eventually, we were able to bring my grandparents to Hawaii from So I understand as an immigrant how important family unification is to immigrant families.  I share my story not because I think it is particularly extraordinary but because it is a story that millions of families in our country share. The same hopes that drove my mom to risk everything to bring us to America are reflected in the stories of millions of immigrant families across the country, and they are reflected in the lives of Dreamers, whose futures are now at risk because of the President's decision to end the DACA  More than 15,000 young people have already lost their protection from deportation as a result of the President's decision, and 122 more will lose DACA protection every single day. It was with this sense of urgency in mind that I joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues at the White House yesterday to find a path forward to protect the The President took great pains to appear reasonable and eager to make a deal, but we left yesterday's meeting without much clarity about where he stood.  Only a few days ago, the President threatened to hold Dreamers hostage until he got $18 billion to build the wall. I would call that his vanity project. In response to my question at yesterday's meeting, the President appeared to demonstrate some flexibility on this issue, but after the Freedom Caucus spent yesterday afternoon warning of a potential betrayal on so-called ``amnesty,'' the President reaffirmed in a tweet his hard-line position that funding for the wall must be part of any deal on  Between insisting on building an unnecessary wall, demonizing family reunification, and peddling misinformation about the diversity visa lottery, the President lost track of what is really at stake here--the inspiring young people whose lives he has left hanging in the balance.  Before the holidays, it was heartening to see so many Dreamers from all across the country taking direct action in the halls of Congress to fight for their futures. I spoke with a number of these young people, like Victor from Houston, who traveled for days to make his voice heard in  Victor's parents were seasonal farmworkers who traveled to the strawberry fields of Florida every year. They settled down in Houston and saved money for a car and an apartment. They sent for Victor and his sister when he was only 4 years old.  Victor spent most of his childhood not even knowing his immigration status. It wasn't until he came home one day with a permission slip to join his middle school class on a trip to Spain that his mom told him that he was undocumented. Learning what it meant to be undocumented--that if he traveled to Spain he couldn't come home--was really hard for Victor, but he tried to put it from his mind.  As the years passed, it got harder for Victor to grapple with his status. He loved going to school, but he knew as an undocumented immigrant that his options after he graduated from high school were limited. He developed depression, and his grades suffered. But a few months after graduation, President Obama created the DACA Program, and Victor successfully applied for it.  Victor told me that even though he had DACA, he was still too afraid to talk about his status with anyone. During the 2016 election, this changed. He confronted his friends who voted for Donald Trump and shared what losing DACA would mean for him.  On September 5, Victor knew there would be an announcement about his future. He put his phone away and started cleaning his house to distract him from what was about to happen. Eventually he ran out of distractions and sat down to watch Attorney General Jeff Sessions' DACA announcement. Victor began to cry. In the days that followed, Victor started having panic attacks--sometimes as many as five to seven per day. He was afraid to get in the car because he didn't want to hurt anyone if he got a panic attack while driving. A few weeks later, Victor showed up for his first United We Dream event in There he met fellow Dreamers and allies committed to fighting for him. He told me that it was amazing to see so many people show up in support and solidarity.  Victor made himself a promise that once the Dream Act passes, he is going to go back to school to study psychology so that he can help LGBT youth like him. Before he left, Victor said something really insightful. He said that it is really important for people to come out of the shadows to tell their stories because once you tell your story, then they can no longer demonize you.  I couldn't agree more.  Fighting to protect Dreamers is about much more than the law. It is about compassion and basic human decency. Late last night, Dreamers won a temporary reprieve when a district court judge in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction to reinstate the DACA Program for existing enrollees. The judge said that ending DACA in the way the administration ended it was arbitrary and capricious. This was an important victory, for now. It is just a temporary injunction, a temporary reprieve.

The Dukes managed to beat us last year in a semifinal game, and we came back and avenged that loss in a thrilling championship game in Frisco, It went down to the final play. It was a very, very exciting game.  Winning a national championship is not easy, and this success, reflected both on and off the field, is earned through hard work and dedication. We recognize and congratulate all of the incredible players and Coach Klieman and his tremendous coaching staff, who put in countless hours of practice and preparation.

1077,topic-id,1642,"Mr.President, I want to associate myself with the comments of the esteemed Senator from I think he described very well the extremely positive impact that tax relief is having on our country, on economic growth, on job creation, and on higher wages and incomes for hard-working  I rise today, however, to talk about the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act and the important reforms we are making to spur economic development, facilitate more lending, and reduce burdensome regulations on our community banks and credit unions.  The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in 2010 following the financial crisis in an attempt to reduce systemic risks the financial sector posed to the economy. This far-reaching law touched every aspect of the financial system, including many small community banks and credit unions around the country and in my home State of North Dakota and across this Nation, in North Carolina and in every State in the These community banks and credit unions are not what pose the systemic risks that Dodd-Frank was passed to address.  At almost 850 pages long, Dodd-Frank required more than 10 regulatory agencies to write almost 400 new rules, which added more than 27,000 new Federal restrictions on American businesses. Think about that regulatory burden--more than 27,000 new Federal restrictions on American businesses.  Compliance costs to implement these Dodd-Frank rules have exceeded $36 billion--I repeat, $36 billion--which is ultimately passed on to consumers. It required nearly 73 million paperwork hours. In fact, agencies were still writing Dodd-Frank regulations after the law was passed. These costs hit small banks and credit unions especially hard, harming the driving forces of economic growth in rural areas and in our underserved areas. These financial institutions provide critical funding for credit for families and small businesses, especially in rural areas and in underserved areas. Rural States particularly feel that impact, like my home State of North  Because of their small size, community banks and credit unions have a more difficult time complying with excessively complex reporting and paperwork requirements. Compliance costs have hastened bank closures in small towns, leading to a growing number of places with no bank branches--meaning, not having financial services for consumers.  Nationwide, more than one in five U.banks have disappeared; that is more than 1,700 institutions--or more than one small bank or financial institution every business day--that have shut down since Dodd-Frank was enacted. That means less access to financial services for consumers across this country, particularly those who don't live in our large urban areas.  Since Dodd-Frank was signed into law, North Dakota has lost over one-fifth of its credit unions, with the number of credit unions in North Dakota declining from 47 in 2010 to 35 today. The number of community banks in North Dakota similarly dropped from 90 in 2010 to 74 today. These institutions have been forced to merge and consolidate due to the overly burdensome regulatory compliance costs associated with Dodd- The ultimate loser, of course, from these increased regulations, compliance costs, and the subsequent consolidation ends up being the very consumer that Dodd-Frank was intended to protect. Whether you are shopping for a loan to fund an innovative startup business, operating capital for your family farm, or seeking a mortgage to purchase your first home, fewer banks and fewer credit unions means fewer options for consumers.  In North Dakota and in rural communities Nationwide, our community banks and credit unions serve just that--the communities. They serve their local communities. They are not only savings and lending institutions for hard-working neighbors, local businesses, farmers, ranchers, and community members, but they are willing to work with borrowers facing circumstances unique to their rural community. They know their customer. They know their community. They know their service area.  Rural community banks and credit unions typically make loans that don't fit the standard mortgage mold. Properties that are not cookie-cutter residential properties are very common in rural markets. Rural lenders tend to use their knowledge of the market and the customer to structure loans that work for both the borrower and the bank. In other words, they make a loan fit the customer, rather than trying to make the customer fit a one-size-fits-all loan program with too much regulation. That might require using multiple pieces of property as collateral for the loan or utilizing a short-term loan to assist with a renovation that is paid off with the sale of a crop.  Documenting assets and cash to close a loan may look very different. For example, livestock in a feedlot waiting for sale or crops ready for harvest or in storage silos may substitute for cash in the bank that would typically get a borrower to qualify for a loan under the standardized approach where one size is supposed to fit everyone.  The fundamental purpose of community banks and credit unions is to serve their local communities. In North Dakota, they do this by forging personal relationships with the small businesses, farmers and ranchers, and individuals in their communities. By knowing their customers, they are able to offer products tailored to each individual who comes into the bank.  Dodd-Frank undermines this fundamental purpose by forcing banks and credit unions to fit their customers into a one-size-fits-all mortgage lending product called ``qualified mortgages.'' While this may work for urban and suburban lenders who sell their mortgages to the largest Wall Street banks, we have seen that it does not work in our rural States and our rural areas.  The bill we are now considering provides relief to rural customers by deeming certain mortgages held by lenders with less than $10 billion in assets as qualified mortgages, allowing community banks and credit unions to expand the types of mortgages they offer while maintaining critical consumer protections--meaning more choice and more opportunity for financing for consumers across the country. This means that our community banks and credit unions in our State and across the Nation will be able to offer a wider range of credit products and better serve the small businesses, farmers and ranchers, and hard-working individuals in our communities.  Another important issue facing our rural communities is a critical shortage of appraisers. The appraisal is a key component of the home-buying process and is important to both borrowers and lenders. The bank wants to know that the home financing they provide can be supported by the collateral, and the borrower wants to make[[Page S1718]]sure they are not paying more than the home is worth.  In rural areas, including my State and many others, conducting appraisals can be more complex than in suburban and urban areas because there are fewer sales and fewer comparable properties. This makes it vitally important that there are local appraisers who are familiar with the area they are working in. However, we are seeing a dramatic shortage of appraisers right now in our State and I know in other States as well. For example, of the 53 counties in our State, 29 have no resident appraisers. This means that all properties sold in those counties are appraised by appraisers from outside the county, sometimes from across the This can lead to significant wait times for an appraisal to be completed, as well as the potential for inaccurate appraisals.  This bill provides relief for home buyers in rural areas by exempting rural mortgage portfolio loans of less than $400,000 from being required to have a certified appraisal if the lender is unable to find a State-certified or licensed appraiser to perform that certified appraisal within 5 days. This will help reduce the cost to consumers and streamline the already time-consuming home-buying process.  Additionally, this bill helps further protect consumers from identity theft and other predatory practices by requiring credit bureaus to provide consumers with one free freeze alert and one free unfreeze alert per year. These tools will empower consumers to take more control over their credit and better protect themselves from potential fraud.  This legislation also includes a provision I cosponsored that would provide protections for bank employees who disclose the suspected exploitation of a senior citizen to a regulatory or law enforcement agency. This will encourage whistleblowers to come forward and protect senior citizens from financial exploitation.  Additionally, I have filed an amendment, which I am urging my colleagues to support, that would help our farmers weather the low commodity prices and economic downturns in farm country. I have heard from many farmers and bankers across the country that the current Farm Service Agency, or FSA, loan program levels are outdated and do not reflect the current ag economy.  My amendment would increase the maximum direct loan amount for the Farm Operating and Farm Ownership Programs to $600,000 from the current level of $300,000. It would also increase the maximum guaranteed loan amount for these programs from $1.39 million to $2.5 million. This would allow new and beginning farmers to purchase land and equipment or provide necessary operating capital to help farmers endure through the downturn in commodity prices. I will continue to work with my colleagues on that amendment.  In conclusion, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act provides real regulatory relief to our community banks and credit unions. I believe this will benefit consumers across this country. It empowers lenders to sell products tailored to their customers, assists rural communities impacted by the shortage of certified appraisers, and provides enhanced consumer protections from identity theft, fraud, and predatory practices.  It is past time that we provide regulatory relief to the community banks and credit unions across this Passing this bill will further economic development, increase lending in rural communities, and alleviate the onerous requirements placed on our small community financial institutions by Dodd-I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

We failed to do that, and now we are confronted with a bill that is recycled, and we have added two natural resources bills on it that could have passed unanimously.  I am a big defender of Native Tribes' rights and sovereignty, and I know that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle remain committed to their sovereignty as well. This bill, however, is about undermining the National Labor Relations Act, not about Tribal sovereignty.  That act, the National Labor Relations Act, safeguards workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively. Most of my friends on the other side of the aisle are not for that. I know that. I have seen them vote that way.  No matter where you work, the basic protections for American workers, however, ought to apply. It is already[[Page H122]]settled law that the National Labor Relations Act and other worker protection laws apply to businesses even on Tribal lands outside the context of inherently governmental functions carried out by Tribal governments. This was not decided by some faceless bureaucrat. This was a court of our land that made this decision.  Instead of undermining workers' rights, this House ought to be moving forward with policies that help our workers and their families make it in America as part of a strong middle class. That means raising wages. It means making childcare more affordable. It means expanding access to opportunities like higher education, homeownership, and a secure retirement. Those are the issues that Democrats continue to be focused on.  That is not what this bill focuses on. Instead, Republicans are focused not on helping workers, but trying to pit one group, Tribes, against another group, workers. That is not what we ought to have in this country.  And they are attaching popular, noncontroversial natural resources bills to this legislation. They have nothing to do with this legislation and would pass overwhelmingly.

2055,topic-id,433,"Mr.Speaker, I want to commend my friend from New Jersey and the work that he has put into this.  I rise today in support of this much-needed legislation that would increase the limit that small companies looking for additional investments and investors can solicit under A+. These deals would increase from $50 million to $75 million. This will enhance capital formation for growing small companies that are exploring crowdfunding as a method to raise capital.  The JOBS Act has proven to be wildly successful, and this program has proven itself successful as well. Yet it can be even more so with this modest increase.  So, specifically, the legislation further strengthens the ability for small- to mid-sized companies to attract more traditional underwriters and more sophisticated investors into the A+ process.  A+ has been termed a ``Mini IPO'' or an ``IPO to go,'' and for good reason. While the cost of doing a full-blown IPO has skyrocketed, and the crowdfunding industry has been adopting A+ and leveraging it to raise growth capital for a fraction of what a traditional full-blown IPO would be, would cost, while still having access to the capital markets.  Like the chairman, I and many others on the committee have been concerned about the decrease in these initial public offerings, or IPOs, over the last number of years. A+ has been able to step in and help fill that gap. It provides much greater flexibility and marketing to potential investors, both accredited an non-accredited, while maintaining important consumer protections that everybody agrees needs to be there.  Despite A+ being cheaper and faster, however, major underwriters and broker dealers have been slow to fully adopt A+ because the size of the increase up to that $50 million has really been minimal compared to a traditional  Raising the A+ limit to $75 million is certainly a step in the right direction to alleviate this problem, as it opens A+ to larger companies that may be considering doing a full-blown traditional  Additionally, this increased limit will have a positive impact for smaller companies because it can attract some of the more traditional underwriters to the process.

Mr.Speaker, I can't think of anything that is more important than what we are talking about here in There are three critical foundations which our Nation was built upon: the freedom of speech, the freedom of conscience, and the right to life.  Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence and our third President, said: ``No provision in our Constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority.''  What he means by civil authority is government.  Mr.Speaker, as I stand here today in the well of the House Chamber, Americans' freedom of conscience and our right to life is, once again, under attack, and this time in This law at issue in California is a classic example of government using its power to force citizens to promote messages that conflict with their personal beliefs.

As leaders of this Nation, we should be offering support, resources, and praises for their efforts, not forcibly targeting these PRCs with unconstitutional government mandates.  Through the work of my wife, Natalie, who served for a number of years on the board of a local pregnancy resource center in west Michigan, I have seen firsthand the overwhelming positive impact that they have on the community. My sister-in-law still serves on that board.

1587,topic-id,556,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my good friend from Maine, Bruce Poliquin, for sponsoring this bipartisan legislation.  The Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors Act amends the Dodd-Frank Act to make some commonsense changes to stress testing requirements for asset managers and the investors whom they serve.  Congressman Poliquin has worked very hard to make sure this bill is bipartisan. In fact, he was able to win the support of two-thirds of the Democrats on the Financial Services  I believe this is one of the many bills that Chairman Hensarling has suggested be part of our negotiations with the Senate on their regulatory relief package. I agree. Why shouldn't a bill with such strong bipartisan support at least be part of the conversation?  The idea behind the stress testing for financial institutions under Dodd-Frank is to make sure that they have enough capital on hand to cover losses in the case of a market disruption like the one that was encountered during the financial crisis. However, registered funds have a very different business model than banks. They do not guarantee any return to investors or promise that investors will get their principal back. Furthermore, these funds are not on the adviser's balance sheet.  The idea that an asset manager should hold capital like a bank does not comport with its business model. Or in the words of Mark Flannery, a former chief economist of the SEC, there is a false parallel for stress testing asset managers: ``The parallel to bank stress tests is really extremely misleading. It is as if Dodd-Frank said `stress test the big banks, and, oh, you might as well go ahead and do the asset management companies.' ''  Fortunately, Bruce Poliquin has sponsored commonsense legislation to provide some regulatory relief in a way that I think Democrats and Republicans should be able to agree.  The Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors Act would eliminate the bank-like stress testing requirements in Dodd-Frank but would empower the SEC, the primary Federal regulator of the asset management industry, to require stress testing as it deems appropriate.  In short, what this bill says is that we should only stress-test asset managers as their primary regulator determines is in the best interest of the investors instead of arbitrarily applying bank-like stress testing requirements as proposed by the Federal  It comes as little surprise that the SEC, including under the leadership of Mary Jo White, seems to agree. The SEC has not been able to come up with stress testing standards that are consistent and comparable with those of the Federal Reserve and other banking regulators, likely because there is no way to account for capital adequacy in these companies.  Furthermore, this bill does nothing to undermine the significant regulatory authority to the Financial Stability Oversight The FSOC would still be able to make recommendations to the SEC for additional regulation of asset managers.  I am not necessarily endorsing this concept, but I would like to emphasize this in the hopes that it would encourage even more Democratic colleagues to join in support of this bill.

2057,topic-id,532,"Mr.Speaker, this is an exciting, important debate. I rise today to speak in support of H.4263, the Regulation A+ Improvement  Congressman MacArthur's bipartisan legislation would increase the offering amount that companies can offer[[Page H1637]]under Tier 2 of A from $50 million to $75 million, adjusted for inflation by the SEC every 2 years.  This type of legislation, modeled after the bipartisan JOBS Act, typically enjoys strong bipartisan support in I hope that will be the case again today.  Title IV of the JOBS Act directed the SEC to issue rules to update A, which exempts small offerings of up to $5 million within a 12-month period from Federal registration. The updated exemption, now known as A+, increased the amount companies could offer from $5 million to $50 million within a 12-month period of time, and preempts State registration and qualification requirements to make it easier for small- and medium-sized businesses to undertake A+ offerings by avoiding the oftentimes prohibitively expensive complexities of complying with up to 50 State regulators, all providing different regulations.  Some opponents of this legislation have argued that it is unnecessary because the SEC is required to review this threshold and has the authority to increase it.  On April 5, 2016, SEC staff informed the Financial Services Committee that the $50 million threshold would remain in place throughout 2018 because of a lack of information available on A+ offerings since the rule was finalized in 2015.  However, during the comment period for implementing A+, the SEC received a significant number of comments that A+ should be expanded beyond the $50 million threshold. Furthermore, since the amendment to A became effective, the rate of A+ securities offerings has increased.  Last year, the U.Chamber of Commerce testified before the Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments Subcommittee, noting this legislation ``is a way to help make it easier for a small business to access capital to get deals done. To do that, even with the bump up to $50 million, people are still finding their sea legs. But in terms of driving liquidity, we thought the $75 million number was important.''  Former SEC Commissioner Dan Gallagher has stated: ``The SEC should have exercised our clear authority under the JOBS Act to raise the offering limit to $75 million.''  Hester Peirce, now an SEC Commissioner, testified during a hearing of the Financial Services Committee that, ``Prior to the JOBS Act's changes to Regulation A, that provision languished unused by companies, so it is important to revisit different avenues for raising capital frequently to ensure their continued usefulness.''  Congressman MacArthur's legislation will help ensure that the SEC focuses on its mission of capital formation, especially for small businesses. This is vital if we are going to continue on the course of economic growth.  And at the end of the day, after all of our debate on the merits of this legislation, let's make sure we remember it is simply an inflation adjustment for the amount of shares that can be issued under this exemption. Congressman MacArthur is simply proposing to make this financing tool available to more startup companies and their investors. This should not be controversial.

One of the problems you have is that you get countries like North Korea developing missile capabilities, and if they have it, then other adversaries have it. I am talking about Yemen and all the rest of them.  It is important for us to communicate to the American people that the[[Page S128]]threat we face is probably the most imminent threat we have had in the history of this country. Today, it is the greatest threat we have had certainly in my lifetime.  I have come to the floor and spoken on this issue in 2001, 2009, 2012, and this will be the fourth time this year. Over the last 30 years, we have witnessed the missile defense programs go through dramatic investment periods, followed by extreme starvation and cancellations--I am talking about in the United States--depending on who happens to be President at the time.  Remember, of course, when Reagan came in and people made fun of him with ``Star Wars'' and tried to defame him in any way they could. Yet he was able to be persistent and start a program, and we should be very thankful we have it today. That was followed in 1989 by President He continued that program.  However, in 1993, when President Clinton was in office, the first thing he did was to cut $2.5 billion out of the Bush missile defense budget request for fiscal year 1994. He also terminated the Reagan-Bush Strategic Defense Initiative and downgraded the National Missile Defense Program to a research and development program. He cut 5-year missile defense funding by 54 percent, from $39 billion to $18 billion.  I say this because these times are changing. Continuing with his administration in 1996, he cut the funding and slowed down the development of THAAD and the Navy Theater Wide To remind ourselves of how important that was at that time and the cuts he made to that and how critical that was, THAAD right now is the only thing we have to join forces with South Korea to be able to knock down something coming from North Korea to South The Aegis system is a defensive system that we could share with Without these systems, they would be wide open. That was 1996.  In 1999, the last of the Clinton years, he delayed by at least 2 years the Space Based Infrared System, which is a very complicated system that knocks down incoming missiles. Then, in 2000, Bush came in. By the end of 2008, President Bush had succeeded in fielding a missile defense system capable of defending all 50 One of the things he did that was most significant--and this is in the final years of his administration--was to recognize the fact that we have had ground-based interceptors in our country for a number of years. In fact, there are 44 ground-based interceptor systems. Unfortunately, they are all on the west coast because that is where we thought the threat would be. We discovered at that time, during the Bush administration, that the threat was from both sides because we recognized that Iran was developing the capabilities, as well as North Korea and others. So in order to protect Eastern United States as well as Central Europe, we had the system that was set up. It was kind of funny because I remember being there with one of our strongest allies. The system they set up was one where they had a radar system in the Czech Republic, and they had a rocket system--a ground-based interceptor--in Poland, right next door. I remember when Vaclav Klaus was the President of the Czech Republic, one of our strongest supporters, and he said to me at that time: Now, if we go ahead and put our system in the Czech Republic and in Poland, can you assure me that if we incur the wrath of Russia, we are not going to end up being embarrassed and have the rug pulled out from under us?  I said: There is not a chance in the world that would happen.  Well, that did happen. In fact, it was a total of 44 ground-based interceptors that were fielded. That was in Alaska and California, on the west coast. We went through this where they pulled the rug out from under Poland, as well as the Czech Then, in April, came our first Obama defense cuts, which began disarming America and dismantling our layered missile defense system. This is critical because we put this in for the reason that we perceived the threat to be coming in from the east as opposed to the west coast, and the very system that would have protected us was taken down by President  I would say, due to his overall reduced budget requests in defense, there were not enough Aegis ships. I already mentioned how we are using those today in defense of many of our allies, including Since Kim Jong Un took power in 2009, he has already conducted more than 80 ballistic missile tests. That is far more than his father and his grandfather conducted.  North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests of increasingly powerful weapons. The latest test was in September of last year. The major test actually came after that, and that was on November 28. On November 28, he demonstrated that he had the range of the United States and the central part of our country. In other words, it was stated by others who observed that he now has the capability of reaching any target in mainland United  There were some scientists who did an analysis of what they did on November 28. They made it very clear. David Wright, an analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists, wrote that--this is something that happened on November 29--that yesterday's test indicates that North Korea can now hold the United States well within missile range. He said: ``Such a missile would have been more than enough range to reach Washington, DC, and in fact any other part of the continental United States.''  Here is the scary part of this. Those who are not wanting to believe that the threat is real and the threat is there are saying: Well, we don't know that the missile he demonstrated on November 28 could have reached that range if it had a full payload, a load of a nuclear warhead.  We don't know if they had one or not, but that doesn't give me much comfort. They also questioned whether or not it could sustain the reentry back into the atmosphere.  The point is that they now have that capability, and that is something we have to keep in mind as we are making decisions, because we have decisions to make, and that is what we are doing right now in trying to decide how we are going to keep the government from shutting down and develop some kind of a budget plan that is going to serve us well.                               Tax Reform  Mr.President, let me mention something else that I think is very significant because I heard today a lot of people criticizing and not really understanding what happened with the tax plan that was passed. We are already getting the results of it. It is kind of exciting. I don't recall anything in my career where we got the results as quickly as we got and we are getting right now. We heard Minority Leader Schumer call the tax plan ``a punch in the gut to the middle class.'' In an op-ed piece in the New York Times, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders said: ``The Republican agenda on health care and taxes is . . . widely disliked by the American people'' and a ``tax giveaway to the wealthy.''  I think it is important that people understand that not only is middle-class America going to benefit from this, but they already have. One million Americans are counting on receiving raises and bonuses from this tax reform. In my State of Oklahoma, thousands of employees will be receiving and have already received large compensation increases, bonuses--Express Employment Professionals in Oklahoma City, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and AT&In fact, Senator Roy Blunt was coming back on a plane, the same one I was on, and the flight attendant was talking about how she had already received a $1,000 bonus. Then, the rest of them chimed in and said: We have too.  That is already happening. Right now we have a list of 123 major corporations that have already given an average of $1,000 for every employee they have, predicated on the assumption that the tax plan is going to increase the economy, and that is exactly what is going to happen.  I am confident that this is actually happening today. I have to say this, though, because more people still try to say: Well, we can't give tax reductions to people and still increase revenue to do all of these things we need to do with our national defense and with our infrastructure programs.  That is not true.  I am going to repeat one that I have done before on this, but people seem to not understand. It is easy to say: Well, if you reduce taxes, you are going to reduce revenue.[[Page S129]]  That is not the way it works. I remember very well what happened. I was not in this position, of course, but in 1991, when Ronald Reagan was President, at that time he had the most far-reaching reduction in taxes. Remember, the top rate was reduced from 70 percent to 30 percent, and the other brackets came down proportionately. Yet at the time he did that, in 1981, the total amount of revenue coming into the United States was $469 billion. As a result of that, it increased revenue to $750 billion. That is huge, and it shows that it really happens. The reason it happens is that for each 1-percent increase in the economy, it produces increased revenue of some $3 trillion. That is what happened then, and that is what is going to happen now. People are rejoicing today.  I ask unanimous consent that a sheet that outlines all of these companies that are giving large bonuses as a result of the tax bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               companies increasing compensation, so far       1.

Zions Bancorp                    tax relief pays american workers       Almost immediately after Congress passed the Tax Cuts and      Jobs Act, American workers at dozens of firms began to see      the effects in the form of bonuses and raises. For supporters      of tax relief this was good news, though not altogether a      surprise. During debate over the law, economists cited      research that workers bear most of the burden of the      corporate income tax via reduced wages. The remainder is      borne by consumers and investors. A significant cut in the      corporate rate would provide real benefits to workers.       One study by scholars at the American Enterprise Institute      concluded that a 1 percent increase in the corporate tax rate      is associated with a 0.5 percent decrease in real wages. A      2007 Treasury Department survey of economic studies found      that workers ``bear a substantial burden'' of the corporate      income tax. The Congressional Budget Office concluded in 2006      that workers pay more than 70 percent of the cost of      corporate taxes.       Opponents of tax relief countered that a corporate rate cut      would help only the wealthy--a claim being knocked down more      each day. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that ``history      shows tax cuts like these benefit the wealthy and the      powerful to the exclusion of the middle class.'' As a wave of      companies across the country began announcing bonuses and      giving raises to workers, it became clear that tax relief is      putting more money in the pockets of the hard-working      Americans who Republicans said would win because of the law.       The same day the House and Senate passed the bill, December      20, AT&T issued a press release saying: ``Once tax      reform is signed into law, AT&T plans to invest an additional      $1 billion in the United States in 2018 and pay a special      $1,000 bonus to more than 200,000 AT&T U.employees--all      union-represented, non-management and front-line managers. If      the President signs the bill before Christmas, employees will      receive the bonus over the holidays.''       So far, at least 123 companies have announced they are      giving employees bonuses or otherwise increasing compensation      due to the tax cut legislation. Notable examples include:       American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and JetBlue      announced $1,000 bonuses for their employees (a total of more      than 200,000 people). American's bonuses will exclude      officers; Southwest's and JetBlue's include all employees.      American said it would pay bonuses ``in light of this new tax      structure.'' JetBlue said that ``our Crewmembers should be      the first to benefit.'' Southwest said it would put the      savings from tax relief ``to work . . . to reward our hard-     working Employees.''       AT&T announced $1,000 bonuses to its 200,000 employees. It      also said that it will increase capital expenditures by $1      billion in 2018.       Comcast announced a $1,000 bonus for more than 100,000      employees. In addition, it plans to invest $50 billion in its      infrastructure in the next five years. Comcast said the      bonuses are ``[b]ased on the passage of tax reform and the      FCC's action on broadband.''       Nationwide Insurance announced a $1,000 bonus for 29,000      employees and increased 401(k) matching. The company told its      employees: ``The combination of the new tax legislation,      including a reduced corporate tax rate, and our associates'      ongoing commitment to our members, community and On Your Side      promise are the reasons we're making this investment that      further enhances the already robust benefits we offer to      attract and retain the best talent.''       PNC Financial Services announced $1,000 bonuses for 47,500      employees as well as $1,500 to be added to existing pension      accounts. The company also will raise its base pay rate to      $15 per hour. PNC's CEO said: ``The tax reform law creates an      opportunity to reward our employees who are working hard each      day to serve our customers, build strong relationships in our      communities and create long-term value for our      shareholders.''       U.Bank announced a $1,000 bonus for nearly 60,000      employees and enhanced health care offerings in the 2019      enrollment period. It will also raise base pay rate to $15      per hour. The bank said that these decisions were ``a result      of the tax reform package.''  ",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgS125.txt,583,CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL,2018.0,10.0,March

513,topic-id,509,"Mr.President, one week ago today, the men and women of Iran began protesting in the streets. It began with people speaking out against a sluggish economy, and economic growth does not exist in People finally got fed up with it. Keep in mind that the country of Iran is still recognized as the financial backbone of terrorism throughout the world.  The State media in Iran has reported that over 20 individuals have died in these protests for their own freedom and over 450 have been arrested since the regime's violent crackdown against the protesters. Let's keep in mind what they are protesting for. They just want some of the freedoms they know other countries have, and right now they don't see any other way to make this happen.  In an act that defies transparency and democratic principles, the regime has shut down social media and messaging sites, limiting the flow of information about the protests. In other words, they are not letting the outside world know what is going on there. Iran clearly thinks they can get away with this flagrant disregard of human rights, and why shouldn't they? Under the Obama administration, Iran was able to violently crack down on democratic protesters in 2009, to continue ballistic missile tests in violation of U.resolutions, and to finance terrorist organizations in the region without international condemnation or repercussions. Remember, Iran is the financial backbone of terrorism in that part of the world.  Just last month we learned how the Obama administration undermined law enforcement efforts against Hezbollah's drug trafficking operations. Hezbollah is well-known to be a proxy of Everybody knows it is a terrorist organization. But rather than going after the financial backing of a known terrorist organization, Obama swept it under the rug. His focus was on creating and then protecting the flawed Iran nuclear deal--a deal Obama promised would end Iran's aggressive behavior in the region and promote reforms in Iran through economic opportunity.  The actual results of the deal have never been clearer. The ruling elite of Tehran continues their aggressive behavior by putting their nation's resources toward supporting Assad's regime in Syria, testing ballistic missiles, and committing human rights abuses against women and religious minorities. It is no wonder that freedom-loving men and women in Iran seek meaningful change.  Fortunately, President Trump has already been clear that the United States stands behind the rights of Iranian citizens for peaceful protests.  Maybe the Ayatollah doesn't recall or didn't get the message from President Trump when he was sworn in last year: Under President Trump, America is the leader of the free world again--standing up for common, human dignity and democratic values. He has backed up his support with action, weighing additional sanctions against the regime and having U.Ambassador Nikki Haley--who is doing a great job, by the way--call for emergency U.meetings to address the human rights concerns.  I support his efforts and look forward to working with the President and his administration to enact any needed sanctions against Iran in order to advance freedom and democracy.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-03-pt2-PgS16.txt,583,TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DECLARES WAR ON STATE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA,2018.0,3.0,March
528,topic-id,1682,"Mr.President, I mentioned that there were three things I wanted to address for this new year. The third is tax reform.  We are approaching 1 year under President Trump's administration, and we are already seeing the benefits of tax reform and cutting harmful regulations.  The comprehensive tax reform legislation passed by Congress last month will allow American families to keep more of their hard-earned money--which we had been talking about for a long time--and it will make it easier for businesses to grow and hire more hardworking people.  Already, businesses across the country--such as American Airlines, Southwest Air, Boeing, Comcast, Wells Fargo, AT&T, and Express Employment Professionals, headquartered in Oklahoma City, in my State of Oklahoma--have announced investments in their employees and businesses as a result of the tax bill.  Clearly, the tax reform will compound the economic growth we have already seen as a result of President Trump's consistent efforts to cut regulations his first year.  Following the severe economic recession of 2008 and uncertainty in the future, many companies had chosen not to invest in their business or their employees. During the Obama administration, Federal bureaucrats unleashed hundreds of regulations that increased the cost of doing business, stifling job creation, and the result was obvious.  According to a report by the Heritage Foundation, by 2015 Obama's regulations were costing taxpayers over $100 billion a year. With these limitations on job creators, it is no surprise that the average GDP growth under President Obama was just a little over 1.5 percent--no matter that previously, throughout history, in the United States it has consistently been about 3 percent.  In less than 1 year, by directing Federal agencies to delay, withdraw, or invalidate 1,600 planned regulatory actions, President Trump has done what President Obama was unable to do in 8 years; that is, to restore the confidence of the American business community. He did this by reversing the Obama regulations. I have one--in fact, I have[[Page S17]]taken the time to list these regulations that were putting people out of business.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a document entitled ``Congressional Review Act Resolutions Passed'' at the conclusion of my remarks.  There are two ways you can get rid of regulations. One way is to do it through Executive actions. I think everyone knows what that is. The more difficult way is to do it through the Congressional Review Act Resolutions; that is, the I was very proud of the first CRA that we were able to get passed. It was one that I introduced, and it was one that is very popular. It was a rule that was put in during the Obama administration that said that we were in competition with the domestic oil and gas companies with China or some other company, and we had to give to them how we put together our playbook, which would put the U.companies at a disadvantage.  We did a CRA on that, and I was very proud to do that. I think people should look at these and realize the great results we had as a result of doing away with the overregulations. I have them listed here, and this is something people are not really aware of.  On January 1, the New York Times even recognized the positive effect of the President's deregulatory agenda. This doesn't happen very often with the New York Times, but they reported on a new ``wave of optimism'' in American business.  Listen to this. The ``Trump effect''--this is what the New York Times is calling it, very appropriately, I might add--``is beginning to translate to investment in new plants, equipment, and facility upgrades that bolster economic growth.''  This is from the New York They continued by saying that with the lowest unemployment rate in 17 years, we are also seeing the ``Trump effect''--again, that is their term--on wages as businesses invest in their workforce by raising wages to keep attracting skilled employees.  This week the Wall Street Journal reported that cities like Minneapolis have seen a 4-percent wage growth in the last year--the highest growth in 6 years.  I am confident we are going to hear more success stories around the country. The proof is in the numbers. For the first two full quarters of the Trump administration, starting with the second quarter of 2017--the ones he would have control over--we have increased the GDP growth to over 3 percent. That is pretty amazing--over 3 percent. This is from the average of 1\1/2\ percent.  What is important about this is, for each 1 percent increase in economic activity, or the GDP, that translates into additional revenue coming into the government of about $3 trillion over a 10-year period. That is why, in the 1981 tax cut under Reagan, they started the year with the total revenue coming in to be $469 billion. But then, as a result of the tax reduction, the increased economic activity increased it to $750 billion. We actually increased our revenue by decreasing the individual rate.  Finally, the made-in-America economy is running at full speed again. We have three huge success stories of the Trump administration: 1, eliminating the Obama overregulations to free up businesses and, 2, reestablishing America as a leader in the free world by reversing the Obama policy of appeasement. Hiram Mann said: ``No man survives when freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails, and those who cry `appease, appease' are hanging by those they tried to please.'' And 3 is tax reform--the first tax reform in three decades.  With that, I want to say happy new year; 2018 is going to be great.

725,topic-id,1673,"Mr.President, I begin by wishing everyone a happy new year, and hopefully everyone had a great We did.  I have three observations I wish to make about 2018. First, here in Washington, we are experiencing some really frigid temperatures this week. Let me tell my colleagues that in Oklahoma, it was even colder there than it was here. That is unusual, but it was. So we experienced recordbreaking, bitter, cold weather, and it was pretty miserable, but the great, warm people of Oklahoma had a great Christmas, New Year's, and everything is good. Many parts of the country saw 2017 with the recordbreaking cold weather, and meteorologists are predicting more recordbreaking cold for the rest of the week and the beginning of next week.  I bring this up to highlight the fact that President Trump joked last week on He said: ``We could use a little bit of that good old global warming.'' I say it a little bit differently. I say: Where is global warming when we need it because we sure needed it this last week. Well, the alarmists went crazy over this. Let me explain what an alarmist is.  Alarmists believe global warming is coming due to anthropogenic gases, and the world is coming to an end. They are the ones who jumped on that, and they actually went crazy for not understanding the difference between weather and climate.  We keep saying the same thing. Every time we go through one of these periods where we experience an event again, we have the same thing that comes up, and we talk about it. Climate is always changing. We understand that. We actually had a unanimous vote on the floor of the Senate, saying, yes, climate changes; it has always changed. Historically, scripturally, there has always been change. We understand that. Anyway, I remember I have been criticized for the same thing.  My colleagues might remember, I brought a snowball here a couple of Februaries ago to show we are not experiencing climate change when it snows in February, after we have been told for decades that soon we wouldn't have any snow again.  That was really kind of a fun thing. I had some of the pages lined up, and I asked: Which one of you guys is the most athletic? It happened that the guy who raised his hand--they all pointed to him and said: He is the guy who is most athletic, and he was from So I said: I will tell you what I will do. I will take the snowball, throw it up there at the Presiding Officer, and you intercept it. If you don't intercept it, it will be a mess. He intercepted it. It was beautiful.  Sometimes people have to quit being so serious about all of this stuff and realize there are things that are happening that people need to talk about, that are for real, on point. Some might remember Al Gore made some pretty outrageous claims. Enough years have gone by, but he said that by the deadlines he pointed out, global warming was going to cause all the snow to melt on Mount I was not far from Kilimanjaro just a few weeks ago, and the snow is still there.  He said that by 2016 the Arctic would be completely melted and all the polar bears would be extinct. None of that happened. The only thing that has happened, according to an article in the New York Times, is that Al Gore has now become the first environmental billionaire. Critics were quick to jump on my case when he did that, and I had to remind them that there is a difference between weather and climate.  Those same critics are also quick to jump on weather events when it supports their cause. Whenever there is a particularly bad tornado in Oklahoma--and we have bad tornadoes in Oklahoma; I have never seen a good tornado--there are people who have witnessed them, and I am immediately asked if this will cause me to change my mind about global warming or climate change. I said: Why? Alarmists have been insisting for a long period of time that the world is coming to an end, and it is coming to an end because of global warming.  After this past hurricane season, I was repeatedly ask if I thought climate change was to blame for the tragic natural disasters. Again, I responded: You alarmists have been insisting that weather isn't climate; so why do you change your position now?  I am not surprised that we have hurricanes during hurricane season, we have tornadoes during tornado season, and we have cold and snow during the winter. That is not unique to just my State of That is all over the country and all over the world.  We hear constantly that natural disasters are getting worse. Yet, when we look at the data, there is no support for the conclusion. When category 4 Hurricane Harvey hit Texas and other Gulf States, it was the first major hurricane to make landfall in the continental United States for 12 years. The next largest gap between major hurricanes actually lasted only 8 years, and that was in the 1860s. Tornado activity has also been down in recent years, with the latest data of 2016 showing a continued low number of tornadoes across the United I might say that this is also true for my State of Since we are experiencing recordbreaking cold last week and this week in much of the country, we are once again reminded that weather is not climate.  So what is happening on the climate front? Now, keep in mind that the alarmists are the ones saying that the world is coming to an end because of global warming. They say that we all will be burned to death and temperatures are skyrocketing. Over the last couple of years, we have been told that it was the hottest year on record. We have been scolded by the jet-setting Hollywood celebrities about our carbon footprint, but, again, if we actually look at the data, there isn't support for all of this hysteria.  The Obama administration touted 2014, 2015, and 2016 as the hottest years on record. But the increases are well within the margin of error. In 2016, NOAA said the Earth warmed by 0.04 degrees Celsius, and the British Government pegged it at 0.01 However, the margin of error is 0.1 degree, not 0.01. So it is all statistically meaningless and below the doom-and-gloom temperature predictions from all the various models from consensus scientists.  Now, this is interesting. Steven Koonin was appointed Under Secretary for Science at the Department of Energy by President That was during the Obama administration. He said: ``The Obama administration relentlessly politicized science and aggressively pushed a campaign about that politicized science.'' In other words, he used that to make a case that is not true, and this comes out of his own administration.  In September 2017, University of Alabama in Huntsville climate scientists John Christy and Richard McNider published a study showing no acceleration in global warming for the last 23 years.[[Page S16]]  Their research shows that if you remove the climate effects of two volcanic eruptions and the El Nino and La Nina systems that occurred over the last 38 years, there has been no change since the early 1990s to the rate of warming and that model predictions from the IPCC are overstated by about double.  Keep in mind that the IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United They started this about 40 years ago, and their scientists have been completely discredited.  I remember when that took place in They had one of the big annual United Nations parties. At that time, Lisa Jackson was Obama's Administrator of the She knew I was going to go there and tell the truth to all these people.  I asked her this question on the public record. In the event that I leave town and you are going to start regulating global warming, you have to first declare that there is an urgency to this and you have to use a scientific declaration. What science will you use?  She said: We are going to use the IPCC, or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  As luck would have it, just a matter of days after, the IPCC was totally rejected. Everyone remembers how they had been caught rigging the information in terms of weather, and it was really quite a mess.  Going back to Christy's explanation, which just came out the other day, the volcanic eruptions cooled the Earth when ash, soot, and debris entered the atmosphere and sunlight was reflected away. ``Those eruptions happened relatively early in our study period, which pushed down temperatures in the first part of the dataset, which caused the overall record to show an exaggerated warming trend.''  So we have two respected climate scientists using sound science to discredit the so-called consensus scientists. By the way, there are hundreds of other scientists out there. One of the best known is a guy from MIT named Richard He has been very outspoken on this.  So every time we hear people talking that ``there is a consensus of science,'' I think we know better. Remember that the media does not share the studies. So quite often they do not say anything about some of the failed practices being used to draw us to these conclusions. I am thankful we have a President and an administration that refuses to handcuff our economy with policies based on overblown headlines.  So while we continue to have tornadoes in May, hurricanes in the fall, and bitterly cold temperatures in the winter, we must remember that the climate has been stable over the last few decades, and we shouldn't give in to the fearmongers out there. Rather, we should focus on actual threats to American families, like the regime which calls for ``death to America'' and ``death to Israel.''                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-03-pt2-PgS13.txt,583,"ECONOMIC GROWTH, REGULATORY RELIEF, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT",2018.0,3.0,March

805,topic-id,886,"Mr.President, I rise to talk about the tradition of New Year's Day, the beginning of a new year, our great country, and many of its great traditions.  I am sorry the minority leader left so quickly because I wanted to brag about how great the New York City Police and law enforcement were on New Year's Millions of Americans gathered to watch the ball drop in New York City and the new year to start. We all enjoy doing that in the warmth of our homes, particularly on days like today, but there is also the warmth of  There is a second great tradition that takes place on New Year's Day as well. It is called the college football season, which is capped off by the Rose Bowl, which is played in Pasadena, This year, the Rose Bowl was played between the University of Georgia, my home State, and the University of It was one of the greatest football games, I think anybody would admit, that has ever been played in that game before, and I am proud of both universities.  I am equally proud of the University of Alabama and Clemson University--the other two teams that played for the right to play in Atlanta, GA, on Monday night of next week, on January 8, to decide the collegiate national championship. My Bulldogs of Georgia will be one of those two teams. They defeated Oklahoma 54 to 48 in a great football game in Alabama made a decisive victory over Clemson in New Orleans, LA, in the Sugar The two will meet this coming Monday night in the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta,  I don't know which is going to win. I know which one I am pulling for. I know which one I am on the floor bragging about tonight, but I am equally bragging about all of our collegiate athletics in this country and the great men and women who make it work--the coaches, athletic directors, and people who make it go.  In particular, with Georgia's victory, it prompts me to come to the floor and talk about Kirby Kirby is the head coach of the University of For 9 years preceding his coming to Georgia, he was assistant to Nick Saban, coach for the University of They will play against each another on Monday night for this year's national championship. It is ironic that the coach and his pupil will be the two coaches in that great game.  Kirby is a University of Georgia graduate. He was a great University of Georgia football player in his own right. He came to the University of Georgia with high hopes as an alumnus, hoping that he could be the person to take Georgia to new heights.  It took him only a year. The first season was 8 and 5. The second season was this year, 12 and 1--now 13 and 1--winning the Rose Bowl and playing for the national championship on Monday night.  Kirby Smart is not just smart because he knows football; he is smart because he knows how to be a leader. You saw an example of a man in the Rose Bowl who never took credit himself. He always gave it to his other coaches and to his other players. He never tried to be the winner. He always tried to be in the background. He put others ahead of himself, but deep down inside--and behind the great victory that was won that night--it was his spirit, his encouragement, his living the dream that all the Georgia players followed.  I want to talk about a couple of them. Sony Michel was the offensive player of the game, one of the greatest running backs ever to come out of the University of Georgia, and we had some good ones--Frankie Sinkwich, Charlie Trippy, and Herschel On defense, Roquan Smith, the Dick Butkus Award winner, played a great defensive game. Then, with the combination of leadership they brought to the team on the field and the quiet leadership and confidence Kirby Smart brought to the team as its coach, they won that game 54 to 48 in a double-overtime elimination of the University of  My congratulations go to Oklahoma and their quarterback Baker Mayfield, who was the Heisman Trophy winner, on playing a great game.  I wish Alabama a lot of luck on Monday night, but not enough to beat my This is going to be our chance to win a national championship for the first time in 38 years of football. We are going to be in my home State of Georgia in our newest athletic facility, the Mercedes-Benz I think it is an appropriate place for us to win, so I am going to say ``Go Dawgs'' from the floor of the  On Monday night, I hope Kirby Smart remembers the reason I am bragging about him today on the floor is that he is going to be our leader Monday night. He is going to carry us to victory one more time. I am counting on him, just like all the Georgia graduates all over the country who watched with joy on January 1, and we will be looking on Monday night with anticipation and, hopefully, satisfaction.

1756,topic-id,393,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, American taxpayers fighting the Internal Revenue Service deserve their day in court. Not every taxpayer who thinks the IRS is wrong is right, but not every time the IRS brings a case are they right.  The Tax Court is a unique creation of It is, in fact, an article 1 court specifically created and dedicated to tax issues.  The Tax Court has the expertise necessary to hear complex or, in some cases, simple tax cases.

Mr.Speaker, the Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act of 2017 closes a small but significant loophole in Federal law and, in so doing, gives Federal prosecutors an additional mechanism to protect veterans from criminals who seek to defraud them.  In recent years, we have heard distressing and infuriating stories about particularly elderly veterans being swindled out of their veterans' benefits. Some of these veterans, including those in low-income housing, have been deceived by fraudsters who, in fact, have preyed on their age and infirmity.  Helping veterans in this case certainly should be a priority in this  This is particularly insidious in that, in some cases, the criminal will claim to get a veteran's benefits approved in record time, will charge outrageous fees to file, and, ultimately, will provide the veteran with little or no assistance. They will just pocket the money that rightfully belongs to the elderly veteran.  Mr.Speaker, this change in the law is critical. I want to thank Mr.Tom Rooney, the author of the bill. I want to urge that we consider it quickly, close this loophole, and provide prosecutors with the kind of ability to protect our aging veterans in a way that is currently not available.

379,topic-id,849,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in honor of the upcoming holiday remembering Martin Luther King,  As a lifelong activist fighting for immigrants, civil and human rights, and now as a Member of Congress, King has been a deep and central inspiration throughout my life. His work has helped me to make possible the path that I have taken, from being a 16-year-old immigrant girl who came to this country by herself for college, to serving, now, as the first Indian-American woman elected to the United States House of Representatives--and it is the courage and the fight of King that made my journey possible.  I knew of King first because of his connection to Mahatma Gandhi, a great leader from my own birth country of Like Gandhi, King was a once-in-a-generation leader. Like Gandhi, the problems that King tackled were once seen as insurmountable problems, institutional barriers of race and class that seemed as if, if taken on, would topple society as we knew it, tall walls of tradition and practice that kept our society segregated and divided.  But that did not stop him from speaking out, organizing, and leading a growing movement that reminded the leaders of our country of the very dream that made America possible: that all men and women were created equal and that we should be judged by the content of our character and not the color of our skin.  King's gift was in his unique ability to bring truth, compassion, and justice together for a better future and to remind us of how much we share even across our differences. He followed Gandhi's principles of nonviolent resistance, also known as satyagraha: ``satya'' meaning truth, and ``graha'' meaning adherence to truth.  Satyagraha then meant insistence on truth, and that is what King preached and acted upon: truth about ending segregation and discrimination, truth about ending the war in Vietnam, truth about lifting up sanitation workers and ending poverty, truth, ultimately, that it is love and not hate that builds our character and our collective society.  If King were here with us today, he would call on us to have faith in our fight for justice and to substitute courage for caution. He would call on us to work passionately and unrelentingly for the very vision of our country that inspires so many around the world, for that more perfect Union that we know is still ahead of us, for that society that remembers that we are all better off when we are all better off.  King would remind us that justice is what love looks like in public. He would call on us to move into that plane of higher education, that plane of moral consciousness where we simply cannot stand by as injustice occurs around us.  He would call on us to address economic inequality by raising the minimum wage and enacting real tax reform whose benefits accrue to the masses and not to the top 1 percent and the wealthiest corporations.  King would call on us to pass the Dream Act and support the futures of 1.5 million young people across the country. He would call on us to expand and support the Affordable Care Act and healthcare for everyone so that no one is one healthcare crisis away from bankruptcy.  Our work is still to fight for justice and build that beloved community where each of us has a place to stand regardless of the color of our skin or where we live or how much money we have in our pockets, and in this beloved community, we would tackle the legacies of racism and implicit bias that we all carry with us with courage and with fortitude. We would work together to build that community that inspires us and to leave a world to our children that makes us proud, and, most importantly, we operate always from a place of generosity and abundance rather than fear and scarcity.  From that jail cell in Alabama, King wrote: ``We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny,'' or, as the great civil rights leader Reverend Joseph Lowery once said to me during the Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride: ``We may have come over on different ships, but we are all in the same boat now.''  To make a difference, to truly serve the people, it only takes courage and coming together as a collective, across the aisle, across rural and urban, across Black, White, and King showed us what that really looks like, and he died because he was compelled to stand for making a reality from a dream of what was possible only in a country as great as the United States of  Today, as we remember and honor Martin Luther King, Jr., we remember, too, that if we are courageous, if we put people over politics, our actions have the power to change lives, to push that moral arc of the universe more quickly towards justice. As King said: ``We must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.''[[Page H87]]                            ____________________",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgH86-2.txt,2354,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4545, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS",2018.0,10.0,March
1202,topic-id,880,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in recognition of our wonderful public schools across the country.  Every child, Mr.Speaker, has the right to pursue opportunity, and through our public schools our country makes that opportunity a reality every day. Education imparts practical and invaluable skills that kids carry with them for the rest of their lives, teaches our children to become engaged members of our society and our democracy, and public education is a great equalizer, having remained a means of mobility for generations of families. I know this firsthand, Mr.I came to the United States when I was 16 years old by myself to go to college and take advantage of all the opportunities that an American education had to offer.  For much of our Nation's history, our public schools have served this essential purpose of helping students and their families to thrive. And public schools, which serve all students, regardless of who they are, are the only institutions where the vast majority of our kids can access these benefits.  It is those schools and the teachers, professionals, and staff who serve in them--and I use ``serve'' very deliberately, because it is a service to be in our public schools, where teachers could earn so much more elsewhere but choose to be in the public schools because that is the place where they can help the most kids. It is those schools and those amazing successes in my own district that I want to celebrate today.  Monserrat is a teacher at Concord International Elementary School where almost 80 percent of the students are from low-income families and more than half are English language learners. Last year, Monserrat created a writing lesson using both Spanish and Before this lesson, most of the kids wrote at a kindergarten or a first grade level, but by the end of that lesson, every single one of her students was able to write a complex complete sentence. And over the next year Monserrat's second graders became ambassadors for Concord International, giving tours of their school in both Spanish and It is clear that her investment in her students opened doors to achievement for these Seattle public school students.  Another story comes from Shorewood High School in Shoreline, Emily, a leader on her school's robotics team, wasn't interested in STEM until she got to high school because no one encouraged her to pursue it when she was younger. It wasn't until she learned about the lack of representation of women and girls in STEM that she realized that something needed to change. And last summer, Emily launched the Full STEAM Ahead Club, an all girls' mentoring group that encourages middle school girls to pursue science, technology, engineering, arts, and math. The youth mentors showed girls how important it is to engage in STEM fields early, and they work every day to expand girls' perceptions of what they can achieve, which is to say, anything.  And at Evergreen High School, a youth-led group called FEEST is working to combat food injustice in public schools. One of their campaigns recently made waves when youth leaders created the first student advisory committee with the district's nutrition services director. They provided the director with feedback on how to increase fresh and culturally relevant food items on school menus. And last month, they successfully got one of the recipes they created onto the district menu.  Through their work, these young people have developed relationships with their classmates, with decisionmakers at the school district level, and they are building power and using their own innate intelligence about the issues that matter to create change in their schools and communities.  Mr.Speaker, I share these stories today to highlight how critical public schools are to my constituents and all And as Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to ensure that we continue supporting our public schools. For example, public money should go to public schools. It should not be used to bankroll private entities and corporations that don't deliver excellent, inclusive, equitable instruction.  Our public schools are under attack right now from the Secretary of Education and the Trump administration. Our public schools and public money should not be used to generate a profit. And teachers, Mr.Speaker, should be teaching and not carrying guns to try to protect their students.  As tens of thousands of students across our country and here in the capital have rallied and called for attention to safety in our public schools by passing sensible gun reform legislation, Mr.Speaker, unfortunately, this body has yet to address the issue of guns and safety in our schools and in our classrooms.  And if we want to support education for our kids, we should make sure that they have the right to live. That is what we are talking about: kids who go to sleep at night wondering if they are going to cower in the corners of their classrooms the next day because somebody has a gun because Congress has not done our job.  The Trump administration and Secretary DeVos have demonstrated that they want to make sure that the money is what prevails. And, Mr.Speaker, today as we honor our public schools, we also need to honor the responsibility of Congress to protect our students and protect our public education.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-15-pt1-PgH1614.txt,2354,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4545, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS",2018.0,15.0,March

As the Congressman, the distinguished gentleman from California, just articulated, the whole premise that anyone other than the wealthy and the well off is going to benefit is built upon the fraud of trickle-down economics, when there is absolutely no evidence that trickle-down economics has ever done anything for everyday  When Ronald Reagan cut taxes on millionaires in 1981, we didn't get explosive economic growth. We got an explosion in the deficit.  When George Bush cut taxes on millionaires and billionaires in 2001 and 2003, we didn't get explosive economic growth. We got the Great Recession in terms of the legacy of the Bush economy.  Then there was the so-called great Republican experiment in Kansas, where a Republican State Legislature and a Republican Governor massively cut taxes on the wealthiest, top folks in  And was there massive economic growth?  We got prison riots, overcrowded classrooms, and crumbling infrastructure.  Those are the facts. That is what so-called trickle-down economics has yielded, and now this fraud is being perpetrated on the American people.  It is shameful.

We are going to offer a better deal for the American people; focus on better jobs, better wages, and a better future; focus on higher pay, lower cost; and giving the American people the tools to succeed in the 21st century economy by focusing on a real infrastructure bill, real training, real community college opportunity, real tax reform for middle class Americans and those who aspire to be part of it.

303,topic-id,156,"Mr.Speaker, I think that is exactly right. The gentleman's concerns and suspicions are well-founded based upon the approach that was taken by this Congress on the other side of the aisle in connection with the tax bill.  So the individual tax cuts, to the extent that there are any that will be felt by the American people, are modest; the corporate tax cuts are massive.  The individual tax cuts are temporary; the corporate tax cuts are permanent.

It is time to have a debate and let Members vote whether they want to stay or come home.  Mr.Speaker, to make things worse than ever, on February 15, Pamela Constable wrote an article in The Washington Post titled, ``Taliban appeals to American people to `rationally' rethink war effort.''  They are our enemy, but it is not bad advice, to be honest with you.  Pamela Constable mentions many portions of a longer letter written by the Taliban to the United I have a copy of this article and I read it yesterday.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the article written by Pamela               [From the Washington Post, 14, 2018] Taliban Appeals to American People to `Rationally' Rethink War Effort                         (By Pamela Constable)       Kabul.--Taliban insurgents on Wednesday issued an      extraordinary, 17,000-word appeal to the ``American people,''      asking them to pressure U.officials to end the 16-year-old      conflict in Afghanistan and asserting that the protracted      American ``occupation'' had brought only death, corruption      and drugs to the impoverished country.       The letter, whose authenticity was confirmed by a brief      telephone conversation with insurgent spokesman Zabiullah      Mujahid, was primarily aimed at a U.audience. Unlike      previous statements issued by the Taliban, it used statistics      and logical arguments--not just ideological harangues--to      convince Americans that their government's investment in the      war has been a dire mistake.       ``Prolonging the war in Afghanistan and maintaining      American troop presence is neither beneficial for America nor      for anyone else,'' the document said, calling on U.     citizens, legislators and others to ``read this letter      prudently'' and evaluate the costs and benefits of continuing      to fight. ``Stubbornly seeking the protraction of this war;''      it added, ``will have ``dreadful consequences'' for the      region and the ``stability of America herself.''       The letter, sent under the banner of ``The Islamic Emirate      of Afghanistan,'' was issued just weeks after a blitz of      deadly insurgent attacks in the Afghan capital have left the      government struggling to cope with increased public anxiety      and anger. It also came as the Trump administration is      ramping up a new military strategy, involving thousands of      additional troops, to expand the Afghan security forces and      train them to defend their country independently.       While insisting that ``our preference is to solve the      Afghan issue through peaceful dialogues,'' the letter also      warned that Taliban forces ``cannot be subdued by sheer      force'' and that seeking a peaceful solution does not mean      ``that we are exhausted or our will has been sapped.''       This combination of outreach and threat has been a hallmark      of Taliban statements, including a shorter one issued shortly      after the spate of attacks last month that killed more than      150 people in urban population centers. The insurgent group      has said it would not revive peace talks unless foreign      troops leave the country, and it has rejected feelers from      the administration of President Ashraf       A spokesman for Ghani, Shah Hussain Murtazawi, responded      sharply to the letter, saying, ``We never negotiate with      groups who resort to crime and the brutal killing of people      and then claim responsibility for it. The door of peace is      shut to them, but the door of peace is open to those groups      who have expressed their hatred for such crimes.''       The letter's talking points included a list of goals that      the U.government had set out to achieve in entering the      war, including eliminating terrorism, establishing the rule      of law and eradicating drugs. It then systematically      presented arguments, backed up with international statistics      but also exaggerated for effect, to show that these efforts      had failed or had extremely negative consequences.       ``As confirmed by your own military authorities, 3546      American and foreign soldiers have been killed, more than      20,000 American forces injured and tens of thousands more are      suffering mentally,'' the letter said, asserting that the      actual casualty figures were much higher but were being      ``concealed'' by U.leaders. The casualty figures track      with those provided by the U.military.       A second argument said reports by the U.Office of the      Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction estimated      that ``sixty percent of Afghan territory is now under the      control of Taliban.'' The figure is actually much lower, but      the inspector general and other agencies have said that      insurgents control or influence more territory than at any      previous time in the war and that the area continues to      widen.       The letter also said that there had been 751 U.     airstrikes in September, which appears to be an accurate      figure. ``You should ask your generals that despite using      such force,[[Page H1613]]     have you retaken even a single inch of land from the      Taliban,'' the letter suggested.       A third assertion was that previous U.administrations      had cited the ``prevention and eradication of narcotics'' as      a justification to ``invade'' Afghanistan, an inaccurate      claim. But the letter correctly cited figures from the U.     Office on Drugs and Crime showing that opium poppy      cultivation has ``skyrocketed'' in the 16 years since the      military intervention and that the number of Afghan drug      addicts has reached more than 3 million.       The overall message of these arguments was that the      American people should make a ``rational'' assessment of the      war effort, realize that it is backfiring and prevail upon      their leaders to withdraw.       ``You proclaim to be a developed and civilized nation,''      the letter said. ``We leave it to your judgment to decide''      whether the prevailing conditions of ``insecurity, chaos''      and soaring drug problems in Afghanistan constitute ``reforms      or crimes against humanity.''

Today I decided not to talk about stories of individuals again but to try to put it in context, with the message really being that the time is now to make a decision. We don't need more information. We just need the will to act and do what I think is the right and the fair thing to do because we have been at this discussion now--it is hard to believe we have been at this discussion for 16 years.  The American public--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--overwhelmingly support a permanent solution for It is not that we need to know anything more to solve this. We have been talking about it for a very long time.  I want to encourage Members of this body and in the House who are involved in the negotiation to come to an agreement and provide permanent protection for the Dreamers before next Friday so that we can protect this community, which is frightened because[[Page S131]]they are so worried about being deported or losing their ability to work, to go to school, losing the ability to protect their families. But it is more than just protecting people because they are frightened; it is protecting them because, as I have seen in Virginia and in every State, they so enrich this country.  The first version of the DREAM Act, it is hard to believe, was introduced in 2001. The Senator from Illinois, Mr.Durbin, who has been a champion of this and has my deepest admiration for his persistence in this endeavor, introduced the first version of the DREAM Act together with the senior Senator from Utah, Mr. The bill has evolved since then. It wasn't exactly the same as we are contemplating now, but it was the first version of the bill. It sought to repeal a provision of the 1996 immigration reform that prohibited undocumented immigrants from eligibility for higher education. Instead, what the bill, in its original version, did 17 years ago was to grant permanent resident status to young, undocumented immigrants with a high school degree or equivalent GED who fulfilled certain residence requirements and did not have criminal records. That was the start of this discussion. We are still looking for the permanent answer.  The DREAM Act first almost passed in 2007. It attained more than a majority vote in the Senate, but it didn't get to the 60-vote threshold, so that was insufficient for passage. In 2010, the House passed the DREAM Act, but the Senate again failed to approve it with a 60-vote threshold.  In 2013, just a few months after I came to the Senate, we contemplated, debated, discussed, voted upon comprehensive immigration reform in I was kind of proud then. I was a young Senator, had been here a couple of months and stood in my chair and offered a speech on the floor of the Senate in Spanish to describe what was in the bill for the 45 million Americans who get their news every day in the Spanish language. After I was finished describing it, people came up to me and said: Has anybody ever done that before? And I said: Frankly, I don't know.  It turned out that it was the first time in the history of the body that a speech had been given in a language other than But what was important about that moment in June of 2013 was not the speech; it was the vote. The package was comprehensive. It included not just the DREAM Act but border security, assistance for employers to determine the immigration bona fides of those applying for work. These are reforms--an approval for people here on temporary protected status from El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, and Haiti to become permanent residents and then convert that into a path to citizenship. That comprehensive immigration reform bill, in my view, represents the Senate working at its best: a bipartisan working group, coming through committee, coming to the floor with amendments. It passed this body with 68 votes in favor.  It was evidence of the naivete of a young Senator at the time that I assumed, of course, something was going to happen because it passed here with 68 votes. I knew the House wouldn't do exactly what we did, but I thought they would do something, and we would be conferencing it. But alas, I was naive; that was not to happen.  We are now in a different place, and we have the ability to act.  I supported President Obama's actions in June of 2012 to protect Dreamers--the DACA Program; and then later, the DAPA I felt that those actions were completely in accord with earlier Executive actions Presidents had taken in the area of immigration.  Since June of 2012, 800,000 young people have achieved Dreamer status. Some of them aren't so young anymore. I sometimes refer to them as students and kids, but they are in the military, they are parents, they are teachers, and they are active in their communities. As I said, there are 13,000 in my DACA has allowed them to continue their education, to work legally, and to remain in the only country they have ever known.  I will say I was disappointed when President Trump in September announced that he would terminate the program in 6 months--in I felt like it was the breaking of a promise to these young people because he had said, even as a candidate and then as President, that Dreamers were good kids and that they wouldn't have anything to worry about from him.  I will say there was one aspect of what the President said--I can't just be critical without pointing out that there was one thing about what he said that I thought was right. He said: And Congress should fix it. I agreed with President Trump on that. I wish he hadn't terminated the program, but he was right that this is something for Congress to fix because anything done by Executive action, even fully within the power of a President to take it, is subject to being changed by another The lives and futures of these young people are such that we shouldn't be scaring them about whether they are protected or maybe back to being protected depending upon who was the occupant of the White  That Presidential announcement in March, although I was disappointed, on that core piece of it, that Congress should fix it, I think President Trump was right and I think he is right. I think this is something that Congress must fix, should fix, can fix, and we have all the information about it to fix it right now.  It has been difficult and a little bit heartbreaking to talk to these young people and their families about the fears they have. I don't live under the fear of deportation. I don't live under the fear of my job being taken away because of my status. I don't live under the fear of my kids not being able to get instate tuition and instead having to pay out-of-state or not being able to afford it at all. It is not a fear I walk around with every day. It is hard to put yourself in somebody else's shoes and experience the fear and even terror they are feeling when you yourself don't have that same exposure.  I have spent a lot of time listening to these young people and their parents in Northern Virginia and Richmond, especially, where I live, and the fear they feel is very palpable, and the panic they feel is very palpable, and I understand why. I think part of our job should not be to increase anxiety and fear; part of our job should be--when we can, when it is the right thing to do, when it is within our grasp--to take action and provide clarity and certainty so people will know what their status is. I think the time for that is now after 16 years.  Maybe the most important thing I am saying is that this is not a new issue. It is not that we need another week or another month or another year to figure out the answer. The first bill was introduced in 2001, and I think January 19, 2018, is ample time for us to now get this right and make it either part of the spending bills that we will do at year-end or part of a stand-alone bill that we could embrace as a body.  I was heartened by some of the comments by the President, as reported yesterday, during the meeting with bipartisan leadership at the White House about this. We can do it, and the time is right to do it now. So I would ask my colleagues and especially urge all those in the negotiations to make this decision and provide these wonderful young people with certainty about their future.

1714,topic-id,2361,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk about gun ownership and gun safety in Virginia and in the United I speak as a gun owner, and I speak as a strong Second Amendment supporter. I want to do a couple of things in this speech, but one thing I want to do is put to rest the idea that gun owners, gun ownership, and the Second Amendment are incompatible with reasonable gun safety rules.  I accept the ruling, the holding, and the principle announced by the Supreme Court in the Heller decision that the Second Amendment conveys an individual right to bear arms and conveys that right to the American public. There was, and there remains, some controversy over the ruling. Some have argued that the text of the amendment discusses only the right to bear arms in the context of participating in a militia, which in 1787 was a necessary strategy for defending the Nation during a time when we had no standing For years, many scholars and courts accepted that notion and argued that the Second Amendment was sort of different from the others in that way. In Heller, the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment, like all the other amendments, conveys an individual right, and I accept and believe that interpretation.  But the Heller decision came with an important caveat. The Second Amendment is the only amendment that uses the phrase ``well regulated.'' The amendment may convey a personal[[Page S1748]]right to gun ownership, and it does, but it explicitly acknowledges that regulations are part of what may be necessary. Courts subsequent to Heller have frequently held that the particular regulations are well within the scope of the Second  The NRA and other organizations often pretend that the phrase ``well regulated'' doesn't even appear in the amendment. Often, they will print a copy of the Second Amendment or the text, and they will have only the second clause, omitting the ``well regulated'' phrase. While that phrase, like the text of the amendment itself, is set in the context of a militia, it is clear from its usage that the Framers knew firearms were dangerous, though necessary, and there needed to be rules to ensure their safe use. In other words, the phrase ``well regulated'' in the text is not there to refer to the kind of uniform that a militia member would wear, whether they should have a beard or not. It is there to refer to the need for discipline and training to keep those people who bear arms behaving in a reasonable and safe manner.  Even if the phrase ``well regulated'' did not appear in the text of the Second Amendment--and that phrase ``well regulated'' appears in no other amendment, only the second--it would still be pretty clear that the Second Amendment right, just like other constitutional rights, is not absolute and free from any governmental rules. The Heller decision, authored by Justice Scalia, stated this very clearly: A ruling of individual ownership and use of firearms does not restrict the government from imposing reasonable rules on their use. Many subsequent cases have affirmed these reasonable rules over time.  The First Amendment, for example, guarantees the right to free speech and makes clear that no law infringing upon such a right is constitutional. But the Supreme Court has long held that government agencies can place reasonable limits on the time, place, and manner of speech, so long as the limits don't discriminate on the content of the idea that is expressed. An easy example is, a city can ban sound trucks with megaphones from driving through neighborhoods blaring ads in the middle of the night while people are sleeping. The right to free speech is subject to reasonable limitation.  Similarly, the First Amendment guarantees freedom of the press, but States punish civil libel through their civil litigation and court processes. A newspaper trashing somebody through a knowingly false statement can be subjected to civil liability, and that paper can't claim the right to free press to shield it from accountability.  The Second Amendment, in this way, is similar to the First Amendment, and I could go through other examples. While the right to ownership, to bear and use arms--not just ownership but using arms--may not be infringed, reasonable rules regarding gun usage are explicitly contemplated by the amendment and constitutionally allowable.  It is important to recognize that we all tolerate reasonable limits on gun use. One common use of firearms in Virginia and Alaska--I know from my one visit to Alaska that this is the case--is hunting. In Virginia, the voters of our State, by referendum, amended our State constitution in 2000 to guarantee to all a right to hunt, fish, and gather game subject to rules prescribed by our general assembly. I was legal counsel for this effort, before I was in State office, arguing the validity of the amendment when a citizens group sued to try to keep it off the ballot. We prevailed in the litigation, and the amendment passed overwhelmingly, with more than 60 percent of the vote. That vote showed our population both embraced the right to hunt but also embraced the acceptance of the notion that this right should be subject to reasonable rules imposed by the legislature.  We have many State-imposed rules on hunting in Virginia, just as I am sure is the case in The State determines the seasons in which hunting can occur--those seasons can differ depending on what you are hunting--where it can occur, the license you need, the training you must complete, which days of the week are open for hunting, what kinds of weapons can be used in hunting, and even the size of a magazine in any automatic or repeating weapon that can be used in hunting.  For example, in Virginia, by statute, you can hunt with a repeating shotgun, but the magazine can contain no more than three rounds. If the magazine on a weapon is larger than that--a larger magazine--you are required to have a plug or filler in the magazine that will reduce its capacity to no more than three total rounds, as measured either in the magazine or in the chamber itself.  The bottom line for these regulations, which are well accepted and understood in Virginia, is clear. Even the use of firearms for hunting, protected by the Virginia Constitution as well as by the Second Amendment, is subject to safety rules that society fully accepts. The clear constitutionality of gun safety rules and the public acceptance of these rules pose stark questions to  Why, in the face of escalating tragedy, are we so unwilling to adopt commonsense gun safety rules designed to reduce gun violence? Why does Congress shield gun manufacturers from liability with a Federal protection that we don't give to the manufacturers of other products? Why does Congress limit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from using its resources to research gun violence? Why does Congress limit the ability of law enforcement to fully trace the use of guns that are used to commit crimes? Why does Congress prohibit weapon use and ownership by certain classes of dangerous individuals but resist a universal background check system that would be necessary to enforce that prohibition? Why won't Congress enact the same kinds of magazine limitations on weapons used to kill people that we embrace on weapons used to kill deer? Why won't Congress ban weapons of war--weapons of war that are used by trained officials, as was the case with the Presiding Officer in his military service or my son in military service, but why won't we ban those weapons of war from the streets of our country?  Self-defense, sport, hunting are all protected and encompassed within the broad protections of the Second There is not, there has never been, and there never will be an effort to confiscate all weapons in the country because of their popular acceptance and because of the clear commands of the But why can't we have reasonable safety rules?  America's children--so many of them appeared here yesterday, children from a middle school in Northern Virginia, some high schoolers from Thomas Jefferson High School; I visited with students from Florida--posed some even starker questions to us.  Does Congress care more about its children or more about contributions from the NRA and gun manufacturers? Can adults act like adults and try to keep children safe? Those were the questions that I heard from the students on the Capitol steps yesterday.  I applaud the children of the country who are asking these questions. They stand together with an overwhelming majority of Americans who believes we can do better and we need to do better. I have seen the tragedy of gun violence, but I have also seen that we can do better and that part of that is having better rules on guns.  When I was elected to the city council in Richmond in 1994, we had the second highest homicide rate in the United That was the only top 10 list we were on. That is not the one you want to be on. I went to too many funerals and too many wakes and too many crime scenes, and I was in too many church basements with support groups of homicide victims' families, and I don't want to do those kinds of things again.  Yet, through the pain of that--multiple efforts by multiple people--we helped reduce our violent crime rate risk. We dropped the homicide rate by 60 percent. We dropped the aggravated assault/violent crime rate by nearly the same number. We did a number of things, but one of the things we did was to recognize that we had a problem with guns. It was not just about people or just about mental health. Those were issues, sure, but we had a high gun carry rate in The gun carry rate means: In 100 stops that the police would make, what percentage of the time were people carrying weapons? In Richmond, we just had an unusually high percentage compared to other cities for a variety of the reasons.[[Page S1749]]  What we decided to do is, if we could bring down the gun carry rate, we may not make bad people good people, but we could avoid an argument's breaking bad and then turning into a homicide or an aggravated assault. We were able to do things that brought the gun carry rate down, that made people leave their guns at home, if they were leaving their homes, instead of putting them in their pockets. By doing that, we helped to bring down gun violence. We found that you could take concrete steps to make people safer.  I was the Governor at the time of what was the worst shooting in the history of the United The weird thing to say about my own State is that I wish it had always been the worst shooting--the tragedy at Virginia Tech in April of 2007, when 32 people were killed. It has now been eclipsed by shootings in Orlando and Las Vegas and So many other tragedies have happened since then that even some of the particulars of the Virginia Tech shooting start to recede in memory as new tragedies happen.  It was painful. I interacted with the 32 families who had lost their kids and who had lost their parents who were professors, and I have continued to interact with them over the years and to learn what went wrong that day, and a lot of things went wrong. Vowing to the families that we would try to fix them has been a cause of my life for the last 11 years.  We also learned through the pain some things we could do to make our communities safer. In this particular case, there were problems with mental health, and there were problems with privacy rules, and there were problems with campus safety protocols. Yet a significant problem was that we had a flaw in the background record check system. A young individual who had been adjudicated mentally ill and dangerous and was prohibited from owning a weapon was able to slip through the cracks in the system to get a weapon that he shouldn't have had. So the lesson we learned is, with a better background check system, you reduce the risk of tragedy.  Whether it is a common street crime of the kind that occurs every day and may not get the attention on the weekly news or whether it is a mass shooting that gets the attention on the weekly news, I have had some scar tissue over this, but at least the scar tissue has taught me a few things. One of the things I have learned is you can take meaningful steps, and if you do so, you make communities safer. If you know that you can take steps to make people safer, then you must. You must.  I will conclude and just say this.  We need a debate on the floor of this Chamber about how to reduce gun violence and promote gun safety. We haven't had one since April of 2013. It has been 5 years, and the list of tragedies is getting longer and longer and longer. We shouldn't be afraid to entertain both Republican and Democratic proposals for reducing the scourge of gun violence. There will be different kinds of proposals, and that is as it should be.  It is just like the debate we had about Dreamers a few weeks ago. There were different proposals put on the table that were going in different directions. We know in this body that we need to get 60 votes to get anything passed, which means nothing will pass unless there is some bipartisan support. Yet we shouldn't be afraid of having that debate. We have been afraid to have the debate, but our children are afraid for their lives. If they are showing the courage to speak out for change, the least we can do is show that we are listening.

100,topic-id,261,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill.  It was in 1935 that this body enacted the National Labor Relations It guaranteed basic rights to private sector workers to organize into trade unions, to engage in contractual bargaining for decent wages and better conditions at work, and to take joint action, if necessary.  But in 1935, just like today, here, 2018, the Republican Party and business interests vehemently opposed passage of any laws that help workers. Little has changed. Once again our Republican colleagues trample on the backs of workers.  This legislation rolls back proven protections that allow wages to rise in places like California, and their casinos, from $10 an hour to $13 an hour. Now, these modest pay increases have helped elevate the workers who work in those casinos above the Federal poverty level.  Who has ever tried to buy a house in California or tried to live on $13 an hour or $10 an hour? You are not talking about a whole lot of money there, especially from a party that just gave $1 trillion away to the people at the very top.  But with this bill, our Republican colleagues chose to strip these hundreds of thousands of workers, the majority of whom are not members of Tribes but work in those casinos, of decent wages and their right to a voice in the workplace.   Beneath their sheepskin costumes hides another Republican attack on worker rights in this country, this time under the guise of Tribal sovereignty.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

So I urge my colleagues to oppose this bad bill.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the strong opposition to it from the United Steelworkers of America and from the Communications Workers of As a proud daughter of labor, I am proud to stand here today in opposition to this bill.                                          United Steelworkers,                                  Pittsburgh, PA, January 9, 2018.     Re United Steelworkers oppose inclusion of anti-worker H.         986, Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2017 in 140.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 850,000 members of      the United Steelworkers (USW), we strongly urge you to oppose      140 on the House floor this week. Rather than[[Page H121]]     being identical to the Senate bill, this version includes the      anti-worker and undemocratic Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of      2017 (H.986).       H.986 would exempt all employees of federally recognized      Native American-owned commercial enterprises operated on      Indian lands from the protections of the National Labor      Relations Act (NLRA) and would authorize over 567 distinct      and separate labor law jurisdictions in the United       To be absolutely clear, this legislation strips workers--     both Native American and non-Native American--of their NLRA      protections. While some organizations have falsely attempted      to paint tribal governments as similar entities to states      (which are exempt from the NLRA), tribal governments are      substantially different than states in one key democratic      principal: state governments allow workers an ability to vote      for their legislators no matter their ancestry, while most      tribal governments require blood quantum or lineal descent to      determine who is eligible for membership or citizenship.       Simply put, if H.986 becomes law by inclusion in 140,      U.citizens working in the United States for tribal      commercial enterprises would not be able to vote for the      elected representatives who set their labor laws. These      workers will lose the ability to petition the government that      oversees their working conditions.       The gaming industry, which is an employer for approximately      246 of the 567 federally recognized American Indian tribes;      has over 600,000 casino workers on tribal lands, the      overwhelming majority of whom are not Native In      2011 before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, the National      Indian Gaming Commission testified that the vast majority of      employees (up to 75 percent) were non-tribal members.       Our union understands the importance of the principle of      tribal sovereignty; however the fundamental human rights of      employees are not the exclusive concern of tribal enterprises      or tribal governments. As the International Labor      Organization highlighted in a letter on a previous version of      this bill, ``it is critical that the State (the national      authority) takes ultimate responsibility for ensuring respect      for freedom of association and collective bargaining rights      throughout its territory''. That is why we believe the      current test set by the NLRB is the best course of action      until labor laws are strengthened in the United       In 2004, the NLRB under the Bush Administration ruled for      the first time that Tribal casino workers should have the      benefit of NLRA protections, San Manuel, 341 NLRB 138      (2204). Yet, since the San Manuel ruling, the NLRB has      asserted jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis. In 2015, the      NLRB declined jurisdiction citing the 1830 Treaty of Dancing      Rabbit Creek and 1866 Treaty of Washington stating:       ``We have no doubt that asserting jurisdiction over the      Casino and the Nation would effectuate the policies of the      However, because we find that asserting jurisdiction      would abrogate treaty rights specific to the Nation.''      Chickasaw Nation Windstar World Casino, 362 NLRB 109 92015).       Similarly the NLRB declined jurisdiction:       ``. . . when an Indian tribe is fulfilling a traditionally      tribal or governmental function that is unique to its status,      fulfilling just such a unique governmental function      [providing free health care services solely to tribal      members],'' Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation, 341 NLRB 139      (2004).       The NLRB has developed a reasonable and responsible test to      determine jurisdiction. H.986 creates significant      confusion and jurisdictional issues over labor law      enforcement and grossly undermines worker's rights. Our union      urges you to oppose 140, with the inclusion of H.986,      and asks you to instead work to expand worker's rights not      restrict them further.           Sincerely,                                                    Leo Gerard,     International                                  ____                                                  January 9, 2018.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the members and officers      of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), I am writing      to express our strong opposition to 140. CWA has no      objections whatsoever to Sections 1 and 2 of the bill as      amended. Unfortunately, these non-controversial, sensible      bills have been hijacked to also pass H.986, a bill that      would strip hundreds of thousands of workers at tribal-owned      and -operated enterprises of their protections for the right      to bargain collectively.       H.986 seeks to overturn a National Labor Relations Board      (NLRB) decision in San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino, which      applied the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to a tribal      casino enterprise. The NLRB's finding in San Manuel adopted a      test to determine whether the NLRA is applicable to      businesses operating on tribal lands--if it would ``touch      exclusive rights of self-governance in purely intramural      matters'' or ``abrogate Indian treaty rights,'' the NLRA      would not apply, but otherwise the decision will be based on      a series of factors including whether an entity is a purely      commercial enterprise or employs or caters to individuals who      are not tribal members.       The San Manuel test balances two crucial issues--tribal      sovereignty and the right of workers to bargain collectively.      The test ensures that truly internal matters of self-     governance will continue to be handled by sovereign tribes,      while also ensuring that the fundamental rights of workers to      organize and advocate for their own interests are properly      respected. H.986 would overturn this balance by exempting      any enterprise or institution owned and operated by an Indian      tribe and located on its land from the requirements of the      NLRA--or any other guarantee of workers' fundamental right to      organize and collectively bargain.       The practical impact of H.986 would be to exempt a broad      swath of businesses from the NLRA, even though, in many      cases, they are purely commercial enterprises. For many of      these companies--particularly casinos--the majority of their      workforces are not members of the tribe employing them and      therefore do not have full access to internal, tribal      mechanisms for grieving issues or petitioning for change in      tribal policies. This is why the International Labour      Organization stated in 2015 that ``it would appear likely      that an exclusion of certain workers from the NLRA and its      mechanisms would give rise to a failure to ensure these      workers their fundamental freedom of association rights.''       I urge you to oppose 140 as amended and instead work to      advance an agenda that protects both workers' fundamental      human right to organize and tribal sovereignty. CWA will      consider including votes on this bill in our Congressional      Scorecard Thank you in advance for your consideration.

If that isn't an invitation for more job outsourcing, I don't know what is.  The corporate tax rate, which Republicans slashed at the expense of the middle class, Social Security, and Medicare, is now at 21 percent; but the rate at which American companies' overseas subsidiaries will be taxed is half that much, 10.5 percent.

495,topic-id,1802,"Mr.Speaker, I stand with so many of my colleagues today in a call to action for this body to address a crisis that is at its breaking point for pensioners across our country, retired workers, who have come from the building trades, miners, truck drivers, so many more--actually, hundreds of thousands of Americans--losing their pensions or about to lose them.  Millions of American retirees have worked and earned pensions that they contributed to through the multiemployer pension programs. In fact, I met one retiree recently who paid over[[Page H79]]$225,000 into his plan and has not been able to access one penny--not one penny. Yet hundreds of these plans face serious financial shortfalls, leaving millions of retirees facing an uncertain retirement future.  For today, Congress needs to step up and secure the pension benefits these workers have earned. And there should be no pension cuts for workers who contributed to their own plans and should have a right to the money that they invested. Congress can no longer kick the can down the road. There simply is no more time.  This problem does not go away if Congress continues to ignore it. Rather, the financial stress mounts for the retirement funds and, of course, for the retirees and for their families so severely impacted. Indeed, the costs the Federal Government will bear if we don't solve this problem now become exponentially more significant as time ensues.  Over the last 4 years, I have heard extensively from retirees forced to ride this terrible economic roller coaster. It is almost like a corkscrew, right side up, upside down. They are caught in this as their retirement security careens out of their control through no fault of their own.  There are thousands, tens of thousands of Americans who did everything our country asks of its productive citizenry, retirees who worked for decades for a company and thought they would have a secure retirement but now they face a stark reality.  From Toledo, Ohio, such retirees as Carol Jones, who drove a truck for over 30 years and who missed holidays and major life milestones because of his work on the road, the knowledge that he was earning a pension helped in those moments, but now he says it all feels like a pipe dream. And when you drive a truck for over 30 years, things happen to your knees; they happen to your back. Bouncing over concrete for three decades has severe costs for so many. But if a solution is not passed now, Carol won't even be able to continue to care for his disabled daughter.  Or how about Ernest Frye, a teamster for 54 years? He and his wife currently can live on what they earned through his pension, but, with its threatened cuts, everything will fall apart for them. They will have to rely on the government to cover the difference. And with the rising cost of medical expenses, they run the risk of also losing their home if his pension is cut. What kind of cruelty is this?  Or how about Cindy Grimley, who was hired in 1978, and has taken pride in being able to take care of herself? Even with the pension she earned and lives on, she cannot afford medications her doctor tells her she needs, and she can't afford to lose a single dollar of her promised pension.  Or how about Tom Brady, who worked 30 years--30 years--with Roadway Express and is a Vietnam veteran? He faced a 50 percent cut under the Central States Pension Fund application. They call it Any cut to his pension won't only impact him. He has six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren whom he and his wife help support.  I hear countless stories across this country of how retirees are caring for children with disabilities, supporting their own ill and aged parents, or supporting children and grandchildren with life expenses. These cuts impact more than just the individual who earned the pension. And, really, don't these workers who retired have a right to the money that they put into these plans?  You know, there were hundreds of companies that walked away from their pension promises. They didn't keep their promise to the workers. The workers put their money in, and some of the companies walked away. Is it the worker's fault?  Ask any retiree or responsible economist, if we fail to fix this pension crisis, we will create a tremendous deficit to our economy both locally and nationally. Some retirees already live under the financial constraint of us not solving this challenge, and some have already had 70 percent cuts to their pensions.  For example, Ironworkers Local 17 in How about the New York State Teamsters? How about the United Furniture Workers pension and the International Association of Machinists Motor City pension? They have all seen that decisions were made forcing cuts upon their retirees. And millions more live on that precipice: money that should be coming to them because they earned it, they put it away, and then it was taken away.  This House has continued to let these retirees down. There has not been a single hearing to fully understand the financial plight confronting retirees. How irresponsible is that for the leadership of this House? The Senate has only taken a bit of action, but no solution.  Immediately after the House passed the scam pension bill a few years ago--that is the original Multiemployer Pension Reform Act--I set to work to correct the unfairness that it allowed, and we introduced the Keep Our Pension Promises Act, which, back then, had the number H.2412. We called it It would have prevented these draconian cuts to earned pensions by filling the financial gap of many of these plans, such as the Central States Pension Fund, and reinstate the anti-cutback provisions that are contained in the ERISA legislation, the Employee Retirement Income Security The bedrock of that law was that, if workers work and they put money aside for their pensions, that pension money will be there for them.  But our bill lacks sufficient bipartisan support. So back last December, it was very reassuring for me to stand with my colleagues Representative Richie Neal of Massachusetts and, from the other body, Senator Sherrod Brown as we introduced the Butch Lewis Act, H.4444 and 2147.  In the House, this legislation now has two Republican cosponsors, and I hope many more of our colleagues' support will follow. But there is not time to recruit cosponsors one or two at a time. Retirees across our country are waiting for true leadership to push an equitable solution so they aren't led to the guillotine on their pensions. It is time for real congressional leadership to identify the impact this crisis will have and organize an effort here either to create a new bipartisan solution or pass the already bipartisan Butch Lewis  If we fail to act, we can no longer wonder why the middle class is angry at Washington and this Congress, for they see this as just another broken promise by We can no longer wonder why they believe the system is rigged, because here are more than a million honest Americans who worked for a living decade after decade. They worked hard. They followed the rules, and now they are getting thrown under the bus. The companies they worked for reneged on their promises.  And you know what? Unless we do something, the promise under ERISA will remain unfulfilled, and that is their pension security.  I would say to my colleagues, if you ever wonder why tens and tens of millions of Americans are angry and deeply disappointed or feel betrayed by their government and the companies they worked for, look no further than this issue.  I remember one man who didn't come from my State, but I met him here in He said: Congresswoman, I earned and put away $225,000 in my pension plan, and they told me I had to work 20 years. So I drove 20 years, drove a truck 20 years.  And he said: I started to have back problems. And when I got to my 20th year and I made it through, I said to them: Well, I am ready to apply.  And the company said: You know what? We changed the rules. You have to work 2 more years.  So he said: Two more years?  So he made every effort that he could under great pain to work those 2 years up through his 22nd year of employment as a driver, and then at the 22nd year, the company said: You know what? We changed the rules. Now you are going to have to work an additional 3 years.  Imagine having promises broken all the time.  And now he is disabled. He has difficulty standing, sitting. He has pain all the time. And he has not been able to gain access to a penny of money that he earned. Surely, if someone at the White House is listening to this, if you think about President Trump's travels through Ohio when he talked to the miners and he sought their vote, or in Chicago with those who drove a[[Page H80]]truck and paid into the Central States Pension Fund, the promises that were made, surely we can find a way to help keep the pension promises that these workers earned.  I want to thank all of the Members who cosponsored our former bill, the Keep Our Pension Promises Act, and the Butch Lewis Act, and I thank Members of both parties for trying to find a solution, a real solution, for this crisis. We are moving toward it. We really don't have any time to waste because Congress must reach a solution early this year, and we should look no further than including that pension relief in the upcoming spending deal that is being negotiated between the White House and this Congress now.  Pensions now. Pensions now. These workers have earned their pension. Why has the government of the United States made it so difficult and made their retirement years so stressful by not reaching a solution to date? I make a strong appeal on behalf of over a million workers across this country who so justly earned the pension benefits that they deserve.  I thank my colleagues who are listening. I thank the American people for writing us and for sharing their personal stories with us. I have great hope, in these final negotiations on a spending bill for 2018 which is currently under negotiation at the highest levels, that this pension issue finally will be resolved.  Keep the letters and emails and phone calls and visits coming. This is the time to make your weight felt.

She worked as the founder of NETWORK, the social justice lobby, urging Congress to care for the needy and the sick, and she became a tireless advocate in these Halls of Congress for justice, especially for the poor and oppressed. One of her greatest victories was pushing for the passage of the Children's Health Insurance Program, which insures 9 million of America's children.  In 2008, Sister Catherine was invited to deliver the benediction at the Democratic National Convention, and she urged Americans to ``call forth and affirm as leaders of this Nation, persons[[Page H31]]of vision, courage, and solid values, clearly focused not only on what is but, rather, open to the challenge of discerning and welcoming what is yet to be.''  Sister Catherine, your sacrificial life was extraordinary, and you were countercultural. You will be missed. May your passionate words and deeds guide us to care for our fellow human beings. The American people are grateful for your lifetime of service.  I will later include in the Record a eulogy and tribute to Sister Catherine by Sister Christine Schenk, who spoke at her memorial service and whose first sentence about her reads: ``Catherine's life was all about bringing glad tidings to the poor and letting the oppressed go free. She was so powerfully passionate and so dedicated to her mission of justice, who can doubt that the spirit had indeed anointed her for this work?''                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgH30-6.txt,616,"HONORING CONGRESSWOMAN MARCY KAPTUR, THE LONGEST SERVING WOMAN IN THE",2018.0,9.0,March
1613,topic-id,1248,"Mr.Speaker, I must say, I was not expecting what just happened. I want to thank the gentlewoman from California, my beloved friend of almost over three decades--in having the deep respect I have for her in her own life before she came to Congress and now as the ranking member on the Financial Services Committee; a very difficult position to hold--for taking this opportunity so late in the evening to commemorate my tenure here in our magnificent U.House of  Mr.Speaker, I thank every single Member who has come down.  Obviously this is Women's History Month, and we had this announcement today, and I happened to be the victim of it.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the people of Ohio's Ninth Congressional District for believing in me throughout my political career, for teaching me, for helping me to learn more and to understand the travails and the possibilities that were in their minds and hearts. I thank them so very much for that.  As with anyone, we all have our faults and human limitations, but, to the best of our ability, we have tried to uphold the Constitution and to help the American people.  I think back to my very first term in Congress, beginning in 1983. There was a great Congressman from Florida, Claude I can still see him down in the well. Probably the most important vote I cast in my first few months in Congress was the refinancing of Social What a great leader he was. Probably not originally from the liberal wing of our party, yet liberals and conservatives came together to do what was right in resecuring Social Security for the next generation.[[Page H1600]]  Congressman Levin came to the floor with a spark plug. Our fight has always been to define where our jobs went, and we began to track places where we saw production move beyond our ability to restrain. Places such as I represent became hollowed out in many corners of our community. Since the early 1980s until today, this country has not been able to balance its trade accounts or to write trade agreements that were truly fair, as Congressman Levin has referenced. So we hemorrhage at the rate of over half a trillion dollars a year, almost $600 billion annually, because we can't get other markets open, and they take it out of the hides of our people and our communities here in this country.  So if we go back to the 1980s. If you really look at when the numbers began to change, it is not hard to understand why the American people are unsettled and frustrated because of what has happened with the economy.  As I said in remarks earlier today, I was taught by a very great professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin many years ago that economics is not destiny, but it is 85 percent of it. If you really think about that, what we have endured over the last period of my service, three decades--going on four decades almost, we have seen this transformation in production platforms.  Unfortunately, with NAFTA on this continent, as we struggle to find a solution to the immigration issue, the reciprocal of NAFTA in Mexico was the upending of millions of small farmers, millions and millions of people who lived at the poverty level, but they had some way to eke out a living. And when their corn market was destroyed after NAFTA's passage in 1993, it took about a decade; but every year, hundreds of thousands of people lost their livelihood. They were desperate, desperate people.  What are they going to do?  Our grandparents fled to this country from what was greater Poland at the turn of the 20th century because they couldn't feed themselves.  It is the same reason the Irish came, right?  We look at what happened in Mexico as the flip side of We have never been able to fix that as a continent.  Are our leaders that stupid that we really can't face the music and develop adjustment provisions, as Europe did when it brought in Spain and Portugal?  So we look back to the basis, the root of why things have happened and hurt the American people, and we can understand their frustration. So I think I have been a voice for that. It is a problem we haven't fixed yet, but it is one that we need to attend to very carefully, because the American people have paid the price of, really, policies that went awry.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Waters for surprising me. She and I have fought so hard on prudent lending, prudent banking, and we have served here long enough to see when it wasn't, and when greed took over a gambling mentality rather than a prudent banking mentality, what it did to this country and how hard it was to pick up the pieces.  African Americans lost half of their accumulated wealth after 2008, half, since the founding of the The pain in those communities is not over. Maybe somebody from Wall Street might tune us in and hear that, but I want to tell them that it isn't fixed yet.  What has happened in many places such as I represent, predatory lenders have moved in, auto title loan companies, scam artists, who are making terrible, terrible exploitative deals with these individuals who simply don't know what those agreements they are signing mean. That is wrong.  If we look at the Latino community, they lost one-third of their accumulated wealth in the financial crash of 2008. And then for those who were the remaining Caucasians and other parts of our population, they lost about one-fifth of their wealth. It was extraordinary loss of capital, of money, of property value that belonged to them.  So sometimes, though, we try, but we can't always fix what is wrong. As we look to the future, our primary responsibility here is to defend liberty, as Congressmen Takano and Levin and Congresswoman Speier and so many others who came down here this evening talked about.  I feel very privileged to work with my colleagues in defending liberty and making sure we have the strongest defense in the world, and try to help those countries that are now being invaded by the Russian Federation, whose citizens simply want to be free and to have a decent life.  Mr.Speaker, I note that one of our colleagues has come to the floor, and I don't want to deny him any ability to speak. Congressman Soto and I have worked so much on issues of concern to Florida and Puerto Rico and, obviously, trying to fix the bad gerrymandering that happened around the country, so I want to acknowledge his presence here this evening.  I thank all of my beloved colleagues for this great honor.  Mr.Speaker, I thank my family; my brother, Steven, who is doing extremely well after a very serious illness and coming back to us. It means so very much to me. I am hoping he is listening tonight. In memory of all of our family members and my godchildren, some of whom were here today, and all of the people who helped me along the way, there is just no way to properly thank them except to keep trying to do a very good job and to meet the unaddressed needs of this great, great  Mr.Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Waters so very much for this great surprise and for being my friend.

929,topic-id,469,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.4561, the SAFE TECH Act, sponsored by my good friend and colleague and a knowledgeable alumnus of the Homeland Security Committee, Congressman Bilirakis, who recently participated in my subcommittee's overseas congressional delegation to examine airport security and the passenger screening technology in place at last point of departure airports with direct flights to the United  As part of our delegation, we visited Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, where we saw the effective deployment of new and advanced computed tomography screening technology, as well as a number of other screening technologies aimed at making the passenger and employee screening checkpoints both more effective and more efficient.  Upon returning to the United States, the committee conducted rigorous oversight and found that the existing testing and evaluation processes in place at the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration are riddled with bureaucratic bottlenecks that serve to delay new technologies for years.  I will note that the technology in place at the airport in Schiphol was made in the United States, yet we are not taking advantage of that technology because of these bottlenecks.  Additionally, due to logjams at Homeland Security and TSA facilities, small businesses, as well as technology startups, are often prevented from participating in the acquisitions and procurement processes. As a result, our aviation system is left with antiquated security technology that is incapable of adequately responding to new and ever-evolving threats.  Madam Speaker, this is simply unacceptable, and we must act to reform the Homeland Security and TSA acquisition processes. H.4561 takes significant steps toward making these reforms by allowing new technologies to receive third-party testing and evaluation, while maintaining existing lines of authority for the TSA administrator to ensure such testing remains held to the highest standards of security and integrity.  This bill will not only drive innovation but will also save taxpayer dollars at Homeland Security and TSA, while reducing costs to companies developing new screening technologies. That is why we have received broad support, not only in a bipartisan manner here in Congress, but also from the private sector.  Madam Speaker, I commend the dedication of Congressman Bilirakis to reforming the broken acquisitions process currently in place and for working with me and the committee on developing this bill. I also wish to thank Chairman McCaul for supporting this legislation and moving it quickly through the committee to address the serious concerns we found through our oversight efforts.  I also thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who routinely support bills of ours, and we routinely support bills of theirs, because we both understand that homeland security is a very bipartisan issue.

Unfortunately, though, this House has spent a good deal of the last year or so trying to take back some of those advances that we have made, essentially, putting more families in the position of having that economic uncertainty of not knowing whether or not their premiums will continue to go up or their copays will go up, or prescription drugs will be available but completely unaffordable to them; putting families back in the place where they are, essentially, one illness away from losing everything that they have worked for.

As Senator Kaine just noted, I was also heartened, after the meeting at the White House, by the fact that this President understands--he said he understands that we can't wait until March to get this done, that we need to get this done soon. For me, the easiest way to do this is by passing the Dream  The Federal court decision in California yesterday will provide some temporary relief, as every single day more and more kids fall out of status. That sounds like a legal term, but for them, it changes their whole life. These are kids who literally believed our government. They were told: You register. You sign up. We are going to allow you to stay.[[Page S132]]  And then, in one little moment and with a signature, that all changed. Their lives changed. So it is now our obligation in the Senate to get this done.  We have already seen the harmful effects of the administration's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, and the situation will continue to get worse until we take action. This is not just a small thing. I have met these kids. Ninety-seven percent of them either work or are in school. The average age they were when they were brought to this country is 6\1/2\ years old.  A few months back, I stood in front of a Catholic church with our archbishop of the Twin Cities, Archbishop Hebda, and a number of his parishioners and a number of the priests from that church to talk about what this meant in people's lives--kids brought over through no fault of their own.  My favorite example of a Dreamer, Senator Kaine and Mr.President, is Joseph He was brought over--and he didn't know this at the time--as a baby. His parents had died, and he was brought over to Sleepy Eye, MN, where he was raised. This was a long time ago. When he got to be the right age, he decided that he wanted to serve our country, and he signed up to serve in World War  Well, back then, he went to the military, to the Army, and said: I want to sign up.  They said: Well, it turns out--I don't know what term they used back then, but he was undocumented. And when I first met him at the young age of 99, as he explained to me, back then, all you did was you went to Canada for a day, with our country's OK, and slept in a hotel for a night, which is what he did, and then came back. Then he was made legal, and the Army signed him up, and he ended up going over and serving in the He came back to this country, met his wife, got married, had a son, and that son served in the Vietnam war.  A few years ago, when he was 99, I got to bring him to Washington, and we stood in front of the World War II There he stood. He had never seen it before, and he would never go again. He just died at the age of 103. He stood there with two Dreamers, suburban high school kids from Minnesota who wanted to join the Air Force, but they couldn't do it. They didn't have that right status. They were Dreamers too. They had been brought over as young kids.  To me, that just brought it all home. This is a war hero, someone who served our country, and this is the kind of person we are talking about when we talk about the His last act of patriotism in the last few years of his life was to continue to push so that other kids could serve their country just as he had and just as his son had.  While we have not reached an agreement yet on this bill, the reports on the bipartisan meeting are hopeful. But time is ticking by. Time is ticking. The American public is with us. This is not one of these issues where the public says: What are they doing? This makes no sense. A recent poll found that 86 percent of Americans support action to allow the Dreamers to stay here in the United So I am very hopeful that we can come together on a bipartisan agreement.  The Dream Act was based on one simple principle, and that is that you should have the opportunity--this set of people, 800,000 people who came over here through no fault of their own, should have that opportunity to call this country home, as they have been doing for so many years.  Passing the Dream Act isn't just the morally right thing to do, it is the economically right thing to do. One recent study estimated that ending deferred action for childhood arrivals would cost the country over $400 billion over the next 10 years. It would cost my State more than $376 million in annual revenue. We are proud to be the home of more than 6,000  Since it was established in 2012, it has helped, as I have noted, nearly 800,000 young people who have lived in the United States since childhood to have better lives. Think about that--800,000 people. As I mentioned, 97 percent of them are in school or in the workforce, and 72 percent of them are currently in school pursuing a bachelor's degree or higher. More than 100 students applied to medical school last year. Nearly 100 of them are currently enrolled in medical school at a time when we need more doctors, particularly in rural areas. Those are the facts.  I note that at the meeting at the White House, the President actually said that when this got done, he wanted to pursue comprehensive immigration reform. It is something that we have done before on a bipartisan basis in the Senate, and I believe that is where we need to turn now.  We talk about the economic sense of the Look at our country overall. Seventy of our Fortune 500 companies are headed by immigrants. Twenty-five percent of our U.Nobel Laureates were born in other countries. Immigrants have been an economic engine for this country.  Everyone in this Chamber came from somewhere. Their relatives came from somewhere. My grandparents on my mom's side came from Switzerland, and on my dad's side my great-grandparents came from They worked in the mines. They worked so hard just to send my dad to college. They saved money in a coffee can in a basement. I am here today with great-grandparents who came straight from Slovenia, a grandfather who worked in a mine, a dad who grew up there and was the first one in the family to go to college and get a 2-year degree and then a 4-year degree, and I literally stand here on the shoulders of these immigrants.  On my mom's side, the Swiss side, my grandpa came over and ended up at Ellis Island when he was 18 years old, and they had reached the cap on Swiss immigrants. That might sound amusing, but that was the case. He then somehow got himself to Canada--I think he said he was going to live there--came back through--because he wanted to be in our country--came back through, ended up in Wisconsin, like all good Swiss, with my other relatives on my grandma's side, worked at a cheese factory, and was an alien for 20 years. He finally applied for citizenship when World War II was breaking out, and that is when they found out that, in fact, he maybe had come into the country two different ways. But back then, they listened to his story, and they gave him citizenship. Otherwise, he would have been deported--I think it was 3 weeks before the U.joined World War II--as a Swiss Instead, he married my grandma back then, they had my mom and my mom's brother, and here I am.  I am on the shoulders of those immigrants. So when I see these Dreamers, I see my own family, and I hope everyone in this Chamber sees the same thing--the American dream. That is why, Mr.President, I stand with the Senator from Virginia, Mr.Kaine, with Senator Durbin, and so many of my colleagues who have been working on this for so long on both sides of the aisle.

1723,topic-id,2457,"Madam President, I come to the floor today for a number of reasons, but first and most pressing is to call on and ask the administration to extend deferred enforced departure status for a group of This is a unique situation. Senator Jack Reed was on the floor in the last hour talking about it as well.  Both the State of Rhode Island and the State of Minnesota have a number of Liberians who didn't just come to this country--they didn't come to this country illegally--they came to this country decades ago. They came because of a civil war in their country of Liberia, and then after that war was basically resolved, they were allowed to stay. So they are all registered in this country, they are working legally in this country, and they are in a special status called deferred enforced departure.  Ever since George H.Bush, Presidents--Democrats and Republicans; George Bush, of course, President Clinton, and President Obama--every one has allowed them to stay.  As my colleagues can imagine, since this happened back in 1991, these are people who have been working in our country for decades now. I met one who is 65 years old. Some of them are now 70 years old. They have obeyed the law. They have paid their taxes. They tend to be working in a lot of--of course, consistently--working in our assisted living facilities in They are working in our hospitals. Some of them had healthcare experience in Liberia before they came to They are a thriving community that has integrated well into our State and into Rhode We are a State where the unemployment rate is somewhere around 3 percent and even lower in some of the areas where this community is working. It would literally be a big jolt to our economy--and not to mention immoral--if they were suddenly deported and lost the legal status they have had for literally decades.  Unlike some of the other things we talk about with people who maybe just came here--and I worked so hard on the Dreamers, to get them a path to citizenship--this is a pretty unique situation. We hope the administration will be practical about this. That is why Senator Reed and I are working on this issue. We hope to get it resolved quickly since their status is ending on March 31, which is just a few weeks from now.  Liberians are the only group of people and it is the only country with deferred enforced departure--or DED, as it is known--which is a temporary legal status that requires the President to reauthorize it every 18 months.  One idea is that the President could reauthorize it, and then they could[[Page S1755]]look into it more. As we know, there is a lot going on in our country. There are a lot of changes right now within the Office of the Secretary of State and other things. So one idea would be that they could simply allow the program to continue for 18 months and then come to a conclusion on what they think they should do about it.  As I mentioned, in 1991, President George H.Bush first issued temporary protected status to Liberians in response to the nation's civil war. Since 1991, Presidents on both sides of the aisle have extended legal protection to Liberians in the United States under either TPS or DED--deferred enforced departure--because of civil wars, the Ebola outbreak, and other instabilities in their country. All Liberians covered by DED have been living in the United States since 2002. This isn't, as I said, new people coming in under that status; these are people who have been living here with that status for decades. As I mentioned, some are now in their seventies, and all of them have lived here legally. They have paid their taxes and contributed to our communities and worked at our employers. If DED is not extended by March 31, they will lose their legal status and work authorization and face deportation.  Minnesota, as I mentioned, has one of the largest Liberian populations in the country. Many of these people are business owners. They are teachers. They are healthcare workers. According to one organization, nearly 40 percent of Liberians in Minnesota work in our nursing homes as nursing assistants and other support staff. Imagine if we took thousands of people away just like that on March 31, because they wouldn't have legal status to work at the nursing homes where they have worked for decades.  I have also called for action on the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act--a bill that Senator Reed has introduced every Congress since 1999--and I have cosponsored this bill. The bill would actually provide permanent protected status, including a path to citizenship, for those Liberians who have obeyed the law and have been here in this temporary status for decades.  That is not what we are asking for today. We understand and we hope that negotiations are ongoing so that we can have a more comprehensive immigration bill. We are simply asking the administration to continue with the 18-month status that was started back in 1991 by a Republican  I met with a number of members of our Liberian community yesterday. They are experiencing extreme fear right now that their livelihoods will be lost and their families will be ripped apart. I am hopeful that we will be able to resolve this, at least for that temporary 18-month period.                    Support Our Military Spouses Act  Secondly, Madam President, on a different topic, I want to take a moment to discuss a bipartisan bill that I introduced this week that would help reduce the burden of relocation for military families.  When servicemembers relocate to comply with military orders, they and their families make sacrifices to help protect our Right now, there is a problem with the way the law treats some military spouses who make frequent moves, and the law, ironically, makes it even harder on them rather than easier on them.  Current law allows Active-Duty servicemembers to maintain one State of legal residence for tax and voting purposes even when military orders require them to relocate. That makes moving a lot easier. Unfortunately, this convenience does not apply to a servicemember's spouse unless they were living together at the same residence before they got married. In other words, if you were not living with your servicemember before you got married, you have to establish residency every single time your family gets moving orders from the military. From filing taxes to registering to vote, a military family then has double the paperwork and stress each time they move.  This is a loophole that must be fixed. Why would we make it harder for the spouses of those who are making a sacrifice by having their loved one serve overseas and not make it easier for them to vote and to pay their taxes and to basically be the citizen they deserve to be? That is why, on Tuesday, Senators Cornyn, Kaine, Kennedy, Manchin, and I introduced the Support Our Military Spouses Act--legislation that would ensure that spouses have the same residency protections regardless of their living arrangements before marriage. From titling a car, to filing taxes, to registering to vote, everything is a little easier when the law ensures that you can stay a resident of one State and that it is the same State as your spouse's. That is just common sense, and it cuts out a lot of redtape for military families.  The bill has the support of the Military Spouses Network, the Military Officers Association of America, and the Council of State This bill passed the House in July of 2017 with bipartisan support, and I am going to work with my cosponsors to get it done in the  We ask a lot of our military members and their families. When we can make life easier for them, we should. This is one simple thing we can do.                             Honest Ads Act  Finally, Madam President, I would like to mention the sanctions that were just announced against Russia for interfering in the 2016 election. It took 14 months, multiple indictments, and a poisoning in Britain, but the administration is finally imposing sanctions--the same sanctions that were passed by the Senate 98 to 2 and 419 to 3 in the House last year.  Sanctioning Russia for undermining our democracy is what we should do, but we must remember that it is not enough to protect ourselves from future attacks. There is no longer any doubt that our elections will continue to be a target for foreign adversaries. Intelligence reports make it clear that Russia used covert cyber attacks, espionage, and harmful propaganda to attack our political system.  Trump administration officials--not Obama officials, Trump intelligence officials--continue to sound the alarm that Russia is continuing its efforts to attack our democracy. The CIA Director said that he has seen no signs that Russia has decreased its activity and that Russia is currently working to disrupt the upcoming 2018 elections. National Intelligence Director Coats, who was once a Senator here, said that Russia is bolder.  It would be a mistake to think the sanctions passed today are all we need to do to address these warnings. They will no doubt help because if you do nothing, then you just embolden them to do more. It is the policy of the United States to defend against and respond to cyber threats to our democratic system, and we need to start acting like it. We need to be as sophisticated as those who are trying to do us harm.  We know that Russia attempted to hack into 21 States' election systems. In Illinois, they actually got into the voter data system. That is why Senator Lankford and I have led a bill to take an amount of money which is just 3 percent of one aircraft carrier and invest it in our States, to let them, on a decentralized basis, make their own decisions about the kind of equipment they want and to be able to upgrade it. Forty of our States have not upgraded their equipment in 10 years. Ten of our States do not even have backup paper ballots. What would happen if they were hacked, as they got so close the last time? There would be no way to prove what actually happened. You would have to vote again.  That is why we have Democrats and Republicans supporting this effort. Representative Mark Meadows, the head of the Freedom Caucus, is leading the bill that Senator Graham and I have--which is similar to the one I have with Senator Lankford--over in the Senator Coons from the Appropriations Committee has been a strong supporter of this effort, as have Senator Kamala Harris, Senator Graham, and a number of other people. This is a truly bipartisan effort because people understand that it is no longer going to be only traditional ways of warfare when we are attacked; it is going to be cyber. It is not going to be just election infrastructure. It is not going to be just government infrastructure. It is going to be our businesses, power companies--you name it. That is why we need to upgrade our cyber protection.  The last thing I would mention on this front, as we look to the next election and how we are going to protect our democracy, is the Honest Ads Act.[[Page S1756]]This is a bill I have with Senator McCain, also cosponsored by Senator Warner, the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence This is based on the fact that we know Russia spent millions of dollars buying ads. That was reflected in the indictment of 13 Russians and what they did and how they plotted to disrupt elections and to spend money on political ads. A number of these ads were even purchased in rubles.  What Senator McCain and Senator Warner and I are trying to do is simply apply the same rules already in place to protect Americans in our elections by making sure that we know who is paying for the ads and what those ads are. Who is paying for the ads--those are the simple disclaimers you see on the ads where they say, whoever the candidate is, I paid for this ad. Who discloses the ads--that is simply when any radio station or TV station--you can go into the station or see it online and see what the ads are. That is not true right now of some of the most sophisticated companies, if not the most sophisticated companies, in America, companies like Facebook and Twitter, which have made millions and billions of dollars, companies that are profiting off of political ads.  It is no different from when a newspaper or a TV station allows someone to buy an ad. They make money off it, so it is their duty to protect the citizens, to make sure that the ads don't contain falsehoods, that the ads are not criminal, that the ads are known to everyone. That is all we are trying to do, is to apply the same rules of the game to what you see when you see political ads on issues or candidate ads.  The FEC did something just yesterday--but it was very narrow--about candidate ads. So what you see on candidate ads and issue ads--that you also see those same disclaimers and, most importantly, the disclosure on ads that are on social media companies. And I use those words carefully--``media companies.'' Newspaper print and radio--we love them--are media companies. Facebook and Twitter--we love them--are media companies. We are not talking about recipes and cat videos. We are not talking about free stuff that people put up. We are talking about paid political ads that need to be treated the same.  While we are pleased that these sanctions have been put in place, while it is good that the FEC is narrowly trying to do something within their jurisdiction about disclaimers on candidate ads, we must pass the Honest Ads Act, because if we think it was bad last election when $1.4 billion was spent on election ads, try this next one out: Forecasts are that $3 billion to $4 billion is going to be spent on social media ads against candidates on issues, and there is no way to track it. It is just going to go out to your Facebook page. You are not going to know if it is true, you are not going to know who paid for it, and the ads will just vanish.  I think Americans deserve something better, and I ask my colleagues to support the Honest Ads  Madam President, I yield the floor.

King dedicated his life to justice and equality, and he died for it. But even with his ideals, King would have never had the impact he did if it weren't for his willingness to dedicate his life to service. That path of service is open to us all.  As King said: ``You don't have to have a college degree to serve. You don't have to have to make your subject and your verb agree to serve. You don't have to know about Plato and Aristotle to serve.''  King knew that service isn't about your education or your background. It is about much more than that. He taught us all that all you need to serve is ``a heart full of grace, a soul generated by love.''  That path is not an easy one, but it is one we can all take, and we should.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-08-pt1-PgH7-2.txt,2325,CLOTURE MOTION,2018.0,8.0,March
1549,topic-id,160,"Mr.Speaker, study after study has shown that employers and employees find that onsite childcare provides the greatest value of any employer-provided childcare option. Despite this, only 11 percent of all private sector workers in the U.receive childcare assistance through their employers. Of that 11 percent, only 7 percent have access to childcare at or near their place of work.  As childcare costs dramatically increase each year relative to family income, the time has come for new approaches that provide affordability and flexibility for working families and increased productivity for businesses. Onsite childcare accomplishes this and has been repeatedly shown to reduce absenteeism and increase staff retention.  That is why I am introducing the Child Care At Responsible Employers Act this week: to incentivize employer investment in onsite childcare by providing a small preference in government contracting to those who do so.  With childcare costs rising, we can't afford not to act, and onsite childcare helps both businesses and families.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-19-pt1-PgH1682-2.txt,2325,"ECONOMIC GROWTH, REGULATORY RELIEF, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT--",2018.0,19.0,March

In this historic speech, he called upon Americans to embrace nonviolence in reaction to the news of King's assassination. Senator Kennedy stated: ``What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love and wisdom and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be White or whether they be Black.''

Stephen Hawking was a brilliant student of the universe, a giant of the world stage, an inspiration to me personally and to us all. Through his discoveries about black holes and quantum mechanics, Professor Hawking challenged humankind to ponder the mysteries of the cosmos. He was curiosity personified, having once remarked: ``My goal is simple. It is a complete understanding of the universe, why it is as it is and why it exists at all.''  Yet Professor Hawking, who was diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, at the age of 21, also personified the unconquerable human spirit. He took on the challenges of his disability with unparalleled tenacity and a trademark sense of humor, all the while reminding us ``to look up at the stars and not down at your feet.''

52,topic-id,3087,"Madam President, it is an interesting conversation we can finally have about immigration. This has been that topic which has been discussed for a while but not settled.  For 20 years, this body has talked about solving some of our immigration issues. National security immigration hasn't been a partisan issue until of late. Suddenly, when President Trump brings it up, we have a bunch of folks who used to be for border security but are now against border security because President Trump wants border security--with some of the exact same ideas that have been in the Gang of 8 bill or were in previous versions or were even talked about with a secure wall or fence before. Almost every Democrat in this body voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006.  It is interesting to me the number of people who contact us saying: We do not want to build a wall. I have said: What about the 650 miles of wall that already exists and was put in place after 2006, which, by the way, President Obama, when he was Senator Obama, wholeheartedly supported and voted for?  This is suddenly a partisan issue. I am trying to help our entire body take a step back and say: Immigration should be a humanity issue and a legal issue, not a political issue.  I had a conversation with a friend of mine this weekend. We have known each other for years. He is a pastor. We started talking about the immigration issue. In that dialogue, he said to me: In the church, we look at every individual as an individual created in the image of God, and the church has a ministry to be able to reach out, regardless of legal status.  Then he said, right behind it: But, in government, we understand there is a different responsibility. The church engages with every person equally, but the government has the responsibility of looking at laws--what is legal and what is not legal--and helping abide by those laws and enforcing those laws.  He is correct. There is an issue of humanity in this. These are people caught in a system, and oftentimes those children in the DACA Program are caught in a gap in which literally they have no home country. They were brought as infants or as young children with a parent who violated the law but did so with a child who came in and has now lived in the country, in some cases 20 years, and they know only this country. They are literally caught in the middle. While we have great compassion, we are walking this interesting balance between compassion for people, which we as a nation have, and also consistency with the law. The law applies to every person. Whether you are the President of the United States or an undocumented individual who has come in, the law applies to everyone.  What do we do with this? The first thing I think we need to do is take a deep breath and pull the politics out of this and to say border security--in fact, security as a whole is not a controversial issue. I will tell you, as a U.Senator, I have the privilege occasionally of going to do interviews. Let me give you an example. CNN has a great studio in Washington, When you go to the studio in Washington, DC, you go through the front door of a big building. There is a security person there, and they will check your ID before you go any farther. Not only will they check your ID, they make sure you are already preregistered to be there to visit with CNN because you can't just walk in. You have to notify them ahead of time you are coming, even if you are the person being interviewed. Then, there is a physical barrier between you and the elevators. Once the security guard clears you, you go through the physical barriers, but you can't go up the elevator because the security guard has to clear you to actually go up that elevator and punch in a certain code to go up to the floor. When you arrive at that floor, you are literally in nowhere land because everywhere around you are locked doors until someone comes in and clears you. You go to another security guard, and you sign in with that security guard, again check ID, and then you have an escort who takes you into the studio. That escort stays with you because as soon as your interview is done, they will smile at you and say: Your time is up. We are going to escort you out.  It is a shame CNN has to do that, but they do because not everybody who walks through their doors means to do them no harm. There are some people who mean to do them harm, and it is right for them to keep that level of security.  For that level of security that we talked about for CNN, all of us see that as rational--unfortunate but rational. I would say to us as a nation, why is that rational at CNN headquarters, and it is irrational for us to be able to do the same thing with our own borders? Not everyone who crosses our border is there to help us. We can all admit, there are some individuals--a few thankfully--who do mean to cross our borders and do us harm. We should be aware of that. We have half a million people a day who legally cross our border, our southern border, alone--half a million people a day who cross back and forth, who legally go through the system. They are doing commerce. They are visiting family. There are all[[Page S58]]kinds of individuals who move back and forth through our gates legally every single day. We should ask the question: Why are half a million people moving through legally but yet there are thousands and thousands who are moving through illegally? What is the difference, and should we ask questions of some of those people? Should there be a physical barrier in some spots?  We have seen some places like in Yuma, AZ, when there wasn't a physical barrier and there is a large city right on the border and someone would cross the border quickly, commit a crime, and move right back across the border. When a physical barrier was put in place a decade ago in Yuma, AZ, the crime rate dropped dramatically in that area. The physical barrier helped and did reduce crime.  I have had people say, if you build a 30-foot wall, there will be a 31-foot ladder leaning against it. That is true, but it slows them down and gives enough time in remote areas or in heavily urbanized areas for people to be able to respond and be able to interdict those individuals. Walls don't stop people. They slow people down so you can actually do interdiction and ask: Why are you going over the wall rather than through the gates like half a million other people are doing today?  Why is that happening? That is not unreasonable, but it has become heavily politicized. We need to step back and remove this from a conversation about Presidents and about political parties and move it back to some basic, commonsense things--things this Congress used to do with wide, bipartisan support--things like a physical barrier. There should be a wall in certain areas of the southern border that don't have a wall right now. There should be areas of technology in other areas. There should be an area to have watch towers with cameras that are there. We should add some additional personnel. We are talking about 3,000-plus miles on our northern border, 2,000 miles on our southern border. That is a lot of territory to be able to cover. Some of those areas don't even have broadband access to it, so just getting information to the agents who work there takes a very long time or is unreliable. We do need to have some technology improvements in some of those areas. Should every part of our border have a wall? No, I don't think so. It shouldn't all have a wall, but in heavily populated areas, it probably should because that provides greater security, quite frankly, on both sides of the border.  Some of it is even more simple than that. There are areas where there are large amounts of cane that is growing up in the Rio Grande River, and the Border Patrol agents can't see on both sides of the river who is moving through because people can hide in the cane. Just eradicating the cane that is all through that area on the border, in the river area, would provide tremendous visibility. That would allow people to be able to see farther and, quite frankly, stop some of the drug movement and allow for more interdiction in those areas. It shouldn't be that controversial. That should be common sense--adding technology, adding sensors, adding greater visibility, adding a wall in areas where a wall is needed, and in other areas that don't need a wall, we don't.  That is not just the issue. Some of the issue is fixing loopholes in the law that get exploited. There are some individuals who cross the border, and they know the rules. The coyotes in Central America who are actually humans smuggling them all the way through Mexico and getting them to the border have told them exactly what to say. When they encounter a Border Patrol agent, they say: Say these words, and you will get access to asylum, whether they are true or not.  The way it typically starts is, they say those words the coyotes have told them to say, and they actually get a quick hearing and what is called a notice to appear for another hearing, which is usually 2 or 2\1/2\ years later. They disappear somewhere into the American system, and we have no idea where they are. They are somewhere among 300-plus million Americans in some town, and we don't know where they are. The vast majority of them never show up for the court hearings, but they have a piece of paper that says ``notice to appear,'' which also means they are given legal protections until that court date, and they can move around the country.  That is a loophole in our system. It should be fixed. Nowhere else would they do that. Why do we do that? We allow ourselves to be exploited. There are some words and phrases that we need to be able to clean up in the law and some things that need to be done. Again, that shouldn't be controversial. It should be security related. There should be some basic questions about how we are going to handle immigration.  We allow 1 million people a year to become citizens of the United States legally--1 million people a year. Yet the American system is also ignoring hundreds of thousands of others who are coming into the system illegally and pretending it is not happening. It is. For 20 years, this Congress has not paid attention to it.  Say what you would like to about President Trump, but he is pushing this Congress to do something it has not done in two decades--deal with the issue of border security. This body will have to come to agreement on that. The House of Representatives will have to come to agreement on that, and the President will have to be able to sign it or it will be just another Executive action that will not last very long. If we are going to have lasting, real change in border security, it has to go through the legislative process.  The President is pushing us to get that done before the first week of We had 6 months of time. Four months of that has already run out. It is time to get that document finished, to deal with the basic things the President has asked for--border security, a legal status for those individuals who are in the DACA Program whom the previous President just put into deferred action status--that we will not arrest them, but they are in some sort of legal limbo in between. President Trump wants to have a permanent answer for all of those families. Dealing with things on border security, not just the wall but the other exceptions to it. The President wants to deal with the visa lottery, which is a system where the names of 50,000 people somewhere in the world are just randomly drawn out of a hat to be able to become American citizens.  Many of us said for a long time, that is a foolish way to do your immigration system. Our immigration system should be based on what we need in America--what jobs, what locations--rather than randomly pulling names of people around the world out of a hat. I understand there are millions and millions of people around the world who would love to be Americans, but in America, we want to be able to target those individuals who want to not just be Americans but want to be a part of us, not just culturally but economically, to be part of the fabric of whom we are, to make decisions for ourselves as a nation, and to do it not just in our own policy but also our own immigration policy. It is not too much to ask.  There are basic things that should be done. Dealing with the DACA students who are literally caught in a place where they have no home is a compassionate thing to do, but along with our compassion, we also need to uphold the law. Those kids should not be held to account for what their parents did, but their parents should not have the same access to the American system of being naturalized as the kids do--only because the parents did intentionally violate the law. They chose to break the law and bring their child with them when they did it. The child didn't make that decision. Now they are growing up in a place where they have no country. They should have a shot at being in our I do not believe the parents of those kids--who broke the law--should have that same access to our system. That may seem heartless, but I will tell you, that is the balance we have to have between compassion for people and upholding the law; that the law does apply to all people. Maybe there is a way to do some other work permits or some other things that could be there, but access to citizenship should be reserved for those individuals who are upholding the law, not violating it.  There are some DACA kids who have done some remarkable stuff, some DACA kids who are pretty amazing individuals. I ask folks in Oklahoma when I am home, if I could identify for you 700,000 people somewhere around the world who speak English, who are excellent students, who have stood up[[Page S59]]every day in their school and pledged allegiance to the United States of America, who are in our military already, who are already working in our economy right now, are those the individuals you want to reach out to and be part of that 1 million people a year who become citizens? I have yet to have someone tell me: No, that is not whom we are looking for. Everyone says: That is exactly whom we are looking for.  I get to smile at them and say: They are already here. They just happen to have grown up in this country already, but they have no home and would love to call this one their home.  I would like to give them the opportunity to earn the ability to be naturalized--not automatic, to earn it--and go through the process, to get in line like every other person around the world, to get in line but not have to return to their home country because they don't know a home country, but get in line here to do it.  There is a way to be able to do this. The President has been the first advocate for that. There is a way to be able to actually answer the problems we have dealt with for 20 years on border security so we don't continue to have another DACA Program in 5 years, in 10 years, and over and over again as we are right now. Let's solve it.  Interestingly enough, in 2012, when President Obama announced the DACA Program, he made some pretty blunt, clear statements during that time period. One of them was, for individuals--this was in June of 2012--who are already here, he set a date. He said: For those individuals, our Nation wants to provide an opportunity to not be arrested, and we will work on your status, but for any future individuals who cross our border, you will not have access to this program.  That is President Obama who made that statement in 2012. While I have heard individuals say we should abide by the words of our Presidents, when President Obama made those statements to those kids in 2012, I would remind us as a nation, we should honor all of those statements, if we do any of those statements, including President Obama's statements saying that this will end, and people who are crossing our border will be returned to their home country.  As he announced publicly, there is a right way to be able to do immigration. Let's do it the right way. We already receive 1 million a year. Let's do it the right way, and you will find a very welcoming United States of  That is where I think we can go, and I hope in the days ahead we can finish out a negotiation and be able to resolve some basic things--not everything in immigration but at least the core issues of immigration and border security so we can resolve the issue not only for the kids in DACA but continue to be able to work on how we are securing our Nation for the future.

1057,topic-id,1593,"Madam President, when I was in college, I remember watching a State of the Union speech by President Reagan in which he took a 43-pound stack of papers and set them on the podium. As he was giving his State of the Union Address, he said: This is the budget bill that has been given to me--43 pounds of it, all stacked up. It was a famous moment when the President said: Do not send this to me again.  Republicans and Democrats alike stood and cheered. They said: That is a terrible way to do government.  For 5 of the next 6 years there were no more Omnibus appropriations bills, but that did not last. Since 1986, there have been 22 Omnibus appropriations bills. People may ask, what is that?  By law, Congress is to do 12 appropriations bills. Each part of that has a section of the budget, and each one of those is passed as a stand-alone. First, they go through subcommittee, then committee, then to the full floor, and then they pass. But 17 times since 1998 and 22 times since 1986, all of those bills were just looped together to make one giant document--the 43-pound document that President Reagan dropped in 1988.  What is going wrong? We have another one of those omnibus bills next week, in which all of the appropriations bills have been looped together to try to simplify the process, but this actually provides even less transparency.[[Page S1705]]What do we do with this? How did we get here?  The short story is that the Budget Control Act of 1974 was created right after Watergate in a fight between Congress and President Nixon over the fact that President Nixon was told that Congress wanted to be able to spend certain amounts of money in certain areas, and President Nixon basically didn't want to spend it. So Congress pushed back and put additional requirements on him to actually do what Congress was compelling him to do in that 1974 Budget Act, to try to create more transparency and provide greater leadership for Out of that was born this Budget Act, but also the House and Senate committees and the Congressional Budget Office were born.  All of those things were to create more input and create a system in which, each year, the President would create a budget and would submit that budget to Then that budget would lead to authorizing bills from the different committees. And then, from the authorizing, it would lead to appropriations bills and final passage.  Well, how is that working for us? It is not. It created a process so complicated and so slow that, although it makes sense on paper and in legislative language, it doesn't actually work year to year, and it pushes us into what is called continuing resolutions--or, as is commonly thrown around here, Every year since 1995, Congress has had at least one CR--one continuing resolution; that is, taking last year's appropriations bill, just changing the date on it, and moving it over. There is no strategic planning, nothing. That is a problem for us.  The budget process itself has broken down and has fallen into omnibus spending bills, with 12 bills, all combined. Some years, we fail to get budget bills done at all.  The authorizing process that is supposed to go between the budget and the appropriations process has completely collapsed for us. In fact, in the 2017 appropriations, it happens that there were 256 expired authorizations in the final appropriations bills. About $310 billion of what was appropriated was not authorized even last year. Some of those things hadn't been authorized for more than a decade. Finally, we have passed all appropriations bills only four times in the last 44 years.  We have a major problem with the way we do budgeting. Year after year, people visit me or people bring this to me in townhall meetings or at the grocery store or at Taco Bell; people catch me and say: What is going on with the budget process?  I can tell you that if it sounds as if you say that every year, it is because you have said that every year now for a couple of decades.  How do we get out of this? There is a bipartisan, bicameral committee that has been put together and met for the first time last week. There are 16 total--8 Democrats and 8 Republicans, 8 from the Senate and 8 from the Our mission is to revise the way we do budgeting. A lot of Americans probably will not watch this process, but it will be extremely important that we actually fix it.  I am convinced that we are not going to get a better budget product until we get a better budget process. This committee itself is designed in such a way that it takes out the partisanship, not just with equal numbers on both sides, but the agreement from the very beginning is that if we don't have a majority of Democrats and a majority of Republicans signing off on the final proposal, we will not bring it to the floor. If we do, we hope to fix the budget process itself.  The budget process is set up to create gimmicks in the budgeting rather than to fix them. We have a 10-year budget window, and there are all these gimmicks that have been created to try to move spending outside the 10-year budget window to make things look as though they are actually going to balance when they actually don't balance. I would like for us to consider some things like biennial budgeting. Twenty States budget every 2 years. It gives budget certainty for 24 months. We should get that. That helps our economy. That helps our businesses. That helps our agencies. That helps in contracting. That helps us avoid these continuing resolutions--if we can actually do budgeting in 2-year cycles.  I would like to get out of the perpetual focus on government shutdowns and the countdown clocks that happen. I proposed a bill 5 years ago called the Government Shutdown Prevention It is designed to get us to a spot where we actually put the pressure on Congress to get the job done but hold agencies and hold the American people harmless while we work through the process.  Quite frankly, I think the President's budget is a meaningless document. It has never been passed by any President of any party. I don't mind the Presidents releasing their budget priorities--ways we can save money, duplication that they see, key aspects. That is entirely appropriate. But the President's budget every year just becomes a big fight, and when it is late, it throws the process off even more and gives Congress one more reason to say that they are not getting their job done because someone else was late in doing theirs. We should reform that.  We should reform the way we do debt limits. We are the only country in the world that does this. We have had some kind of debt limit since the 1920s, actually. But originally, when it went to the form that it is in now in the late 1930s, it was established as a way to protect us from adding more debt, and it did work for decades.  It has not worked for decades. It has been another fiscal cliff out there that has not resolved anything. We have to fix that so it does what it is supposed to do or take it away, but we can't destabilize international economies because we can't get our job done here.  We have to have some sort of focus on both revenue and spending. We should deal with real consequences when we don't get things done on time. We have to build internal processes that actually get things done. We have to pay attention to $20 trillion, and growing, in national debt.  These are things we can get done, but they will not get done if we don't actually fix the process. There is no moment to actually get the big things and hard things done.  My hope and my commitment, with this body and with this group of 16 of us who have grouped together from the House and the Senate--Republicans and Democrats--is this: Bring a proposal to us that is a fair, nonpartisan proposal that is not focused on what party is in power at that moment but looks at the fiscal health of the Nation, how we can plan for the future, and how we can actually get off this endless cycle of nonaction and get back to a process of predictable budgeting and appropriations. We will bring some of those solutions in the days ahead.  Right now we are meeting and talking. I invite any Member of this body who wants to contribute to catch any one of us in this group. We are not saying that the 16 of us are exclusive to solving the problems.  I also say the same thing to the American people: Anyone in my State or anyone around the country who wants to contribute good ideas, bring them. Let's add these good ideas together. Let's fix the process. Let's get back to actually talking about how we solve the budget issues rather than how we solve our internal processes in the House and the That is the last thing we should be arguing about and the first thing we should fix.

2004,topic-id,321,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation, H.4227, the Vehicular Terrorism Prevention  This bipartisan legislation requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to assess the activities the Department is undertaking to combat the threat of vehicular terrorism and submit a strategy to Congress on its findings and recommendations.  Over the past several years, I have been alarmed with the increased frequency that terrorists in Europe and around the world have used vehicles--oftentimes, rental vans or trucks--to commit heinous acts of violence. From Paris to Barcelona and Jerusalem to London, at least 138 people have been killed and countless others injured because of these attacks.  With the October attack in New York City showing that these extremist groups will not hesitate to carry out the same attack on American soil, it is critical that the Department of Homeland Security is doing their due diligence regarding this threat.  Mr.Speaker, this legislation would specifically require DHS to assess the activities the Department is undertaking to support emergency response providers and the private sector to prevent, mitigate, and respond to the threat of vehicular terrorism.  Within 6 months of the bill's enactment, the Department must complete this assessment and submit to Congress a strategy that includes an examination of the current threat of vehicular terrorism, methods to improve information-sharing activities with emergency first responders and the private sector, and training activities the Department can undertake to prevent and prepare to respond to these attacks. The Secretary must also include any additional activities that DHS recommends to address the threat of vehicular terrorism.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, Representative Donovan, and the entire House Homeland Security Committee for their work in advancing this bill to the House floor.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join with me in taking the next step to addressing this dangerous threat by passing H.4227.

This tax plan drains funds from working mothers while giving huge tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy.  Women are breadwinners for half of the American families with children. These women often do more work for less pay.  Nearly six in ten workers in low-wage jobs are women. Women earn 82 cents on the dollar. In Michigan, it is even lower: 74 cents.  The tax plan takes away the individual mandate, so 9.5 million women could lose healthcare--annual exams, birth control, cancer screening, pregnancy support--and lose economic security.  Under this new law, the wealthiest continue to prosper at the expense of hardworking women in this country.

The suffrage movement was the demand and struggle for the right for all women to vote and run for office and was a very important part of the overall women's rights movement.  Faced with constant opposition and threats of violence, women of various social classes, economic classes, and race traveled across the country to make their proclamation loud and clear. They have a voice, and they deserved a vote.  As women fought and marched for their right to be treated as first-class citizens, in addition to their gender, African-American women were also faced with the barriers of racism in While women were united by gender, they remained divided by race. In the march for respect and dignity, Black women were asked to march at the back of the suffrage parade.  Despite being asked to go to the back of the parade, 22 founders of the amazing Delta Sigma Theta sorority marched. This sorority was the only African-American women's organization to participate in the parade.

582,topic-id,1524,"Mr.President, according to Landmine Monitor, which is the world's best source of data on the production, use, export, stockpiling, and clearance of landmines, cluster munitions, and other unexploded ordnance, 2016 was a terrible year for casualties caused by mines and other  In 2016, the Monitor recorded 8,605 casualties, of which at least 2,089 people were fatalities. That is the highest number since 1999, and it includes the most casualties of children ever recorded. Civilians represented 78 percent of recorded casualties in 2016. There are still 61 countries that are known to be contaminated with landmines.  On the positive side, approximately 232,000 landmines were destroyed in 2016, and 66 square miles of land were cleared of mines and other International donors and UXO affected countries increased support in 2016 for UXO clearance programs by $40 million above the previous year to $564.5 million. The United States was, like previous years, by far the largest donor.  It is also encouraging that, since March 1, 1999, when the international treaty banning antipersonnel landmines came into force, 163 countries have joined. That is an extraordinary achievement for a treaty that owes its existence to the vision and perseverance of hundreds of advocacy, human rights, arms control, humanitarian organizations, and journalists, around the world, and the leadership of former Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy; yet despite this progress and substantial declining in the past few years, the number of innocent people maimed and killed by mines has steadily increased.  There are several explanations for this. Rebel groups like ISIS routinely use landmines and other improvised explosive devices. The wars in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen have been largely responsible. It may never be possible to completely eradicate the use of landmines by rebel groups, for the weapon is so cheap to manufacture while causing such harm.  But the major powers that have not joined the treaty--the United States, Russia, China, Pakistan, and India--also share the blame. Antipersonnel landmines, which are designed to be triggered indiscriminately by the victim, whether an unsuspecting farmer or an enemy or friendly combatant, have no place in the arsenals of modern militaries. It is hypocrisy to claim on the one hand, as our military does, that it uses every precaution to avoid harming civilians and prides itself on its precision weapons, and on the other hand to insist on the right to use a weapon that is the antithesis of precise and overwhelmingly harms civilians.  I have spoken more times than I can count about the scourge of antipersonnel landmines and the need for the United States to join the Mine Ban Treaty so we are no longer an excuse for other countries not to join. Our military has not used landmines for more than two decades. In fact, U.policy now strictly limits the use of antipersonnel mines to the Korean Peninsula, but we do not need them. What we need is the best protection for our troops to maneuver safely through minefields. We should have banned these indiscriminate weapons a long time ago, and we would have if landmines were blowing off the arms and legs of children in this Nation the way they are in others, but we have learned that the Pentagon is not in the habit of giving up weapons, even if they are weapons that deserve to be relegated to the dustbin of history. That decision will only be made by a President who is willing to do what is morally right.  Landmines have been aptly described as weapons of mass destruction in slow[[Page S136]]motion. President Trump reacted with anger and disgust, as he should have, when Syria's President Assad used chlorine gas against his own people. He should react the same way toward antipersonnel landmines and set an example for the rest of the world.  I ask unanimous consent that a January 6, 2018, New York Times editorial on this subject be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, 6, 2018]                 Why Do Land Mines Still Kill So Many?                        (By the Editorial Board)       The world is rolling backward, and at a disturbingly faster      pace, in the struggle to limit carnage from land mines and      other booby-trap explosives. The most recent numbers,      covering 2016, are appalling.       Known casualties that year came to 8,605, including 2,089      deaths, according to a new report by Landmine Monitor, a      research arm of the International Campaign to Ban      The toll was nearly 25 percent higher than the 6,967 maimed      and dead counted a year earlier, and more than double the      3,993 in 2014. And these numbers are almost assuredly an      undercount. ``In some states and areas, numerous casualties      go unrecorded,'' Landmine Monitor said.       Much of the 2016 mayhem stemmed from conflicts in      Afghanistan, Libya, Ukraine and Yemen, but people in 56      countries and other areas were killed or wounded by      improvised explosive devices and other ordnance placed by      governments or, more commonly, by insurgent groups. The sheer      indecency of it is self-evident. Nearly 80 percent of the      victims were civilians; children accounted for 42 percent of      civilian casualties in situations where the ages were known.       One subset of the menace, cluster munitions, is singularly      vicious. A single cluster bomb can contain dozens, even      hundreds, of baseball-size bomblets that spray in all      directions, ripping apart anything in their path. All too      often, they fail to detonate right away and thus become time      bombs that imperil unwary civilians who pick them up,      including curious children. Cluster munitions alone caused      971 known casualties in 2016, more than twice the toll of the      previous year, according to Cluster Munition Most      victims were Syrians, nearly all of them civilians, but Saudi      Arabia has also used American-supplied cluster bombs in            Perhaps the saddest part of all this is that for well over      a decade the world seemed to have gotten a grip on what are      referred to generically as the ``explosive remnants of war.''      Thanks to an international treaty that came into force in      1999--now signed by 163 countries and banning the production,      stockpiling and transfer of land mines--casualties declined      steadily worldwide. They reached a low of 3,450 in 2013,      compared with 9,228 in 1999. (A companion treaty outlawing      cluster munitions, joined by 119 countries, went into effect      in 2010.) As the death and injury toll for 2016 shows, nearly      all that hard-won progress has been erased by the brutal      conflicts of recent vintage.       The picture is not irredeemably bleak. The Landmine Monitor      said that 32 donors, led by the United States, contributed      nearly $480 million in 2016 for mine clearance and victim      aid. That was an increase of 22 percent from the year before.      More than 232,000 antipersonnel mines were reportedly      destroyed in 2016, and about 66 square miles--an area nearly      the size of Brooklyn--were cleared of explosive hazards.       The grim reality, though, is that the land mine and cluster      munitions treaties are undercut by the refusal of some of      modern warfare's most powerful players to sign them. Among      those countries are China, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Russia      and Saudi And the United The Pentagon has      long insisted that eliminating cluster bombs could put      soldiers at risk. As for land mines, they are deemed by      Washington to be a useful tool in the demilitarized zone      separating North and South Korea--a first-line defense for      the South against a possible invasion. But given the North's      nuclear buildup, a mined DMZ seems to be a Cold War vestige      of diminished value.       Washington is not immune to international suasion. Land      mines are so stigmatized that American forces have barely      used them since the 1991 Persian Gulf war. The United States      stockpile, estimated at three million mines, is significantly      reduced from pre-treaty years; it's puny compared with the 26      million mines that Russia has on hand, according to the      International Campaign to Ban Similarly, American      reliance on cluster munitions, which peaked in the early      stages of the 2003 Iraq war, has all but disappeared.       In 2014 the Obama administration even signaled it might be      willing to join the anti-mine treaty. Regrettably, that step      never came. It might have been a moral statement encouraging      others to follow suit. Now, with President Trump openly      disdainful of international agreements, the likelihood of      Washington's signing the treaty would seem to be about zero.      The Pentagon, under his ultimate control, recently authorized      the military to restock older cluster munitions, whose      immediate failure rate can be high, leaving bomblets that can      explode and kill civilians even years later.       For countries like Afghanistan, Libya, Ukraine and Yemen,      the risks may endure long after the guns go silent. Vietnam      provides an example. Since the war there ended in 1975, at      least 40,000 Vietnamese are believed to have been killed and      another 60,000 wounded by American land mines, artillery      shells, cluster bombs and other ordnance that failed to      detonate back then. They later exploded when handled by      scrap-metal scavengers and unsuspecting children.       The lesson is stark for today's war-torn countries. They      could reap the same whirlwind in coming decades.

669,topic-id,2482,"Madam President, just last week we began the second session of the 115th We are now safely into 2018, and we should be talking about what we can accomplish for the American people in the new year. We simply face a long list of unfinished business from 2017--last year--and, unfortunately, we have a very short window in which to get it done.  We are 4 months into fiscal year 2018, and we still don't have a budget deal. I am vice chairman of the Appropriations We should have had this done long before now. Our agencies are operating under last year's funding levels. They have little flexibility to handle the problems they face today.  We still haven't reauthorized the Children's Health Insurance Program, what we call CHIP, so that puts the healthcare of 9 million children at risk. These are American children.  Nearly 800,000 Dreamers live under uncertainty and fear of deportation, living in the country they have known most of their lives. I don't know how anybody, Republican or Democrat, could call this acceptable.  Now, I know the Republicans control the House, they control the Senate, and they control the White They are in charge. They have to show responsibility and show leadership on these issues, but instead of addressing these issues, last year the Republican leadership spent time rolling back sensible regulations designed to protect the American consumer, designed to protect our environment, and designed to protect people from harassment in the workplace. They rolled those all back, and then they passed a massive tax cut for big corporations and the wealthiest of  We Democrats have been calling for bipartisan budget talks since June--7 months ago. We have passed three continuing resolutions since September of last year to give us more time to strike a deal on the budget and Dreamers and CHIP and disaster funding. These are just to name a few, but they are enormously important to the people who are experiencing the disasters or who have children who need healthcare or who are Yet, on the 102nd day of the fiscal year, there are only 9 days until the next fiscal cliff, and we don't have a budget deal.  President Trump said months ago that the country could use a good government shutdown. I don't agree with[[Page S120]]him, but I am beginning to think that is exactly what his party is angling for--a manufactured crisis to distract from the fact that they are not doing their job.  The Washington Post seemed to confirm this last December, when it reported the President privately told people that a government shutdown would be good for him politically. In all of my years in the Senate--I have been here under Republican and Democratic Presidents alike--I have never heard such damaging rhetoric come from the President of the United  Nobody wants a government shutdown--nobody. It is devastating to people not only throughout the government but to people throughout the whole country. However, that seems to be what they are vying for.  For months, I have been calling for a bipartisan budget deal that is based on parity--equal increases for defense and nondefense programs--that would provide relief from sequestration. I agree with the Republicans and Democrats who say military readiness has suffered under sequestration but so has our Nation's economy, so has our educational system, so has our infrastructure, and so has our care for our veterans.  If we want to combat the problems caused by sequestration, we have to raise the caps on both sides of the ledger. Fixing one side of the equation will not address the needs of our Nation and, even worse, will actually shortchange our military.  If we don't invest in our economy, if we don't invest in the education of our youth, the military will not have expert, qualified soldiers, the men and women on whom they rely. If we don't invest in our diplomacy, our Nation and the world become less safe. If we don't improve our cyber security defenses and our physical infrastructure, we become soft targets for those who would do us harm, both in this country and outside this country. If we don't care for our veterans, we are not going to have young men and women who are willing to serve.  This week, the majority leader came to the floor making the case for increased defense spending. He asked us to listen to our nonpartisan military leaders about what they think is needed to keep this country safe. I couldn't agree more.  To that end, I have two letters signed by a combined 560 retired admirals, generals, and other former military members. I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record following my remarks.  I have no idea what these admirals', generals', and others' political parties are, but they make the case that we have to increase our investment in domestic priorities--including education and childcare, as well as diplomacy--if we are going to keep our country safe and support our military. Secretary of Defense Mattis said even more bluntly: If we do not fully fund the State Department, we should be prepared to buy more ammunition for our military.  The wisdom of our military leaders notwithstanding, Republicans appear to be dug in. They claim equal increases for both defense and nondefense programs would add too much to our deficit and burden our children. It is one over the other. It is hard to have somebody say that with a straight face in the wake of the President signing a tax bill to add $1.5 trillion to our Nation's debt and to benefit primarily large corporations and the wealthiest You can't make the argument that we can't afford to take care of our domestic needs. It is simply not credible.  Budget negotiations are not the only place where Republicans haven't engaged in a productive way. President Trump's decision to end the DACA Program has put nearly 800,000 Dreamers in this country in an untenable position. The decision was as cruel as it was senseless. It may make a tweet that people look at, but if you are one of those Dreamers and you are on your way to school and are expecting a scholarship to college and you don't know if you are going to be in this country tomorrow, that is not a tweet.  The President should have worked with He should have found a permanent legislative solution while keeping DACA protections in place. I believe he terminated the program under false pretenses, yielding to xenophobic voices in his administration, and last night a Federal judge issued an order that said just that: Terminating DACA was not required under the law--far from it. But a court order that only temporarily halts the administration from dismantling DACA provides little comfort to They live each and every day uncertain of the future and with fear of deportation.  Now, I have heard Members of the Senate trying to decide at what time we are going to finish voting for the week. Their big fear is this: Are we going to make our flight home?  Dreamers have to worry if their flight is going to be out of this country and back to a country they don't even know. They worry if they will have to leave the country they know and love.  Dreamers are Americans in every way, except on paper. They were brought here as children, through no fault of their own. They are law-abiding members of our community. They attend school. They serve as doctors and teachers. They defend our homeland as brave men and women in uniform.  This is a crisis of the President's own making. Now, Congress needs to pick up the pieces. I hope, after the meeting yesterday, we will be allowed to pick up the pieces. We have spent months trying to find a path forward, but you can't find one if the administration keeps moving the goalposts.  We need to address the fate of the Dreamers now. You can take a poll in this country. The American people want us to. Also, look at the broad bipartisan support on display yesterday at the White Republicans and Democrats want to fix the mess that the President created. A solution should be within our grasp.  The White House has made unreasonable demands, such as $18 billion of American tax dollars to build a wall on the southern border, in exchange for The $18 billion wall is last century's solution. It does nothing for this century.  If they really believe Mexico is going to pay for it, I have a solution. Open a bank account and, as Mexico sends us money, then use it to build a wall. Don't ask the American taxpayers, who are strapped at home, to pay for something the President says the Mexicans will pay for. Open an account, find out if they are telling the truth, let the money come into the account, and then build it.  But, worse, don't use the Dreamers as negotiable commodities. They are not commodities. They are human beings. They are people who deserve to have their dreams. Let's pass a bill--we could do it this week--protecting Dreamers now. Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White This is their government.  We have a week and a half before the next continuing resolution expires. We have a lot to do. Let's get serious. Let's get to work. I am willing to work here every day, every night, right through the weekend. Let's get it done. We are not doing it for us. We are doing it for all the American people. Let's do it for all the American people--not for special interests, not for one party. Let's do it for all the American people. It could be done, if we want to.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               Mission: Readiness,                                 Council for a Strong America,                                                     May 30, 2017.       Members of Congress: As retired admirals and generals, we      know from our experience that no matter how much we spend to      build our military and procure the latest and greatest      technology, we will never be a secure nation if we do not      have qualified and skilled men and women to fill the ranks of      our Armed Therefore, investing in education for our      youngest children, which is the foundation of our future      national security, is essential. Accordingly, we urge      Congress to prioritize investments in early childhood      programs, including funding for Head Start, the Child Care      and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), and Preschool      Development Grants in FY18 Labor, Health and Human Services,      Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations       Mission: Readiness is the national security organization of      retired top military leaders that recognize the strength of      our military depends on our people. The stunning fact is that      today, 71 percent of young adults ages 17 to 24 cannot      qualify for military service because they are too poorly      educated, medically or physically unfit, or have a      disqualifying record of crime or drug abuse. if these issues      are not addressed, the Nation risks a shortage of qualified      recruits--one that will leave the country vulnerable for      years to come.[[Page S121]]       Mounting research shows that the early years of life have      an incredible impact on educational attainment, behaviors and      health. High-quality early interventions can help vulnerable      children succeed in school, stay on the right side of the law      and achieve a healthy weight in the long-term. These outcomes      open the doors for many career paths, including military      service.       Long-term studies of early education programs show      impressive differences in children's educational outcomes. A      recent analysis of Head Start outcomes, comparing siblings      who did versus did not attend the program, found participants      showing increased probability of graduating from high school,      attending college, and receiving a postsecondary credential.      High-quality state preschool programs have also demonstrated      lasting effects on students' elementary-school performance.      New Jersey's preschool program, for example, found that      children in the program were three-quarters of a year ahead      in math and two-thirds of a year ahead in literacy in the      fourth and fifth grades.       While Congress faces tough spending choices ahead to secure      and protect our Nation, we know that the backbone of our      military is, and will always be, our women and men in      uniform. As a matter of national security, in order to grow      the pool of eligible recruits, Congress must prioritize      investments in early childhood programs, including funding      for Head Start, the Child Care and Development Block Grant      (CCDBG), and Preschool Development       Signed by a combined 424 retired admirals, generals, and      other former military members.                                  ____                                                February 27, 2017.

Dear Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi, Majority Leader      McConnell, and Minority Leader Schumer: As you and your      colleagues address the federal budget for Fiscal Year 2018,      we write as retired three and four star flag and general      officers from all branches of the armed services to share our      strong conviction that elevating and strengthening diplomacy      and development alongside defense are critical to keeping      America safe.       We know from our service in uniform that many of the crises      our nation faces do not have military solutions alone--from      confronting violent extremist groups like ISIS in the Middle      East and North Africa to preventing pandemics like Ebola and      stabilizing weak and fragile states that can lead to greater      instability. There are 65 million displaced people today, the      most since World War II, with consequences including refugee      flows that are threatening America's strategic allies in      Israel, Jordan, Turkey, and       The State Department, USAID, Millennium Challenge      Corporation, Peace Corps and other development agencies are      critical to preventing conflict and reducing the need to put      our men and women in uniform in harm's way. As Secretary      James Mattis said while Commander of U.Central Command,      ``If you don't fully fund the State Department, then I need      to buy more ammunition.'' The military will lead the fight      against terrorism on the battlefield, but it needs strong      civilian partners in the battle against the drivers of      extremism--lack of opportunity, insecurity, injustice, and      hopelessness.       We recognize that America's strategic investments in      diplomacy and development--like all of U.investments--must      be effective and accountable. Significant reforms have been      undertaken since 9/11, many of which have been embodied in      recent legislation in Congress with strong bipartisan      support--on human trafficking, the rights of women and girls,      trade and energy in Africa, wildlife trafficking, water, food      security, and transparency and accountability.       We urge you to ensure that resources for the International      Affairs Budget keep pace with the growing global threats and      opportunities we face. Now is not the time to retreat.       cc: Secretary of State Rex       cc: Secretary of Defense James       cc: National Security Advisor H.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, 8, 2018]                 It's on Republicans To Stop a Shutdown                          (By Bernie Sanders)       I do not know why President Trump and the Republican      Party--which controls the White House, the Senate and the      House--are so willing to shut down the government. Maybe they      think it will be good for them politically. Maybe they      believe the chaos created by a government shutdown would be a      welcome distraction from the ongoing Russia investigation      being conducted by special counsel Robert Mueller      Whatever the motives of the Republican leadership, one thing      is clear: A government shutdown would be disastrous for the      American people.       A shutdown would harm tens of millions of working-class      families who would be unable to access vital services. It      would disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of federal      employees who would not receive the paychecks they expected.      It would endanger members of the U.military who are      putting their lives on the line defending our nation.       Congress has a responsibility to the American people to      prevent a shutdown and work in a bipartisan manner to reach a      fair budget agreement that addresses the very serious      problems facing the working people of our country.       Unfortunately, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-     Ky.) ratcheted up threats of a government shutdown last week      by insisting on ending the long-standing, bipartisan      agreement over parity for defense and non-defense spending.      This principle of parity is enormously important for working      families and is something that cannot be terminated. If we do      not act, funding for education, child care, health care,      nutrition assistance, affordable housing and other important      domestic programs will be at a 40-year low as a percentage of      our economy.       As the middle class continues to shrink, cuts to non-     defense spending would cause even worse economic pain to      working families, the elderly, children, the sick and the      most vulnerable. Meanwhile, as Trump and the Republicans      demand an unbelievable $100 billion increase in military      spending over the next two years, the Defense Department has      been inoculated from budget cuts over the past several years      because of the Overseas Contingency Operations loophole--a      special account not subject to spending caps established by      Congress in 2011.       Providing parity in these budget negotiations means, among      other things, fully funding--without offsets--the Children's      Health Insurance Program for 9 million kids and community      health centers for 27 million It means increased      funding for the Social Security Administration and the      Veterans Administration so they can provide guaranteed      benefits to seniors and veterans who have earned them. It      means keeping our obligations to more than 1.5 million      workers and retirees who are about to lose a large part of      the pensions they were promised. It means addressing the      crisis of student debt, expanding child care, improving our      crumbling infrastructure in rural America and protecting our      national parks. It means providing help in the national      struggle against opioid and heroin addiction.       Furthermore, as part of the budget negotiations, we must      also provide adequate disaster relief to Texas, Florida,      Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, as well as assistance to      the Western states recovering from terrible wildfires.       Finally, Trump added even more fuel to the fire when he      decided to use 800,000 ``dreamers'' as a bargaining chip for      an $18 billion wall that the overwhelming majority of      Americans do not want. These dreamers are young people who      have lived in this country for almost their entire lives.      They go to school. They work. They serve in the U.     military. The United States is their home; they know no      other. For Trump and the Republican leadership to allow their      legal status to expire, and to subject them to deportation,      would be one of the cruelest acts in modern American history.      It must not be allowed to happen.       This is not just my viewpoint. It's what the American      people want. A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed that      77 percent of the American people, including a large majority      of Republicans, support providing legal protections for the      dreamers. The Republican Congress must act. A clean Dream Act      must be signed into law as part of any budget agreement.       The American people are increasingly disgusted with a      government that protects the interests of the wealthy and the      powerful, while ignoring the needs of the vulnerable. The      U.government must do more than provide huge tax breaks to      billionaires, callously deport young people, greatly expand      military spending, end net neutrality, deny the reality of      climate change and threaten to cut Social Security, Medicare,      Medicaid, education and nutrition programs. We must pass a      budget agreement that addresses the needs of Americans and      not just billionaire campaign contributors.[[Page S122]]    ",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgS113-7.txt,1383,SECURING AMERICAN NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AGAINST TERRORISM ACT OF,2018.0,10.0,March

1051,topic-id,941,"Mr.President, I was just at a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, and we were talking about what continues to happen, over and over again in this country--mass shootings. We are an outlier in this country, as we have far more shooting deaths per capita than any other similar country in the world, and we heard some of the things that make it difficult to attack the problem.  For example, Congress has passed legislation that cripples the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and When ATF is asked to perform a trace on a gun involved in criminal activity, they have to go to a warehouse with stacks of papers to do a physical search of records. They search warehouses that contain the amount of information I can store on an iPhone and find in a matter of seconds. This physical search is something Congress has required them to do.  We heard about the fact that you can buy magazines carrying 15 or 20 rounds, even though many states including my own State of Vermont, limit the number of rounds you can have in your weapon for deer season.  We want to give the deer a chance, but we don't want to give children in school the same chance. This is the world upside down. We limit what you can buy and use to go deer hunting but not what can be sold to people who want to shoot children.  Outside the Capitol right now, there are young students who have brought their powerful message to those of us inside the They say thoughts and prayers are welcome, but what the United States needs right now is action.  I said this morning at the hearing that I am tired of people saying: ``Oh, this is not the time to talk about taking steps. This is the time for prayer and reflection,'' as though it is an either/or thing. It is getting kind of weary to hear that refrain over and over again--this is not the time for action. Tell that to the parents, tell that to the other children, tell that to their siblings when they are at the funeral because somebody shot them.  Now, I am very, very proud of those students in Vermont whose voices are joining this nationwide chorus of student voices. We have Vermonters showing up, even though we have had 10 to 20 inches of snow in some towns in Vermont in the last day or so, and it is still snowing heavily there now. We know that in Washington, half an inch of snow would close the place down but not in my These Vermont students are not going to use a heavy snowstorm as an excuse for not showing up to deliver their message. We are here in comfort in a secure building. We ought to act in solidarity with these students and with the students who put shoes out here on the lawn of the Capitol--rows and rows and rows of shoes--symbolizing children who have died.  Now, I remember a little over a year ago, millions of women across the Nation brought their energy into the halls of government. In my own hometown of Montpelier, VT, where I was born, our State's capitol, there are only 8,500 people. We had 19,000 to 20,000 show up on the statehouse lawn for the women's march there. Brave and strong, they were speaking out. My sister was one of those joining them. In fact, some had to park their cars on the interstate; they caused such a traffic jam just to be there.  I remember the hundreds and hundreds of Vermonters who came here to My wife Marcelle and I hosted them before the march with coffee and doughnuts, and we had to keep sending out for more coffee and more doughnuts because of the number of people there.  We marched with them alongside our daughter and granddaughter. We saw people of all races, all backgrounds, all across the economic and political spectrum marching for women's rights. They made a difference, and now our students are doing the same thing. Our students are acting as a catalyst to break the inertia that has prevented Congress from dealing with the plague of gun violence.  When I was chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, we brought several pieces of gun legislation here, and even those that got 50-plus votes were blocked from going further. There was heavy pressure from powerful lobbyists. The lobby that wasn't heard, though, were the children who were facing this danger. Now they are being heard. Now they are being heard.  The question is, does Congress have the courage to listen? The strength of our democracy is citizen engagement. At a time when it has never been more important to protect and engage in our democracy, I am deeply moved by the students who are making their voices heard today. I think of those students in Florida and elsewhere who faced a horrendous thing that most of us will never see, even if we have been in combat, but they had the courage to go back to school after the shooting. They saw this tragedy, they faced the danger, they saw their classmates and teachers killed, and they still had the courage to go back to school.  Well, I would ask: does Congress have the courage to do something? That is the question they are asking. If we can't answer it positively, then we in Congress have failed these students.

1066,topic-id,2157,"Mr.President, 10 years ago this month, we saw the first domino fall toward the worst financial crisis since the Great Some of our country's largest financial institutions were facing capital and liquidity crises, and it became clear that many of the biggest banks would need a massive injection of capital, in the form of a taxpayer bailout, to prevent what then-Chairman Bernanke called the ``chaotic unwinding'' of financial markets.  The near collapse of the U.financial system had a real and lasting impact on the prosperity of the United States, reaching the pocketbooks and kitchen tables of every American family and the stability of the world's economy across all sectors. We--and I do mean we--you, me and all tax-paying U.citizens footed the bill for the risky and cavalier behavior of our country's biggest banks, allowed largely by a poorly regulated system that brought our economy to its knees. American taxpayer dollars propped up our financial system to prevent its catastrophic failure, an economic collapse that would have wrought even more damage and misery on tens of millions of American households.  The crisis clearly exposed deep flaws in our regulatory system and a serious lack of oversight of the financial sector. It taught us that looking the other way and trusting the system to check and right itself will always result in a race to the bottom in terms of capitalization, risk-taking, transparency, and, too often, casual lending practices.  Big Banks and their executives took on untold and unnecessary risks, hid their financial well-being and, at best, misinformed their investors and, at worst, downright lied. This behavior was supported and left unchecked by a regulatory regime without the oversight to identify and teeth to prevent rampant risk-taking in the name of short-term profit.  We vowed we would never again put American taxpayers on the hook to bail out Big To that end, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, the most sweeping, comprehensive reforms to our financial system since the 1930s. These changes, including new regulations and enforcement mechanisms, were necessary to prevent the recurrence of the systematic profit-driven actions of bad actors throughout our financial system. Dodd-Frank required Big Banks to meet capital requirements, pass stress tests, and make plans for their orderly liquidation in case of failure. All of these requirements were designed to prevent another taxpayer bailout, and they are working. By design, these standards are difficult to meet, but they have not prevented banks from profiting. Big Banks, in fact, are thriving. They continue to protect American taxpayers who are, rightly, wary of the behavior of Big Now is not the time to roll back these protective rules for Big They don't need it. No one except these big hanks will benefit, and it would all be at the risk of future bailouts. Without these standards, we will again see bank executives influenced by compensation packages that favor[[Page S1710]]risky short-term profits over sound investments and loan quantity over quality. If we roll back commonsense oversight of Big Banks, we should expect banks to take advantage of their newfound flexibility and reintroduce risky practices like failing to ensure they are adequately capitalized and mitigating risk.  Like most sweeping reforms, some pieces of the Dodd-Frank Act had unintended consequences. We talk a lot about banks that are too big to fail, but not about banks too small to succeed or perhaps too small to comply with the new regulatory regime. Authority was granted to new and existing agencies to mandate certain regulatory requirements intended to safeguard our financial system. Our small community banks and credit unions have done their best to comply with these one-size-fits-all regulations and rules, often to the great detriment to their businesses, their bottom lines, and their relationships with their community and customers. I have heard from community bankers who, instead of focusing on Vermonters' needs and tailoring their financial services in the honest and professional way that is a hallmark of doing business in a small community, must spend much of their time crossing Ts, dotting Is, and collecting data for fear of the consequences of minor errors. That is not how small community bankers should be spending their time and not how they maintain the flexibility necessary to meet the needs of their communities.  Our community banks and credit unions did not cause the financial crisis; yet they are still paying the price for it, and by extension, the consumers they serve. I am glad that this bill provides some regulatory relief for smaller and community banks. If regulatory relief for community banks and credit unions were its own bill, we would be lining up to support it--or even more likely, pass it by unanimous consent.  But what started out as an effort to help small community banks has been hijacked by Big Banks and their supporters in I am extremely disappointed that this essential relief has been coupled with some very significant changes to regulations on the biggest banks, banks that took hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts. This is the handiwork of savvy lobbyists pushing a deregulatory agenda and hiding it behind relief for our community bankers. They know community banks are the backbone of our communities and that they enjoy the support of their representatives. It is frustrating that we could not consider, debate, and pass a bill that would responsibly allow community banks to better serve and revert to relationship lending in their communities without revisiting these additional oversight measures on Big Banks that our constituents demand and deserve.  All told, this bill will substantially deregulate some 25 of the largest 38 banks and will require fewer stress tests which are effective ways to measure a bank's ability to withstand sudden or prolonged economic downturns. I do not believe this is an appropriate way to relieve our community banks and credit unions, and I am concerned that instead of safeguarding our economy, this legislation will instead open up our taxpayers to even more risk at the hands of bank executives. For these reasons, I cannot support the Big Bank protection act that this bill has become. I am disappointed that instead of passing what we said we wanted--relief for small banks that are being punished for something they did not cause--this bill will roll back the very rules that hold Big Banks accountable and that protect our economy and the American people.  To conclude, I ask unanimous consent that an opinion piece by Vermont Law School Professor Jennifer Taub, which appeared online at CNN.com, be printed in the In it, she discusses the troubling flaws of this proposed legislation. Her words would be instructive to the Senate as we are poised to roll back some of the strongest protections we have against another financial crisis.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        [From CNN, 5, 2018]                Mitch McConnell's Big Gift to the Banks                           (By Jennifer Taub)       This month marks the tenth anniversary of the $29 billion      US government-backed bailout of Bear The collapse of      this giant investment bank in March 2008, under the weight of      its bad mortgage-linked bets, marked the beginning of the      global financial crisis.       To commemorate it, the US Senate plans to deliver a big      gift to the banking sector by removing several safeguards for      American families put in place after the meltdown.       Tin is the traditional tenth wedding anniversary gift. A      bank deregulatory bill on the crisis anniversary is a fitting      present from someone with a tin ear.       Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has announced that      this week the Senate, rather than respond to the plague of      gun violence by considering gun law reforms after the      Parkland shooting, will begin debating the rollback of      financial reforms.       The bill, 2155, would considerably weaken the Dodd-Frank      Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the law      President Barack Obama signed in 2010, which was designed to      tame Wall Street, protect consumers and make our financial      system less fragile.       Lifting the sensible limits imposed by Dodd-Frank would be      a dream come true for the banking sector, but eventually a      nightmare for the rest of us. This bill will hurt homeowners      and allow giant banks once again to take big risks with      taxpayer-backed, FDIC-insured customer deposits.       Who is calling for this bank deregulation? The pressure is      not coming from clamoring constituents. Instead, it is the      bank lobbyists, outside the public eye, who quietly      orchestrated this effort. Acknowledging this provenance, the      growing opposition has dubbed 2155 ``The Bank Lobbyist      Act.''       To pass it, McConnell needs 60 votes, so he will require      more than just his party's support. The bill already has 11      Democratic co-sponsors. Unless the public speaks up, he may      get those votes.       Here's why. The bill's sponsors on both sides of the aisle      are counting on our fading memories. They think we have      forgotten the terrible years after the toxic-mortgaged-backed      meltdown, when many millions of families lost their homes to      foreclosure. The bill's sponsors believe that the pain      previously inflicted upon us by the financial sector is      buried in the past. They are wagering that we have forgotten      both the 1980s Savings and Loan debacle and its repeat      performance in the more recent 2008 global financial crisis.       That is a bad bet. We remember.       We remember that banks and borrowers got into trouble with      unaffordable mortgages. Yet this bill would essentially      encourage banks with up to $10 billion in assets to once      again offer predatory mortgage loans to millions of      borrowers. This includes making mortgage loans to homeowners      based on their ability to pay just an initial ``teaser''      rate, not the fully-amortized rate. This puts borrowers at      risk of losing their homes if they cannot afford the higher      long-term payments. It also puts banks at risk when these      loans default.       As Boston College law professor Patricia McCoy detailed in      the American Banker, Dodd-Frank ``required lenders to first      determine that loan applicants are able to repay before      making them home mortgages. Lenders who fail to make this      assessment can be liable to borrowers.'' Yet the bill      ``permits banks with total assets of up to $10 billion . . .      to make unaffordable mortgages, with no liability to      borrowers, so long as the banks hold the loans on their      books.'' She adds that ``if the bill becomes law, Congress      will excuse over 97% of US banks from having to verify      applicants' income, assets and debts for mortgages they keep      on their books.''       We remember that big banks got taxpayer-funded bailouts.      That is why Dodd-Frank automatically subjects bank holding      companies with more than $50 billion in assets to enhanced      supervision by the Federal Yet, under the Bank      Lobbyist Act, that threshold would be raised to $250 billion.      This is too great a risk. As former Fed lawyer Jeremy Kress      explained in The Hill, raising the threshold to $250 billion      is ``effectively deregulating 25 of the 38 biggest banks in      the United States, accounting for nearly one-sixth of the      assets in the banking sector.'' We remember that in 2008,      several banks with under $250 billion in assets, including      Countrywide, received billions in bailouts during the 2008      crisis. And even before the bailout funding was available,      when IndyMac with just $32 billion in assets went bust, it      cost the FDIC deposit insurance fund about $9 billion.       We remember that regional and community banks can cause a      national meltdown. The bill's proponents are positioning it      as harmless regulatory relief for regional and community      banks. But we remember that during the savings and loan      crisis during the 1980s, risky practices--including poor real      estate loan standards, thin capital, risky assets, and      dependence on short-term funding--led to the collapse of      hundreds of savings banks. The resulting S&L bailout cost      taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. As George      Washington University law professor Art Wilmarth explained in      the American Banker, ``Big regional banks and the largest      money center banks have held highly correlated risk exposures      during every US banking crisis since 1980. Those correlated      exposures resulted from very similar business strategies that      many large banks pursued during the boom leading up to each      crisis.''[[Page S1711]]     Yet this new Senate bill would allow regional and community      banks to avoid prudential supervision, and also engage in      high-risk trading with customer deposits.       We remember the bailout oath of ``never again.'' Upon      signing Dodd-Frank, President Obama vowed we would ``never      again be asked to foot the bill for Wall Street's mistakes,''      but that ``for these new rules to be effective, regulators      will have to be vigilant.'' Yet with President Donald Trump's      appointment of Mick Mulvaney to head the Consumer Financial      Protection Bureau, the deliberate gutting of consumer      protections began.       Now with the ``Bank Lobbyist Act,'' our senators have a      choice. Will they pile on with the Trump Team and pummel the      already weakened financial reform law into submission? Or      will they honor their promises made to the American people      and protect us from a future financial meltdown?       Time will tell. We will remember.

1363,topic-id,467,"Mr.President, for 50 years, the Vermont State Housing Authority, VSHA, has helped make available secure, safe, and affordable housing in my home State of Vermont.[[Page S1785]]Founded in 1968, the Vermont State Housing Authority provides thousands of Vermonters with the resources they need to find housing that works for them. As the first statewide housing authority in the Nation, VSHA was a pioneer in the field, as they built a successful program from the ground up without existing State models or best practices to replicate.  Not only does VSHA help Vermonters of all ages and backgrounds find a home through Federal or State programs, they also provide critical support to those who need it most. The VSHA offers a variety of assistance and resources to the refugee population that has settled in Vermont, including free interpreter services and the promise of a friendly face ready to help navigate a new beginning in an unfamiliar culture. Further, VSHA staff make what can be a frightening transition more tailored, personal, and comfortable--helping new citizens acclimate and assimilate into their new communities.  From connecting families in need with resources from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to developing innovative programs that inspire self-sufficiency and long-term independence, to promoting affordable housing for veterans, VSHA is involved in every community in VSHA, though the Family Self-Sufficiency Program, helps families achieve economic stability and independence. As of the fall of last year, the program has graduated 194 people and has assisted a total of 153 Vermonters in becoming first-time homeowners through the homeownership program. While homeownership is a critical piece of building wealth and a hallmark of the American dream, it is often a far off dream for many families who struggle just to find a stable and affordable place to call home.  As more and more families struggle to make ends meet, especially when affordable units are few and far in between and housing prices continue to rise, the team at VSHA, led by their executive director of more than 30 years, Richard Williams, has worked hard to ensure that we work to meet the needs of our community. Though support for our most vulnerable populations is first and foremost in the minds of the VSHA team, it is clear that civic engagement and involvement plays a large role as well. The VSHA is involved in partnerships with dozens of Vermont nonprofit organizations, State and Federal agencies, and private sector businesses. Through their work rehabilitating and managing buildings, VSHA has revitalized our communities and downtowns one by one.  The Vermont State Housing Authority has made a lasting difference in the lives of Vermonters across our great For that, I thank them. On behalf of all Vermonters, congratulations on 50 years of hard work, dedication, and outstanding commitment to those you serve.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-19-pt1-PgS1784-3.txt,1383,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2018.0,19.0,March
1486,topic-id,420,"Mr.President, late last month, as I watched Olympic Gold Medal winner Jessie Diggins carry our flag in the Pyeongchang closing ceremonies, I was overcome with pride--pride in Vermont and pride in our great country. Throughout the games, athletes raised in Vermont and those who choose to train at Vermont's world-class winter academies and programs showcased the very best of our winter wonderland. Vermont, ranked 49th in population among the States, sent the most athletes per capita to the games. While there, they showcased Vermont values, including respect, personal achievement and excellence, civility and good sportsmanship.  Vermont athletes were also incredibly successful during these games, bringing home three gold medals. Montpelier native Amanda Pelkey and the U.Women's Hockey Team capped a year battling for equal pay and treatment with a gold medal performance, stunning Canada in a thrilling final match. Burke Mountain Academy graduate Mikaela Schiffrin continued her stunning success, bringing home gold in the giant slalom and silver in the alpine combined. Jessie Diggins, from Stratton Mountain School's T2 elite team, lunged across the finish line in an exciting end to the women's cross-country skiing team sprint to grab the gold, the first cross-country gold medal ever for the United  Between the golden moments of triumph, we also saw the grit and determination of Vermont athletes to simply compete at the highest levels of their sport. In the slalom, Ryan Cochran-Siegle demonstrated his ability to overcome injuries and the odds as he enjoyed--and then gracefully ceded--the lead to his fellow athletes. His teammate, UVM alpine racer Tommy Bisemeyer, had the courage to speak honestly about the profound disappointment of suffering a training injury that cut short his second Olympic attempt. Other Vermont Olympians include Sophie Caldwell, cross-country skiing, from Peru; Caroline Claire, freestyle skiing, from Wilmington; Kelly Clark, snowboarding, from West Dover; Emily Dreissigacker, biathlon, from Morrisville; Susan Dunklee, biathalon, from Barton; Lindsey Jacobellis, snowboarding, from Stratton; Nolan Kasper, alpine skiing, from Warren; Devin Logan, freestyle skiing, from West Dover; Kaitlynn Miller, cross-country skiing, from Elmore; Andy Newell, cross-country skiing, from Shaftsbury; Ida Sargent, cross-country skiing, from Craftsbury Common; Emerson Smith, freestyle skiing, from Dover; and Liz Stephen, cross-country skiing, from  We as Vermonters are so proud of each and every Vermonter who went to Pyeongchang to represent the Green Mountain State and our country.

1819,topic-id,638,"Mr.President, it is about time we had a debate, if only for a few hours, on the participation of the U.military in the civil war in Frankly, I cannot comprehend nor am I able to explain to my Vermont constituents the ongoing involvement of U.troops in support of the Saudi-led coalition as it flies U.S.-origin planes and drops U.S.-made bombs--purchased at a discount thanks to American taxpayers--amid continued reports of indiscriminate targeting and horrific civilian casualties.  These are not isolated incidents in They have occurred time after time over the past 3 years. Houses, health clinics, and markets are destroyed, millions of people uprooted from their homes. Whether extreme negligence or intentional and a war crime, the effect is the same for those who are killed, wounded, or displaced. There is no evidence that U.military involvement nor the recurrent appeals of international humanitarian and human rights organizations has improved the situation.  This is not just a matter of the carnage we have observed. It is that we are supporting these military operations at all. Only Congress has the power to declare war, and the ongoing participation of U.forces in the Saudi-led coalition's war against the[[Page S1816]]Houthis in Yemen clearly meets the definition of the ``introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities'' under the War Powers The War Powers Resolution also authorizes Congress to direct the removal of U.forces if their introduction has not been authorized by law, as is the case in the war against the  That is why I support the resolution before us, S.54, which would exercise Congress's prerogative to limit the involvement of U.forces, in this case to the narrow purpose of combatting al-Qaida, which does serve our national security interests in the region. I recognize, as some others have pointed out, that the war in Yemen is part of a larger conflict of interests and ideology between Iran and Saudi If there are other legitimate and compelling national security interests that justify the deployment of U.forces in that region, let us debate them.  We should also be doing more to demand greater transparency and accountability for civilian casualties in Yemen, regardless of the context in which they occur. If the Saudis want U.S.-taxpayer subsidies, they need to focus their efforts on terrorists, take effective steps to minimize civilian casualties, and credibly investigate such casualties when they occur.  I have heard Senators who oppose this resolution say they intend to hold hearings and focus more attention on what is happening in I welcome that, but I have to wonder why it has taken so long and whether anything will change as a result. Yemen has been a humanitarian disaster for years, and there is no end in sight. The Foreign Relations Committee should have held hearings and voted to invoke the War Powers Resolution when the U.military first became involved in  This is not a new crisis, and other than the increasing toll of death and destruction. the facts on the ground have not materially changed. The Saudis have seemingly done nothing to improve the conduct of their air force in  The least we can do is support this sensible resolution to put an end to the unauthorized involvement of the U.military in this civil war, as the War Powers Resolution compels us to do. The alternative is conceding unchecked power to the executive branch to use U.troops in support of any armed conflict, without congressional debate or authorization. That is just what the War Powers Resolution was designed to prevent. It is time to live up to the responsibility entrusted to us in the Only Congress can declare war. If we are unwilling to do so, we have no business asking the men and women of the U.military to risk their lives in Yemen today.

1987,topic-id,573,"Mr.President, today, I am proud to once again join with Senator Collins to introduce the bipartisan Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Senator Collins and I have championed this effort together for years now, and I thank her for her thoughtful and steadfast advocacy and constructive contribution throughout our efforts. Our bill will extend for five years key programs authorized by the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, and expand and improve the programs and services that are vital--and sometimes lifesaving--resources and safe havens for at risk youth in our home states and across the country.  Runaway and homeless youth are significantly more likely to become victims of sexual abuse and trafficking. Our bill ensures that service providers, who are the bedrock of the support system for runaway and homeless youth, have the information, training, and resources they need to identify and serve youth that have been victims of trauma. This includes connecting the youth with appropriate additional services to ensure their physical and mental health and safety.  The bill reauthorizes and expands programs and guidance that help providers reunify youth with their families and loved ones, or, if not possible, provide a tailored and comprehensive support system to help them get back on their feet or on a path to self-sufficiency. The spectrum of support services include emergency and transitional housing--because the first step is having a safe place to stay. They also include training and counseling relating to physical and mental health care, financial literacy, and workforce training. Runaway and Homeless Youth providers are there for the youth every step of the way, supporting them and connecting them to their community and to available resources. Our reauthorization adds completion of the Free Application for Financial Student Aid (FAFSA) form to the available assistance to help youth who wish to pursue advanced educational opportunities realize their goals.  Finally, our bill ensures that no child can be discriminated against in trying to gain access to access services or housing through Runaway and Homeless Youth programs. It is unconscionable to turn away any child in need--gay, straight, black or white. These are our Nation's most vulnerable youth and they must all feel welcome. In many cases, Runaway and Homeless Youth programs can be a last resort. We cannot let one child fall through the cracks in our support system.  In Vermont alone, the Vermont Coalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs served 500 young people in need of housing supports in Fiscal Year 2017. Vermont is the seventh most expensive State to live in for rural areas, and ranks within the top five States for the largest shortfall between housing wage and renter wage. As youth and families struggle to make ends meet in Vermont and across the Nation, these programs and support systems are more important than ever. We must invest the resources to ensure our youth have a safe place to go and the resources they need to become self-sufficient.  Senator Collins and I know just how dangerous and unpredictable the weather can be in the In fact, we are getting hit with yet another nor'easter complete with fresh snow this week. No child in either of our states, or anywhere in the United States, should have to call the street home. The bill we are introducing today will help ensure our nation's children have a safe place to stay and have the support they need to grow, learn, and thrive.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-19-pt1-PgS1792.txt,1383,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2018.0,19.0,March

78,topic-id,1161,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Evans for yielding, for that gracious introduction, but, more importantly, for his magnificent leadership. He has come to Congress hitting the ground running, and it truly has been and is in the spirit of King, so I thank the gentleman very much.  And to our chair, Congressman Cedric Richmond, I want to thank him for his steady leadership--and it is steady--of our caucus and for helping us to stay focused on this Special Order on the evenings which we do these to honor the life of Martin Luther King, Jr., who was and is our drum major for justice.  To Congressman John Lewis, I just have to say to him that I owe him a debt of gratitude. I would not be here if it were not for him.  And I want to say, on behalf of my young people at the Martin Luther King Freedom Center who have a chance to be with him every year--now it has been about 17 years--how much he and Congresswoman Terri Sewell--how much they have touched their lives and have turned their lives around, and how they understand now what fighting for justice and peace really means by being part of their efforts and by their mentoring them and teaching them that the beloved community is not only a dream but can be real. So I thank Congressman Lewis so much. It is an honor to know the gentleman and to serve with him.  This year, as we remember the man in the movement that transformed really the soul of America, it is really important that we honor the fullness of King's dream. So while we remember King's birthday this month, we also are reminded that it was 50 years ago, on April 4, that he lost his life to an assassin's bullet.  King was a crusader for voting rights and peace, but he was also a warrior for economic justice and ending poverty. In fact, one of King's most memorable speeches, of course, ``I've Been to the Mountaintop,'' it was given in Memphis, Tennessee, at a time when King was determined to transform the civil rights movement into an intersectional economic justice revolution.  A few months before his death, two young African-American workers were crushed to death by a faulty truck in The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFSCME, union members went on strike, and King was right there with them lending his support.  In a speech to the sanitation workers on strike, King explained why he was there. He said: ``Now, our struggle is for genuine equality, which means economic equality.'' King said that to thousands gathered at Mason He said: ``For we know that it isn't enough to integrate lunch counters. What does it profit a man to be able to eat at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn't earn enough money to buy a hamburger . . . ?''  King had come to signal the dawn of a new era in the struggle. He was there to stand with workers who were sick and tired of low wages, unsafe working conditions, and the city's refusal to recognize their union. He was there because he believed that labor rights, civil rights, and human rights are one and the same. He was there because he understood the simple truth that there can be no racial justice without economic justice.  Tragically, while fighting to secure the American Dream for all Americans, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Now, that was a day that changed my life. Congresswoman Jackson Lee mentioned where she was. We all remember that moment. I was living in San Jose, California, and was commuting to San Francisco, about an hour away by train. I returned that evening. My car was parked in the train's parking lot. I got off the train, turned on the radio, and the news came through that King had been killed.  Well, I sat in my car for I don't know how long, and I cried. I was shocked like everyone, saddened, and angry. But I was also motivated to fight for the dream that King envisioned. My job, I quit my job. At that moment, I knew that I had to do something. So I became involved as a community worker with Bobby Seale and the Black Panther But it was King's assassination that catapulted me into the movement.[[Page H14]]  I was determined to prove that even though the assassin killed the dreamer, he could not kill the dream. Right now in this country, the work that King went to Memphis to achieve, that work remains unfinished, which is what we intend to complete. Forty-seven million Americans remain locked in poverty. Discrimination and institutional racism continue to hold livable wages hostage, and the economic wealth divide, it grows deeper every day in urban and in rural communities.  Now, I represent the 13th Congressional District of California, a great district where there is an explosion of wealth in the bay area, which has recently experienced also a spike in median household income.                              {time}  2000  It is a hub of innovation and creativity, yet, in many ways, it is a tale of two cities. Black households in my district have been locked out of this explosion of wealth. According to the Census Bureau, the median income in the bay area jumped by 9 percent while the median income for Black households inched up just 2 percent.  It is not just wealth inequality. Twenty-three percent of Black households are poor, and 43 percent of Black children in my district are considered poor in These numbers have remained stagnant year after year after year. This is unacceptable.  It is not just my district that experiences this wealth divide. Recent studies show that if trends persist, median Black household wealth could hit zero by 2053.  This alarming possibility makes one thing clear: the work to achieve King's dream must continue, and members of the Congressional Black Caucus tirelessly continue to work both inside this Congress and in our communities because there is still much that we must overcome.  As the conscience of the Congress, the Congressional Black Caucus fights every day to dismantle barriers that prevent low-income people, poor people, and people of color from having a fair shot at the American King's legacy can be found in our efforts to give communities of color, struggling families, and women a fair shot at improving their basic living standards.  There are many bills: Congressman Bobby Scott's bill to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and Congresswoman Alma Adams' Closing the Meal Gap There are many bills that many members of the Congressional Black Caucus really are championing every single day to ensure that King's life will be remembered, that his death will not overshadow his life, and that his legacy of fighting, as King said, to make the promises of democracy real will live on for generations to come.

700,topic-id,1424,"Mr.President, I rise today to honor the life of a truly remarkable man: Thomas Monson, the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  On Tuesday night, at the age of 90, President Monson was called home by his Heavenly I expect that his reunion with his wife Frances was a joyous occasion, and I am confident that this reunion will provide comfort to his three children and eight grandchildren.  But President Monson's legacy is far greater than his family, even though that was of paramount importance to President Monson and his wife President Monson's legacy also includes the countless men and women whose lives were touched by him, as well as the confident, global church he helped to shepherd, to expand, and to strengthen.  Consider this: In the 54 years Thomas Monson served as an apostle, church membership swelled from 2 million to 16 million. That accomplishment is a blessing from God, but it was realized by saints like President Monson, who devoted their lives to serving Him--in his case, starting at an exceptionally young age.  Thomas Monson was born and raised in Salt Lake City in a large and devoutly faithful family. He attended Utah State He served with honor in the U.Navy Reserve, and he worked for a time in printing, including for the Deseret  By the age of 22, he was the bishop of a ward, a local congregation in Salt Lake City, charged with guiding over 1,000 people in their walks with  By 36 he was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, one of the youngest people ever to receive that special calling.  But Brother Monson did not give in to hubris as a result of those unexpected and, in many cases, early promotions. Quite the opposite, he was humbled by the very heavy mantle that had been placed on his shoulders with each of these callings.  Members of President Monson's ward remember the young bishop as a steady companion to people who were enduring struggles and hardship. There were 80 widows in his ward, and Bishop Monson took the time to visit every single one of them on a regular basis. Also in his ward were 18 servicemen fighting in the Korean war. Every month, he sent letters to those 18 men to remind them that they had not been forgotten, and even decades later, he would speak of these servicemen and widows during the church's General Conference meeting. His love for them could still be felt by those in attendance.  Those stories illustrate the kind of man President Monson truly was. I can testify to this fact through personal anecdotes of my own, including the fact that in 2010, shortly after I had been elected to the U.Senate, President Monson invited me, along with[[Page S38]]my wife Sharon and our three children, to visit with him in his office in Salt Lake He prayed with us, encouraged us, and offered us counsel. As much as anything, we just felt honored that he would take the time to meet with us and show interest in our lives.  This is perhaps the single most consistent thread in President Monson's life. He was someone who at every step of his life, at every stage of his service, was always willing to reach out to others, to visit them even without anyone else expecting it. He was known--famous, in fact--for routinely interrupting his daily routine just to visit someone who happened to be sick, who happened to be in the hospital, who happened to be going through something difficult. President Monson didn't always know the reason why he needed to visit the person in advance; he just knew it needed to be done, and he always did.  There are lessons that we can learn here in the U.Senate about this type of service--this type of service that is selfless, that is eternal in its scope and in its reach, this type of service that blesses the lives of other human beings without any expectation of remuneration. He was a leader who understood how even small, seemingly insignificant acts of kindness could affect people's lives in profound, lasting ways.  He always urged his brothers and sisters within the church and elsewhere to be on the lookout for signs that God was calling them to help. ``Never fail to follow a prompting of the Holy Spirit,'' he would say, and on a regular basis, he did just that. This could mean visiting a relative in the hospital or delivering a meal to a coworker who was mourning a loss or just checking in on a friend he hadn't seen in a while.  For President Monson, it was always about taking time for that personal connection. President Monson knew that little encounters build strong relationships--and strong saints.  In 2008, President Thomas Monson was called to lead the church. He proved to be a good steward of the church in a fast-moving world and in an expanding, growing faith community. Many obituaries have already noted how in 2012 he lowered the age requirement for missionaries, a decision that increased the missionary force in short order from 52,000 to almost 70,000. That is almost 20,000 more young people to spread the Gospel and daily serve in those communities around the world.  But President Monson did far more than that to strengthen the church's commitment to caring for the least in our community. Under his leadership, the church expanded its poverty and disaster relief programs. He even added ``caring for the poor and needy'' to the church's official mission statement.  President Monson lived in Utah almost his entire life, but his heart was with the church spreading throughout the world. During the depths of the Cold War, he helped lead the Latter-day Saints trapped behind the Iron Mormons in the Soviet Union were poor just like everyone else. They didn't have a temple, and their governments forbade them from traveling abroad. As a result, they didn't have access to temple ceremonies that are central to our faith. That didn't sit well with President  As he told his brothers and sisters from the pulpit during a trip to East Germany, he wanted them to share in ``every blessing'' of the faith. So he gave everything he had to help those people, even the shirt off his own back--quite literally. He returned from one trip to the Soviet Union in his house slippers because he had given his spare clothes to the less fortunate, a funny story that brings to mind the words of the Savior: ``[For] I was a stranger, and ye took me in: [I was] naked, and ye clothed me.''  Around that time, President Monson began two decades of quiet diplomacy with the Soviet authorities, including with Erich Honecker himself. His labor reaped a tremendous harvest. In a regime that was hostile to religion and to outsiders, he won approval for Mormon missionaries to come and spread the  In 1985, he won an even bigger triumph when a temple opened behind the Iron Curtain in Freiberg, Ninety thousand East Germans attended the dedication of that temple.  He had followed a prompting of the The result was nothing less than that dramatic, impactful tear in the Iron Curtain, one that had stifled religious belief, but religious belief was facilitated by this noble servant of the Lord Jesus  These are just a few stories from President Monson's life that I have shared, and I would like to conclude with just one more. Not long ago, President Monson was asked what he wanted for his birthday, which was coming up. Here was his simple response:       Do something for someone else on that day to make his or      her life better.

1098,topic-id,1656,"Mr.President, the issue we are confronting today is one that deals with the separation of powers outlined in the U. Our system of government was set up in such a way as to protect the people from the dangers associated with the excessive accumulation of power in the hands of a few. We knew from our experience under British rule that bad things happen, especially at a national level, when too few people exercise too much of the power. Nowhere is this more evident than in the case of the war power. In fact, much of the Revolutionary struggle that led to the creation of our Nation resulted from wartime activities undertaken by a Monarch thousands of miles and an ocean away. It is important today that we remember those same concerns and the constraints placed in our Constitution as we run our government nearly 2\1/2\ centuries later.  I am happy to be here with my colleague, Senator Sanders, to file a discharge motion for our resolution, S.54.  Whether you are present in the Chamber today, physically with us, or whether you are tuning in at home, I hope you will listen closely so that we can fill you in on the unauthorized Middle East war that your government--the government of the United States of America--is supporting and actively participating in as a cobelligerent.  This war in Yemen has killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians--human beings, lest we forget--each one of them possessing innate, immeasurable worth and dignity. This war has created refugees, orphans, widows; it has cost millions of dollars; and, believe it or not, at the end of the day, it actually has, quite arguably, undermined our fight against terrorist threats such as I will expand on these unfortunate facts in a moment, but for now, let's just focus on one thing. Our military's involvement in Yemen has not been authorized by Congress as required by the  Article I, section 8 of the Constitution states that the Congress shall have the power to declare war--Congress, not the President, not the Pentagon, not someone else within the executive branch of government, but Yet in 2015, then-President Obama initiated our military involvement in Yemen and did so without authorization from  The current administration has continued Obama's war. Senator Sanders, Senator Murphy, our cosponsors, and I are now giving Congress a chance to fix this error by debating and voting on our Nation's continued involvement in this unauthorized, illegal war in  If, as our opponents claim, this war is necessary, then surely they can defend that argument before this body and before the House of Representatives and, ultimately, secure authorization from Congress, just as the Constitution demands under article I, section 8. But if, on the other hand, they cannot defend this war and they cannot persuade a majority of the Members of this body and a majority of the Members of the House of Representatives that this is a war that needs to be fought, then it needs to end. Let's have an honest reckoning about this war today.  Before this debate gets underway in earnest, there are a few points that I would like to clarify.  First, let's talk about Iran for just a moment. Yes, the Houthis did fire on a U.Navy vessel. This only reinforces the fact that Yemenis view the United States as a participant in this war, regardless of whether or not Congress wants to acknowledge that participation or approve it, as the Constitution requires. But overall, there are conflicting reports about the extent of Iranian support for the Houthi rebels.  What we do know is this: The Houthis are a regional rebel group that does not itself threaten the United While the Houthis are no friends of ours, neither are they a serious threat to American national security. The longer we fight against them, the more reason we give them to hate America and embrace the opportunists who are our true enemy in the region--And the more we prolong activities that destabilize the region, the longer we harm our own interests in terms of trade and broader regional security.  The bottom line is this: We are spending a great deal of time and treasure to defeat a regional rebel group[[Page S1804]]with no desire to attack the homeland and unclear ties to Iran's influence is much clearer in other parts of the Middle East with other groups--for example, with the murderous terrorist group,  If we want to counter Iran, let's have that debate in Congress and vote to equip this administration with the necessary authorization to use our vast and fearsome military resources to defeat its proxies--not to create new proxies by turning rebel groups against us.  Let's talk about ISIS for a moment. Our resolution would not impede the military's ability to fight terror groups, like ISIS, inside The resolution itself requires the removal of U.forces from hostilities in Yemen, except--except, and I quote--``United States Armed Forces engaged in operations directed at Al Qaeda or associated forces.'' That is a direct quote from the text of the resolution itself. It should put to rest the notion that this would somehow jeopardize our ability to fight terrorists.  The Pentagon and the executive branch have long insisted that they have adequate authority under the authorization for the use of military force enacted in 2001--adequate authority under the 2001 AUMF to fight against  If those at the Pentagon and elsewhere in the executive branch or any of my colleagues now claim that this resolution specifically needs to exempt operations against ISIS, then what are we to make of their previous confidence in the 2001 AUMF? Have they suddenly lost faith in that document overnight or are they merely using this argument as a pretense to oppose our resolution?  I personally believe that the 2001 AUMF has been stretched too far. Our resolution, however, is completely agnostic on this point. It is entirely agnostic about whether counterterror operations against al-Qaida and ISIS can proceed in the wake of the resolution. Our resolution is specific, and our resolution relates specifically to the Nothing in this bill may be interpreted as an  Lastly, with regard to Saudi Arabia and the ongoing visit of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in Washington, DC, at the moment, I have been deeply concerned about our illegal war in Yemen since its inception and have taken steps to end our involvement in that war. I presented questions to our combatant commanders on the topic, just as I have for other unauthorized operations in the past. I had hoped the new administration might take prompt action to end our unauthorized activities in Sadly, that has not occurred.  Last fall, after countless missed opportunities and some broken assurances, my colleagues and I decided it was time to take matters into our own hands. By ``matters,'' I mean those matters that are specifically already in our hands, those matters that are already granted to the Congress and to no other branch of government.  There may be some short-term impact on the U.S.-Saudi relationship, but overall the Crown Prince should understand that this protracted and clearly nonconclusive war only hurts his government's stability and legitimacy. He, too, should want a quick end to this conflict. Saudi Arabia is an indispensable partner in the region, without which the United States would be less successful. But the Saudis themselves are at an inflection point within their own government. Working with the United States should be a goal for the Crown Prince and should be a credibility-lending endeavor.  The resolution before you is the product of years of effort. It was not timed in any way, shape, or form to coincide with the Crown Prince's visit. It was drafted with one thing in mind, which is to make sure that before we put U.blood and treasure on the line, before we put the sons and daughters of the American people who have served in harm's way into an area in which hostilities are ongoing, to get involved in combat capacities in an area where conflict is brewing, we owe it to them, we owe it to their parents, we owe it to their families, and we owe it to ourselves, having taken an oath to uphold, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, to do it the right way--not just because the Constitution requires that but also because of the reasons the Constitution requires that.  It makes sense that when we are doing something that has a greater capacity to impact our government, our standing in the world, our own security, and the lives of those who were sworn to protect us, we do it in the right way, not just through the appropriate branch of government but through the appropriate branch of government in part because that is the only place where an open, honest, public debate can occur.  It is one thing to make a decision somewhere within the military chain of command on whether to undertake a particular action, but this is one of the reasons why, in order to declare war, in order to get us involved in a war in the first place, it requires action by Congress, because this is the branch of the Federal Government most accountable to the people at the most regular intervals.  Over the course of many decades, under the leadership of Congresses and White Houses of every conceivable partisan combination, we have seen a gradual shift of power in a number of areas--including regulatory policy, trade policy, and the exercise of the war power--over to the executive branch of government. When we don't exercise that power, it starts to atrophy; the Constitution means less, and it is less able to protect the American people. That is why this resolution matters. That is why I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Let's do this the right way.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Kennedy).

1101,topic-id,166,"I would certainly agree that the answer is yes in response to that question. It is Congress that gets to decide whether we go to war; it is not the executive branch.  For that very same reason, when we have brought up this resolution calling into question whether we have authorized that war and whether we should continue in the absence of an authorization for that war--if we are asked to table that, that very request amounts to a request for abdication of our constitutional responsibility.  A favorite song of mine called ``Freewill'' by the band Rush came out several decades ago, and it says: ``If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.''  If we choose in this moment to table this resolution, we are making a choice to be willfully blind to the exercise of a power that belongs to us, to allow someone else to exercise it without proper authority.

1103,topic-id,676,"Mr.President, some of our colleagues from time to time may ask us how we would define the term ``hostilities'' and what the United States might be doing that triggers that definition. I welcome that discussion. It is important to note that the U.Code is somewhat vague on that question, defining ``hostilities'' broadly to mean any conflict subject to the laws of war. I don't necessarily view that broad definition as problematic. It is something that allows Congress to assess the unique circumstances in each instance on specific grounds at each point in time.  Our involvement in war and in conflict has greatly changed over the years, and it will continue to change as the nature of international relations changes and as the technology we use in war changes and develops. It doesn't mean we are not involved in hostilities. I welcome further discussion on this matter.  Let's look at the facts of our involvement in Yemen today. Since 2015, U.forces have aided the Saudi coalition with midair refueling and target selection assistance, or, as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in December 2017, our military is helping the Saudis ``make certain [they] hit the right thing.'' In other words, we are helping a foreign power bomb its adversaries in multiple ways. If that doesn't include and amount to and itself constitute hostilities, then such words have lost their meaning.  There are those within the executive branch of government who would define the term ``hostilities'' so narrowly that it would apply only when our armed services personnel are on the ground firing upon or being fired upon by an enemy force. It is understandable in some respects that they would want to define it that way because if they define it that way, that puts the executive in power.  That is one of the reasons we have to remember that there is a natural tension built into our constitutional structure to make sure that not all power is concentrated in any one branch of government. It is one of the reasons Alexander Hamilton pointed out in Federalist 69 that war power would not be exercised by the Executive in our system of government. In this instance, as in many others, the Executive in our system of government would differ from the monarch under the old system, the one that was based in The King had the power to take Great Britain to war. The King didn't have to seek a declaration of war from Parliament; the King could act in and of himself to decide when to take us to war. It is one of the reasons why it matters here.  When we see the definition of ``hostilities'' narrowed to the point that it very often will not exist given the way we engage in hostilities today, given modern technologies that frequently allow us to engage in acts that anyone would have to acknowledge amount to combat, amount to conflict, amount to hostilities, they can still explain it away as something the Executive can do independently of  This resolution will not do anything, according to some, because we are not engaged in hostilities in I am building upon this argument that is based upon a very narrow, cramped, distorted interpretation of the word ``hostilities.''  When people ask what we think the resolution would do if it were to pass--first of all, it is clear that we are engaged in hostilities because when we are involved as a cobelligerent, involved in midair refueling in combat flights, when we are identifying targets for the Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen against the Houthis, those are combat operations, and those are clearly hostilities. But even if we were to suppose that U.activities in Yemen somehow did not constitute hostilities according to the War Powers Resolution, the text of our resolution is crystal clear about what constitutes ``hostilities'' for its purpose; namely, ``aerial targeting assistance, intelligence sharing, and mid-flight aerial refueling.'' Our resolution would end those very specific activities against the Houthis in Yemen--nothing more and nothing less.

1105,topic-id,487,"Mr.President, Senator Sanders mentioned some previous wars and how this may or may not relate to those previous wars. One of the other questions we get from time to time is also a related question: How does this impact or influence operations somewhere else in the world where the United States is engaged? Would the passage of this resolution mean that every other type of operation anywhere else in the world would have to stop too? What about our global counterterrorism activities? We sometimes get those questions.  The main reason we drafted this resolution was to bring our activities in Yemen into line with our laws as expressed in the So if we are fighting unauthorized wars in other places around the globe, then those wars need to be authorized by Congress, or else they would need to end. Importantly, however, this resolution does not itself make law or set precedent for other operations. This resolution applies just to this conflict in Yemen against the Each conflict or operation ought to be evaluated on its own merits and measured against our national interest and any existing authorizations for the use of military force. We can't evaluate this resolution as being something that requires us to swallow the entire elephant at once. This is just focusing on one issue in one part of the world. We need not take any kind of a ``sky is falling'' approach that will say this will immediately jeopardize everything else we are doing in any and every other part of the world.  Global counterterror operations under title 10 or title 50 involve U.action but arise in different ways, and any other activity that we undertake or authority that we cite in introducing our armed service personnel into hostilities cannot serve as a substitute for congressional action as contemplated by the The power to declare war belongs to Congress and not to the Just because government breaks the rules often--and sometimes with impunity--it does not mean it has the right to[[Page S1806]]break the rules, nor does it mean, certainly, that we shouldn't call out rule-breaking when we see it going on, but that is a debate for another day.  The resolution before us today is specific to our activities against the Houthis in It does not authorize or deauthorize military force in any other part of the globe or against any other foe. In fact, the resolution specifies that it does not interfere with existing operations against al-Qaida and its affiliates. Our resolution is narrowly tailored to end our efforts to assist forces that are fighting against the It is deliberately narrow in order to address a black-and-white situation that is clearly not covered by any existing authorization for the use of military force.

1835,topic-id,733,"Mr.President, I stand to urge a ``no'' vote on the motion to table. We are involved as cobelligerents in hostilities in someone else's war--in a civil war in  It is very difficult to dispute the contention that there is no decision made by a government that is more severe, more serious, that carries with it more dire consequences than sending brave young men and women sworn to protect us into harm's way, into battle, into hostilities.  We have been faced with the debate here about what amounts to hostilities. We have the executive branch of government that understandably has defined that term narrowly but in this case so narrowly as to obliterate any meaning behind that word, basically suggesting that we are not in hostilities unless we have people on the ground firing upon an enemy and being fired upon. That is not always the way modern warfare is conducted and hasn't been for some time.  The fact is that we have our uniformed military personnel who are engaged in things like midair refueling on combat missions, refueling the combat aircraft of another country when those combat aircraft are in route to a battlefield, to a theater of warfare. If those aren't hostilities, I don't know what is.  We have been told that we need to do this in regular order. Let's talk about regular order for a minute because, as I mentioned a moment ago, there is nothing more serious than sending our uniformed military personnel into hostilities. We have in this body adopted laws and procedures making it possible for us to receive fast-track consideration of measures that indicate that the executive branch of government has overstepped its power.  We are in our third year involved in this civil war in Yemen--3 years--and yet this hasn't come up for a vote; 3 years and we haven't had anything come out of committee and voted on the Senate floor. Three years ought to be long enough. In fact, the War Powers Resolution gives us expedited consideration. It gives the committee 10 days to consider that. The committee has now had more than twice that time to consider that, and the committee has not put anything out. This is why we are well within our rights, well within the boundaries of what is appropriate, in fact, and well within what the Constitution already grants us, which is the power to declare war. That power, with good reason, was not vested in the executive branch of government. It was vested only in Congress--that branch of government most accountable to the people at the most regular intervals.  The reason this is so important is that before we send our young people into a place where they could die, we want to make sure that an open, honest debate is held in public view, not behind closed doors at the Pentagon or at some other government office building, but right here on the Senate floor and in the House of We cannot exercise that power capably, we cannot claim to be mindful, and we cannot be deemed faithful to our oath to uphold, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States if we don't look out for our authorities and if we don't make sure that someone else isn't exercising authority that was granted to this body. That authority belongs not to any one person; it belongs to the people.  If we refuse to take this vote today, if we choose instead to table this measure rather than to allow it to come up for a vote on the Senate floor, we are choosing not to decide, and we will still have made a choice--a choice to abdicate our responsibility. If we make that decision today, then shame on us. It is our prerogative as a coequal branch of government to make sure that we do our job, to do that which only Congress can do.  This is, in fact, a war. There are, in fact, grave humanitarian concerns presented by that war, and that makes it all the more important, not less important, for us to debate this and for us to discuss this under the light of day, in public, and on the Senate floor.

Louise sat right there. She encouraged us; she supported our agenda, whatever we were doing; and she was a true mentor. I know, on behalf of all of us, we are praying for her family and her constituents tonight, and it feels different without Louise being on this floor.  I am glad to be with my sisters this evening and Congressional Black Caucus member Mr.Evans because this is a moment that we have to kind of pull together in her absence.  Each year, in March, we pause to honor the countless contributions that women have made to this As a Black woman, I am uniquely aware that our stories tend, really, to be lost in the mainstream celebration of Women's History That is why I am glad to be here with my CBC colleagues to declare that, yes, 2018, this is the year of the Black woman.  For generations, Black women have blazed trails throughout this Nation: Madam C.Walker, Mary McLeod Bethune, Ruby Bridges, Audre Lorde, Mae Jemison, and Michelle This list of historical Black girl magic, it could go on. It could go on and on because, in every chapter of American history, Black women have stood up, spoken out, and pushed this Nation closer to freedom and justice and equality for all.  Last year, we saw the clearest indication of the influence that Black women have on our society through the emergence of the Me Too movement against sexual assault and misconduct.  Many don't know this, but the Me Too movement was started by a Black woman 12 years ago to support victims and survivors of sexual violence. Tarana Burke's work and the phrase ``me too'' have revolutionized the way we approach sexual assault in this country. But as has been the case throughout American history, Tarana's story, the story of Black women, is often lost in mainstream coverage of this movement, and what a shame it is.[[Page H1690]]  But, once again, 2018, this is the year of Black women, and thank you for giving us a chance to highlight some of these hidden figures.  Courageous, bold, and brilliant women like Tarana have been fighting for the soul of this country for generations. And despite being locked out of opportunity and left behind in consideration, like our beloved, brilliant, the late Maya Angelou said so wisely: And still we rise.  We rise in the spirit of Black women like Ida Wells, who happens to have been born on July 16, which is my birthday--different year, though, but July 16. She was a revolutionary journalist and crusader for justice who spoke truth to power and exposed the atrocity of lynchings across the country.  We rise with the hope and determination of Black women like my mentor--and Congresswoman Yvette Clarke has so boldly taken up her agenda, and she is standing on her shoulders--Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, the first major party African-American candidate and the first woman candidate who ran for the United States  Miss C., as we called her, broke many barriers while tirelessly advocating for the most vulnerable in our Nation and our world. Mr.Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Clarke for laying her record out.  I have to say, I got to know her very well. I was honored to have coordinated her northern California campaign, and I saw the many obstacles that she overcame as a Black woman in politics.  I happen to have been honored to have been a Shirley Chisholm delegate in Miami at the convention, and I have to just say, you talk about mentors, Congresswoman Chisholm encouraged me, and she was a catalyst for change, and she was unbought and unbossed.  I think Black women today are unbought and unbossed, and we are the catalyst for change, and so I can't help but honor Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm tonight and thank her for her contributions to our country, but also for being so special in my life, because I shared many, many, many moments with her.  So thank you again, and we want to recognize her on this floor.  Mr.Speaker, we also rise with the courage of fearless Black women like Anita Hill, who held her head high and spoke out against sexual harassment despite being humiliated by a committee of White male  I was reminded by Andrea Mitchell last week, on her show, that Congresswoman Slaughter was one of those House Members who marched over there to that committee and held that hearing up for a couple of days.  When we rise, when we stand up together. When we refuse to be silenced, Black women and women can change history.  Because Anita Hill refused to let the abuse she was subjected to dissuade her from working to create a world where other young female professionals wouldn't be made to accept sexual harassment as simply part of the job, a movement was begun because of that.  The movement led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 that allowed employees to sue for damages related to sex discrimination and harassment, and Anita reminded us that it was a Black woman who filed the first sexual harassment lawsuit in the mid-eighties.  Now, this movement led to more women being elected to office, tripling the number of women Senators from two to six; and because of that movement, there are now 22 women Senators and 104 Members of the  Make no mistake, we still have a long way to go to achieve full and lasting equality for Black women in this country. Black women still make only 60 cents for every dollar that White females make. We still have to fight for access to healthcare, and structural sexism continues to stand in the way of Black women being able to fully achieve the American But still we rise.  I am confident that, no matter what obstacles we face, as long as we stand up, speak out, and fight for what is right, we will win--because we are winning.  And let me just say as a Black woman who has been fighting for social justice and equality my entire life, the fight is worth it.  So I am proud to stand here with you tonight in memory of my mother, who was a fearless warrior woman, who taught me never to back down if I thought what I said or what I did was right.

It was 30 some years ago that Marcy Kaptur and I went to Japan, and she had a spark plug made in This is an old one, so it is safe. She took it to Japan because it was impossible to export from the United States a spark plug to They excluded our products completely.  So Marcy and I went over; and everywhere she went, she had a spark plug. People thought it was because she is kind of a spark plug. But, instead, again, it was because of the exclusion of any product made in the U.going to They blocked it out while they had a completely open market. That began a struggle that went on and on and on. Marcy never gave up, and we still haven't given up.

I just say this with deep feeling because of her deep feeling. We spent days and days in Japan and came back and spent days and days, and we pleaded with administrations: let there be reciprocity when there wasn't.  So I am afraid Marcy has done so much that it is forgotten what she was doing some years ago. But she was a pioneer in saying that when it comes to trade, expand it, do so in a way that is reciprocal, and do so in a way that is fair that remembers Main  Secondly, I want to talk about another activity I have been privileged to work on with Marcy There has been reference to her heritage. Marcy never forgot her roots in Ohio, and she never forgot her family's roots overseas--never. Indeed, her deep feelings about democracy--it was in Ukraine that she and I worked on--really reflected the depth of her feeling about democracy and the United States of So together we put together the Ukrainian American Caucus, and she has been the spark plug in that caucus.  I think both activities reflect so much about Marcy Kaptur, her intelligence, combined with her deep feeling. She has never forgotten where she came from, and she has taken that remembrance, that remembering, and essentially took it into action in this place.  So we will talk about Wall Street some other day. But we are here on behalf of so many to tell Congresswoman Kaptur that her career has been so distinguished.  I have a special duty here. She and I are the two people remaining in the class that came in. I think there were 81 of us, and the gentlewoman has never, never failed with the same enthusiasm with which she came. What a tribute that is to the gentlewoman and her character.  I finish with this. Marcy remembered her roots, and also that meant deep feeling about family.

1692,topic-id,482,"Mr.Speaker, students from across the Nation, including from my Ninth District in Michigan, are demanding that their voices be heard on the issue of gun violence. They are upset with the carnage they have witnessed. They are fearful for their safety, and they are tired of excuses and inaction.  But 1 month after the tragedy in Parkland, Florida, not to mention so many prior school shootings, Republican leaders in Congress have failed to bring up any legislation that might meaningfully control the weapons that are being used to kill and wound so many So all of us Democrats are coming here today, many of us. On the Republican side--I am not sure the screen can show--we see empty seats. No bill on assault weapons, no bill on improving background checks, no bill to ban bump stocks, nothing--this is a terrible moment of silence when we desperately need a moment of action.  While there is no single answer to gun violence, any credible response must address the weapons of war that are turning our schools, houses of worship, movie theaters, and concerts into battlefields. Assault weapons with magazines holding 30 bullets are not needed by hunters nor are they required for self-defense. They are killing machines, and increasing numbers of our fellow Americans have become their victims.  Congress must stand up to the NRA and say, ``Enough.'' Even President Trump called out Republican Members of Congress for being too afraid of the NRA to act, saying the NRA has ``great power over you people; they have less power over me.''  But ever since, President Trump has been backtracking, showing he, too, is more scared of the NRA's political muscle than he is of the public's demand for change. This outcome is depressingly familiar.  Fifty years ago, 1 week after Bobby Kennedy was assassinated, I spoke on the issue of gun violence at Wayne State I felt compelled to speak about the myths that the NRA was spreading regarding any effort toward sensible gun control. In my 1968 speech, I said: ``One of the favorite sayings of the NRA and the rest of the gun lobby is that `guns don't kill people; people kill people.' The figures show the inaccuracy of the statement. The truth is that `people with guns kill people.' ''  This remains as true today as it was 50 years ago, and yet we still remain paralyzed by the And what is its solution to gun violence? More guns. More guns in the classroom by arming teachers, more guns on the streets through lax concealed carry laws, and more guns crossing State lines by overriding local laws. In this deranged math, more guns somehow equals less violence.  Grieving parents and terrified students deserve so much better. They are tired of the stonewalling, the diversion, and the deception. They are demanding real action to stop gun violence. Let us act now.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-14-pt1-PgH1551.txt,683,THE HISTORY OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS AND THE LEGACY OF DR.,2018.0,14.0,January
213,topic-id,580,"Mr.Speaker, I agree with Mr.Sensenbrenner for the reasons he has outlined that this bill should not become law. However, I am also speaking in favor of the Amash amendment that has been put in order that would fix the problems that he has so eloquently outlined.  Before 702 was enacted into law, the NSA and the FBI would need to get a probable cause warrant to collect this information. We made a major change that allows this information to be collected when a foreigner is communicating with an American, and when you go to the ``abouts'' collection, which the underlying bill would codify, even when that doesn't occur, when there is merely discussion of a foreigner. That is not what I think our Constitution requires. And we did not outsource to the judicial branch or the executive branch the decision on what the Constitution requires us to do.  Now, we have learned that there is a vast amount of information being collected--we can't go into the details of that in an open session, just that we have been told by Admiral Rogers the scope of this--and that the database that is so-called incidentally collected because of the architecture of the internet could be searched for Americans without a warrant is not consistent with the protections outlined in the Fourth Amendment to the  The Amash amendment, which is basically the USA RIGHTS Act, ends these backdoor searches by requiring a warrant. It ends reverse targeting. It bans the ``abouts'' collection and prohibits the collection of domestic communications, prevents the misuse of information on Americans, and is something that we should support.  Now, in a letter to the Senate in October, a coalition of groups said this:       The USA RIGHTS Act, which is essentially the Amash      amendment, is markedly superior to all current legislative      proposals to reauthorize section 702.  Who said that?  The American Civil Liberties Union and FreedomWorks, the NAACP, but also the Project On Government Oversight, and Color of This is a broad, left-right coalition that has come together, even though there are many things we disagree on, because we agree on one thing: When we took an oath to defend the Constitution on our first day of this session, we didn't take that oath to defend the Constitution when it is convenient or when we feel like it. We took that oath to defend the Constitution every day, in every way, and with every bill. And without the Amash amendment, this bill falls short.  Just a note on where we are in the timing. It is true that this has been delayed, I would say unconscionably delayed, for this proceeding. But we have more time than has been suggested.  Under the existing act, it provides that, if there is an existing order from the FISA court, that order remains in effect even if the underlying bill lapses. We have an order that extends into late So we have a deadline, but it is not this week and it is not next week. We owe it to our constituents and we owe it to our obligation to the Constitution to get this right.  When Jim Sensenbrenner, who is someone whom nobody is going to question his conservative credentials, and when Judge Poe, Zoe Lofgren, and Jerry Nadler come to the same agreement on the Constitution, I would hope that our colleagues would listen.

Mr.Speaker, I have often contemplated what transformed America from an enthusiastic ragtag rabble that had this idea of freedom into the strongest economy, the freest Nation, and the strongest military in the entire world?  The reality of that is the freedom that this government and the rights that were given by God that we protect has given to the American people. When you think about the innovation that has come from America, innovation that has changed the face of the world, most of it came from here because of the freedom that we have.  Now, if you go right down the road here to the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum, you will see a testament to that freedom in that building where two bicycle mechanics from Ohio were able to accomplish to what, for centuries, scientists and engineers couldn't accomplish, because they had the freedom.  We have taught our children in this Nation to dream big. In America, you can accomplish anything that you want to dream. But in the past couple of decades, we have squelched the dreams of these kids because, as we have put out the fire that we tell them they can have in America, we are quenching that fire with wet blankets of bureaucracy and obstacles.  But I want to share with you a story from back home. It was a letter I received from a young man, a 14-year-old, thanking me for the tax reform bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which put more money in the back pocket of his parents.  You see, he had a dream. He dreamed of being a pilot. He wanted to be a pilot. But I can tell you, as a pilot myself, that is a difficult thing to accomplish. Not only is the training difficult, but it can be very expensive.  But he wrote me this letter thanking me. Because of the bonus that his dad received from his company because of the corporate tax cut, and the money that they are going to save because of the individual tax cuts, his parents are using that money to ensure that he gets flight lessons at 14 years old. He is accomplishing a dream because we removed government out of the way.  And one thing, quite frankly, is we need airline pilots. Up here, we start looking at what government programs we can put in or incentives to get people to fly, when all we have got to do is get out of the way and let our children, once again, dream big. That is all that we are doing, is getting us out of way.  When you look at Georgia, the results have been astounding. Even Home Depot, which is headquartered in my district, is investing $50 million to train 20,000 tradespeople to fill the gap.  With this closing, Mr.Speaker, let me bring up that the number of jobs that we have available in this Nation is about equivalent to the number of people we have unemployed. We need to continue to get out of the way.  ",CREC-2018-03-19-pt1-PgH1684.txt,2238,THE HISTORY OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS AND THE LEGACY OF DR.,2018.0,19.0,January

I am an original cosponsor of this bill, Mr.Speaker, not just because it is just one of these bills that you want your name on. It is because I really believe in the concept that right-sizing[[Page H1582]]regulation of our community banks and credit unions is what they need to be able to survive and succeed.  Now, I want to make something clear. The other side has argued that if one bank wants a regulation one way and another one wants a regulation another way, it is almost impossible. It is the regulators that are doing the tailoring. It is the regulators, not the banks, that would tailor the rules. And if the minority side does not trust the regulators enough, they should not have extended all this power to them through Dodd- The truth is, Mr.Speaker, every time I meet with community banks and credit unions in my district, they tell me about the excessive regulatory compliance burdens that this one-size-fits-all regulatory scheme has on them, and they describe it as a death by 1,000 cuts.

1153,topic-id,431,"Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to be here for the second time in as many days to discuss a bill from Mr.Tipton, my friend and our colleague from I commend his dedication to find ways to bring more credit options to more This bill is no exception to that, and I thank him for sponsoring it.  This Nation is founded on the idea that those who enforce the law are not those who ultimately judge those laws.  This idea of due process is something all Americans respect and we enjoy, but in the case of financial institutions, there has been a noted lack of such process during appeals. If a bank or credit union today is assessed a postinspection penalty that they feel is based on inaccurate or incomplete information, the only recourse is back to the regulator that performed the inspection in the first place. Such an argument turns the concept of proper process upside down.  At the very least, I think we would all agree with a number of my colleagues who have noted that the judge, the jury, and the executioner should be separate. There has to be a better way.  This bill provides that better way by giving these institutions a new recourse so they can be assured of fair treatment. We all know this could be an expensive and time-consuming process for a bank or credit union, which is all the more reason to provide fair treatment. Smaller banks and credit unions that go through this appeal process are possibly running the risk of losing an appeal that will severely limit their ability to offer credit.[[Page H1633]]  For that reason, a newer, fairer process will help all Americans by increasing access to credit. I am not pulling that idea out of thin air. The National Bankers Association, which represents minority bankers, supports the legislation. That should tell us how this bill will benefit every American who relies on the financial services and on credit.  Finally, Mr.Tipton's bill does not change the fact that some banks and credit unions will lose their appeals. No one is saying that bad actors should go unpunished. The point of the bill, however, is to make that process as fair as possible. By consolidating the appeals process into one office that is separate from the four main banking regulators, that fairness can be achieved.  Again, Mr.Speaker, this bill not only supports the concept of due process, but it will also expand credit opportunities for all  I again commend the bill and the author, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor.

1313,topic-id,307,"Mr.Speaker, I am pleased today to speak on Mr.Tipton's bill, the TAILOR  But first I would note, as always, in participating in these kind of debates, any time you have a discussion led by Chairman Hensarling and by Ranking Member Waters, it is always an exciting, stimulating debate, and the intensity and the focus is always there.  But, today, we are focused on what I think is a very important piece of legislation because too often we think of financial institutions as the big guys, the truly massive entities. The truth is, however, that institutions that accept deposits from Americans come in all shapes and sizes. Thus, it is important that the regulators consider those many shapes and sizes when requiring compliance. The TAILOR Act would require that consideration by regulators.  My colleagues have already discussed that this provision has passed the House and is supported by the administration, as well as several industry groups. But I will note that for anyone in this body who represents a rural area, I guarantee banks and credit unions in your district are devoting a large portion of their budget to compliance. That is money that could easily go toward providing credit to the many Americans who need it.  Shouldn't the regulators consider the small institutions when forming these regulations?  This bill will free up some ability for those institutions to lend money to typical Americans and local businesses. I know my district would see the benefits of this bill, and I would guess that many districts nationwide would also benefit in the same ways.

1137,topic-id,364,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling for his tireless work in bringing this and so many other commonsense bills to the floor. I also want to thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.Tipton) for his commitment to this issue.  The lack of consistency and quality in the bank examination process has created serious problems for financial institutions and their customers. Mr.Tipton's legislation aims to remedy many of the issues we have heard about from the banks and credit unions in our congressional districts.  H.4545 will allow financial institutions to have supervisory determinations reviewed by a newly established independent examination review board. This will create uniformity among regulatory agencies, while making the overall exam process fair and efficient.  The legislation includes several other key reforms, such as imposition of a reasonable time limit on examiners to provide exam results to institutions. It may seem like a simple request in the bill, a simple provision, but, today, institutions may wait as much as a year or more--in some cases, several years--to get the results of a single exam.  How can you be expected to comply with regulations if the regulators don't get back to you in a timely fashion with their feedback?  I myself spent several years as a bank examiner. The relationship between banker and examiner was a collegial one. Examiners would work with bankers to make sure they understood their rules and address the issues that manifested themselves during the course of the examination. If an institution failed to fix those issues, it then faced appropriate repercussions.  Today's exam environment is completely different. Financial regulators seem to play a constant game of ``gotcha.'' The only recourse for a financial institution is to turn to an appeals process that, quite frankly, has a predetermined outcome.  Mr.Speaker, something has to change.  To be clear, this bill does not prevent regulatory agencies from conducting exams or imposing restrictions on financial institutions. What it does is restore order to the exam process, which, for far too long, has been politicized and abused.  This is an incredibly important measure and one that I hope will receive support from all my colleagues.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for his work.

Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado, Mr.Tipton, for being such a champion for this initiative and others to bring about a more responsible, effective regulatory regime. For years, Members on both sides of the aisle have advocated for a more tailored, commonsense approach to Federal banking regulation. We have all said, time and time again, that rules designed for large institutions shouldn't apply to community banks and smaller credit unions.  We pressed the Federal financial regulators to take into consideration the risk profile and business models of institutions. In their appearances before the Financial Services Committee and in response to congressional letters and calls, the regulators tell us they are tailoring regulations and supervisory requirements based on individual institutions. They tell us what we want to hear, that one size fits all; but, Mr.Speaker, these institutions have yet to see this relief that they really need.  We lose a community bank or a credit union every day in this country. Today we have an opportunity to work together in an effort to change that, to make sure that our constituents continue to have access to the services they need and to achieve financial independence.

Otherwise, they are going to quit; they get tired, frustrated; and they go away.  This is what is happening with our smaller institutions. They are saddled with rules and regulations that are for the larger institutions, yet they have to play that same game and experience the same costs. As a result, they are going out of business at the rate of one a day.  This bipartisan bill is straightforward and one that every Member of this body should be able to support.

Mr.Speaker, I want to start by thanking the gentleman from Maine (Mr.Poliquin) for his work on this very reasonable legislation.  Stress tests are a good idea that should be standard practice in any company. What is not a good idea--and, quite frankly, not terribly helpful in promoting systemic financial stability--is the cryptic and arbitrary manner in which stress tests are handled today.  Today, the Federal Reserve imposes these stress tests on all financial firms with more than $10 billion in consolidated assets. This doesn't apply just to banks, despite the fact that the Fed is a bank regulator. This requirement to submit information extends to nonbank financial firms as well.  Mr.Speaker, let me take a moment to walk you through what one of these stress tests looks like. A financial firm is given cryptic instructions to run a number of scenarios to test the fortitude of the institution. That firm then submits tens of thousands of pages to the In some cases, that number can climb to more than 100,000 pages at a cost of millions of dollars.  Mr.Speaker, to give you an idea of what 20,000 pages is, in our committee hearing, we had a visual aid there with a table about this size right here in front of me today, about 3 feet tall, and boxes all around. That is 20,000 pages. Some of these stress tests, Mr.Speaker, are 100,000 pages, five times that amount, hundreds of thousands--if not millions--of dollars to do these stress tests; and, quite frankly, there is very little evidence that the Fed actually reads all the paperwork. In fact, one day you will probably get a call from the Fed, and they will tell you whether you passed or not. It is a very subjective test. There is no real explanation offered if a firm fails. The message is just to try again and keep trying until you finally pass the test and guess what the model is. This is not a productive exercise for anyone.  The truth of the matter is that the Fed has no business conducting and analyzing stress tests on nonbanks. Those firms have functional regulators, like the SEC and CFTC, which better understand the business models and performance of nonbanks and, as such, the risks those firms pose to the financial stability of the United The actual supervisor of these companies should be the only entity with the ability to require these sorts of activities, and Mr.Poliquin's bill allows for that.

1830,topic-id,954,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to share my deep concern over the Trump administration's approach to North  I thank the Senator from New Jersey, the leader of the Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee, for asking the Members to come out here to speak to the Trump administration's foreign policy.  North Korea is a serious and ever-worsening threat to its people, to our allies and partners in the region, and to the United Unfortunately, the Trump administration has mismanaged our North Korea policy, and the potential consequences of failure are too great to ignore. North Korea may have bent over backward to appear conciliatory during the Winter Olympics and through its offers of talks with South Korea and the United States, but Kim Jong Un has not stopped his dangerous activities--far from it. While the North Korean regime is all smiles and open arms, its malign behavior continues.  Its engineers race to perfect a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korean laborers around the world--modern-day indentured servants--send paychecks home to the regime to help fund its illicit military programs. Illegal ship-to-ship transfers of refined petroleum products continue. North Korea's army of cyber warriors grows more capable, and the Kim regime's thugs make no efforts to scale back rampant human rights abuses.  However, President Trump's approach to date threatens to make an already bad situation even worse. Despite his recent announcement that he would accept a meeting with Kim Jong Un, President Trump has systematically undermined the effectiveness of the very agency--the U.Department of State--he will need to make talks successful. By so doing, he has harmed U.foreign policy right as the United States is poised to embark on a crucial diplomatic effort with North  By firing Rex Tillerson, President Trump threw the State Department further into chaos when what we need right now is more consistency. This is indicative of a President who considers himself to be his own diplomat, negotiator, and strategist. Yet the gutting of the State Department goes much deeper. It has been badly depleted of both staff and resources by the Trump administration and is consistently ignored in the opaque process the White House is using to try to conduct American foreign policy.  President Trump has stifled dissent, ignored experience, politicized key diplomatic and national security agencies. The Special Representative for North Korea Policy, Ambassador Joseph Yun--the lead American negotiator with North Korea--has stepped down. One wonders whether he felt his advice was being heeded. We still don't have a U.Ambassador to South Korea more than a year into the Trump administration. We still don't have a confirmed Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific We still don't have a special envoy for North Korean human rights issues. We no longer have a sanctions coordinator.[[Page S1823]]  Going into talks at the senior-most level with a hollowed-out State Department is no way to peacefully resolve a crisis. To the contrary, it exposes us to greater risk, and as if these vacancies were not enough, it gets worse.  The Trump administration's recently released budget request for fiscal year 2019 would drastically cut State Department funding. The State Department is already alarmingly underresourced and understaffed to handle the significant and increasing threats from North Yet there is no explanation as to why the President believes it is prudent to cut diplomatic resources, especially in the middle of a crisis.  We deserve an answer as to why the administration believes the State Department deserves fewer resources while trying to execute a wide-ranging strategy of diplomatic engagement and pressure. All the while, the White House is subjecting our allies and partners to contradictory statements that cause confusion and dampen the prospects of a peaceful solution.  We hear different thoughts on different days. Before firing him, President Trump routinely undercut Secretary Tillerson and, with it, our diplomatic high ground. Confusing our allies in South Korea and Japan, whose assistance in helping resolve the North Korean crisis is indispensable, only serves to embolden Kim Jong Un, who seeks to drive a wedge between the United States and our allies.  We cannot afford to fail. I am concerned that if these talks do not go well, President Trump will be able to claim he tried both economic pressure and diplomacy, with neither path having solved the problem. He will be left with the conclusion that the only approach remaining will be military force. We must be clear. There is no military solution to the North Korea crisis.  Today marks the 15th anniversary of the U.invasion of Although the current situation we face with North Korea is not identical to the one we faced in the runup to the Iraq war in 2003, the North Korea situation is, in fact, worse, and the consequences are even more severe. Unlike Iraq, North Korea has nearly completed the development of long-range nuclear-armed missiles that will be capable of creating nuclear mushroom clouds in our cities.  We all agree we need to act to ensure that this never happens. The only responsible course of action is for the administration to use all tools of American statecraft to reduce the threats from North We have an obligation to American families, servicemembers, and our allies to say, unequivocally, that we did everything in our power without resorting to armed conflict.  Let's return the United States of America to the forefront of statecraft and allow for our diplomats to advance our interests without having to risk a frivolous loss of life.

I am overjoyed to see members of the community empowering our veterans and I am honored to say that this organization was founded in my home State, in my hometown, by one of my high school classmates, John ``Big Daddy''  John founded the K94Heroes program after connecting with one of our other classmates, an elementary classmate, who specializes in service dog training for veterans. In 2015, John and his daughter established K94Heroes and raised private funds to mitigate training costs.

I am so thankful for the doctors who have led the charge to observe a week dedicated to our Nation's physicians, and especially thanks to Kimberly Jackson is a true pioneer for the medical profession. In June of 2015, she founded the Physicians Working Together organization. This group was created to bring physicians together from a broad spectrum of specialties. Jackson then, just 1 year later, established the last week in March as National Physicians  This year's celebration will include a physician-led virtual conference hosted by the Physicians Working Together group. The conference is available for free and will provide physicians with valuable ways to improve their everyday practice. The virtual sessions will also highlight ways that physicians can take action in policy through advocacy groups and navigate the world of politics. I encourage my friends in the medical industry to tune in.  As an obstetrician/gynecologist, I have had the privilege of building relationships with patients that I will always hold dear to my heart. There is nothing quite like watching a family grow before your eyes and having a hand in their healthy growing.  Although government regulations piled on over the years have continued to make it difficult to build and nurture these relationships, my patients have become no less important nor less of a priority to me. I know this to be the case for many other doctors throughout the  During my time practicing medicine in Great Bend, Kansas, I had the opportunity to work alongside many fellow physicians who practice with a level of care that I want for my own family, physicians who are more than deserving of a week of appreciation. So please take a few moments to show your support for your local physicians.  For more information regarding the conference, I would ask you to check out the National Physicians Week Facebook page, or look at my own social media pages for more ways to spread the word.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-19-pt1-PgH1655-4.txt,2328,SUPPORTING THOSE LIVING WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE,2018.0,19.0,January
1864,topic-id,396,"Mr.Speaker, last night, 406 of my colleagues and I voted to pass the STOP School Violence Act and the Securing Our Schools  As a father of four, when I dropped each of my kids off at Jefferson Elementary School in Great Bend, Kansas, I felt confident that they were going to have a safe place where they could learn and grow; but, today, we have seen time and time again that we need to revisit how we are protecting our children.  The STOP School Violence Act will train students, teachers, faculty, and local law enforcement on ways to identify threats and report them. It goes back to the message we have been relaying for ages: see something, say something.                              {time}  1015  This bill recognizes that sometimes our children and educators often do not have the training to spot some of the warning signs, and that is why it is critical that we provide training so students and personnel can recognize and report threats before they occur.  We also looked at ways to better our reporting process so that, when a threat is made, we have an effective way to log and intervene. To do so, this bill provides funding for States to upgrade their technology and develop an anonymous reporting system through a mobile app, hotline, and website. Not only does it allocate funds for violence, prevention training, and modernize our reporting protocols, it also allocates funds to improve school security equipment.  The STOP School Violence Act, coupled last night with the Securing Our Schools Act, grants funds for schools to install panic buttons and further hardening and protection of our schools. These are steps forward that approach the issue of school safety from several angles, and I am proud to have cosponsored both pieces of legislation.  I want to make sure that my message to everyone back home today is clear. The House of Representatives is listening, and our school grounds should no longer be soft targets. After last night's vote, the STOP School Violence Act and the Securing Our Schools Act joins the Fix NICS Act that has been waiting on a vote from the Senate since last Fix NICS would strengthen background checks and close critical loopholes.  Today I urge my friends in the Senate to pass these bills so that our Nation's schools and children can be safer.

1669,topic-id,511,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the courageous students in Sacramento, California, and across America who are saying enough with this country's epidemic of gun violence.  Last week, I held a gun violence prevention student townhall in my district, and we were fortunate enough to be joined remotely by Skype by two students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida: Adam Alhanti and John They inspired us all with their dedication to a future without a fear of gun violence.  The students that filled the auditorium of Kennedy High School in Sacramento to listen to Adam and John were fully informed, passionate, and focused on the future. They wanted to know how we can enforce stronger background checks, ban assault weapons, change a culture of guns in this country, and how they can amplify their voices.  After hearing their thoughts and questions, I know one thing for sure: these amazing young people are not going to back down from achieving progress on this issue. I believe it would be incumbent upon all of us to listen to their voices. They are the voices of the future.  As Adam from Parkland said during our townhall, this issue of gun violence affects all of us. No one wants to live in fear about going to school, work, the movies, church, a concert, or just walking on the street; so no one can afford to sit on the sidelines and do nothing to reform gun laws in this country. We owe it to these students, to our children, our grandchildren, and all future generations to come together and take action on commonsense legislation.  Many of the things we want to see reformed are largely supported by the American people. In fact, one high school student in Sacramento pointed out to me that policies like universal background checks have widespread support from the public. It is true. Polls indicate that over 90 percent of the American people support stronger background checks.  Under current Federal law, people who purchase firearms at a gun show, through classified ads, or on the internet bypass a background check. There is no excuse not to act to close those dangerous loopholes.  It is our job to represent and act on the will of the citizens of this country. We can by voting on solutions like the bipartisan Thompson-King legislation that would expand and strengthen the current background check system. Yet another week in Congress and here we find ourselves without a vote on real gun violence reform legislation.  At one point during my townhall last Friday, Adam from Parkland said: ``We[[Page H1550]]are heard. There is no more, `Can we be heard?' It is now. People hear us. They ask, `What's next?'''  These young people are rightfully going to keep up their demands until we make significant reforms that make a lasting impact. I ask my Republican colleagues to not only listen to these students, but to also take meaningful action to address the gun violence epidemic in this country. Words are not enough. We must move forward.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-14-pt1-PgH1549-2.txt,1814,SCREENING AND VETTING PASSENGER EXCHANGE ACT OF 2017,2018.0,14.0,January

The President declared, in that meeting, that Republican lawmakers are so scared of the He said that and admitted that the Republican lawmakers are scared of the NRA, but he said that he was not.

But all we know is what the results were.  The results were that, after he had this behind closed doors meeting with NRA, he didn't come out so strong anymore. He started to back down. He started to say--well, he was so strong about, hey, it didn't make sense about 18 to buy a gun, 18 to 21. That was not in his plans anymore. We saw that he had changed his whole demeanor.

That young man is now a Member of Congress and someone whom we admire. He goes by the name of  John He was only 16, 17 years old, and it changed  And I dare say, there are some 16- and 17-year-olds who are outside today who will change America and make it a better place, and we need to join them.

This is a conversation that neither Jeremy's mother nor any mother should need to have. Yet, with 7,000 innocent children killed since Sandy Hook in 2012, it is one that parents across America are forced to have with their children.

696,topic-id,1576,"Mr.President, I rise today as brave citizens in Iran are taking to the streets to exercise their fundamental right to freely express their opinions and protest against their government.  As a democracy founded on core values, including the freedom of speech, equal rights under the law, and basic human dignity, the United States must always stand up for those peacefully advocating for these principles. For decades America has championed these principles, not only because they are right but because they promote our interests. We know that nations whose governments respect human rights and freedom of expression, that uphold the rule of law, and that protect the civil rights and liberties of their people serve as America's most reliable allies, most strategic security relationships, and most prosperous economic partners. Our enduring belief in democratic values compels all of us to stand up, not as Democrats or Republicans but as Americans, and to support citizens around the world courageously protesting the regimes that oppress them.  We stand with those who speak out, and even risk their own lives, to make their voices heard in the struggle against oppression, inequality, and injustice. The fact that today's protests in Iran are against a regime that engages in activity that directly threatens our Nation, our allies, and our security interests is a separate matter.  Iran's leaders may try to blame the protests on outside forces, but in reality this unrest is homegrown. The Iranians marching in Tehran know exactly who is to blame for the hardship, inequality, and oppression they face in their daily lives. It is the regime itself. For those who have closely followed the developments in Iran for years, it is no surprise to learn that the regime continues to disregard the basic rights of its citizens. The regime has proven that it has no moral qualms with forcing the innocent to suffer. Already security forces are responsible for the deaths of more than 20 Iranian protesters. They have detained and imprisoned hundreds of people who are simply speaking their minds.  Of course, these abuses are just one example of the consistently odious behavior we have witnessed from Iran in recent years. This is a regime that has proven that it is more interested in building ballistic missiles than building bridges, that believes money is better spent on terrorist networks in Lebanon and Syria than on schools and hospitals for the Iranian people, that any revenue generated by Iran's international energy deals go directly into the pockets of those fomenting discord in the region and not into the hands of Iranian citizens trying to feed their families, and that will continue to engage in malign activity that isolates it from the community of nations, directly at the expense of the Iranian people. For these reasons and many more, I sincerely hope that the international community lives up to its responsibility to support all those who are protesting this repressive regime.  However, words go only so far. The United States must continue to lead international efforts to counter the Iranian regime's destabilizing behavior overseas. Unfortunately, this administration has yet to take the lead. We hear plenty of bluster from this President, but threatening tweets do not constitute policy nor can they hold Iran culpable. Putting a nation ``on notice'' means nothing if there are no policies put in place. We need a real strategy that addresses Iran's destabilizing activities in the Middle East, whether it is the regime's continued support for terrorist networks, illegal ballistic missile development, or human rights abuses and political interference in other countries.  These threats are what compelled me to work with my colleagues across the[[Page S36]]aisle last year to pass the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act, a bill to hold Iran accountable for its ongoing support for terrorism, ballistic missile proliferation, and human rights abuses. This legislation passed the Senate with an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 98 to 2. Ultimately, it served as the base text of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which addressed a wide range of hostile behavior from not just Iran but from Russia and North Korea as well. This bill calls for the administration to develop a comprehensive regional strategy to deter conventional and asymmetric threats. We are fast approaching the deadline for that strategy.  More importantly, however, we have heard the President say for more than a year that he was going to develop a plan to hold Iran accountable. Thus far, we have seen nothing more than tough talk. The reality is that this administration has yet to fully implement critical provisions of this law that could substantively counter Iran's nefarious behavior. The bill gives the President the authority to target human rights abusers, including those complicit in the ongoing repression of protesters, but he has yet to use that authority. The bill also authorizes the President to go after those individuals and entities that are violating international arms embargoes, exporting hateful ideologies and weapons across the region and fomenting violence and chaos against innocent civilians in Syria and Yemen, but he has yet to go after these actors.  While the administration designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps under terrorism authority--something I applaud--it has not effectively targeted actors associated with the  All of my colleagues know that I was deeply skeptical and strongly opposed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of I voted against the JCPOA precisely because I thought it was a mistake to roll back sanctions on Iran without the total dismantlement of its nuclear infrastructure. However, refusing to certify Iran's compliance with a deeply flawed deal, as the President did in October, does little to address its shortcomings. The President's move in October was a hollow attempt to fulfill a campaign promise while continuing to let Iran enjoy the benefits of the JCPOA and continue its non-nuclear malign activities throughout the region. Furthermore, this decision was carried without a clear path forward and without specific proposals that could have garnered critical international support.  At the end of the day, the Trump administration's actions may have actually left the United States with less leverage to address Iran's far-reaching, nefarious behavior in the Middle East, whether it be its support for terrorism, its human rights abuses, or its illegal ballistic missile development. None of these critical security challenges are addressed simply by not certifying the JCPOA, nor does it move us toward a comprehensive international strategy for the nuclear program Iran plans to resume immediately following this agreement's expiration. In short, the President's own lack of policy has squandered whatever leverage he may have hoped to gain.  Furthermore, the President has severely disadvantaged himself by gutting the very instruments in his national security apparatus that should be taking the lead on Iran and all foreign policy matters. As an architect of the sanctions networks that crippled Iran's economy and forced its leaders to negotiate with the international community, I know how essential our diplomatic arsenal is to confronting  The President, however, seems committed to hollowing out those agencies and offices that are in the best position to advance our diplomatic interests. The Trump administration, for example, has shuttered the office of sanctions policy at the State The Office of Foreign Assets Control at the Treasury Department is now woefully understaffed. As the President publicly talks about supporting democracy, his administration has scrapped funding for human rights and democracy programs and even removed the word ``democracy'' from USAID's mission statement.  Meanwhile, Iran continues to increase its presence in Iraq, to maintain support for the terrorist organization Hezbollah, and to take credit for Bashar al-Assad's murderous grip on power in  The United States must be willing to work with its allies if we are serious about holding Iran accountable. We should be corralling our allies in Europe to begin treating all of Hezbollah's entities as terrorist organizations. We should be moving our allies toward the development of a comprehensive international strategy for addressing Iran's nuclear ambitions once the JCPOA expires.  Finally, this administration must prioritize the release of American citizens unjustly arrested and detained in Today, Princeton University student Xiyue Wang, a scholar from one of the most renowned academic institutions in the world, in my home State of New Jersey, remains in prison under ridiculous charges of espionage. Similarly, Siamak Namazi, a former student of Rutgers University in New Jersey, remains in prison, along with his father, a former UNICEF employee. And Robert Levinson remains missing after more than 10 years.  In short, this President's approach toward Iran thus far has been a disjointed mix of campaign promises, bluster, and confusing signals to our allies--not a serious consideration of how to effectively confront an existing and growing threat.  So, as we approach a legally mandated deadline for the President to present Congress and the American people with a sound policy to confront a real threat, I call on the President to make use of our incredible national security establishment, to consult experts who can help formulate a strong, sound policy capable of confronting Iran's destabilizing behavior in the Middle East, and to implement a strategy that will effectively confront Iran's continued support for international terrorism, its belligerent ballistic missile tests, and its ongoing public and brutal abuses of human rights within its own borders and around the world.

1114,topic-id,1810,"Mr.President, I wish to thank Senators Lee, Sanders, and Murphy, as well as the other cosponsors of the resolution we are debating, for their commitment to elevating this debate in the I agree with my colleagues that this is an important debate with significant implications. As the elected representatives of the American people, we must serve as an effective check on the executive branch, fulfill our commitments to protect the national security interests of the United States, and be responsive to our constituents.  This debate is about how we best leverage the tools in our national security toolbox, including military tools, to protect U.national security. Although the resolution focuses on one particular element of U.policy, limited military support--basically, refueling, intelligence, and advice--to the Saudi coalition, I encourage my colleagues to expand the aperture of this debate so we may call on the administration to assert real leadership, diplomatic heft, and nonmilitary resources to move the conflict in Yemen toward a political tract.  As the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I remind[[Page S1809]]my colleagues that it is this committee that has the jurisdiction over the questions of use of force. I remind my colleagues that it was also under my leadership as chair of this committee that it twice voted on authorizations for the use of military force--once in 2013, in response to the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people, and once in 2014, in response to the rapid rise and spread of the Islamic I remind my colleagues of these two committee votes to underscore my commitment to open debate, my willingness to take tough votes, and my enduring commitment to a robust role for the legislative branch of the U.Government in the use of force and oversight of that force.  Now, I am pleased that Chairman Corker has agreed to hold a public hearing with administration witnesses on the war in Yemen--I think a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is critically important--to look at the U.military support to the Saudi coalition and our overarching U.policy for resolving the war in I appreciate that the chairman has also made a commitment to a markup in the committee in the near future on legislation that deals with the question of Yemen, and I also welcome his commitment to markup an AUMF, or an authorization for the use of military force, in the committee. Those are significant and actually will go a long way toward an informed process about how we deal with this challenge.  In considering S.54, I encourage my colleagues to assess the best way to promote core U.security interests in the Middle East, including pushing back on Iran's aggressive and destabilizing actions across the region, countering terrorism, and ensuring the freedom of navigation. To achieve these goals, our longstanding policy has been to partner with the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council to promote the security and stability of the Arabian  As we consider this resolution, we must fully grasp the situation on the ground and the scope of attacks on one of our traditional security partners. Saudi Arabia has endured Yemeni-originated attacks inside its territory on a scale that no American would accept--ballistic and Scud missile attacks aimed at major Saudi population centers, cross-border attacks by Iran-backed Those are significant.  Now, having said that, I share the concerns, I think, of a majority of my Senate colleagues regarding the conduct of the Saudi-led coalition operations, the unacceptable scale of civilian casualties, the severity of the humanitarian crisis, and the seeming lack of momentum on all sides toward a political tract to negotiate an end to this conflict.  The Saudi coalition bears significant responsibility for the magnitude of human suffering and the scale of destruction in Seventy-five percent of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance, and more than 8 million are on the brink of famine. The conditions have also led to the worst outbreak of cholera in modern history, with an estimated 1 million people suspected to be infected.  While the Houthis bear much responsibility for the violence, the Saudi-led campaign has played a significant role in exacerbating, however, the current humanitarian catastrophe. We must remember that the Houthis overthrew the internationally recognized and lawful government of Yemen and continue the conflict by resisting a political solution. So we ask the Saudis to have a political solution, but we need the Houthis to engage in a political solution as well. We also have to remember that the Houthi insurgency has vastly expanded the opportunities for al-Qaida in the Arabian  At the same time, I worry that withdrawal of limited U.military support to the Saudi coalition will weaken our leadership and our ability to influence a political settlement, improve humanitarian conditions, and could even make the situation worse.  Let us be clear-eyed about who will most benefit from an absence of American power. As it has done in political vacuums throughout the region, Iran will continue to expand its proxy power, and through its Revolutionary Guard, Iran will continue shipping weapons to the Houthis in violation of the arms embargo. With an emboldened Iran as patron, the Houthis will continue their campaign within Yemen and their attacks on Saudi  Meanwhile, other nations in the region will be left questioning the commitment of its long-term security partner, the United In Saudi Arabia's darkest hours, as ballistic missiles are launched at major population centers in Saudi Arabia and Lebanese Hezbollah is on their border training Houthi fighters while Iran continues to transfer lethal equipment, we risk sending a signal to our partners and to our adversaries that the United States is not reliable.  Across the world, from Canada to the United Kingdom, President Trump has damaged our credibility as a reliable partner, even to some of our most stalwart allies. We must push against those concerns and show our allies that the United States upholds its international commitments. Consideration of withdrawal of support for the Saudi coalition must be taken in concert with other ways in which the United States is working to end this war--the totality of U.policy--which I fear is lacking.  The solution, I believe, is to bolster our diplomatic, humanitarian, and political presence to help solve this crisis, to end the human suffering, and to assert practical, concerted leadership. Thus far, the administration's approach has effectively abdicated leadership on the global stage. Thus far, while we have heard senior officials assure us that there is no military solution to this conflict and a political settlement is necessary, this administration is actively dismantling the State Department and antagonizing the United Nations--the two entities that have the potential to play the most critical roles in moving toward a political settlement and addressing the humanitarian crisis.  We have vacancies at the Assistant Secretary of State level for the Middle East and the Ambassador in Riyadh--a failure of leadership.  With this dangerous approach to our diplomatic institutions, we will not be in a position to promote political solutions, and our military, once again, will be called on to do the critical work of diplomacy and development, distracting their attention from other pressing challenges--a failure of leadership.  Regarding a broader diplomatic strategy, the administration has also failed to develop a comprehensive strategy to confront Iran, including holding Iran accountable for continuing to provide missile supplies and lethal training to the  Across land and sea, we know Lebanese Hezbollah operatives are in Yet we have seen no sanctions and no action at the Security Council for this illicit, illegal activity. The administration has not made one designation for Iranian violations of arms embargoes, as directed by the legislation passed here 98 to 2, the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act--again, a failure of leadership.  I expect the administration to articulate and implement a comprehensive strategy for addressing Yemen that includes requisite conditions for continuing to support the Saudi coalition, a strategic push for a political settlement, efforts to alleviate the human suffering, and a comprehensive strategy to decisively push back on Iran's destabilizing actions in This includes tough diplomacy with countries that will continue to facilitate or, at a minimum, fail to push back on Iran's actions.  I will continue pushing the administration to assert critical American diplomatic leadership rooted in the values of democracy, human rights, and human dignity.  Based upon Chairman Corker's commitments to those hearings and future markups and based upon the totality of the situation, I will vote to table the motion to discharge from the committee because I am not ready to either abandon our partners that face an existential threat from Iran run amok in Yemen, but my support is not unconditional, and I will demand responsive actions.  I want to see, as I told the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia earlier today, a renewed commitment and a rapid movement toward a political track by the Saudi coalition. I want to see consistent demonstrations of commitment[[Page S1810]]to humanitarian access and alleviating the humanitarian crisis. I want to see followthrough in pledges of assistance to stabilize and rebuild Yemen by members of the Saudi coalition. I want to see energy and diplomacy from the Trump administration.  This week's visit of Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman is an opportunity to press forward on a path for ending the war and addressing the civilian suffering. That certainly was my message to him. The limited support the United States provides is leverage. Now the Trump administration needs to use it.  In conclusion, I invite my colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to join me in holding the administration to account and pushing the administration to use our leverage to drive this conflict toward a political track.

1824,topic-id,1479,"Mr.President, I come to the floor with a series of my colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the Democratic side to enter into a colloquy about this administration's chaotic and incoherent approach to foreign policy--an approach that has left our allies confused and our adversaries emboldened and undermines the standing of the United States on the global stage.  To be fair, the President's own national security strategy echoes decades of bipartisan recognition that the founding values of the United States--democracy, the rule of law--should continue to drive our foreign policy. Yet the President himself has shown a fundamental disrespect for these very principles: declining to publicly champion the importance of human rights and good governance, refusing to condemn dictators around the world who brutally repress their own citizens, sow instability across the world, or even attack those who attack the United States--something I fear will ultimately weaken our ability to promote the security and prosperity of all  Last week's unceremonious firing of our Nation's top diplomat was the President's latest and brazen example of disrespect for the role of diplomacy, diplomats, and of the State Department itself. While I had my differences with Secretary Tillerson, the reality is, it does not serve the interests of the United States when the President undermines his top diplomat on major foreign policy initiatives, from the crisis in the gulf to, ironically, his outreach to North  Secretary Tillerson's legacy will be shaped not just by the President's misguided efforts but also his own ill-advised attempt to dismantle the State Department, leaving the United States without key voices to advance our interests around the world.  The administration has failed to even nominate critical, high-level positions--Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries--leaving a void of empowered voices. Meanwhile, there are gaping vacancies in some of the world's most troubled regions. For example, as we confront a nuclear-armed North Korea, the President has yet to nominate an ambassador to South Korea, our critical ally on the peninsula--one that has historically relied upon American assurances and allegiance.  Similarly, the President took more than a year to nominate an Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific The impact of these vacancies was on full display last week when the President--without the knowledge of his top diplomat--announced a meeting with North Korean Dictator Kim Jong Un, an assertion that was then ultimately walked back and modified by his Secretary of Defense and his White House Press  In the Middle East, as the President continues to send more and more American troops and we face an emboldened Iranian regime creeping further into Syria, facilitated by the Kremlin's military support, he has yet to appoint Ambassadors to consequential posts, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and Jordan, which has proved a critical partner in our fight against terrorism in the region and in supporting refugees--two essential components of U.policy in the Middle  How can we possibly expect to assert American leadership and secure our interests with these posts unfilled and with no empowered individuals at the Department itself? Under the President's watch, the number of career Ambassadors, which is basically the State[[Page S1819]]Department's equivalent to four-star generals at the Department of Defense, has plummeted by 60 percent. If we were shedding four-star generals this quickly, we would be sounding the alarm of a national security crisis.  We have just one career-level Ambassador left at the State Let me say that again: One career-level Ambassador left, and this administration has seen fit to ship him off to an academic institution rather than to engage him in frontline diplomacy.  We are witnessing a mass exodus of experienced diplomatic and security professionals who have dedicated their lives to this country. This is a forced exodus, and I am deeply alarmed to see reports revealing what we have feared for some time.  We just started to learn about disturbing efforts to purge the Broadcasting Board of Governors and impose a partisan editorial voice on U.international media. Alarmingly, last week, press reports highlighted emails that provided concrete evidence of the administration's efforts to effectively purge the Department of anyone they do not believe would be a purist for the President's vision. Emails showed political leadership describing some civil servants as ``turncoats, leakers, and troublemakers.''  The conversations showed senior political appointees working with outside organizations engaged in vicious smear campaigns against career civil servants and dismissing death threats against some of these same career officials. Diplomats who have served Republican and Democratic Presidents alike, who have spent their careers working to build a more prosperous and secure world so a Commander in Chief would not have to send our sons and daughters into war.  This is Our government functions because of apolitical civil servants across agencies who dedicate their lives to advance the interests of their fellow citizens, from distributing Social Security checks to negotiating nuclear arms treaties. It is outrageous. It is disgraceful. It is dangerous.  We face challenges from every corner of the globe. We simply cannot confront them if we are not present, and we cannot overcome these challenges when the President himself does not acknowledge them.  As China's political leadership consolidates power and as the country expands into the South China Sea and pursues an aggressive economic agenda around the world, the President, for his part, praises these dictatorial moves. Meanwhile, he has failed on his promise to deliver better trade deals.  In Latin America, while the President calls our neighbors to the south drug dealers, criminals, and rapists, China is expanding its economic and cultural presence in our own backyard.  In Mexico, one of our most integral bilateral partners--Mexico is the second largest market for U.goods and services in the world--we will soon lose our Ambassador, as we hear about how the Russian Government is seeking to interfere in their upcoming elections.  When it comes to Russia, again and again, the President's own intelligence officials have made clear that the Russian Government not only meddled in our election in 2016 but continues its interference in the American political system to this day. Yet the President refuses--refuses--to condemn Vladimir Putin or impose congressionally mandated sanctions to hold them accountable for their attack on the United I understand today he congratulated him on his ``election.'' That is not an election. Putin is seeking to be a czar, not to be a  The Russian Government continues its military aggression in the Ukraine and its disinformation campaigns across  In the Middle East, it continues to enable Bashar al-Assad's slaughter of innocent civilians and Iran's efforts to expand its presence and threaten In a brazen move this month, the Kremlin used an unlawful chemical agent to commit murder on British soil, showing how far they will go if they are unchecked.  Beyond these great power threats, we must also confront nonstate actors and new tools designed specifically to destabilize free and democratic societies.  We must demand more information to learn about Cambridge Analytica and the efforts of this organization to exploit private information from social media users across the world to promote particular political agendas.  The only way to confront old and emerging threats is to stand united with our allies. We have spent decades building these alliances based on mutual respect, accountability, and vigorous engagement in the international institutions and security agreements that are essential to promoting peace and security around the world. We ourselves must be a reliable ally and partner. We must speak with an authoritative voice. We must have our national security agencies executing clear, integrated, coherent strategies.  The President himself must champion the fundamental ideas that have made America secure and prosperous: democracy, human rights, free expression--values we champion not because simply they are right but because they are also strategic. We stand for these values because, globally, governments that uphold the rule of law, that respect human rights and freedom of expression, that welcome economic competition--these are the nations that form America's most reliable allies, most prosperous economic partners, and most strategic security relations.  Let me close with this: The American people and the institutions we have built remain resilient. Now more than ever, Congress must exercise its role as a coequal branch of government when it comes to our foreign policy. We need Republicans and Democrats in Congress to uphold our duty to conduct oversight, to ensure that bipartisan values that have guided American foreign policy for decades can be executed by an experienced, empowered, fully funded and fully staffed State  Together, we must ensure that our reputation as a leader of nations is not eroded by a President and an administration that thus far, in my view, far from putting America first, threaten to leave America isolated and behind. That is our challenge. That is our choice. I appreciate my colleagues who join us in this regard.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Hoeven).

351,topic-id,1160,"Mr.President, 100 days is a significant period of time--significant, particularly, because it involves the health of our children, which has been neglected over the last 3 months plus. How is it that this Chamber managed to go more than 3 months and not get in place a permanent expansion or a 5-year expansion of healthcare for our Nation's children?  Well, I can tell you why. It is because my colleagues on the majority side of the aisle here in this Chamber had a different bill that they were immersed in and that was a healthcare bill that would be better termed a health destruction bill because it would have wiped out healthcare for somewhere between 20 and 30 million Americans, and eventually version 5 of that bill died here in the  Then my colleagues across the aisle said: Well, we have another beautiful idea. We are going to do a tax bill that will deliver trillions of dollars to the richest Well, our Constitution was crafted around the vision of government of, by, and for the people, but my colleagues across the aisle like a different version of governance. They like governance by and for the powerful and the privileged.  So here they have this tax bill, and this tax bill has provisions like eliminating the dynasty loophole so wealthy families can pass their dynasty inheritances from one generation to the next without ever paying capital gains. They had a provision that they wanted to change the tax brackets for the wealthiest They wanted to have corporations, which have paid a smaller and smaller and smaller share of the costs of the infrastructure and the healthcare and the education of America, to pay even less. They had a provision where passthrough corporations would get a sweetheart rate. If you add up these provisions, they total over $3 trillion. Now, not all of it goes to the wealthiest 1 percent, but most of it does, and most of it goes to the wealthiest 10 percent.  Let's just take and only count two-thirds of that $2 trillion. Now, let's think about that number. That is a number that we really can't imagine. How many grains of sand are on this beach? You just can't get your hands around that kind of money--$2 trillion to the richest So let's divide it by the number of American men, women, and children in our country, and what do you end up with? You end up with the fact that that bill that[[Page S76]]my colleagues across the aisle were so insistent on passing delivers the equivalent of $6,000 for every man, woman, and child in America to the very richest  This bill was not about delivering benefits to the richest This bill was not about delivering benefits to the privileged. This bill was not about making the powerful more powerful. This bill was about children, and so it got set aside, one day after another after another, and we are at 100 days and counting.  Now, who are these children? These are the children of families who are the working They don't qualify for Medicaid--in Oregon that is the Oregon Health Plan--because they are doing a little bit better than that, but not well enough to afford regular insurance in These are the children of the working poor.  Now, not so long ago, we had a Presidential campaign, and President Trump campaigned on helping working families. But where was President Trump? President Trump was all immersed in the same tax bill for the privileged and the powerful, and he didn't say anything about trying to make this happen for our children of working families.  This bill, by the way, began 21 years ago. This program, the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, was forged in bipartisanship. This bill was the product of Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Orrin Hatch, working together to say that we shouldn't allow children of low-income families to go without healthcare. Why is that? Well, because they knew it profoundly affects the quality of life of that child. We want to invest in those children. We want them to be successful. We want them to have strong futures. We don't want them to go without doctor's visits when they are sick. We don't want them to go without vaccinations and contract terrible illnesses. We don't want them to go without dental care and have their teeth destroyed even before they reach adulthood. No, we are going to take care of those children.  This bill was forged in bipartisanship back when both sides of the aisle seemed to care about the vision of government of, by, and for the people, but that vision has been disappearing. There is probably no better symbol of that than this session and the leadership of this body being obsessed with benefits for the best off while ignoring this bill for our children.  Now, it hasn't been completely ignored. The Finance Committee has acted. There is a bill called the KIDS Act, or the Keep Kids' Insurance Dependable and Secure Once again, Senator Hatch was right in the middle of this, partnering with Senator Wyden from Again, it is bipartisanship at the committee level. They passed it out, and they passed it out unanimously, but we don't see the KIDS Act getting passed here on the floor of the  So let's change course. Let's try to remember that this Nation was founded on the vision of distributed power among the citizens so that it will continue to make decisions by and for the people, not by and for the best off in our society. Let's try to reclaim that vision, and let's start by passing this bipartisan bill, forged in bipartisanship and passed out of the Finance Committee in bipartisanship. Let's get it to the floor, and let's pass it now. Let's not let this 100 days become 105 or 110 or 130. Let's get it passed now.  Now, in the continuing resolution there was a little short patch that said: Well, we are going to make sure the States that are running out of money right now for a couple of months will not go under. This is not the type of bill that we should have for a few weeks or a couple months. Quite frankly, I heard lots of folks on this floor saying that they were so excited about this tax rip-off to give money to the powerful because the powerful need predictability, they need stability, and they need to know what the tax rules are a long time into the future. Well, struggling families would like to have some stability, not have their children be a bargaining chip in some broader vision of securing even more benefits for the powerful at the expense of working  Let's put aside that vision of using our kids as a bargaining chip and pass this bill and get it to the President's desk.

659,topic-id,1787,"Mr.President, here we are at the start of a new year. Last year, the Republican majority decided to dedicate the year to government by and for the powerful and the privileged, but how about this year, 2018? We pay attention to our Constitution, which starts with that vision of government, not for the powerful, not for the rich, not for the privileged, not for the well connected, not for the wealthy but for the people of the United It is a vision where power is distributed, and power comes up from each individual citizen to create policies for their general welfare.  Last year, we saw this complete dedication to trying to wipe out healthcare for 20 million to 30 million Americans in order to provide tax benefits for the richest. How big were those tax benefits? Well, if you add up the provisions that are dedicated to the powerful corporations and those benefits for the wealthiest 10 percent, and most of that goes to the wealthiest 1 percent, those provisions stack up to over $2 trillion--$2 trillion.  It is very hard to get your hands around $2 trillion. Those are not numbers we use in ordinary conversation. Let's take that down to the amount of money per man, woman, and child--per citizen in Well, that is about $6,000--$6,000 taken from the community funds for every man, woman, and child in America to deliver to the wealthiest That was government by the Republican majority in 2017. It was not ``We the People'' but we the powerful and we the privileged.  How about we have a new year's resolution that pays attention to the vision of our Constitution, to that vision of government of, by, and for the people?  Ben Franklin once wrote in his ``Poor Richard's Almanac'':       Be at war with your vices,       At peace with your neighbors,       And let every New Year find you a better man.  Every new year is a chance to recreate and reenvision where we are headed. Certainly, it is a big vice to use this Chamber, in contravention of our Constitution, to pursue policies for the powerful and privileged rather than for the people. So let's set that vice aside and have a bipartisan year, dedicated to making a foundation for families to thrive and jobs and education and healthcare and a healthier planet.  Right now, we should have an immediate new year's checklist of things to get done, and that checklist starts with the budget. We have just 9 days until funding runs out for the Federal Government, and we all know from experience what that means--parks shut down, medical research stops, passports don't get processed, and businesses can't check in on their I-9 applications for employees. That is the type of conduct that happens in banana republics--basically, in countries that don't have a competent system of government. It should not happen in the United States of  We are deep into the financial year, which started on October 1. October passed. November passed. December passed. We are well into January and still the majority leadership of this body is unable to put together a process that addresses just key, fundamental issues. Why is that? Because they were so distracted by delivering trillions of dollars to the richest of Americans and trying to destroy healthcare for millions of Americans that they didn't tend to the fundamentals that need to be tended to. Let's take care of those things now.  The Children's Health Insurance Here we are. It expired on September 30 of last year. Nine million children across America depend on this insurance. This insurance was crafted in a bipartisan manner. It was forged in an agreement between Senator Hatch, a Republican, and Senator Kennedy, a Democrat, who had very different visions of America but who could agree that families who didn't qualify for Medicaid and weren't affluent enough to buy insurance for their children could still have insurance for their children. These are the working poor of America, the struggling workers of  It was forged in a bipartisan manner, but this year my Republican colleagues decided to make these children a bargaining chip for their effort to get more for the privileged and the powerful. That has to end.  When children do not have insurance, they don't get that dental benefit to take care of those cavities. They don't get that medical exam. They don't get those inoculations, those vaccinations. They don't get treatment when they are injured because their parents can't afford to take them to the doctor. They don't get treatment when they are sick for the same reason. Let's take care of children's healthcare.  This is not a partisan issue. It was forged in a bipartisan manner, and it should be so today.  What also expired on September 30 of last year was the legislation authorizing support for our community health clinics. Community health clinics are the front door to healthcare for millions of It is that friendly place in your rural community, in your urban neighborhood, where you can go through the front door and get assistance.  Talking about millions of Americans who go through those front doors, there are more than 1,400 clinics across the country. These are popular in rural areas. They are popular in urban areas. They are popular in red They are popular in blue There is nothing partisan about it, but the leadership of this body has no interest, has seen no urgency in reauthorizing the ability for those health centers to stay open.  In Oregon we saw, as a result of the Affordable Care Act, 30 more health clinics established. We saw a lot more resources go into both mental illness and into drug abuse during a period in which the opioid crisis joined the meth crisis and afflicted both rural and urban areas. Lots of folks come to this floor and say: We have to take on opioids. It is not just on the left-hand side of the aisle, but it is also on the right-hand side of the aisle. People base virtually their entire campaigns on taking on opioids. Yet the Republican leadership says this isn't important. Let me tell you, this is important, and we need to get it done.  Then let's turn to the Dream Dreamers are those children raised in our communities, now 16 through their midtwenties. They are productive members of our communities. They have gone through our high schools or are in high school now. They are in college. They are working. They are contributing. They know no other country than ours.  Across both sides of the aisle we hear folks say: We want to take care of them and establish a structure for this, a legal structure for the  The President yesterday hosted a bipartisan conversation at the White House to say: Let's get this done. He expressed his support. In fact, everyone in the room expressed support for getting this done.  Each one of these--the budget, the children's healthcare, the health centers, the Dream Act--are bipartisan efforts. These are things that should have been addressed long ago if my Republican colleagues instead weren't so[[Page S116]]obsessed with decimating healthcare for millions of Americans and ripping off the National Treasury to deliver benefits to the wealthiest  Let's get this done for our More than 100 a day are losing their status, which means they can no longer legally work in our country.

We certainly saw a powerful punch against our States from the raging forest fires in the West to the hurricanes in the South and Hurricanes have hit Texas and Florida and Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands--massive destruction. Fires have scourged States from Montana to Idaho, to Washington, to Oregon, to Those fires burned well into the winter months of November and  These afflictions hit Democrats and Republicans, red States and blue Why don't we get this done? These are basic, bipartisan, let's-get-it-done agendas. Let's get it done now.  Let's make sure, when we are addressing the impact of those storms in the South and those hurricanes--Harvey, Irma, and Maria--we simultaneously recognize the destructive impact forest fires have had that have been scourging the They have destroyed a lot of the infrastructure in the forest that needs to be replaced. They have affected a lot of communities that need economic help recovering.  Certainly, it made us recognize that we have millions of acres of forests that can become much more fire resilient if they are thinned, if we get rid of the fuel buildup on the floor of the forests. When they become more resilient, they stop the forest fires.  Thinning is a win-win. It produces a steady supply of sawlogs for the mill and stops forest fires when they are raging. There was a forest fire headed right for Sisters, OR, and it hit an area that had been thinned. Guess what. It stopped. The trees were farther apart. The fuels were removed from the floor of the forest.  Now we have created a real fire hazard with our clear-cut strategy of years past--the forestry grows very close together, often replanted. Trees are all the same height. It is very easy for the fire to get into the canopy, and once in the canopy, every tree is touching the next tree. It rages on, and there is no break.  But a natural forest is very different. We can more effectively replicate the fire-resistant nature of a natural forest by thinning these overgrown, second-growth forests. We can then create that supply of saw logs, keep our mills open, keep our people working, and strengthen our economies in rural We can do it by funding this reduction, these thinning programs in acreage that has already gone through the environmental process. In Oregon, we have 1.6 million acres already approved for thinning, if we can pass the funds to get it done.  So let's take this on in 2018. Let's dedicate 2018 to that vision in our Constitution of ``we the people.'' Let's stop passing legislation targeted specifically to help out the richest at the expense of everyone else in Let's turn over a new leaf from campaigns and policies and legislation by and for the privileged and the powerful to honor the vision of our Constitution, the vision of our Nation, a Nation of laws which distributes power that produces policies by and for the people of the United States of America, for making families stronger, for building those foundations of jobs and healthcare and education and a healthy planet.

It places it[[Page S1812]]very clearly here, with article I, Congress is to act, but we have participated very directly, in partnership with Saudi Arabia, in the assault on Yemen, on the Houthis, and the result is a dramatic, dramatic humanitarian crisis. So we should absolutely hold that debate on this floor, as envisioned in our  Article I, section 8 states, unequivocally, that ``the Congress shall have Power . . . to declare War.'' It is only Congress that is given this power under our  If anyone has any doubts, then let's pay attention to the other words of our Founders, James Madison himself: ``In no part of the constitution is more wisdom to be found, than in the clause which confides the question of war or peace to the legislature, and not to the executive department.''  The Founding Fathers' vision was reinforced by the War Powers Resolution of 1973, also often referred to as the War Powers That act was necessary because the executive branch tends to put our forces into conflict without the permission of Congress, in violation of the So it is important to lay out the parameters under which they are allowed to do so under emergency action and the circumstances under which they are not allowed to do so.  The War Powers Act says: ``It is the purpose of this joint resolution to fulfill the intent of the framers of the Constitution of the United States and insure that the collective judgement of both the Congress and the President will apply to the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities.''  It goes on to say that ``the constitutional powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief to introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities . . . is clearly indicated by the circumstances, are exercised only pursuant to (1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United States.''  In the case of the Saudi war we are participating in against the Houthis, it is not triggered by an attack upon the United States, nor is there any specific statutory authorization--that is why we are going to have this debate today--nor is there a declaration of war.  So the standards of the War Powers Resolution have not been met, and I call upon my colleagues to shoulder your constitutional responsibility to have this debate and hold the Executive accountable when they are violating the law of the United States of  There are two components to our presence in Yemen which should not be confused. One is where we are directly involved against forces associated with al-This debate is not about that. The administration contends and we do not dispute today whether that is covered by the 2001 authorization for use of military force.  I think many of us feel that initial 2001 AUMF, authorization for use of military force, has been stretched beyond recognition. That is a debate for a different day. This argument is directly about our support of Saudi Arabia in bombing the Houthis in That is the central question.  For us to understand why this is so important is, one, the integrity of the If we do not hold the Executive accountable to the Constitution of the United States of America, then we are essentially taking that key, critical clause that gave us responsibility for when military force is used by the United States out of the Constitution and delivering it to the That certainly is not the vision. If people want to have that vision, they will introduce a constitutional amendment to that point. Introduce a resolution to declare war to make this action in concert with the Create specific statutory authority in concert with the But do not fail your constitutional responsibility to hold this debate.  The War Powers Resolution lays out clearly that our participation in the support of foreign forces engaged in hostilities is engagement under the vision of our Constitution and certainly under the law of the War Powers It says under section 8:       Authority to introduce United States Armed Forces into      hostilities or into situations wherein involvement in      hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances shall      not be inferred--(1) from any provision of law . . .      including any provision contained in any appropriation Act,      unless such provision specifically authorizes the      introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities.  Again, specific authorization is required.  It goes on. In this section titled ``Interpretation of Joint Resolution,'' it states:       ``[I]ntroduction of United States Armed Forces'' includes      the assignment of member of such armed forces to command,      coordinate, participate in the movement of, or accompany the      regular or irregular military forces of any foreign country .      . . in hostilities.  Clearly, the law states that our engagement, our coordination with a foreign power engaged in war, is covered by this act. Our participation in the movement of their military forces into hostilities is covered by this act.  Therefore, we have to understand the details of our engagement.  First, the United States refueling the Saudi planes as they go to bomb the Houthis is very directly participation in the movement of military forces into engaged hostilities. We are refueling the planes en route. How can that not be participation in the movement? Certainly a plane is a part of a military force. Certainly refueling it is participation in the movement of that plane. Could this be any clearer? This is black and white. Not many things are. In terms of the violation of the War Powers Resolution and the offense against our Constitution, this is black and white.  Second, we provide intelligence.  Third, we provide the weapons.  Fourth, we provide targeting assistance.  Fifth, we established a joint combined planning cell operation center to conduct military and intelligence activities in partnership with Saudi  All of that fits into this direct section of the War Powers Act regarding coordination or participation in the movement of a foreign force engaged in hostilities. If this were a minor involvement--it is not. We have participated thousands of times in this manner. On a daily basis, we are involved in coordination.  The airstrikes Saudi Arabia is conducting have produced one of the worst humanitarian situations in the world. Think about the reports on these different strikes.  There were 3 airstrikes in Sa'dah last month, killing 5 civilians and wounding 14 more, including 4 children, as well as killing the paramedics who were trying to pull the survivors out after the first bomb dropped.  We had a strike on a hotel last August that turned the building's ceiling black with the charred blood of 50 farmers who were in that building.  It is one horrific circumstance after another as these bombs drop on civilians in It is time for us to reckon with the fact of our participation in this carnage. This carnage has resulted in 10,000 Yemeni civilians killed, and there are 8 million people on the brink of starvation. Why is it that humanitarian aid has not gotten to those folks? Because Saudi Arabia has blocked it. We are partnering with a country that is blocking humanitarian aid. Does that square with the principles of the United States of America, to participate in partnership with a country starving 8 million people?  Then we have the fact that the Saudi bombs have been dropping on the infrastructure of Yemen, and they have destroyed the water systems. When you destroy the water systems, the sewage contaminates the fresh water, and a direct consequence of that is cholera. At this moment, the cholera epidemic in Yemen has affected 1 million people. That is the single largest cholera epidemic in the recorded history of mankind.  There are 8 million people starving and 1 million people sick with the worst cholera epidemic ever. We are participating in creating this.  To my colleagues who say Saudi Arabia has partnered with us against ISIS, fine and good, as they should. However, this issue is different. This is about whether we are helping them and participating directly in the hostilities of dropping bombs on civilians, Houthis, and creating a massive famine and a massive cholera epidemic and massive deaths. A lot of children are dying every day.[[Page S1813]]  The Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, warned that this famine could become ``the largest famine the world has seen for many decades, with millions of victims.''  Every day, about 130 children die from hunger and disease. We pride ourselves on going to the assistance in the world when children are being slaughtered or starved or decimated by disease. In this case, we are participating in this carnage. Does any Member of this Senate want to stand up and say that is an appropriate mission for the United States to participate in, this carnage? I certainly hope not.  The death and destruction in Yemen is unimaginable. It is appropriate that we debate on the floor the Sanders-Lee-Murphy resolution, a bipartisan resolution to say: Let's honor the Let's abide by the 1973 War Powers Let's hold the administration accountable because it is not just this issue--although this issue is massive--it is also the standard by which the Executive will operate in every potential war theater around the world for a decade to come.  If we proceed to say that it is OK that you trample the Constitution in Yemen, that you disregard the War Powers Resolution in Yemen, then we will be giving carte blanche to this administration to do so in one nation after another. We have long abdicated our responsibility. Let's abdicate no more. Play the role, the responsibility the Founding Fathers gave us in the Constitution, and bring an end to our participation without authorization in this horrific conflict.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-20-pt1-PgS1801-4.txt,1900,1400,2018.0,20.0,January
1510,topic-id,2137,"Mr.President, I come to the floor tonight to discuss America's role in the crisis in  I have here a picture of the fractured remains of buildings, people fleeing from those buildings, and a small child, probably in her father's arms. This represents the challenge of the bombing that is going on in that nation. I am here tonight to discuss America's role in that bombing and the fact that here in the Chamber we need to debate how it is we have come to the point of supporting this bombing when the War Powers Act clearly says we should not be.  When our Founding Fathers wrote our Constitution, they designated the President as the Commander in Chief, but they gave Congress, the House, and the Senate the sole power to declare war. Article I, section 8 states unequivocally: ``The Congress shall have the power . . . to declare war.''  It is only Congress that can take our Nation from peace to war. If one has any doubt about that, consider the words of James Madison himself, the father of our He said: ``In no part of the constitution is more wisdom to be found, than in the clause which confides the question of war or peace to the legislature, and not to the executive department.''  Now, the clearly stated responsibility in our Constitution was reinforced by the 1973 War Powers Resolution, often referred to as the War Powers That particular piece of legislation stated as its purpose the following: ``It is the purpose of this joint resolution to fulfill the intent of the framers of the Constitution of the United States and insure that the collective judgment of both the Congress and the President will apply to the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities.'' It goes on to say: ``The constitutional powers of the President as Commander-in-chief to introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, are exercised only''--and that is a critical word--``pursuant to (1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United States.''  The picture I showed you showing the fractured remains of buildings and people fleeing that bombing in Yemen, that activity is not taking place subject to a declaration of war by this body--we have done no such thing--nor is there any specific statutory authorization for our assistance in that, nor is there a national emergency created by an attack upon the United States where that is justified.  Tomorrow this Chamber will take up this issue. We will be voting on a resolution put forward by our colleagues Senator Sanders, Senator Lee, and Senator Murphy calling for the removal of our Armed Forces in this role of supporting Saudi Arabia in this war against the  There are two basic components of our presence in Yemen, and those are very distinct and not to be confused. The first is counterterrorism efforts in which we are directly engaged against associated forces of al-This is a role that stems from the authorization for the use of military force that we passed in this Chamber in 2001. Members may come to the floor and argue about whether that initial authorization for use of military force involving al-Qaida in Afghanistan has been stretched beyond recognition. I would argue it has been stretched substantially and perhaps beyond recognition, but that is not the issue we are debating this week.  This week we are addressing the central issue of whether our involvement in supporting Saudi Arabia in its role in war against the Houthis in Yemen has violated our Constitution and the War Powers Act, and we have to confront and face how our assistance is contributing to a vast humanitarian crisis in that country. We may not have boots on the ground in support of the Saudi war against the Houthis, but we are very involved.  As we judge whether this involvement is violating the Constitution and the War Powers Act, we should turn to section 8, the interpretation of the joint resolution. It says:       Authority to introduce United States Armed Forces into      hostilities or into situations wherein involvement in      hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances shall      not be inferred--       (1) from any provision of law . . . including any provision      contained in any appropriation Act, unless--  This is the key--     such provision specifically authorizes the introduction of      the United States Armed Forces into hostilities.  It is very clear. The interpretation of this joint resolution says there is no room here to be participating in hostilities--that is a war--even in a supporting role, unless it has been specifically authorized by This interpretation of the joint resolution section of the War Powers Act goes on to say:       (c) For purposes of this joint resolution, the term      ``introduction of United States Armed Forces'' includes--  You see the language here--     the assignment of member of such armed forces to command,      coordinate, participate in the movement of, or accompany the      regular or irregular military forces of any foreign country      or government when such military forces are engaged.  There is the key fact that was laid out when we passed the War Powers This War Powers Act doesn't just address us directly engaging in hostilities or directly confronting an enemy on the battlefield, it includes these provisions of commanding, coordinating, participating in the movement of, or accompanying military forces of a foreign country.  There is no question that we are coordinating and participating in the movement of the Saudi forces, so let's take a look at exactly how we are involved. The administration comes back and says: Yes, but we are not directly bombing the We are not directly putting boots on the ground and shooting them.  It is clear the War Powers Act includes coordinating with, participating with, supporting, and partnering, if you will, with a foreign country involved in such a war. We are very involved.  First, we are involved by refueling Saudi planes en route to bombing the forces of the Houthis in That is pretty direct involvement, and it goes to that language which says ``participate in the movement of'' those foreign forces. If we are refueling their planes en route to bombing the Houthis, we are participating in the movement of their military forces. A plane, a bomber, is a part of a military force.  Second, we are providing intelligence and thus very directly supporting this war of the  Third, we are selling the weapons to them that they are using in this war on the  Fourth, we are providing targeting assistance. We have even established a[[Page S1784]]joint combined planning cell, an operation center, to conduct military intelligence activities in partnership with Saudi  Here is why this matters so much: It has a huge impact on the lives of the people in It is very possible the planes we refueled are responsible for conducting a series of three airstrikes in Saada last month, killing 5 civilians and wounding 14 more, including 4 children, as well as paramedics trying to pull survivors out of the rubble after that first strike, or that the planes we refueled played a role in striking a hotel last August that turned the building's ceiling black with the charred blood of 50 farmers who were staying in that building. We know that the bombs we have sold to the Saudis are killing many civilians. It is time for us here to reckon with that fact.  A lot of Americans may not even know we are involved in this war. It has not been widely discussed. There are so many things going on across the planet at this time--so much going on in Syria, for example, that perhaps Americans in general are not paying attention. But we should be paying attention because of the carnage that is occurring: 10,000 civilians have been killed since this conflict began. The great, vast bulk of those civilians are dying from air strikes conducted by Saudi Arabia that we are supporting through intelligence and target assistance and refueling. Then there are the consequences of that bombardment. The result is just a tremendous humanitarian crisis.  The Saudis have been involved in blockading the ability to get humanitarian supplies into Yemen--food and medicine and fuel. This has resulted in what the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, has warned could become ``the largest famine the world has seen for many decades.'' Seven million Yemenis are on the verge of starvation because of this war that we are involved in and the related Saudi blockade of food and medicine.  About every day, 130 Yemeni children die from extreme hunger and disease--130 a day. One of the factors that is killing people is cholera. Since October of 2016--so roughly a little less than a year and a half ago--1 million Yemenis have contracted cholera. More than 2,000 have died from it. It is the largest cholera outbreak in recorded history. Let me say that again: 1 million Yemenis have contracted cholera, and it is the largest cholera outbreak in recorded history. So 7 million Yemenis are on the verge of starvation, 1 million have contracted cholera, and so many are dying because of this war we are involved in.  The death and destruction in Yemen is unimaginable, and the United States needs to take a hard look at the role we are playing--a role we are playing in violation of our Constitution and in violation of the War Powers Act of 1973. That is the issue we are going to be discussing here on the floor.  I know there is some popularity in saying: Let's not look at that humanitarian crisis and our role in it; let's just look at the relationship we have with Saudi Arabia and know that they have helped us in other cases--for example, the war on Let's know that they are a good customer for many of our products and for many of our military products. But I say to my colleagues: This issue is bigger than simply a good marketplace or a good relationship with Saudi This goes to our involvement, our culpability in the deaths of thousands of Yemenis and 130 children a day through bombs falling on them, through hunger, starvation, through cholera.  It is hard for me to think about this young child in this picture, this young Yemeni, who clearly is the victim either of cholera or starvation or some other consequence of this conflict. But imagine 130 of these children dying every day.  It is our responsibility to honor the Constitution, and it is our responsibility as humans on this planet to wrestle with the fact that our involvement is contributing to this vast humanitarian disaster. Let us not abdicate our responsibility on the basis of friendship with another nation based on the fact that they are a good market for our products or that we think they may be future partners in some other agenda. We have a direct responsibility in war and peace that we have not fulfilled, and this week, with this coming resolution tomorrow, is a point that we must wrestle with this. Let us wrestle with it and honor the Constitution and give some integrity to the 1973 War Powers  Thank you.  The PRESIDING The majority leader.

1215,topic-id,384,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from West Point, Georgia, and I want to also thank the Georgia and Alabama delegations' Members who, as part of the Tax Truth Squad, have come here tonight to share examples of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on their districts.  The last major tax reform was conducted 31 years ago. I believe many people, many businesspeople and workers, had simply given up on the idea that we would actually achieve what we achieved at the end of last year. In less than three months since the tax reform bill passed, as my colleague said, more than 440 companies have given a pay raise, bonuses, increased 401(k) contributions, or, in the case of utility companies, lowered their rates dramatically. In Michigan, rates will be lowered this year by $400 million.  This number of 440 doesn't even include small mom-and-pop businesses on Main At least 4 million Americans are receiving special tax reform bonuses, announced already this year, in 3 months. The direct bonus announcements have already passed $4 billion. Small-business owners are showing unparalleled confidence in the economy as the optimism index reached record high numbers in February according to the NFIB Small Business Economic Trend Let me say that again: record high numbers, all as a result of what we achieved at the end of the year.  This optimism in economic strength is reflected in data recently released. Last month, the United States economy created 313,000 new jobs.                              {time}  1945  More importantly, 800 million people reentered the labor force who weren't trying to go to work. The unemployment rate remained the same at 4.1 percent, what most people call full employment. Equally important, wage growth over last year increased 2.6 percent; 2.6 percent already in terms of wage growth.  These are good things for Americans, for wage earners; and, as my colleague said, even more importantly, a good thing because they keep money in the pockets of workers and families to make decisions on what to do with their hard-earned money rather than depend on those of us here, frankly, in Congress or, worse, bureaucrats, to spend it for them.

338,topic-id,2039,"Mr.President, I was fortunate enough this week to attend the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual convention in Nashville, where I had the opportunity to headline a discussion of the farm bill, along with my colleague from Kansas on the[[Page S94]]Senate Ag Committee and the gentleman from Texas, Congressman Conaway, who is leading on the House Agriculture Committee, during the President's commodity meeting. The American Farm Bureau hosted other farm groups and commodity organizations from across the country to talk about the next farm bill and to try to bring consensus as to what agriculture is looking for in farm policy.  In my opportunity to visit with people at the Farm Bureau's annual meeting, in my remarks, I paid particular attention to the farm bill. It is a farm safety net. When we talk about a farm bill, I suppose we ought to highlight that only a small portion of the farm bill is actually related to farm programs. There are a number of titles to the farm bill, and most of the money in a farm bill is spent on nutrition programs and mostly SNAP, but there are other important components of a farm bill--rural development and conservation. In addition to that topic, which I have been on the Senate floor speaking about before, are food aid and support for those who are experiencing famine around the globe. My opportunity to be with farmers and ranchers from across the country gave me an opportunity to not only speak about my views as to what a farm bill should contain but, more importantly, for me to hear what they had to say that was important to them.  Farm Bureau members from across the country made it clear to me, first of all, that they would like to see Congress--Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate--and the administration work together in a bipartisan fashion to get a farm bill done and, prior to that, to get a disaster relief bill completed, which I hope we will do yet this month on the Senate floor--both the disaster bill that needs to get to the President's desk as soon as possible and also a farm bill that needs to be completed in a timely fashion. The current farm bill under which we are operating expires in 2018.  Of the things I want to highlight that I heard from Farm Bureau members while I was there is certainly the importance of crop insurance and the value it provides, particularly for those of us who live and farm and work in places where the weather is not often our friend, as well as just the challenges the current farm bill is creating in  Particularly, the safety net programs PLC and ARC don't work as well as they should or could. Part of that has to do with timeliness, and part is the inability and the difficulty in farmers having to choose between two programs and to predict for a long period--the life of the farm bill--which makes the most sense to them economically. Whether they are going to have high prices, low prices, good weather, or bad weather is a hard thing to know in the life of a farm bill. Again, because of the issues we have with the current farm bill, timeliness is important because those provisions that are less than satisfactory today will be extended if we aren't successful in completing a farm bill this year.  While the topic of conversation generally revolved around the farm bill, I want to indicate to my colleagues that so much of what I heard was about trade, particularly about The reality is, 98 to 99 percent of the mouths to feed are outside of the United Farmers and ranchers earn their livings by feeding a hungry world, and exports matter to us. There was a lot of concern expressed to me and among the farmers and ranchers who were gathered there about the potential of the withdrawal by the United States from Kansas is a good example. Our largest importer--the place to which we export the most agricultural commodities--is  It is not just about commodities. In addition to the commodities, there are manufacturing jobs related to food and food products. There are 36,000 jobs that generate more than $5.7 billion in economic activity, and approximately 14 percent of all jobs and 10 percent of all manufacturing jobs are tied to the food and agricultural sectors. So, when we talk about trade and exports, we are not just talking about shipping a ton of wheat or a carload of wheat to another country; we are also talking about all of the jobs here in the United It is not just in growing commodities and not just in raising cattle but all of the jobs that come from taking those commodities, turning them into food, and exporting the food to other countries as well.  I have had this conversation with people within the administration and with my colleagues in the U.I do believe the tax bill we passed will improve the economy and that farmers, lots of other business men and women, manufacturers, and others will experience greater economic opportunity as a result of the passage of the tax bill. I would highlight that the tax rates are a lot less important if we don't have income. If something would happen in which we would not be exporting--for example, if there would be a withdrawal from NAFTA--the outcome could be that the tax rates would become semi-irrelevant because the income levels of farmers and ranchers and those who would have jobs in the food sector would be significantly diminished. Less income means tax rates don't matter as much as they otherwise would.  Things are really difficult in agriculture today. Commodity prices are at low prices historically. The challenges are great. Weather, as I said earlier when speaking about crop insurance, is not always our friend. Across Kansas, the plea is for rain or snowfall or moisture. It is dry statewide. The challenges the producers in my State but really those across the country face are low commodity prices and weather, which are significant. What that means is, we need every additional market. We cannot afford to lose any market to which we sell those commodities. More markets mean higher prices, and more demand means higher prices. Today, we need every penny we can gain on a bushel of corn or wheat or soybeans or grain sorghum. We need to make certain we don't lose markets but that we gain markets.  I commend the President for traveling to Nashville and speaking and meeting with the American Farm I believe it has been 30-plus years since a President attended a Farm Bureau annual convention. I know, in my own experience both in the House and the Senate, reporters have often asked me to analyze what I have heard or haven't heard in a President's State of the Union It has always been my practice to listen to a State of the Union Address and hear whether a President speaks about agriculture, about farmers, about ranchers, about rural Here we had a President who traveled to Nashville and spent time with those farmers and ranchers of America, and I am pleased the President did so.  I continue to encourage the administration to remain mindful of the role agricultural trade plays in our economy. I would indicate that our withdrawal from NAFTA is a high-risk strategy--a negotiating tactic, perhaps. It is true we have the highest quality of agriculture products available in the world, but other countries are very interested in taking our markets, and any indication that our markets are not going to continue gives countries like Argentina, Brazil, and others the opportunity to make the case that they will be stable suppliers. The things we raise in the United States they can sell and provide in those countries as well. My point is, we don't have a corner on the market, and any suggestion that we are not a stable supplier or that the trading relationship is going to diminish or disappear between two countries means that others are eagerly seeking to take those markets away from us.  Given the impact on our Nation's economy, I urge those conference attendees, those people I visited with in Nashville, to continue to convey to all of those policymakers the importance of trade and the importance of trade agreements.  The administration has a desire to develop bilateral as compared to multilateral trade agreements, and I encourage those negotiations to be ongoing today. We don't have any time to waste when it comes to finding new markets and trading relationships with other countries.  Again, I appreciate the President traveling to Nashville and spending time with farmers and ranchers, and I appreciate the agenda he outlined in regard to regulatory relief, as well as the issue of broadband, on which the President spent a significant amount of time, providing technology to a part of[[Page S95]]the country that has, in many instances, been lacking or woefully inadequate.  But the bottom line is that rural America needs income. We can do lots of things to improve the quality of life in rural America, but in the absence of farmer success, in the absence of a farmer and rancher earning a living, the ability to attract our children or others to come back to the farm and the ability to retain our young people in the community to work on a farm diminishes greatly.  One of the questions I received was from a young lady studying in Texas, and this was her question: What are you doing to make certain that young people have a chance to be farmers? While my answer was less than perfect--it is a hard one to answer--it is an important question. The reality is that the chances of young people having the opportunity in agriculture to earn a living is totally dependent upon the economic success of those individuals in agriculture today and what the future holds. We can find a few programs that might encourage young people to be able to enter agriculture as a profession and as a career, but the reality is that it will only work when they are earning a good living, and that comes, once again, from the safety nets, including crop insurance, which will be included in a farm bill as it works its way through Congress this year, but also in the opportunity to see that every market around the globe is available to the U.farmer and rancher so that he and she will earn a living and so that they will increase the chances that their sons and daughters have the opportunity to work side by side with them into the future.  I especially want to thank a few people from the American Farm Bureau Federation for allowing me to attend and inviting me to attend and to speak--certainly, President Zippy Duvall, the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, from Georgia; Dale Moore, a Kansan who is at the American Farm Bureau Federation; and Mary Kay Thatcher, their long-time government affairs person. All of those individuals at the American Farm Bureau Federation do their job so well, but I especially want to acknowledge the friendship and support of those three individuals.  I am reminded that no matter where we go, farmers and ranchers have a lot in common. In addition to their economic importance to communities across Kansas and around rural America, it is farmers and ranchers that still today provide a sense of what is right in America--an understanding of right and wrong, an understanding of the value of life, integrity, character, and values. It is something that is important not just to rural America but to our entire United States of So thank you to the farmers who visited with me. Thank you to the farmers who gave me the opportunity to speak with them and listened to me. Please know that I am happy and will continue to roll up my sleeves to work with my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats--the Senator from Kansas, the chairman of the Ag Committee; and the Senator from Michigan, the ranking member, ",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgS89-2.txt,1507,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2018.0,9.0,January
320,topic-id,622,"Mr.President, I would like to take a moment to remember and pay tribute to a pioneer of Alaska aviation, Cliff Everts, who passed away in December at the age of 95. One of the greatest compliments you can pay to a longtime Alaskan is to refer to that individual as a pioneer. Yes, Cliff was a pioneer, but that understates the reverence with which he is held in Alaska's aviation community. He is indeed an icon of Alaska aviation.  Place yourself in a remote Alaskan village in the dead of winter. The outdoor temperature is minus 25 degrees, and the village is running short of fuel. Imagine the sound of a fuel plane landing on your village's gravel runway, delivering thousands of gallons of fuel needed to sustain daily life in the bush and power remote work sites. Deliveries such as this make life in rural Alaska possible. This is the legacy of Cliff  Originally born in New York, Cliff's passion for flying began at a young age. He took his first flight at 12 years old. As a teenager, he delivered newspapers to pay for his flying lessons. Cliff trained on a Taylorcraft, a high-winged, two-seater aircraft, and was soloing within just 6 months.  Later Cliff joined the Civilian Pilot Training Program, supporting wartime efforts during World War It was not long thereafter that he made the decision to leave New York, to accept a position flying as a copilot for Alaska Star Airlines in Alaska Star Airlines was a predecessor of today's Alaska  Having grown to love Alaska, Everts embraced the pioneer spirit and accepted another position flying for Wien Airlines in He continued to fly for Wien Airlines for 35 years, logging over 30,000 hours of flight time. His flights carried mail, cargo, and passengers throughout the entire  While Cliff Everts was a pilot by trade, he was also a very savvy entrepreneur and was well known for his many business ventures, but he is best known for Everts Air Cliff started this business in the 1980s flying a C-46. The C-46 is a World War II era high-altitude, multiengine aircraft. He quickly built the fleet, running his business on the philosophy that providing for the unique needs of Alaskans can be done both efficiently and affordably by  Cliff's son, Robert, began his own aviation business called Everts Air Between Everts Air Cargo and Everts Air Fuel, the pair owned 21 airplanes. I understand that there are six C-46 aircraft remaining in revenue service. The Everts enterprises fly four of the six, and that is a testament to how well they treat their equipment. They are also known for treating their people exceptionally well.  Alaska was good to Cliff Cliff was great to In recognition of his achievements, Cliff amassed numerous awards and recognitions. In 2007, Cliff received the Federal Aviation Administration's Master Pilot In 2011, the general aviation side of Fairbanks International Airport, what we call ``East Ramp,'' was dedicated in Cliff's honor. In 2012, the Alaska Air Carriers Association designated Cliff as an ``Aviation Legend.'' Cliff was also inducted into the Alaska Aviation Hall of He holds the Alaska Aviation Entrepreneur All appropriate recognition for a man best known for these words, ``Flying has been my life, and I can't see joy in doing anything else.''  On Saturday, January 13, Alaskans from all walks of life will come together in Fairbanks to celebrate the life of Cliff Cliff's friends and admirers will be joined by his wife Betty and their large family. On behalf of my Senate colleagues, let me take this opportunity to share our condolences with Betty and the family and to thank Cliff Everts for his outstanding life of service to aviation and                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgS137.txt,1694,PROTESTS IN IRAN,2018.0,10.0,January

1716,topic-id,2263,"Mr.President, I enjoyed that little bit of history there. I am sure that the Irish everywhere--and those who are, perhaps, not quite as Irish--will find good reason to celebrate on March 17 whether one is in Florida or in the Northeast or in Alaska, as the Presiding Officer certainly knows.                              The Iditarod  Mr.President, I am here to share a little bit of I know that the Presiding Officer will also appreciate the update on an event that we in Alaska celebrate every year and have for the past 46 years--the annual Iditarod race.  This is a sled dog race of international fame, a race that begins just outside of Anchorage, AK, and ends in It is about 1,000 miles. I think this year's southern route was 998 miles to be exact. It is one of the longest sled dog races on Earth, and it travels over some pretty interesting terrain. ``Interesting'' is a choice word to use as you cross mountains and frozen tundra and forests and the frozen ice. The Iditarod is, truly, a race for only the most hardy, only the best.  The Iditarod, itself, commemorates the deadly 1925 diphtheria outbreak that happened in There was no way to get the diphtheria antitoxin from the coastal area, down in Seward at the time, all the way up to This was before we had air transport as a viable option. So the real question was, How do you move this? How do you move this quickly? It was the middle of the winter. This was not a race. This was a lifesaving mission to move serum, again, 1,000-plus miles to the north to save a community. They resorted to a relay of dog sleds, of dog teams, to move that serum.  Today, the Iditarod is no longer a relay. It is a race of individual sled dog teams. Again, it is about a 1,000-mile race. It is a test of determination, certainly, of the K-9 mushers, and it is tough. It is always in the first weekend of At this time of year in Alaska, sometimes conditions can be pretty good--above zero. Sometimes they can be 30 degrees or 40 degrees below zero. Sometimes you can have a ground blizzard and wind conditions that move close to 80, 90, 100 miles an hour, and when you want to talk about windchill, out there, it is real; it is extreme.  This 46th annual running of the Iditarod hasn't been that challenging in terms of the cold, in terms of what they have seen in the past, but there is always some bump. There is always something that causes the race to be a little bit different. This year, the mushers had a scheduled checkpoint on Eagle This is a place where they take a mandatory 8-hour break. The game changer in the race this year was in the snow conditions. Because of the ceiling, planes could not drop food for the mushers, so they had to take this very critical checkpoint off of the board. The mushers plan all of this out in advance of the trip. They kind of know where they are going to be along the way. They plan their moves. So this was a pretty unanticipated event at the end and could have impacted it. Yet you had mushers who were pretty versatile, pretty adaptable. They took the news in stride and continued up the Yukon River toward other rest stops there.  Nicolas Petit, who had arrived in Anvik, was the frontrunner at the time. He was, like, ``Ah, no big deal. My strategy is an evolving thing.'' Yet that evolving thing allows for, again, curve balls that get in the way. In the instance of Nicolas Petit, the frontrunner--a Girdwood musher from a place that the Presiding Officer and I frequent often and I call home--everyone was quite excited. Long story[[Page S1750]]short, he lost the trail and lost the lead.  You think to yourself: Wait a minute. How can you lose the trail? This is not a NASCAR race, where you just go around the same track here. This is 1,000 miles. If it is windy, if it is blowing, if there is ground cover that you can't see through, things happen--things truly happen. On top of the harsh climate conditions that the mushers face, there are occasionally chance encounters with some wildlife. You have moose, caribou, bears, and porcupines out there, and they are all potential rendezvous for mushers around the trail.  One of the interesting headlines to come out of the Iditarod this year was a headline that read: ``Iditarod Musher Chases off Bison with Ax''--an ax, yes. Marcelle Fressineau and her 14-sled dogs were between Rohn and Nikolai, and they came face-to-face with a mother bison and her calf. What do you do? You don't want your dogs to be in danger, so the tough Alaskan woman takes her ax and charges the bison and says, ``Go away. Go away.'' Long story short, they ran away, and she continued her journey to You have to admit that people like this are ready for adventure and are full of grit and determination to succeed.  Of course, it is not just the mushers. It is the K-9 athletes. It is these dogs that, truly, are the inspiration to watch along the journey. This year's Iditarod kicked off with 67 talented, resilient competitors from all over Alaska and the world--67 dog teams.  This year, Joar Ulsom was the first musher to arrive in He came in just after 3 a.m. on Wednesday morning. He is originally from Norway, and he has been dreaming of being an Iditarod racer since he was a kid. In 2011, he relocated to Willow, AK, which is kind of our dog mushing capital of the world, and he really has made this dream a reality. He is a seasoned racer. He first completed the Yukon Quest in 2012 and has completed other races since then. He completed--he won the race in 9 days 12 hours. Again, this is not a recordbreaking time. Snow slowed things down, but think about standing on the back of a sled for 9 days 12 hours, minimal sleep, constant attention to the dogs in front of you. It is just an extraordinary story.  The newspapers are telling the story of Joar crossing the finish line in Thousands of people had gathered under the burled arch to congratulate him. It was about 4 degrees, 3 a.m., with thousands of people out in the street. My brother and sister-in-law came all the way from Brazil to be there on the other end. It was my sister-in-law's dream of a lifetime--bucket list--to be there at the end of the  Joar and his team are happy, and we are very pleased for him. I offer hearty congratulations to our 2018 Iditarod champion and his team of amazing dogs.  I wish all the competitors, many of whom are still out on the trail, success and safety as they compete in this truly ``Last Great Race on Earth.''                      Tribute to Chuck Kleeschulte  Mr.President, I want to recognize a longtime member of my staff, Chuck Kleeschulte, who recently retired from the If you are from Alaska and you have ever had any dealings with the Alaska delegation, you have met or have dealt with Chuck He is held in great respect in our State as a result of the work he did for so many people back home.  It is an understatement to say we miss him already. He hasn't been gone that long, but we miss him already.  Let me share a little bit of his biography for those who were not fortunate enough to know and work with He is an Alaskan not by birth but by choice. He moved from Ohio to Alaska in 1976 to work as a reporter at the Juneau Empire in our capital. A few years later, he became press secretary for then-Governor Jay He followed that with a stint at the Department of Environmental Conservation and then he returned to reporting for a few more years.  Chuck first came to the Senate in 1991. He was convinced by my father Frank Murkowski, who was a Senator at the time, to move to Washington, DC, to be his press secretary. So he did. He made the move, and now 27 years later, Chuck is still part of the family here. He served as my father's communications director, a legislative assistant in my personal office, and most recently as a senior adviser for the Energy and Natural Resources  Chuck, I think it is fair to say, is an institution within our institution. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of all things If someone wanted to know what the vote was on a measure back in 1993 that related to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline or whatever, Chuck would be able to recall that without any notes, without any prodding, without any background. Chuck is extraordinary. He has a work ethic that is second to none.  We have a phrase that has been around for about 30 years now, and it is ``Check with Chuck.'' Just check with Chuck because you don't need to do any fact-checking. He is it.  His legislative achievements are almost too many to name. Let me talk about some of the big-ticket Alaska items that Chuck was involved with. He was involved with responsible energy development in the 1002 area. He led this fight for us for decades as we sought to open up He has been the lead on a lifesaving road for the good people of King Cove that we just, again, have been successful with. He has been working to build out a safer route on the Sterling Highway, a much needed timber supply in the Tongass National He wrote legislation to ensure the transfer of lands owed to Alaska, to promote the construction of an Alaska gasline, and to expand the use of renewable resources, such as hydropower, marine hydrokinetic, and geothermal. Chuck was involved with all of it.  He has been involved in so many significant accomplishments for our State, but what is equally impressive is the work Chuck did very quietly and just every day for Alaskans all over the Whether it was a bridge that needed repair, a light pole that had toppled over in bad weather, land use fees that had been miscalculated by a Federal agency, a land exchange for a remote community, Chuck was always there. No matter how small the problem, no matter how complicated it may be, Chuck was there to work on it.  Chuck has only been retired now for a few weeks, and the people I talk to are all asking: How is Chuck doing? Where is Chuck? They all say they are going to miss him, and I say how much I already do.  It is a comfort to know that Chuck is not going too far. He is retiring from Washington, DC, and he is moving to a beautiful little farm in Floyd, Apparently there is only one stoplight in Chuck's new town, but I think Chuck is going to keep busy. His better half Tori says she wants a cow. They want to grow a little bit of hay, and there is grass to mow. There is a half-acre pond that apparently is stocked with fish. There is a barn we all volunteered to help him paint this summer. We will figure out time to do the barn painting.  To the people of Floyd, congratulations on bringing Chuck into the fold. We know the barn, the cow, the hay, the pond, the single stoplight, and the community are all very lucky to have him. I certainly was.  He spent 27 years in Congress and near double that working on behalf of Alaska in some fashion or another. Chuck's guidance and work have not only benefited me but the State and people of Alaska and the rest of our country.  My favorite part, what I loved best about Chuck is, after all he has done and all he has accomplished, he is still one of the most humble guys you will ever meet. I told him that recently, and he said: ``Oh, yeah, it's easy to be humble when you have a lot to be humble about.''  Chuck was just that way. He is always modest, but the example he set as a true public servant is one to emulate. He worked hard every day--every day. He made our office a better place. He helped people, and in doing so, he left some truly enormous shoes to fill.  Should anybody doubt that Chuck left a lasting impression, all we have to do is look at the single space, 50-page exit memo he wrote to give the rest of my staff, giving them updates on everything he had been working on, the status, whom to contact, what to do next. Chuck left the guidebook. He is incredibly thorough, amazingly impressive, and always appreciated.  So I want to thank Chuck Thank you. Thank you for[[Page S1751]]everything you did for me, for Alaska, and for our You will always be a part of our Senate family and a beloved member of Team After 27 years, and on behalf of those who knew him, I wish Chuck the absolute best as he begins his very well-deserved retirement.

We have tried every means to move our colleagues to action, but in remembering the names of people who have been lost, it is a reminder that there is a human face behind every single one of these numbers, and behind that victim there is a trail of trauma--family members, friends, classmates--that is difficult to unwind.[[Page S1697]]  On December 14, 2012, armed with a tactical semiautomatic weapon with clips of 30 bullets, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, and himself.

1106,topic-id,854,"Mr.President, I am grateful to join for a few moments the cosponsors of this resolution--Senator Lee and Senator  It is important to pick up on what Senator Lee was just putting down--the notion that this is a limited resolution that speaks to our participation in an unauthorized, illegal partnership with the Saudis to bomb the country of It does not affect our partnership with Saudi Arabia and others in the gulf region to continue to confront terror, to continue to confront al-Qaida--a specific carve-out in this legislation that allows for 2001 AUMF authorized activities to go forward.  It is also important to note that if you care about the priority of taking on al-Qaida and taking on ISIS in the region, then you should support debating our resolution because all of the evidence suggests that the continuation of this civil war inside Yemen is making ISIS and AQAP, which is the arm of al-Qaida that has the clearest intentions of attacking the homeland, both more powerful. The AQAP controls much more territory inside Yemen than it did in the beginning of this civil war.  If you take the time to meet with Yemeni-Americans, they will tell you that inside Yemen, this bombing campaign is not perceived as a Saudi bombing campaign; it is perceived as a U.S.-Saudi bombing campaign. What we are doing is radicalizing the Yemeni people against the United Add to this the new information that suggests that some of our partners in the coalition, although not directly working with al-Qaida, are starting to arm some very unsavory Salafi militias inside Yemen that are filled with the types of people--the types of extremist individuals--who could take the training they have received from the coalitions and the weapons they have received from the coalitions and easily turn against the United  If you care about the mission against terrorism, then you should support debating our resolution.  Just to recap the reasons we are here today, we need to have a debate on the lack of authorization for military force because it is time for Congress to step up and do our constitutional duty.  The administration wrote in its letter to us that we do not have the authority as the U.Congress to weigh in on military activity that is waged by the administration unless there are two armies firing at each other on the ground in an area of conflict. That is the administration's definition of ``hostilities,'' and admittedly that is a definition that has been used by Democrats and This is not exclusive to the Trump administration. The problem with that is that it would allow for the United States, through Executive decision only, to wage an air campaign against a country that wipes it out without there being any say from the U. Clearly, what is happening in Yemen today meets the definition of ``hostilities.'' We have shown pictures on this floor before of entire cities that have been wiped out. More than 10,000 civilians have been killed in the largest outbreak of cholera in the history of the world in terms of what we have recorded. Those are hostilities, and the United States is clearly engaging in those hostilities because we are helping with targeting and refueling the planes that are supplying the munitions. If we cede to unlimited Executive authority with respect to this engagement, there will be no end to that.  Lastly, let me speak to what is happening on the ground. There is zero evidence that U.participation in this coalition has made things better. Civilian casualties are not getting better. The day after Christmas, over 60 civilians were killed in a series of airstrikes. Reports are that last month, the Saudis engaged once again in something called double tapping, by which they targeted an area in which civilians lived, waited for the emergency responders to arrive, and then hit again--something that is not allowed by international humanitarian law. The humanitarian catastrophe itself is getting worse, not better.  Maybe most important is that the battle lines inside Yemen are not changing. The Saudis have been telling us for years: Stick with us. If you keep on helping us bomb the Yemeni people, we will win this war. We will get back control of Hudayda and of Sana'a.  That is not happening. At the beginning of this war, the Houthis controlled about 70 percent of the population inside Today, the Houthis control about 70 percent of the population inside If we continue to support this bombing campaign, nothing will change except that more people will die, except that more civilians will be hit by the bombs we help to drop, except that al-Qaida will continue to control big portions of that country.  While Senator Lee notes that this resolution is actually not on the merits of our engagement there and that it is whether we have the legal justification to be there, let's admit that if you do consider the merits, other than backing the play of our historic ally, there is nothing to suggest that our participation there is making things better rather than worse.

The courage of the brave men who served on the USS Indianapolis, who delivered critical parts to the first atomic bomb used in combat, helped bring about the end of World War After their mission was complete, they were intercepted on their way to join with the rest of the Pacific fleet for the invasion of mainland Two torpedoes from a Japanese submarine struck the Indianapolis on July 30, 1945, sinking the battleship and immediately killing 300 of the 1,196 sailors aboard. The remaining 900 sailors were left to fend for their lives in the shark-infested Pacific, spending 3 days with few lifeboats or supplies and no way to notify the Navy of their peril.  Father Conway, as chaplain, disregarded his own safety by swimming back and forth among the men, administering aid, helping to gather those who had drifted from the mass of survivors, and continuing to minister and organize group prayers. His heroism gave comfort to the dying and helped save the lives of the 321 sailors who were rescued from the sea. Father Conway's acts of bravery took a physical toll, and he succumbed to the elements shortly before rescuers arrived. As one surviving sailor said of Father Conway, ``He was the most visible person keeping the men together, giving them hope and sacrificing himself to keep his fellow sailors united, calm, and alert.''  The legacy of Father Conway continues to inspire his family, fellow sailors, and the people of That is why next month, in recognition of his birthday, we pause to reflect upon and celebrate his courageous actions.

In the most powerful, most affluent country in the world, our children should not have to go through that; never mind those who have actually had to face down someone with a gun inside their classroom or inside their school.  What is devastating to the parents in Parkland and Sandy Hook, what is devastating to the parents in Baltimore, in New Haven, and in Chicago is that we refuse to have a debate on the Senate floor about how we can help address this epic mass slaughter, this gun violence epidemic in this country.  I have been taking pains over the course of the last 6 months to try to reach out across the aisle and find common ground with my colleagues on some commonsense legislation about changes to our gun laws. I am proud to have worked with Senator Cornyn on a small bill that would encourage States to comply with existing law--the Fix NICS It now has over 60 Republican and Democratic cosponsors, enough that it could overcome a cloture motion.  I have come to the floor today to ask that we come to an agreement--Republicans and Democrats--by which we can have an open debate on the issue of gun violence for the American public before we break for a 2-week Easter recess. We are going to go back to our States and have a wonderful time with our friends and families, while many others continue to grieve all across this country and many others will enter the ranks of those who grieve because, during the 14 days that we will be away, thousands of people will die from gunshot wounds. I just can't imagine that we would make a decision to go home at the end of this week without having had a debate on the Senate floor for the American people to see how we can try to respond to this cry, this call from the American public to do something.  These kids have been amazing. Literally hundreds of thousands of children walked out of school last week, and hundreds of thousands more students and their parents will be here in Washington for marches and at 600 other marches all around the country this weekend.  The polls tell us over and over again that 9 out of 10 Americans want us to take bold steps forward. Record numbers of American citizens believe the laws that exist today are not sufficient. This isn't a controversial issue outside of It is controversial only here, inside this If we remain silent, if we refuse to have a debate on the Senate floor, we are failing the people who sent us here.  I have come to the floor today to propose a very reasonable path forward so that we can have a debate and some up-or-down votes on proposals this week. From what I understand, there is still a lot of discussion happening with respect to the budget. Obviously, we have to get that done by the end of the week, but it is not ready yet, so we have time this week to have a short but meaningful debate on the issue of guns.  Here is what I am proposing. I am proposing that we have a unanimous consent agreement whereby we can have a time-limited debate--I would suggest perhaps not more than 6 hours--and at the end of that period of time, we have six votes, three votes propounded by the Democratic side and three votes on measures propounded by the Republican side.  I think it is no secret the amendments that Senate Democrats would offer. We would want to see a vote on universal commercial background checks to make sure that commercial sales of guns are subject to background checks. That is something President Trump said he was for at the White House, and he has encouraged the Congress to work on it. Let's have an up-or-down vote on background checks.  I think Democrats would clearly want to see the bipartisan compromise, which has been worked out by Senator Blumenthal and Senator Graham with respect to protective orders, red flag orders, come before the It simply makes sense that we do what Florida is doing: Pass a law that allows for law enforcement, after a viable court process, to take away weapons temporarily from someone who poses a threat. The problem in Florida was, even if they had done something about this young man, they didn't have the legal ability to take his weapons away, even if he had made those kinds of threats in public. Florida is correcting that with their new law. We should do the same at the Federal level.  On our side, there is also interest in talking about the kinds of weapons that are legal and the kinds of weapons that are not. I am a believer, of course, that there is a class of military-style tactical semiautomatic weapons that are best if they are not in the hands of civilians. Obviously, that issue divides our side too. So if that were to come up for a vote, there will be Democrats for it and Democrats against it.  On the other two measures, there will be Republicans for them and Republicans against them. Some Republicans are for universal background checks; some aren't. There are many Republicans on record as being for protective orders, and there are others who will not vote for them.  We will have no idea, the American public will have no idea, and our constituents will have no idea what we are really willing to do and what we are not willing to do unless we have a debate. This is our last chance before we go home.  What I am proposing, I think, is reasonable, practical, and viable. We can get it done--six total amendments to the Fix NICS Act, time limited, perhaps only 6 hours. We could be in and out of that debate in a day. I have talked with my leadership about it. I am confident that Democratic leadership would support that path forward, and I propose it to Republican leadership tonight, as we enter this week, as a means of having this debate that the American public so badly needs. The alternative is unthinkable--going home, letting over a month pass since Parkland, since this outcry for action from kids across America, and not even attempting to get something done here.  I understand this issue is still difficult. I don't understand why my Republican colleagues will not support[[Page S1777]]something like background checks, an issue supported by 97 percent of It is pretty hard to find anything in America that is supported by 97 percent of Apple pie and Grandma probably don't get 97 percent approval ratings in this country, but universal background checks do. So, yes, I am frustrated that my Republican colleagues don't just come to the floor and agree to pass something that has mind-blowing universal support in the public, but what is more offensive is that we don't even try.  What is more offensive to me is that we don't even make an attempt to put these measures on the floor of the Senate and let them be voted up or down. I don't want the gun lobby to have veto power over the legislation that gets passed here, but even worse than that is for the gun lobby to have veto power over what we even debate.  I propose a total of six amendments and a total of 6 hours of debate. I would argue that is insufficient to meet the moment, but I get it that time is running out, that there is not a lot of interest from some Members on the Republican side to enter into this debate. So we are very willing to have a short, time-limited debate to see what we can get consensus on and what we can't get consensus on, and whatever moves out of this building, whatever amendments get passed, then we live with it and live to fight another day.  It has been 5 years since the tragedy in my State and now 32 days since I don't think we should wait one day longer before we have an open debate on the Senate floor about how we, as those entrusted with the safety of our children, do something about the epidemic of gun violence in this country.

1832,topic-id,740,"I thank the Presiding  Mr.President, I just returned from a trip to a major transatlantic conference in While the Europeans have spent a lot of time over the course of the last 12 months hand-wringing about whether the United States is committed to Europe, committed to NATO, committed to our common defense, my feeling upon going to Brussels for this particular conference is, they are kind of over the hand-wringing. They are now just making plans to move on without us. They are making plans to protect themselves without us. They are making plans to set the rules of the road economically, politically, and culturally around the world without the United The evidence of that was very clear.  The Europeans are setting up something called the European Defense Initiative, in which they are going to start doing military planning and purchasing outside of NATO because they are just not convinced, not confident that the United States is going to be seriously engaged in That compromises our security as the Europeans start to make plans for their defense without us, even though we still have an obligation under the treaty to protect them.  Over and over, you see the world moving on as they watch this massive withdrawal of America from the world. The President said at a rally in Alabama a few months ago that the world is starting to respect the United States of America again. That could not be further from the truth. The Pew organization charts other countries' opinions of the United It also charts whether other countries believe the United States is going to act in the best interests of the world. The numbers are, frankly, startling.  Of the 37 countries they surveyed, only two of them have higher confidence in the United States under Trump than they did under One is a rather statistically significant increase, that being Russia, which by 42 percentage points is more confident that the United States is going to act in that country's best interests. South Korea had 88 percent confidence under Obama and has 17 percent confidence under Canada had 83 percent confidence under Obama and has 22 percent confidence under Germany is 86 to 11. They have come to this belief because, as my colleagues have mentioned, the Trump administration had signaled its unwillingness to try to set a moral tone for the world in the way that it budgets. The budget they presented to us reduces accounts dedicated to countering Russian aggression around its periphery by 63 percent. It is a clear telegraph to Europe that they are on their own, that countries that are trying to fight back against a country that wants to reestablish a new version of the Soviet Empire will have no help from the United  In this budget, the National Endowment for Democracy is cut by $100 million. It is no secret that countries like Hungary and Poland are starting to slip away from traditional democratic norms. Countries like the Philippines are doing the same because there is not a moral force here in the United States committing to bring them closer to the ideals of participatory democracy.  There is a $1.6 billion cut in humanitarian aid, telling the rest of the world: If you want to solve these enormous problems of humanitarian catastrophe--famine and refugee displacement--you can't look to us anymore. You are on your own again.  There is a 35-percent cut in overall international narcotics and law enforcement funding, just at a time when record amounts of fentanyl are finding their way into the United  The moment of panic is over for the world. They have watched this administration walk away from its traditional obligations to try to stand up for the rule of law, to try to promote democracy and human rights, and to try to protect America's interests and our allies. They are simply making other plans. I hope the next administration will be able to correct that, but those plans are hard to break once they are made.  I hope Republicans and Democrats will stand up to make sure that America does not become any weaker in the world than it already is today, 15 months into this administration.

663,topic-id,932,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to talk about an issue that is critical to patients and families in my home State of Washington and across the country. Today, parents are wondering if they will be able to get the healthcare their kids need, and communities are wondering if they will be able to provide it.  That is unacceptable.  Congress has to swiftly and fully restore the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, and funding for other services families need, like community health centers, which have been waiting more than 100 days for a long-term solution. They should do so without making deep cuts to successful prevention programs in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that tackle avoidable conditions like heart disease and diabetes.  Democrats have wanted to get this done for months. By focusing on pushing through partisan tax reform at the end of the year, Republicans instead put massive corporations and the wealthiest ahead of making sure our children and their families have the healthcare they need. I hope they are now ready to give these issues their full and immediate attention. In case they aren't, I want to make sure they know exactly what this is about.  It is about children like Stella lives in Washington She is 5 years old. She has two brothers. She has a love of the outdoors, especially swimming and kayaking. She has a typical kindergartner's boundless energy and excitement. But Stella was born with spina bifida, an issue with how her spinal cord was formed. In the past year of dealing with that condition, Stella's family went through 5 catheters a day, almost 2,000 in total. They went on 10 different occasions to have MRI scans. They went to get her new leg braces. Given the cost of all that, they went through their $5,000 deductible in the first 5 weeks of the year. That is right. It took just 5 weeks. Additionally, this year Stella is also scheduled to have bladder and kidney surgery.  As one can imagine, the expenses are really adding up. Even with both parents working, covering Stella's healthcare needs would be an unimaginable task. Fortunately, Stella does qualify for health insurance through CHIP has helped her family afford the treatment she needs, including physical therapy.  Stella's story is just one of many examples of families who rely on this program. There are 60,000 children in Washington State who are now insured through Nine million families nationwide rely on it to help address the healthcare needs of their children. Yet Congress has taken over 102 days and counting to restore it. There is no excuse for this inaction.  Families who rely on the CHIP Program are not alone in needing our immediate attention. Thanks to CHIP and Medicaid, the uninsured rate among children is now at an all-time low. Jeopardizing this accomplishment by letting CHIP twist in the wind is simply unacceptable. This Republican-controlled Congress has also failed to renew other investments that our families rely on for the care they need--programs such as community health centers, which serve 25 million patients, particularly in our rural and poorer communities; the National Health Service Corps, which brings doctors and other healthcare providers to underserved areas through scholarships and loan repayment; and the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program, which brings primary care and dental residencies to communities in need. Leaving these programs without long-term extensions a minute longer is utterly irresponsible because this lack of certainty for them is already bringing a negative impact on our communities.  For example, the Northeast Washington Health Programs serve some of most the rural areas in my State, including Ferry County, which has fewer than four people per square mile. They are struggling to hire needed medical staff and managers because of this uncertainty that is now there. Ferry County cannot wait.  The Community Health Association of Spokane runs 12 health center sites and sees more than 70,000 patients a year. They recently began offering very much needed opioid addiction treatment. If Congress does not reauthorize the community health center funding, those efforts will be jeopardized and expansions will be halted. Spokane cannot wait.  Yakima Neighborhood Health Services served over 22,000 patients in 2016. Almost all of those patients were below 200 percent of the Federal poverty line.  If Congress does not act soon, three different clinics, including a clinic in one of the poorest cities in Washington, will be at risk. Yakima cannot wait.  I have heard additional stories of similar hardships from across my North Olympic Healthcare Network has had to put expansions on behavioral healthcare on hold. Another health center in Washington may have to reconsider building a new children's dental residency program. A center serving Whatcom County may have to cancel a project for medical, dental, and behavioral healthcare facilities as well.  Across the country there are a lot of examples for community health centers just like the ones I mentioned. Healthcare that people of all ages and backgrounds rely on is being put in jeopardy, all because Republicans prioritized tax cuts for those at the top before the health needs of millions of people at the end of last year.  It is far past time to show these families that we are willing to work to get this done. We need to give them the peace of mind that they can get the healthcare they need. They deserve that.

1054,topic-id,714,"Mr.President, time and again, President Trump and Vice President Pence have made clear they will put extreme ideology ahead of women's health and constitutional freedoms. We have seen it in their efforts to undermine women's ability to get reproductive healthcare from providers they trust. We have seen it in their efforts to let employers deny women birth control coverage based on what they believe and regardless of what the women who work for them believe. We have seen it in the administration's close coordination with a hate group on tailoring policies to undermine Planned We heard it loud and clear when Vice President Pence laid out his far-right vision that women's freedom to have safe and legal abortions could end in our time. We have also seen it implemented to an appalling extreme in Scott Lloyd's inexcusably harmful and ideologically driven actions as Director of the Office of Refugee  The Office of Refugee Resettlement is a little-known but very important office inside the Department of Health and Human They are supposed to be helping resettle refugees who are fleeing violence, to resettle and integrate Iraqis and Afghans whose lives are actually in danger because they work for the U.They provide rehabilitative, social, and legal services to survivors of torture, and they are charged with overseeing a network of providers across the United States who care for unaccompanied children who arrive at our Nation's borders--children and youth--seeking safety in our country.  However, under Director Lloyd, it has become a testing ground for the radical Trump-Pence agenda to interfere with women's health choices. Repeatedly, under the supervision of Director Lloyd's office, when young women--some of whom are survivors of sexual abuse--have sought safe and legal abortions, his response has been to personally step in and put up barriers to their care. He worked to prevent young women in his custody from speaking with lawyers about their rights. He personally interfered to try to pressure women out of their decisions to have abortions. Director Lloyd even had his office explore the possibility of reversing an abortion once the medical procedure was underway--a practice that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has noted is ``unproven and unethical.''  A deposition from ongoing litigation shows just how reckless and irresponsible Scott Lloyd has been. In emails,[[Page S1703]]he admitted he was making these decisions on an ad hoc basis. In other words, Director Lloyd wasn't concerned with fulfilling his duty as the head of the Office of Refugee He wasn't concerned with the well-being of women. He wasn't concerned with their personal decisions or their freedoms. He was only concerned with furthering an extreme, ideological agenda.  Women and men across the country are not having it. They are standing up and standing against Scott Lloyd's extreme policies. Many have signed a petition calling for his removal, and they are just the latest addition to a growing outcry against Director Lloyd's willful disregard for women's rights.  Many Senate and House Democrats have called for him to step down. I am again calling on Secretary Azar to fire Scott Lloyd as Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement because Scott Lloyd's actions and his personal beliefs about what women can and can't do with their bodies show a fundamental disrespect for the rights and equality of women, as does setting policy that has huge implications for women's health and lives through an ``ad hoc'' process.  Scott Lloyd's actions to undermine women's health and to deny women's rights are utterly unacceptable, and they cannot go unchecked. We cannot permit bullies to try to intimidate vulnerable young women who are making the healthcare decisions that are right for them--not President Trump, not Vice President Pence, and not Scott  I am going to keep standing up and fighting for the rights of these women and immigrants across the country and for the rule of law that ensures those rights. I am going to keep fighting against those who think they are above the law and who want to roll back the clock on these freedoms.

972,topic-id,716,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.4909, the STOP School Violence Act, as amended. But I do so with serious concerns about some of its provisions, and mostly about what the bill fails to do.  H.4909 would authorize $50 million annually for grants administered by the Department of Justice to fund various training and other initiatives intended to enhance school safety. It would authorize another $25 million annually to be used for other related purposes, including physical improvements, such as metal detectors, better locks, and systems for schools to notify law enforcement of emergencies.  The bill is fine as far as it goes, and we should certainly do more to make our schools safer, but it is shameful that we must do so because of our failure to reduce the threat of gun violence to children.  It should be unacceptable to all of us that we must take steps to train staff and students to protect themselves against these types of incidents instead of spending more money on actually educating our young people.  This bill does not include any provisions to strengthen our gun laws or to help keep guns out of the hands of those who should not possess them.  Evidence and experience tell us that we must establish universal background checks instead of the flawed system we now have.  We should encourage States to adopt laws providing for extreme risk protection orders, and we must ban assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines. These steps would help prevent not only school shootings, but would reduce the daily toll of gun violence in our communities.  None of these critical provisions are included in this bill, which was never examined by the Judiciary Committee either through a hearing or a legislative markup session. Had we taken these steps, which we could have done quickly in the exactly 1 month since the tragic Parkland, Florida, shooting, we might have produced a much better bill for floor consideration.  The suspension version of the bill does include an explicit prohibition against the funds being used on firearms or firearms training. Because President Trump and others in the administration have indicated that they believe arming teachers is part of the solution to this problem, it was important to my colleagues and to me that we be assured that this program, at least, will not be used for such a purpose which would actually endanger students, not make them safer.  However, we should have addressed serious concerns that have come to our attention with respect to the anonymous tip reporting systems and threat assessment and intervention teams that would be funded by this bill. We want people to report information about someone who may present a danger to students, but the bill does not include requirements that these systems provide adequate due process protections for students against whom a report is made.  I have longstanding concerns about the increased use of law enforcement in schools. History tells us that, without proper training, use of such policies can have a disproportionate impact on students of color and students with disabilities.  In the decades since Columbine, when the Nation rushed to increase school-based law enforcement efforts, thousands of vulnerable students have entered the school-to-prison pipeline for conduct that should be treated as routine behavior violations.  I fear, therefore, that efforts to increase school-based law enforcement without guardrails to ensure it is done well and based on strong evidence may repeat the risks of the past. My concern is only heightened by the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to remove important tools to ensure States and school districts understand their civil rights obligations when disciplining students.  I urge Secretary DeVos and Attorney General Sessions to maintain current discipline and school resource officer guidance to ensure implementation of this bill does not exacerbate the school-to-prison pipeline.  We should have had the opportunity to address these important issues through consideration in committee, but we did not.  Like the sponsors of this bill, I want Congress to do more to make our schools safer. Therefore, I will support this bill today, not withstanding the serious concerns I have outlined, with the hope that we will address these concerns going forward.

Mr.Speaker, today, young people across the country are taking a stand and calling upon this Congress to do something about the scourge of gun violence that has terrorized our schools and streets for too long. This bill fails to do so, and it should not and cannot be our only response to these demands.  We must make schools safer. But the best way to do that is to do more to prevent gun violence from occurring in the first place. Congress must do more to stop gun violence. Congress should pass an assault weapons ban. Congress should pass an effective background check. Congress should ban high-capacity magazines.  Congress should do a lot more. It is not enough to say that staff and students must do more to protect themselves. Mr.Speaker, it is time to take decisive action to stop gun violence in our communities.

Mr.Speaker, we know what to do.

We know that we ought to eliminate the 3-day limits so that, if they don't finish the background check within 3 days, you can't get your gun.  We know that we should renew the assault weapons ban that was in effect from 1994 to 2004 so you can't buy military killing machines in this country for civilian use.  We know we ought to ban the high-capacity magazines that can convert guns into killing machines for large numbers of people that have no other purpose. You don't hunt a deer with a high-capacity magazine.  We know we ought to ban bump stocks, and we know the other things we ought to do.  But we are, too many of us, cowards.

39,topic-id,2826,"Mr.President, on December 28, just 3 days after Christmas, the Department of the Interior and this administration sent the oil industry a belated Christmas present. They published a proposal to release offshore drilling companies from sensible rules designed to prevent a tragedy like the one we experienced back in 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oilspill, when 11 people lost their lives and almost 5 million barrels of oil were spilled as a result of a defective device called a blowout preventer. There were 5 million barrels of oil sloshing around in the Gulf of Mexico, much of which is still out there down at depths of 5,000 feet, where the actual well pipe came out a mile underneath the surface of the Gulf of  Of course, we know the economic damage that did all up and down the Gulf of The explosion was some 50 or 60 miles off of Louisiana, but the winds shifted and started blowing the oil to the east. It got as far east as Pensacola Beach, and those sugary white sands were covered up with black oil. The Associated Press and UPI photographs went around the world. The winds continued, and it went as far as the white sands of Tar balls floated as far east as the white sand beaches of Panama City Beach, and then the winds shifted and brought it back the other way. People all over the world, seeing the photographs, thought oil was on all the beaches of the gulf coast of Florida, and they did not come. The tourists did not come.  Now, I haven't even spoken about the economic and environmental degradation that occurred throughout the entire gulf and the fishing industries. Of course, the administration has proposed to now do drilling off the east coast of the United States, including off the coast of the State of the Presiding A number of us have come together who don't think that matches with our tourism industry. It certainly doesn't match with regard to our fishing industries, but it also does not match with the U.Department of Defense's training and testing mission.  If we look at the gulf coast off of Florida, the only place it is off limits in law is the largest testing and training area for the U.military in the world, but if you go up and down the Atlantic coast of the Eastern Seaboard, you will see training range after training range, and you get as far south as the Central East Coast of Florida and, lo and behold, is that area of protection for not only the U.Department of Defense but for NASA and other agencies. That is where we are rocketing our satellites into orbit, of which the first stages have to have a place to land. That is where, when we had the space shuttle--and soon we will be rocketing American astronauts to the International Space Station on American rockets. Many of the first stages will fall into the Atlantic Ocean below, just like the solid rocket boosters did on the space shuttle when it launched.  So there are reasons not to have drilling platforms out there, but let's come back to the Deepwater Horizon oilspill. What happened was deep below the seabed, miles farther into the Earth's crust, pressure had built up and an explosion had occurred. The safety mechanism is right where the pipe comes out of the seabed and goes up 5 miles to the surface to deliver oil.  The safety mechanism is a blowout preventer, which is like a huge set of pincers which comes through and cuts off the pipe. If that blowout preventer preventing the blowout of the well is defective--as it was in the BP oilspill, where 5 million barrels of oil spewed out 5 miles below the surface of the gulf into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and rendered the havoc and economic damage it did.  In the turmoil and trauma that ensued, there was obviously a need in the Department of the Interior, in the Bureau of Safety, called BSEE, to change the rules to give additional safety mechanisms to make sure this wouldn't happen again. Lo and behold, there is now a change, and we are starting to see the first attempts at weakening those rules.  Sometimes the issue of regulatory reform feels abstract or arbitrary. This is technical stuff, and it is dry, but the safety standards created after the Deepwater Horizon oilspill are not dull and boring. They are life or death. They were written specifically to make sure families, like those 11 who lost their loved ones, wouldn't have to be notified again that there was a preventable death.  What are these new rules about? They are coming in on the blowout preventer, which is the system to control the flow of oil or to seal an oil well. A blowout preventer is what stands between the enormous pressure that builds up in the oil well pipe and the ocean around it. Its purpose is exactly what the name sounds like. It is to prevent the oil from blowing out into the sea uncontrollably.  It took several months to finally get that well capped 5,000 feet below the surface of the water. These are massive pieces of equipment. The blowout preventer for Deepwater Horizon stood 57 feet tall and weighed over 400 tons. That is how big that thing is. Then there is a piece of the blowout preventer system called a shear ram--a device with two blades that seals off a well in an emergency, and that is what failed to fully close in the BP oilspill.  What the Interior Department in this administration is trying to do is undo the updated standards for shear rams and blowout preventers, and it is trying to get rid of a required third party to certify the safety mechanisms.  Obviously, after what we suffered, it is common sense to have those safety mechanisms, and it means that for a third party to ensure the safety mechanisms by certifying that they are in place--it means that somebody other than the oil company needs to make sure their safety equipment is in place and functioning properly.  These rules require better training for workers, real-time monitoring of deepwater drilling operations, timely reporting of major problems with the equipment, and consistent testing and inspections to increase safety. These rules were also the product of a thorough and transparent discussion by scientists, engineers, industry representatives, agency officials, and the public.  It took 6 years after the spill for the well control rule to be finalized. The Trump Interior Department wants to pull a bait and switch, reversing the safety measures and giving the public a mere 30 days to review a highly technical rule. It took 6 years to develop this rule ensuring the safety devices, and now they have a rule to undo it, and they are going to give 30 days for comments. That is nothing more than a free pass to the oil and gas industry at the expense of everyone else, including folks who work on those rigs, who are going to have to suffer if there is another blowout. There are a lot of other things--communities, marine life, your State's economy, my State's economy, the Gulf States' economies. It is totally misguided and reckless.  Over the past year, President Trump has issued Executive orders cut straight from Big Oil's playbook. He has directed agencies to gut rules designed to protect the environment and the safety of workers if the rules interfered with an oil company's bottom line. That is what this one does. It saves them some $900 million. He directed Secretary Zinke to reconsider the well control rule, which was finalized in 2016. That rule stemmed directly from what we had learned in the investigation of the 2010 BP spill.  By the way, the agency that issued this proposed rollback is called the Bureau of Safety and Environmental It is separate now from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management--the agency that schedules lease sales in the Outer Continental  Before the 2010 spill, the folks who worked with the oil industry to auction acreage in the gulf were the same people who were in charge of inspecting the rigs later for compliance with the[[Page S9]]safety standards. Talk about a cozy relationship. That is why one of the first recommendations from the National Commission on the BP spill was to split those responsibilities into two different agencies--one that schedules lease sales and the other that does the safety. That was a very important step, both to clarify the mission of each agency and to restore public trust in offshore regulators. Yet over the summer, there were reports that the Trump administration wanted to recombine these two agencies. Only one stakeholder group would benefit from that, and you can bet what it is. It is not the consumers. It is not the tourists. It is not the scientists. It is not the environmentalists. It is the oil industry.  Now the Trump administration wants to smack down more recommendations from that investigation. From marine biologists to chambers of commerce, I can tell you, the people in Florida understand how important it is to keep drilling off the coast and, where there is drilling, to make sure the safety mechanisms that were corrected after the BP spill stay in place. But that is not what is happening right here in  When the Interior Department released this revised rule last week, my colleague, a Republican Congressman from Sarasota, FL, said ``It would be a huge mistake to weaken these safety regulations'' and that if the Interior Department doesn't rescind the proposal, Congress should intervene and codify the rules permanently.  He is right, and I agree with Congressman Buchanan, my colleague in the Florida delegation who has an ``R'' behind his name. That is why I plan to subject this misguided rule to the Congressional Review  The Congressional Review Act was once an option of last resort. It was meant to ensure that Congress could override the administration if a rule were widely opposed. In most cases, the Congressional Review Act wasn't necessary because if Congress opposed a rule strongly enough, there was enough consensus to pass a law to fix it.  At the beginning of this Congress, the CRA was a favorite tool of the Republicans who wanted to take a sledgehammer to the Obama administration's legacy through the rules that they had enacted. In 2017, the Senate took 17 votes on CRA resolutions of disapproval on everything from bear hunting in the National Wildlife Refuge of Alaska to drug testing of unemployment benefit recipients.  I think this dangerous proposal from the Interior Department deserves the same level of attention. This proposal is open to public comment until January 29. You are not going to get 6 years this time. You will get only 30 days, and it ends January 29. I hope the public understands that and starts registering some complaints.  I hope, during that time, every Floridian remembers what happened to us when the beaches of Pensacola were blackened with tar and oil and we lost a whole season of our guests--tourists who come to this extraordinary State of natural environment, the beautiful Florida beaches. I hope that every Floridian will remember--whether you were a hotelier, a restauranteur, whether you had the dry cleaners, whether you had the taxi services--when you got hit in your pocketbook; I hope every American who rightly has an interest in protecting our beaches, our oceans, our marine life, decides to write in and complain to Secretary Zinke exactly what he is putting at risk with this proposal.  The Interior Department claims the revised proposal will lessen ``unnecessary regulatory burdens''--those are their words--on the oil and gas industry, saving these businesses money. It is estimated it will save $900-some million for the oil industry. What about all the other businesses that will be hurt by a spill if that blowout preventer doesn't cut that pipe in two and seal off the well, which was the lesson learned from the BP Deepwater Horizon spill?  Do we want to go back and weaken these rules? The BP spill devastated my State's economy, and 11 people lost their lives. Louisiana's bayous were inundated with gooey oil.  I talked to two professors, researchers at Louisiana State University, They compared the critters that had developed in the bayous where the oil went into the bayous--the same kind of critter, a little fish that is about that big. Their progeny were stunning; they were mentally deformed. They could not act like normal killifish. It is a little fish about that big. They compared it to the bays and the bayous where those killifish hatched and grew in waters without oil sloshing around in those waters. For 87 days, 5 million barrels of oil gushed.  I bet folks don't even realize there is a spill that is happening right now. As a matter of fact, it has been leaking for 13 years. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan toppled an offshore drilling platform owned by Taylor Because of the way the platform slid, several of the wells were buried and have yet to be plugged.  We all know it is not a question of if there will be another spill but when--and, oh, by the way, the one that has been going on since 2004. How catastrophic will the next one be? Is it going to be off of the Carolinas? Is it going to be off of Virginia, with all of our military fleet in Norfolk? Is it going to be off of Jacksonville and Mayport, as well as the subbase for our Trident submarines? Is it going to be off of Canaveral, where our commercial government rockets are launched into space, dropping first stages, and where the testing for the Trident submarine that is based in Georgia is done, with the telemetry on the Air Force Eastern Test Range? That is why more than 41,000 businesses on the Atlantic coast have expressed opposition to drilling in the Atlantic Ocean, and that is why NASA doesn't want drilling anywhere near the Kennedy Space That is why the Department of Defense has said, time and again, that we should protect and extend the moratorium on drilling in the eastern gulf.  In 2006, bipartisan Senator Mel Martinez, a Republican from Florida, and I passed a moratorium for the eastern Gulf of Mexico, off of Florida, because of the military as well as all of the environmental things I have talked about.  Just at the end of last year, the Air Force came to us. It wants to put $60 million of new improvements for exquisite telemetry, as we are testing some of our most sophisticated weapons systems in the gulf testing range, which is the Gulf of Mexico, off of Florida, but they don't want to make that investment of $60 million to upgrade all of the telemetry unless they have the assurance it is going to be off limits to oil drilling, not just until 2022, which is in the law, but extended another 5 years until 2027.  We cannot get it done. This Senator tried to get it into the Defense bill--an appropriate place. The Acting President pro tempore serves on that distinguished committee, the Armed Services Committee, which is led by John We couldn't get it done because of oil interests not wanting to give the Air Force the security that its $60 million investment on advanced telemetry would be protected for not 5 years from now but 10 years from now.  The only reason the administration wants to take the time to write a new one is, the oil industry wants it to open up a whole lot more acreage to drilling and not just in the gulf; it wants the entire Outer Continental Shelf of the United States--on the west coast and from New Jersey south, as one goes down the States, including the ones I have already mentioned in the Southeastern United States--Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,  I don't think we should expose even 1 acre of Federal waters to drilling until we have strong safety standards in place to protect against another spill, to protect the workers from losing their lives ever again, to protect the environment, to protect the coastal economies that are so dependent on the beautiful beaches, and to protect the national security interests of our testing and training ranges.  It took 6 years to finalize these rules, and now, in a matter of 30 days, comments are out there to undo these rules. That shouldn't happen. Will other voices in the Senate speak up? It is happening right underneath our noses.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.[[Page S10]]    ",CREC-2018-01-03-pt2-PgS8.txt,859,NIFLA V. BECERRA,2018.0,3.0,March

718,topic-id,2036,"Mr.President, I must say, I have seen political games being played with trying to drill off of the coast of Not only am I appalled--I have recoiled at this political game--but unfortunately I am not surprised because of what we have seen happen in the last 15 hours.  It all started late last week when the Department of the Interior released a new 5-year drilling plan. It virtually had all of the coastal waters--the Outer Continental Shelf of the entire United States--included in this plan, including that area of Florida that is off limits to drilling in law--a law that Republican Senator Mel Martinez and I passed back in 2006 that keeps drilling off of the gulf coast of Florida until the year 2022.  This new proposal would open up nearly all of the Federal waters to drilling, including all of the coastal waters of Florida, both the west coast--gulf coast--and the east coast--the Atlantic--and also the Straits of Florida, those waters that come around the Florida Keys, which is the Gulf Stream that comes right up the southeast coast of The Gulf Stream then goes out across the Atlantic, past Bermuda, and ends up in Northern  Well, our colleagues have heard this Senator many times come and talk about how keeping oil rigs away from Florida's coast is an issue that is important to our State because of our tourism economy but also because of the military missions on the west coast--the gulf--as well as the  As a Floridian, this Senator has been fighting this fight ever since the mid-1980s when Secretary of the Interior James Watt intended to drill off the east coast of Florida where we were launching our space shuttle, dropping the solid rocket boosters, and where we were launching our military rockets, taking our clandestine satellites into orbit and dropping the first stages. That is how I beat it back in the 1980s, but lo and behold, here we are again in the same place.  We know you can't allow drilling in the Straits of Florida right off the Florida Keys because an oilspill there would be in the Gulf Stream, and that Gulf Stream hugs the coast of southeast Can you imagine what it would do to the beaches of the Florida Keys, Miami Beach, and all up the Gold Coast of Florida, all the way to Palm Beach, all the way north to Fort Pierce, where then the Gulf Stream heads farther in a northeasterly direction out into the Atlantic?  Well, let me show you what is happening in the gulf coast. All of this in yellow is what is off limits in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the 2006 law.[[Page S140]]There is an obvious reason for all of this--because this line is known as the Military Mission Everything east of here is the largest testing and training area in the world for the U.military. That is why we put this off limits to oil activity.  Oh, by the way, the testing and training mission for the entire Department of Defense is located right here at Eglin Air Force Base, which is where they brought all the pilot training for many nations for the F-35, the new super stealth jet fighter.  Guess what is going on down here in Panama City at Tyndall Air Force That is where we have all the pilot training for our F-22, another one of our stealth fighters.  Down here in Key West, we have the Key West Naval Air They bring in the squadrons of F-18s for the Navy at Boca Chica, which is where the airbase is, and within 2 minutes of lifting off the runway, they are over restricted airspace to do their testing and training.  By the way, what about the rest of the Navy? They bring their amphibious ships in here, going onto the beaches up there by Eglin Air Force And all of the activity is not just on the surface; the testing and training mission is also subsurface because that is part of the Navy's mission as well.  There is ample opportunity to test because from here to here is 300 miles. From here to here is about 300 miles. So there is plenty of room to do this testing. This is the largest testing and training area in the world.  But painfully, over time, we have found another reason, and that was over here off of A little over a decade ago, there was an oilspill. It wasn't any little oilspill; it was the Deepwater Horizon, the BP well that spewed at the surface. At the bottom of the ocean, which was a mile below the surface, it spewed out 5 million barrels of oil before they got it stopped. That was a rig that did not work. There was supposed to be what is called a blowout preventer that was to go in and clamp off the well, and there was a blowout. It was defective. It didn't close off that well at the wellhead 5,000 feet below the surface of the gulf. As a result, 5 million barrels of oil spilled.  What happened to Florida's economy, not even to speak of all the fishing over in Louisiana and Alabama and Mississippi? I will tell you what happened to Florida's economy. Oil came as far east as Pensacola Photographs of oil completely covering the sugary white sands of Pensacola Beach went around the world. So what did people do? For an entire tourist season, they didn't come to any of the beaches of the gulf coast because they thought there was oil on the beach.  Painfully, that experience--not even to speak of what has been done to our environment and how much oil is still sloshing around down there on the bottom of the gulf--painfully, that experience got in the minds of the businesses all up and down the gulf coast of  By the way, over on the east coast--had that oil ever gotten into a current called the Loop Current that comes down and becomes the Gulf Stream, that oil would have ruined the tourism industry all along Florida's southeast coast, from the Keys to Miami Beach, and all the way up to Fort Pierce,  Floridians feel fairly strongly about this. That is why we were fortunate, over a decade ago, in a bipartisan way, to pass a law to keep all of that area I just showed you off limits. We knew what would happen to our tourism--what people subsequently found out with the Deepwater Horizon oilspill--and we knew what would happen to threaten our national security by hampering our ability to do our training and testing.  So, voila, all of a sudden, the Trump administration announces last week that it is going to drill off all of I have sponsored legislation in the past. I have introduced bills to expand the moratorium on the gulf coast. I have sponsored other legislation to protect And today I am introducing another bill that would be a permanent ban on drilling off of Florida's coast for exactly the reasons I have just said.  Last week, when the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary Zinke, announced that they were opening up nearly all Federal waters, including all of those around Florida, we, of course, went into fighting mode again. We will fight this, and it will be defeated. It turns out that was just a political stunt because late yesterday--1 day after officially publishing the plan in the Federal Register--Secretary Zinke flew to Florida, met with the Governor of Florida for 20 minutes at the Tallahassee Airport, and suddenly announced that he had now decided to take Florida ``off the table.'' That sounds like a political stunt.  While many in Florida have seen right through this shameless political stunt, it has opened up a long list of other questions that I have now asked Secretary Zinke to answer in a letter I sent today.  What exactly does ``off the table'' mean? Is it the whole Eastern Gulf? Half of it? Is it 125 miles off the coast? Does it mean both coasts of Florida? Does it mean just one? What about the Straits of Florida, Secretary Zinke?  What about the seismic surveys? You all have said you are proceeding with that. Are those off the table too? If you are going to take Florida waters ``off the table'' in this little political stunt that was done 1 day after the Federal Register published this proposed rule, does that mean you are going to eliminate the seismic surveys? There is no reason to expose marine life and endangered species to the harmful impacts of seismic surveys if there aren't any actual plans to drill in the area. So, Mr.Secretary, are you taking those off the table?  What about your statement--it also included another caveat, Mr.You said you were ``removing Florida from consideration for any new oil and gas platforms.'' Well, all of us know that platforms are different from wellheads. So tell me, Mr.Secretary, does that mean there will still be drilling off the coast of Florida, but the platforms themselves might be located just to the west of the Military Mission Line, and the wellhead is going to be underneath and far from that prohibited line? Mr.Secretary, does your change of heart mean that the administration now supports the bipartisan efforts of the Florida delegation to extend the moratorium on drilling in the Eastern Gulf? That is the bill that I am introducing today, and it has been introduced by Congressman Castor in the House of  For every day that goes by without answers to these essential questions, the Secretary needs to add that much more time to the public comment period.  The Secretary's promise last night at the Tallahassee Airport, one day after publishing in the Federal Register that Florida is off limits--right now those are just empty words because the only real thing out there that exists is the law that prevents drilling off the gulf coast of Florida for the next 5 years.  The Secretary has proposed a 5-year plan to drill the rest of Florida and to start drilling in 2023 off the gulf coast of  There is also a law called the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which spells out a very specific process for developing lease sales in Federal waters. With all of this rush, and now saying that Florida is ``off the table,'' I fear this announcement of Secretary Zinke's is going to discourage Floridians from commenting on the proposal that was published just this Monday--the one that opened up Florida's entire coastline to drilling--because Floridians have been given false assurances that they are all in the clear. That brings us back to this political stunt: Design a plan for the entire United States, publish it on Monday, and take it back on Tuesday for Florida for political reasons.  Floridians should be aware and they should make their objections known because if they don't, then the administration will try to say that they never heard objections from It goes on and on--more political games.  Floridians aren't the only ones who need to know what this means. What about all the other States that have been affected? Did you hear that there is an uproar among the Governors of other coastal States that are in this drilling plan of the administration? They asked: Why, one day later, would you go to Florida and say ``We are eliminating it,'' but, Secretary Zinke, you didn't exempt my State--all the way from Maine in the North, all the way to Florida on the Atlantic coast,[[Page S141]]all the other Gulf States, and then to the west coast of the United States, California all the way up to the State of Washington? It is more games.  People in Maryland, people in Massachusetts, people in the Carolinas are really upset. They ask: Why don't you eliminate the drilling that you are proposing off my State? What about out in California and Oregon and the State of Washington?  The administration and Secretary Zinke shouldn't be playing politics with an issue that is so important to all of our futures, especially so to Florida's future.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgS139.txt,859,NIFLA V.

895,topic-id,465,"Mr.President, I would like to speak about net neutrality. If you don't know what that means, you really do when prompted because it means that when you turn on your phone, you go on the internet and you decide what you want to see, and what you want to see--or hear in the case of video--you have the right to have that access and to have it as speedily as any other content that is offered on the internet.  Entrepreneurs who are working out of the garage of their family home and who have a new idea and suddenly want to get it on the internet--because they are financially impaired since they are just starting out, they should have an opportunity, just as the big boys do, to get their ideas on the internet.  Within the obvious boundaries of what is appropriate in language, et cetera, you have a right to get the content that you want and to get that content unimpeded on these tablets we carry around in our pockets. That right to get that content is threatened, and it is threatened because the Federal Communications Commission, on a partisan vote of 3 to 2, has completely overturned the previous rules that had been set on a partisan vote the other way of 3 to 2.  At the end of the day, what it means is that those of us in this Chamber, led[[Page S6]]off first by the Commerce Committee, are going to need a legislative solution, but in the meantime, chaos has been thrown into the system. Now, as a result of the previous year's rules having been completely reversed, they are going to be all tangled up in Federal court, and we are going to go on and on and have this fight.

896,topic-id,525,"This article points out that net neutrality is widely popular. Eighty-three percent of the American public supports net neutrality. The other 17 percent--some of them say they don't. I don't know how they don't. But it is a pretty overwhelming majority--83 percent. But even among Republicans in the surveys that have been done, 76 percent of self-identified Republicans say they support net neutrality.  Here is the flaw in the process the FCC used. Twenty-four million comments came in from supposedly ``Americans'' that were filed either for or against the rulemaking. There is a problem in this record that was built because 2 million of those comments featured stolen identities. It was not a real person; it was somebody else's identity. Some of those identities were people who have long since died. Half a million comments were from Russian addresses. Fifty thousand consumer complaints were inexplicably missing from the record.  Let's take the part about Russian addresses. Is this beginning to tell us something that we know--that there was Russian interference in the last election? We also know from our intelligence community that there was Russian entrance into the voting records of some 20 Now we are seeing the Russian influence enter into the making of law--in this case, the rulemaking--trying to influence comments, whether they were comments for the rulemaking or against the rulemaking. It is another indication that Russia indeed is intending on distorting and influencing the daily operations at the microscopic level--not at the level of an election of a President but at the microscopic level of influencing the development of rules to carry out laws--in this case, a rule that the American people feel quite strongly about. Eighty-three percent are in favor of net neutrality--the opposite of what the Republican majority on the FCC has enacted.  Now we have at least 19 State attorneys general who have raised concerns. They even wrote to the Federal Communications Commission asking that the agency hold off on its vote to eliminate the net neutrality rules, which the Republican Chairman and the FCC majority promptly ignored. The FCC is refusing to even work with law enforcement to get to the bottom of this issue.  Shouldn't the fact that there are Russian bots and people, directed by the Kremlin, trying to influence our government processes--shouldn't that be something we ought to be working on with law enforcement?

1750,topic-id,717,"Mr.President, this Saturday, students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, are going to lead hundreds of thousands of Americans all around the country in calling for commonsense gun control measures at the March For Our  Since this terrible shooting in Parkland, FL, on Valentine's Day, we have seen students all across the country say: This is a movement that cannot be stopped, and, frankly, we owe it to the students--the next generation--to get this right in the policies and the laws we adopt.  Just a few weeks ago, I went to one of the student's homes in Parkland--a group of them. We talked. Indeed, just last week, a number of the students came to my office here in It is amazing that at 15, 16, and 17 years old, these students are looking to us in this Congress to, at a minimum, consider legislation that could have prevented the slaughter that happened in Parkland just a month ago.  In Florida, we have witnessed these students march on the State capitol and demand action. The legislature listened, in part. They made some changes in the law, like changing the age to 21 to buy an assault rifle. That is the same age in Florida law that says you can't buy a handgun until age 21. It was a small step, but it was a step in the right direction to address the problem we are confronting, but we need to do more.  I am so grateful for the resilience of these students, the power of their voices, and the strength of their activism, moving the lawmakers in Washington and in State capitals all across this country to act.  The students, the parents, the teachers, all of them we have asked: What do you want? And they say, obviously, we want commonsense things. We can start with universal background checks in the purchase of a weapon. That would then allow, universally, if you have a background check, you couldn't go to a gun show where there is not a federally licensed dealer and acquire a weapon without having a background check. Why is having a background check a commonsense thing to do? Because you not only pick up someone with a criminal record, you would pick up someone who had a restraining order for whatever reason--it could be mental, it could be domestic abuse. You would pick up somebody being on the terrorist watch list or you could pick up someone who had been on the terrorist watch list. That was the case with the killer in the Orlando Pulse Night Club shooting.  Clearly, that is a commonsense thing to approach this problem.  There is another commonsense thing; that is, these military assault rifles with the long--what I call the banana clips. These are clips that are shaped like a banana or even straight ones that hold 30 rounds. You know, there are State laws in the country that if you are going to hunt wild game, there are certain restrictions on the number of shells or bullets you can put in your gun. My goodness, why wouldn't we want to say there is a limitation on the number of bullets in a clip instead of these long clips that have 30 rounds?  It was used even in the shooting out in Arizona that our colleague Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was one of the victims of, and it was when the gunman was reloading with another clip that he was tackled to the ground; otherwise, there would have been more people who would have been harmed that day.  So it is another commonsense thing that people are asking for and that these students are bringing to light as they argue this case; that they don't want to be in a school where they have this kind of violence that is threatened. The students, the teachers, the parents just want our schools and our communities to be safe. As we have seen across the country, we have had too much violence with these military-style weapons. Nightclubs, churches, movie theaters, outdoor concerts--it goes on and on. Students want to feel safe, and what some students have witnessed is unimaginable.

The Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act would exempt from the      protections of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)      workers employed by tribal-owned and -operated commercial      enterprises located on tribal lands.

In      reaching this decision, the Board applied a test: the NLRA      will not apply if its application would ``touch exclusive      rights of self-governance in purely intramural matters.''      And, the NLRA will not apply if it would ``abrogate Indian      treaty rights.'' The Board also considered other factors,      including that the casino in question was a typical      commercial enterprise that catered to non-Native American      customers and employed non-Native While the Board      asserted NLRA protections in the San Manuel decision, it      ruled the opposite way, denying its jurisdiction in a      companion case (Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation, 341 NLRB      139 (2004)).       We understand the importance of tribal sovereignty and      support the principle in true self-governance matters. But      the fundamental human rights of employees are not the      exclusive concern of tribal enterprises or tribal      governments. While proponents of the bill falsely compare      tribal governments to state governments, they miss a glaring      truth: while state governments are exempt from NLRA      protections, their workers are eligible to vote for those who      set their labor laws. But the vast majority of the 600,000      casino workers who would be impacted by the Tribal Labor      Sovereignty Act are not Native Americans, and therefore have      no voice in the selection of those setting tribal policy nor      the ability to petition the tribal government to protect      their rights.       We object to a sweeping exemption of all tribal enterprises      from the NLRA, and believe the test used by the Board to      determine whether the NLRA is applicable should remain.

Another woman from Trussville talked about how the savings would help with tuition payments for her two college-age daughters. The ability to help with tuition payments was a common theme among my constituents.[[Page H1685]]  Another gentleman from Birmingham noted that his family used their larger paychecks to help pay for college and have placed additional money in savings.  A man from Hoover shared that he was able to make additional payments toward his mortgage principal, increase the amount he was contributing to his 401(k), and was able to take his wife out to dinner and a movie.  It seems the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts may be having an additional benefit for marriages in a way we hadn't considered.  Finally, another gentleman from my district noted, and I would like to quote him here: ``We now have an additional $250 a month thanks to the tax plan. We love the crumbs.''

Because, you see, I was sitting here as I listened to Barbara Lee, Sheila Jackson Lee, John Lewis, Terri Sewell, and Mr.Evans, that to whom much is given, much is expected.  I hear the story of the ``Boy From Troy.'' I hear the story of my chairman, Cedric But I have been fortunate in my life because, you see, I had a father who felt that the most important thing to do was to serve this country and this world. He instilled that in me. A lot of his teachings come from Martin Luther  Fifty years after his death, King's legacy has been shrouded in myth by people who prefer being comfortable to being real. Mr.Speaker, at this time, as young people back in my district say, I am going to keep it real. His personal truths have been twisted into lies by people who want to appear woke but whose eyes are blind to the harsh reality of injustice.  This year, in 2018, we must reclaim King's legacy for those who are apt to quote ``I Have a Dream'' as they seek to silence people of color for fighting to preserve that dream.  Mr.Speaker, King understood that nonviolence does not mean nonconfrontational. He knew that social change requires sacrifice. He knew that doing what is right does not mean doing what is always easy.  When Black Lives Matter protesters peacefully rally in the streets to protest police brutality against young men of color, conservatives and White moderates shout that Black Lives Matter incites violence and should be peaceful like  What they are really saying is: Sit down, boy, and know your place.  That is the same thing they said 55 years ago, when King led peaceful protests against racial injustice in Birmingham, Conservatives shouted that King was causing hatred and violence. They told him to sit down and to know his place, but he persisted. King was not in Birmingham to make everyone comfortable. He was there to upset the status quo and to change our democracy.  Then, 4 years later, King proclaimed that the Vietnam war was morally unjust. He pointed out that profit had become more important to the government than people who were sacrificing their lives overseas. Conservatives, once again, attacked They said he was being slanderous and that he was tragically misleading people.  Now, Mr.Speaker, you see the great outcry and support that we have for our soldiers and our military people now in this country. We honor and revere them now. That came out of the struggle of the Vietnam war, where they were spat on and told that they weren't worth anything. That is where it came from, King bringing up the unjust war that this was. So out of King's protests against the Vietnam war, we began a great reverence for our soldiers once again.  That is what we see now in the streets when we see a Vietnam vet and we tell them: Thank you for your service.  Or whether they were in Afghanistan: Thank you for your service.                              {time}  2015  It was King who first raised that issue. They told him to be quiet and to know his place. But like King told one of his friends at the time, he might have been politically unwise, but he was being morally wise, and that is what mattered. This year, in 2018, we must be morally wise.  King's life and legacy show us that doing right is rarely the same thing as doing what is easy. We, too, must persist.  As we head into a consequential year when Americans will go to the polls, let us not lose sight of the fact that to protect and preserve King's legacy demands that we protect and preserve our democracy from voter suppression, cybersecurity weakness, and foreign meddling.  We must expand voting rights for all  We must modernize our voting systems.  We must appoint an independent commission to investigate foreign meddling into the electoral system before the 2018 Federal election.  We must break down barriers to voting, not build them.  We must make registering to vote easier, not harder.  We must ensure elections are competitive, not guaranteed.  We must restore the right to vote, for felons who have served their prison sentences.  We must end partisan gerrymandering.  We must protect the sanctity of our elections.  We must restore the Voting Rights King knew that it was important.

Mr.Speaker, H.1486 would authorize the Department of Homeland Security's Nonprofit Security Grant Program, which awards grants to nonprofit organizations at risk of a terrorist attack, in statute.  Since early last year, nonprofit organizations throughout the United States have experienced an uptick in threats, vandalism, and violent acts. According to the Anti-Defamation League, anti-Semitic incidents jumped 67 percent from 2016 to the first three quarters of 2017. Many nonprofit organizations, however, do not have the resources to make their facilities more secure by installing proper surveillance, hardening their facilities, and undergoing general preparedness activities.  The need for nonprofit organizations across the country to have access to the Homeland Security grants to bolster security is substantial. Given the security challenges associated with the current terrorist threat environment, it is important that this critical Homeland Security grant program be codified in law.

The Jewish Federations      strongly endorse this bill, and respectfully urge Members of      the Committee to adopt Ranking Member Thompson's amendment of      the bill in the nature of a substitute, in order to align it      with 2011 of House-passed H.2825, the Department of      Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.       The vulnerability of places of worship to violent homegrown      extremists (HVEs) is a growing threat in the United      According to a joint assessment by the National      Counterterrorism Center, Department of Homeland Security      (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, HVEs are      increasingly favoring softer civilian targets, such as houses      of worship, having judged them to have lower levels of      security (and, for some, as a result of encouragement from      overseas violent extremists, such as ISIL).       Last month, the FBI released its annual hate crimes report      for 2016, which found that Muslim bias crimes increased ,      and, for the 20th consecutive year, anti-Jewish hate crimes      amounted to the majority of all religious bias crimes      reported. This year, synagogues, churches, mosques, religious      centers, cemeteries, and other nonprofits have been subjected      to arson/fire-bombing, shooting/mass shooting, attempted      bombing, death threats, robbery, vandalism/destruction of      property, hate-based/anti-Semitic graffiti, assault,      intimidation, and the targets of incitement to violence.       According to DHS, religious facilities share a number of      common vulnerabilities that make them ready targets of      attack, including unrestricted access to facilities and      contiguous and peripheral areas, easy identification,      predictable schedules, and large congregations of people. To      minimize these vulnerabilities, DHS recommends protective      measures that include, access controls, barriers, monitoring,      surveillance, and other physical target hardening and      preparedness investments, such as planning and training.      Unfortunately, DHS acknowledges that common vulnerabilities      also include the limited resources nonprofit institutions      have for security.       Passage of the amendment in the nature of a substitute to      H.1486 would address the vulnerabilities of at-risk      nonprofit institutions, by authorizing a nonprofit security      grant program for the acquisition and installation of      physical target hardening, including fencing, bollards, and      other barriers; lighting, surveillance, and metal detection      equipment; blast proofing doors and windows; cyber-security;      and related employee training and awareness exercises.       For these reasons, JFNA strongly endorses H.1486, and      respectfully urges Members of the Committee to adopt the bill      as amended.

1712,topic-id,1902,"Mr.President, it is not often I get to come to the U.Senate with an uplifted heart, but today I do. Yesterday, two-thirds of this body got together on an issue that is so important to Main Street America and agreed.  After weeks of negotiation and going back and forth, we passed a bipartisan banking bill, and I believe historians will look back on this week and this bill as being a watershed event. It was a measured bill. It didn't blow up Dodd-Frank; it didn't do away with it. It didn't go as far as some people wanted; it did more than others wanted, but two-thirds of us put the national interests above our own self-interests and passed a bill that will change the face of lending for small community banks and regional banks across our country.  Last year, when President Trump became President, he said: Job one is growing the economy. After 8 years of the lowest economic performance in our history, he knew that if you are ever going to deal with the long-term debt crisis we have, you have to first grow the economy. He was right. His instincts were exactly right on.  So what did we focus on? The President had us focus on regulations, energy, and taxes. I am happy to tell you, this body collectively agreed, and we got those things done. We reversed 860-some rules and regulations last year. We unleashed our energy potential, as the Presiding Officer knows very well. Late last year, we passed an earth-shattering, historic tax cut and tax modification bill that will unleash our potential and make us competitive with the rest of the world.  Why was all that necessary? Well, we had gone through an experiment where Big Government--more regulation and more control--was the call of the day, and we saw the result of that. So what we have been doing is, in a measured way, reversing many of those onerous fiscal policies that kept the monetary policy from igniting the economy again. That is all this is.  At the beginning of last year, some $7 trillion almost was not at work in our $20 trillion economy. That is historic. That is unbelievable. You can't even describe that to people outside this country. There was some $2 trillion on the balance sheets of the Russell 1000. That is now being employed. We see announcements every week where companies are announcing capital plans, capital expenditure plans, for the next few years largely as a result of the pullback on regulations last year.  Second, we see that by eliminating our archaic repatriation tax that was part of the tax bill, there is some $3 trillion of unrepatriated U.profits overseas, and most of that will be coming back. The banking bill we just did that reverses some of the more onerous provisions of Dodd-Frank on small banks and community banks will free up some $2 trillion potential in lending capacity. I think this is historic.  After Dodd-Frank, we created a two-street economy: We had Wall Street and we had Main I have a chart here that explains. This happens so often in Washington, where well-intended people who have very little experience in the free enterprise system make decisions that have unintended consequences--and this is one. Dodd-Frank was intended to rein in and control the big banks. Yet what it did inadvertently was penalize the small banks and make big banks better business.  This chart calls out--the way I would measure this is the lending activity. The dark blue line here shows, since the 2008 crisis, large business loans coming out of the major money-centered banks have increased dramatically. Even that hasn't driven the recovery we talk about because a lot of the job creation comes in smalltown America and small companies.  This light-blue line is small business loans, less than $1 million. We are not even back to where we were in 2008. We will be, now that this bill just passed, because it releases or changes the reserve requirements for small and community banks and regional banks. It also changes the definition of what is a regional bank and increases it to $250[[Page S1747]]billion from $50 billion. That lowers the regulatory burden and the cost of compliance for these small banks. That gets translated into money flow--cashflow--into businesses that create jobs.  This is an innovation economy. We know how to create jobs. We just need to get the Federal Government out of the way. One-size-fits-all regulations do not work. Yesterday, we pulled back on a blunt instrument law--Dodd-Frank--done with a supermajority, by the way. Dodd-Frank was totally ineffective and got the opposite result of what they really wanted.  Those small banks and community banks did nothing to cause the 2008 and 2009 crisis, but since Dodd-Frank was enacted, over 1,700 small banks, primarily, have gone out of business--1,700--many because they were unable to cope or afford to comply with the 2,319 pages and 390 new regulations imposed by Dodd-Let me say that again: 390 new regulations were imposed by Dodd-My goodness.  These small banks had nothing to do with the crisis of 2008. Many of these banks were community and regional banks that actually support small businesses on Main Street, give small businesses the needed capital, and sponsor Little League baseball parks. I grew up in a Little League baseball park sponsored by the three banks in my hometown. My father was a board member of one of those small banks. I remember those days. They were involved in the community. When you borrowed money from them, they knew you personally. What we have done is created an environment that just shut down lending activity in these small banks.  Small business lending--which we all know is a driver in every recovery since World War II--took nearly 8 years to barely get back to where we were in 2008, and I am not sure we are totally there, if you go across the board, entirely.  I am so glad to stand here and say that finally the U.Senate took action. I am also proud to say, even though it didn't go as far as I would like, that we got to a measured approach here that both sides could agree.  I remind everybody in this body that two-thirds of us agreed to this. I can't think of another issue that has come before this body. I think we had one vote, 98 to 2, to allow the head of the VA to run his human resources practices the way people in the real world do, and we have seen over 1,500 people now replaced at the VA to clean that place up. I can't think of another thing that has brought us together like this because we all know small banks have been inappropriately affected by Dodd- Republicans and Democrats proved this week, and over the past several weeks, that we can put our self-interests aside and get to the better good. I am proud to be a part of this. That is why I ran for the That is why the Presiding Officer ran. We didn't come up here to not get anything and to just get reelected. The American people are fed up. That is how Donald Trump got elected That is how I got elected.  I would dare say, the American people have the right idea about the future of America, if we would just listen to them. Nobody has all the right answers, but freeing up capital right now to put to work in our economy is the only way we are going to grow this economy north of 3 percent, and I believe we can breathe life back into our rural communities.  I had lunch yesterday with the Secretary of They are focused on redeveloping our rural communities that have been ignored for the last decade. These communities share the values that built Yet they have been ignored by past administrations that led to big city, big urban focus. I think this bill, more than anything else we have done since I have been in the Senate, will actually breathe life back into those rural communities.  I applaud our Democratic partners across the aisle. Seventeen of them took the heat from their own party and from K Street and from the vested lobbyists who did not want this to happen. I applaud them for their courage and for standing up for the people back home. That is what we are here to do. It doesn't always work out this way, but sometimes 15 or 16 of our Republican Party will work with them and get a bill they want to do. That is what this Senate body is supposed to do.  I know there are some on the other side of the aisle who really want a one-size-fits-all bigger government and more intrusion. We heard the speeches this week: It is going to be so draconian. They just don't understand how this bill will breathe life back into capital formation, which is the cornerstone of a capitalistic society, but I believe most people in America have seen the dark side. They have seen the punitive nature of large regulatory bodies by a Federal Government that wants to dominate every aspect of our life, and Dodd-Frank was one of the ramifications of that--accomplished, as I said, only during a supermajority.  The irony of Dodd-Frank is that it is just another example of Washington overreach that hurts the very people it claims to champion and fails to help the working middle class. We see from this chart, large businesses had no problem getting loans, but the small startup entrepreneur is having trouble today, and that is what this bill goes a long way toward helping to alleviate. Small businesses should look at this and say: We are back in business. We are open for business. I believe this will breathe life back into many communities around our country.  Community and regional banks and, by extension, communities and small businesses across the country have been unduly punished for something they had nothing to do with. It is time to correct that, and this bill does that.  I am proud to be a Member of the U.Senate today. I haven't said that many times here. I am proud because we took action, we put our self-interests aside, and this is exactly the kind of result the American people want us to deliver.  This rollback--which I believe is very measured--combined with last year's regulatory rollback, President Trump's steps to unleash our energy potential and, yes, our historic tax bill, go a long way to be a big win for our economy. It sends a message to the rest of the world.  I am hopeful the House is going to pass this bill as soon as possible and that President Trump is going to be able to sign it into law very soon.

557,topic-id,538,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize the 200th anniversary of Macomb County, Situated along Lake Saint Clair in the southeast corner of Michigan, Macomb County is built on industry and entrepreneurship and populated with dedicated citizens and entrepreneurs.  French fur trappers were the first Europeans to arrive in the area during the 17th century, and when they recognized the possibilities presented to them within the area's marshes, they sought new opportunities for trade. Moravian missionaries later established the first organized, non-native settlement in the area in 1782 as a refuge for Native Americans who had converted to Christianity along the banks of the Clinton In March 1780, Christian Clemens purchased a distillery, which is considered the first building on the site of the future city of Mount The next year, he bought 500 acres for development, and the site became known as High On January 15, 1818, Macomb County was formally organized as the third county in the Michigan territory and was named in honor of General Alexander Macomb, a highly decorated veteran of the War of 1812. High Banks was platted as the Village of Mount Clemens and named the county seat.  Starting in the early 1800s and continuing until 1840, settlers began moving into the interior of the county and carved out farms from the hardwood forests. Families began focusing on agriculture as the roots of county villages and towns began to be established by this time. Germans, Belgians, and other Europeans also began joining the original French and English settlers during this time. During the 1870s, mineral baths brought international fame to Mount Clemens as many thought the waters had healing powers, though interest in the spas eventually died out in the early 20th century.  Between 1920 and 1930, Macomb County saw its first population spike when it more than doubled from 38,000 to 77,000. This was caused by the establishment of Selfridge Field in 1917, now the Selfridge Air National Guard Base, and the beginning of the migration of automotive workers moving out of the city of During the 1940s and 1950s, the suburbs again saw a population increase but the largest instance of growth occurred between 1950 and 1970, when more than 440,000 moved to Macomb County and helped make it one of Michigan's largest counties.  Today Macomb County encompasses 27 local municipalities that nearly 1 million Michiganders call home. Like our country, its people come from different backgrounds and ethnicities and share many different cultures. There are robust urban clusters, a prosperous manufacturing and economic industry throughout that is home to more than 18,000 businesses, and beautiful natural features and agricultural lands in the north. All of this has contributed to Macomb County having over 865,000 residents, making it the third most populated county in our great  Macomb County has been an integral part of Michigan and our great Nation for 200 years. As a fifth generation Michigander living in the southeast Michigan area, I am honored to ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating this significant milestone for one of Michigan's most important and storied counties and all those fortunate enough to call it home.

1710,topic-id,672,"Mr.President, I rise today to honor Michigan's farmers. Agriculture is a vital part of Michigan's economy. Our State is home to more than 51,000 farmers who contribute[[Page S1746]]over $100 billion to the Nation's economy.  Michigan is also the second most diverse farm State in the Nation, growing more than 300 commodities, including a significant portion of our Nation's milk, corn, cherries, cucumbers, and much more.  Michigan farmers and farmers across our country feed the Nation and the world, and we must do what we can to support them. Our agricultural businesses rely on the ability to access the resources they need to keep growing, creating jobs, and contributing to our national economy.  Access to these resources can be especially challenging for new farm operations that are just getting started, including small farms that make up 82 percent of Michigan's agricultural producers. Small farms that are just starting out and are facing tough economic conditions sometimes struggle to have access to affordable credit. These businesses rely upon important services provided by the Farm Service Agency, which works with lenders to guarantee and deliver small-dollar loans to the small farmers who need it most.  Farm Service Agency loans and guarantees can help farmers cover urgent operating costs like feed, seed, and fertilizer to get them through the season. Without these loans, farmers could lose their ability to purchase equipment and other necessities for the planting season and could be forced to curtail their operations.  Currently, more than 2,300 farms in Michigan have Farm Service Agency loans, totaling more than $630 million. Across the country last year, the Farm Service Agency made and guaranteed almost 40,000 loans, totaling over $6 billion.  This program is in such high demand that in 2016, the Farm Service Agency ran out of money to finance operating loans. This included more than 1,000 loans that have already been approved. This led to a backlog, and farmers were forced to wait for months until Congress passed emergency funding to get the loans they needed for their day-to-day operations.  Access to capital is critical across a range of businesses, but it is incredibly important for our small farmers. They can lose out on an entire growing season if they can't buy the equipment and the supplies they need while they wait on Congress to fund the Farm Service  This year the FSA loan programs are again on track to exceed available funding, and if that happens, farmers will again be stuck waiting on Congress to receive the loan they deserve and need.  That is why I introduced bipartisan legislation this week with my colleague, Senator David Perdue of Georgia, to provide greater flexibility to the FSA loan program to continue serving farmers during periods of high demand.  My bill--the Farm Service Agency Loan Flexibility Act--would allow the FSA program to increase its loan authority in years when the demand for loans unexpectedly exceeds the supply of funding.  The legislation would enable FSA to increase the available loan funding by up to 25 percent for the fiscal year for self-funding loans and guarantees that do not require appropriation. It would also authorize FSA to increase the loan cap by up to 25 percent for FSA direct loans that require budget authority and would allow FSA to draw stopgap funding for these direct loans from the Commodity Credit  I am proud to have the support of the Michigan Farm Bureau, the Michigan Agri-business Association, the American Bankers Association, and the National Farmers Union, among many others.  Like our small businesses, students, and families, America's farmers deserve to have affordable loan options. They deserve our attention and they deserve our support.  I urge my colleagues to support the Farm Service Agency Loan Flexibility Act to help meet the financial needs of our farming communities as they support and sustain us each and every day.

H.4545 is designed to address enduring concerns about the lack of consistency and quality in the bank examination process. The current exam process can be both opaque and secretive. Coupling this with overburdensome regulations and increased compliance costs have forced many community banks and credit unions to close up shop or reduce their ability to provide for consumers.  Look no further than my State, North Carolina, which has lost about 50 percent of its banks since the financial crisis. In my own city of Charlotte, a decade ago, we had six community banks.

97,topic-id,2315,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to oppose the bill before us that takes away National Labor Relations Act protections for hundreds of thousands of workers.  I support Tribal sovereignty. In my home State of Wisconsin, I am proud the Ho-Chunk Nation is in my district. Potawatomi, Oneida, Menominee, Croix, Stockbridge-Munsee, Lac du Flambeau, Lac Corte Oreilles, Red Cliff, Bad River, and other Tribes all reside in my home State, and I am glad to support the autonomy of those Tribal nations. But this bill isn't about Tribal sovereignty. It is about going after workers' rights.  Look at the track record of the majority in this The Republicans have continued to go after workers' rights, as they have so far. They have repealed the rule that required companies seeking large Federal contracts to disclose violations of labor law. They made it harder for people whose jobs are shipped overseas to get unemployment insurance. They have made it harder for workers whose employers don't offer retirement plans to save for retirement. They have repealed an OSHA rule requiring employers to maintain accurate records of serious workplace injuries for 5 years, while the administration drastically reduces the number of OSHA inspectors.  This bill isn't about meaningful sovereignty. It is about selective sovereignty, because it only goes after labor rights.  If this were a bill about sovereignty, it would include a number of other areas that Tribes are compelled to follow in addition to the National Labor Relations Act: the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA; the Family and Medical Leave Act; and the public accommodations of Americans with Disabilities Act, just to start.  If this bill was about sovereignty, it would exempt OSHA and ERISA and the FMLA and the ADA, for starters. But it doesn't do that. This bill only exempts labor protections for hundreds of thousands of workers, Tribal members and nonmembers, because the majority in this Congress isn't really worried about sovereignty. It is concerned[[Page H119]]about taking away the rights of workers, and that is what this bill is really about.  Mr.Speaker, if this body wants to help Tribes, I am here to help. Bring a bill to the floor that covers all exempted areas, and that is a bill that I could support. But that is not what is in front of us today.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record letters of opposition from the International Union of Operating Engineers, the United Auto Workers, United Food and Commercial Workers, and Unite                                            International Union of                                          Operating Engineers,                                  Washington, DC, January 8, 2018.     Paul Ryan,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The International      Union of Operating Engineers opposes the Tribal Labor      Sovereignty Act, legislation contained in 140 (115-54)      that would eliminate the labor protections currently      guaranteed to hundreds of thousands of American workers.      Indeed, if enacted into law, this bill would constitute the      biggest rollback in labor law since the passage of the Taft-     Hartley Act in 1947.       The International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE)      represents nearly 400,000 men and women across North      Members of the International Union of Operating Engineers      maintain and operate Native American and non-Native American      gaming facilities around the United States, from Connecticut      to California, and this legislation would have a dramatic      effect on their lives and livelihoods. The IUOE is the      second-biggest union in the hospitality sector. But this      legislation extends beyond casinos and gaming. IUOE members      work in mining and energy facilities on Native American lands      in a number of locations, and those workers eventually could      lose their rights as a result of this legislation.       In a few short words, this bill changes current law by      exempting the National Labor Relations Act from tribal      enterprises on tribal lands. Today, the National Labor      Relations Board (Board) implements a case-by-case review of      whether labor law applies to tribal enterprises.       The precedent-setting case that comes from the San Manuel      Band of Mission Indians is instructive. The Tribe operated a      92,000-sq.ft. casino (over two acres), with 1,400 employees.      Only five of the workers were Native The Board      determined that this large commercial establishment should      not receive the exemption from labor law provided to states      and local government because its operations were      fundamentally different than a government. The San Manuels      were not providing a public good to members of the tribe.      They were not behaving like a government. Instead, the Board      determined that when the tribal operation in question is      commercial in nature, employs significant numbers of non-     Indians, and caters to a non-Native American clientele, ``the      special attributes of sovereignty are not implicated.'' The      Board determined that private labor law applies to the San      Manuel casino, just as it would with any other commercial      operation. Federal courts have supported this interpretation.      Sovereignty does, however, apply to governmental functions of      the tribe, just as they would with any state government.       If passed, the exemption from labor law would unfairly      advantage commercial tribal operations at the expense of non-     Native American private-sector companies. Competitors with      Native American commercial operations must comply with labor      law; Native American operations will not. As mentioned above,      the bill's reach extends well beyond the gaming industry.      Tribes are engaged in a variety of commercial enterprises,      from mining and energy development, to manufacturing and      construction. Over time, it is reasonable to expect that      tribal enterprises will expand and compete more aggressively      with non-Native companies in a wide variety of commercial      sectors, without any concern for the rights of workers.       Tribal labor law is woefully inadequate--virtually non-     existent in most tribes around the country. It is no      replacement for the nation's basic legal framework that      protects workers' rights. Eliminating the NLRA for tribal      enterprises will strip away freedoms guaranteed to Americans      today, including hundreds of thousands of workers at tribal      casinos who are not Native 140 (115-54) would      immediately eliminate the rights of thousands of Operating      Engineers in workplaces all over the United       The International Union of Operating Engineers opposes      140 (115-54), which eliminates nearly one-million workers'      individual right to take collective action to improve their      working conditions, and respectfully urges you to oppose it      when it comes to the floor of the House of Representatives on            Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than one million      active and retired members of the International Union, United      Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of      America (UAW), I urge you to vote against 140, because it      includes provisions from the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act      (H.986). This misguided bill would deny protection under      the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to hundreds of      thousands of workers employed by tribal casinos. This      legislation could also impact dozens of other businesses,      including power plants, mining operations, and hotels.       UAW believes strongly in tribal sovereignty and has a      strong record of supporting civil rights. This bill, however,      is misleading. It is an attack on fundamental collective      bargaining rights and would strip workers in commercial      enterprises of their rights and protections under the      Under the terms of this bill, when a labor contract expires,      a tribe could unilaterally terminate the bargaining      relationship with the union without legal consequence under      the NLRA, because the employer's obligation to bargain could      be eliminated. As a result of having a union and a legally      binding contract, hundreds of dealers have been promoted to      benefited and supervisory positions because of provisions in      the contract that maintain minimum percentages of full-time,      part-time, and supervisory positions. Work rules, wages, and      benefits have all improved because of the right to      collectively bargain. This bill would jeopardize these hard-     fought gains.       The Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act seeks to overturn a      decision by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in San      Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino, 341 NLRB 138 (2004). In      that decision, the Board concluded that applying the NLRA      would not interfere with the tribe's autonomy and the effects      of the NLRA would not ``extend beyond the tribe's business      enterprise and regulate intramural matters.'' The ruling does      not apply in instances where its application would ``touch      exclusive rights of self-governance in purely intramural      matters'' or ``abrogate Indian treaty rights.'' The NLRB has      taken a nuanced view on this matter and has ruled on a case-     by-case basis. Congressional interference is not justified.       Supporters of the bill argue that the bill creates parity      for the tribes with state and local governments who are not      covered under the However, there are some significant      differences. Tribes are exempt from employment laws (Title      VII of the Civil Rights Act) that apply to state and local      governments, whereas private sector contractors work      extensively on behalf of state and local governments and      generally must comply with the Non-tribal members      cannot petition a tribe for labor legislation, while workers      employed by a state or local government have a voice with      their elected leaders. This is significant because 75 percent      of Native American gaming employees are not tribal members.      At Foxwoods, where the UAW represents the workers, well over      98 percent of employees and patrons are not tribal members.      Hundreds of tribal gaming facilities make tens of billions in      revenue annually, and these employees are working for what is      simply a commercial operation competing with non-tribal      businesses.       At a time of growing wealth inequality and a shrinking      middle class, the last thing Congress should do is deprive      workers of their legally enforceable right to form unions and      bargain collectively. We urge you to oppose 140.           Sincerely,                                                      Josh Nassar,     Legislative                                  ____                                                         UFCW,                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2018.     To All Members of the U.House of       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.3 million members      of United Food and Commercial Workers International Union      (UFCW), I am writing to express our strong opposition to the      Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act as rolled into a bill that will      be reported as 140.       UFCW is proud to represent 1,000 members at casinos that      operate on tribal lands. These workers have joined together      to bargain collectively for good wages, decent benefits, and      a voice on the job. Passage of the Tribal Labor Sovereignty      Act would take that voice away.       We support sovereignty for tribal governments, but the      Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act is so broad that it would      prevent any worker from exercising their freedom of      association under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).      The vast majority tribal casino workers are not tribal      members and therefore have no voice in tribal policy and are      not protected under tribal law.       Most federal laws protecting the workplace apply to tribal      businesses including the Employee Retirement Income Security      Act (ERISA), Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), the      Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and The NLRA should      not be treated any differently than these other important      laws that protect workers.       There are many differences between state and local      governments and tribal businesses. State and local      governments do not operate multi-billion dollar commercial      Enterprises, nor manage enterprises where the majority of the      employees and customers are from outside of the jurisdiction.      If working people don't like state and local government      policy[[Page H120]]     they can change management by voting for different lawmakers,      while non-tribal employees and customers have no meaningful      way to influence tribal policy.       Congress should be working to expand the rights of American      workers, not take them away. We urge you to stand up for      American workers and oppose the Tribal Labor Sovereignty           Sincerely,                                               Anthony Perrone,     International                                  ____                                                  UNITE HERE!,                                                     Las Vegas, NV       Dear Representative: UNITE HERE represents over 275,000      hardworking men and women in the hospitality industry and      strongly urges you to oppose the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act      (H.986).       Like most Americans, our members have a deep respect for      Native Americans and their role in shaping our nation. Our      members also have a deep and abiding respect for the rights      of American workers and to uphold the laws that govern our      nation and all of its citizens.       This brings me to H.986. This bill would exempt all      businesses owned and operated by Indian nations from the      National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Tribal businesses,      including but not limited to Indian-owned casinos, have      workforces and customers that are almost all non-If      this bill were to become law, American citizens working for      Native American businesses would lose their U.rights under      the NLRA, including ``full freedom of association'' and      ``self-organization'' without ``discrimination.'' Over the      last 30 years, as Indian enterprises entered the stream of      interstate commerce, a number of federal laws protecting the      workplace have been applied to Indian businesses: Employee      Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), Occupational Safety      and Health Act (OSHA), Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and      National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Congress should not      treat the rights Americans have under the NLRA any      differently than these other important laws that protect      American workers.       Much has been made of the need for this bill to give tribal      governments ``parity'' with state and local governments. This      comparison is misleading, if not absurd. States and local      governments do not typically operate multi-billion dollar      commercial enterprises. States and local governments do not      typically run enterprises where the overwhelming majority of      the government's employees are from outside of their      jurisdiction and the overwhelming majority of customers are      also from outside of their jurisdiction. In a state or      locality, if the citizens who live there don't like the      government's policies, they can vote for people to change      those policies. The non-tribal employees and customers have      no meaningful way to influence tribal policies.       In this time of incredible income inequality in our      country, Congress should be working to expand the rights of      American workers, not finding ways to take them away. H.     986 is no different than the laws signed by Governors Scott      Walker (R-WI) and Rick Snyder (R-MI): they attack the basic      rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain.       Please stand up for American workers and join our union to      oppose H.986.           Sincerely,                                                         ",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgH114-2.txt,2171,ALLEVIATING STRESS TEST BURDENS TO HELP INVESTORS ACT,2018.0,10.0,January

1582,topic-id,863,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding me the time, and I thank the chairman for moving this very important piece of legislation through our committee, the Financial Services Committee, and onto the floor.  This is a commonsense bill, Mr.Speaker, that I encourage everybody, Republicans and Democrats, to support, H.4566.  Throughout the great State of Maine and across America, Mr.Speaker, we have millions and millions of small[[Page H1714]]savers and small investors who are planning for their retirement or for the college education for their kids or their grandkids.  The people of Maine, Mr.Speaker, are the most honest and hardworking folks you can find anywhere, and every week thousands and thousands of Maine families are setting aside small parts of their paychecks into an IRA or a 401(k) plan so they will have enough money for their retirement, or setting aside small amounts of money for their son or their daughter to attend a college, a community college, a university, or a technical school.  Today, Mr.Speaker, almost 55 percent of all American families, about 100 million of our fellow Americans, entrust these savings to mutual funds and other pension advisers such that they are able to grow and to provide them with a larger nest egg down the road.  These asset managers, Mr.Speaker, are currently operating under the uncertainty of whether or not they will be subjected to very costly and, in many cases, unnecessary stress test regulations which are designed for large money center banks with very different functions in our economy.  Mr.Speaker, when a bank takes in deposits from its customers, it is obligated to return those deposits and, hopefully, with interest. Now, it is important that those banks have enough reserves to make sure that, during a recession, they are able to meet those obligations. For many of these banks, stress testing does make sense.  However, Mr.Speaker, mutual fund and other asset managers perform a very different function. If one invests for their retirement or their college savings, their goal is to grow that nest egg, but it is not guaranteed to be the case by the asset managers who are performing that job. In effect, Mr.Speaker, these asset managers of mutual funds serve as an agent for the investor and the small saver, with no liability to return these savings in full; but, of course, they take the risk for a better return down the road.  Now, if you do have a huge money center bank with tentacles running throughout the economy and that bank fails, it could represent a systemic risk to our economy. But investors in a poorly performing mutual fund are simply able to switch their account to a better performing mutual fund house in order for a better return down the road with no systemic risk to the economy, in part, Mr.Speaker, because the assets themselves are held at a bank custodian. They are not even held at the mutual fund company or at the asset management firm.  Now, my bill, Mr.Speaker, H.4566, exempts most nonbank financial institutions, like mutual funds, from costly stress test requirements. And this, Mr.Speaker, is so important to our small savers across the country because, when you have costly, cumbersome, and unnecessary regulations, they are paid for by the savers in these mutual funds and by these pension fund investors. And when they are paid out of their rate of return, their rates of return drop, and, therefore, the value of their nest eggs drop.  Mr.Speaker, government should be in the job of helping our families live better lives with more financial security, and H.4566 helps us do just that by removing one-size-fits-all regulations that fit for lots of banks but not for the asset management community.  Today, Mr.Speaker, approximately 4 percent of the expenses of asset managers are for complying with regulations. If we do nothing, that number is expected to go up to 10 percent of their expenses, just on compliance, within 5 years. Now, that makes a big difference because the higher the expenses, the lower the rate of return, the smaller the nest egg for those who are saving for college or for retirement.  To give support to my point, Mr.Speaker, for the past 10 years, economists at our own Securities and Exchange Commission and at our own Treasury have not been able to design a stress test for asset managers and for thousands and thousands of mutual fund companies across the country, and that is because it makes no sense to try to do so.  Stress testing as a prudential regulation simply does not fit every participant in the United States financial services sector. There are intrinsic differences between banks and asset managers, and my bill, Mr.Speaker, recognizes that difference and properly exempts most nonbank financial institutions from stress tests. That, in turn, again, Mr.Speaker, will lower the cost and increase the rates of return for Main Street investors across our great State of Maine and across  Mr.Speaker, I thank you very much for the opportunity to address this very important issue, and I encourage everyone, Republicans and Democrats, both sides of the aisle, to please vote ``yes'' for H.4566, Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors  ",CREC-2018-03-20-pt1-PgH1712-2.txt,2247,IRAN,2018.0,20.0,March

It is very important for all of us to consider this.  Now, Mr.Speaker, we all know what we want in this country, which are more opportunities and more jobs for our kids--better opportunities for our kids so they will have better lives and more freedom. This cannot happen, Mr.Speaker, unless our businesses are able to grow and hire more individuals and pay them more.  Now, that mostly can only happen, Mr.Speaker, if businesses are able to more easily borrow money. The chairman and I both know that the government's job is to help our economy grow, not get in the way.  That is why A+ cuts through the red tape such that more small- and medium-sized businesses are able to access capital, grow their operations, and hire more people. In a sense, A+ has implemented, Mr.Speaker, billions of dollars of new financing and has led economic growth in small to medium businesses to grow and present more opportunities for their workers. So A+ works. We know that because the evidence is there.  With that, Mr.Speaker, I would like to close by saying, Mr.MacArthur's bill is a commonsense technical adjustment to a bill--a rule, rather, that works. It simply increases the amount that companies are able to borrow under this rule that works.  Please, everybody, Republicans and Democrats, support Mr.MacArthur's bill.

848,topic-id,1806,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, over 3 months ago, the funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, expired. Today, families throughout the country, including 90,000 children in my home State of Colorado, face great uncertainty about the future of their healthcare.  When CHIP was first passed, over 20 years ago, it was done in a bipartisan manner, and, until recently, CHIP has always been a bipartisan, nondivisive issue. It is unfortunate to see that, today, here, we are in this body under Republican leadership and, somehow, even children's health insurance has become a political football while we while away our time, our precious legislative time, on bills that have passed this body before and don't go anywhere.  In our most recent Band-Aid for government funding, House Republicans made a claim that CHIP was extended until March 31, but that wasn't the case. By some reports, States could run out of funding in the next few weeks. In fact, in Colorado, our own budget experts predict the State will run out of children's health insurance money by the end of Cancellation letters are literally scheduled to go out at the end of this month.  Mr.Speaker, this simply isn't a way to govern, crisis to crisis, ignoring the real issues people care about in order to consider special interest legislation. Republican leadership and the Trump administration continue to refuse to work on finding a bipartisan solution for the hundreds of thousands who have Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival--or DACA recipients--who are in limbo. We can simply put that bill on the floor today, the Dream Act, and I feel it would pass.  We have the votes to do so, Mr.Let's simply have a vote. It is a purely manufactured crisis.  I am happy to say we will be giving the opportunity for Members of this body to defeat the previous question and move to a vote on the Dream Act, shortly. My colleague, Mr.Correa, has joined us to offer that motion in a few minutes.  Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle often say that the real deadline for a DACA solution isn't until March, but, in reality, every day, already over 100 Deferred Action recipients lose their protected status, are unable to work with their situation unresolved.  For those DACA recipients, the deadline isn't The deadline has already passed, hence, the urgency. Now is the time to pass the Dream Act, to allow these DACA recipients to continue to live and work and serve in the only Nation that many of them have ever known their whole lives.  All the while, congressional Republicans still refuse to work with Democrats on a long-term government funding solution. Here we are less than 10 days from another government shutdown. The Federal Government continues to move from quick spending patch to quick spending patch, costing taxpayers more in the long run by preventing our agencies from doing the planning necessary to improve efficiency.  Today we are only 5 legislative days away--9 actual days--from a government shutdown and the huge negative repercussions that would follow. As a former businessowner, I know, firsthand, the value of long-term budgeting and stability. Millions of Americans know how to plan their family budget and their home budget. Why can't Congress do it for the country?  Instead of working on a long-term budget solution, the House is spending its time on other legislation. Here we have a bill that undermines workers' rights and their protections under the National Labor Relations  In addition to this controversial bill, there are two attached pieces of legislation that were originally separate[[Page H98]]bills that easily could have gone on the suspension calendar and would have largely been noncontroversial. They passed on unanimous consent in the Senate and in the House Natural Resources Committee, but their fate is put in jeopardy by putting them onto a controversial bill.  The first bill amends the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of 2010. To clarify, that is a separate economic development fund known as the WMAT settlement fund that can be accessed to cover potential cost overruns for this rural water project.  The Interior Department has said it is unsure if the settlement fund could be used for additional costs, and so this clarifies that water-related economic development projects would specifically include the planning, design, and construction of the rural water system. This legislation could have passed and, likely, could have become law but, instead, has been put into jeopardy by affixing it to a bill that is unlikely to go anywhere.  The second uncontroversial bill that is wrapped up is regarding the authority of pueblos. It concerns two New Mexican pueblos and simply clarifies that they could lease their lands that are held in trust by the Federal Government for 99 years. This legislation ensures Native Americans have the right to their lands that they deserve. It respects their sovereignty and nations in a noncontroversial way.  I am fully supportive of these two technical and simple pieces of legislation, but, unfortunately, because they are attached to a bill that isn't going anywhere, are very unlikely to become law.  These are the types of bills that could go straight to the suspension calendar and straight through the Senate and should be signed by the President, but, instead, they are being put in jeopardy by lumping them in with a bill that is unlikely to become law.  There are so many of these types of Natural Resources Committee bills from both Democrats and Republicans that should be making their way forward as stand-alone items.  I am glad, for instance, that one that I authored, my Bolt's Ditch and the WEDGE Act--actually, two that I authored--were put forward and passed by this House and not attached to other controversial legislation.  I am also reintroducing, soon, a bicameral bill that I also consider noncontroversial, the Continental Divide Wilderness, Recreation and Camp Hale Legacy Act bill. It would preserve over 90,000 acres of wilderness and recreation lands in Summit and eastern Eagle Counties, and is endorsed by local businesses, commissioners, and towns across the area.  It was crafted with input from dozens of stakeholder groups, including the Wilderness Society, Vail Resorts, the Outdoor Industry Association, the International Mountain Bicycling Association, Conservation Colorado, and many municipalities and local businesses. It will help sustain our recreational economy in Eagle and Summit Counties, protect watersheds, and preserve important wildlife corridors and tourism opportunities.  These are the kinds of bills that we should be moving forward from the Natural Resources Committee, not controversial bills that actually take away the rights of American citizens, including Native American citizens.  And, while we are not today, we should never be moving forward on Natural Resources Committee bills that actually whittle away at the public lands we all own and the Antiquities Act by shrinking monuments like Bears Ears or making it easier to destroy lands we cherish and value.  All I ask is that we separate out these two Natural Resources bills, send them to the suspension calendar, and not let them be put in jeopardy by affixing them to the fundamental underlying legislation which is controversial, namely, the Tribal labor bill. That is the bill that is the main controversial bill in this package.  And, of course, I stand here as a supporter of the rights of every American to organize. I am a supporter of workers' rights, and I am also a strong supporter of Tribal sovereignty, not only principles under American law, but the right thing to do.  I, like many of my colleagues, place a great deal of importance in Tribal self-determination, autonomy, local control, and independent governance for our nations. In fact, I have been the champion of sovereignty, and I have long voted in favor of legislation that allows Tribal discretion in the judicial processes and in education.  But, of course, the right to organize is an inalienable right of every American, protecting our workers, including Native American workers, to fight for a safe working environment regardless of what entity owns the company they work for. Legislation balancing these two competing principles is possible.  Reconciling these two priorities can be difficult, but I think that there is a way to do it. Instead, this bill drives a wedge between issues or groups that have a history of working strongly together, such as Native Americans and labor unions.  We can balance critical rights to sovereignty with the protections that are due to every American citizen regardless of their race, ethnicity, cultural practices, membership in an Indian nation, or governing structures. This legislation does not find the right balance. It hurts workers of all stripes and colors, including many Native American workers.  Workers have the right to collectively bargain; otherwise, workplaces become unsafe, sexual harassment can go unchecked, and the income gap continues to widen. This legislation would strip Native Americans and non-Native Americans, many of whom work for Native American enterprises, of the right to collectively bargain.  Without the right to self-governance, we would not have the strong communities present across the country today. Without the right to collective bargaining, we would not have the strong and growing economy that supports our middle class. This legislation simply does not succeed in balancing both of these values.  I also want to point out that President Trump agrees with me, or at least he did last time he commented on this 25 years ago. In 1993, at a hearing before the House Committee on Natural Resources regarding the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, then private citizen Trump testified regarding the legal barriers facing labor unions at that time to organize workers employed at Tribal casinos. His testimony said, in part: ``At present, even union workers in States like New Jersey would have no federally or State protected rights or the ability to organize in casinos on Tribal lands. The unions hope to do something about this. They hope to gain the right to recognition, the right to organize if they so choose. Quite frankly, I hope they have better luck than we have had so far.''  Mr.Speaker, the last time the President commented on this, it is clear that he also believed that workers on Tribal land should have the right to collectively bargain. I hope that his administration would not be supportive of this legislation if it were to move through Congress, which it is unlikely to do.  Instead of policies that benefit those at the top, I have a number of ideas that I will be talking about later that we can move forward to empower workers and help make sure that the 21st century economy works for everyone.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgH96-5.txt,1910,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2018.0,10.0,March

854,topic-id,1385,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to address some of the things that my colleague, Mr.Cole, said. The big difference here between Tribal-owned and -run businesses and State and local governments is that State and local governments are not generally in the business of owning/operating companies. With very few exceptions, we don't have a socialist form of government in this country where cities or States are actually operating businesses in competition with the private sector.  Tribes, in addition to their Tribal workers, which are more analogous to State or local workers--and it is an appropriate discussion--also happen to own businesses, which is fine, and they produce revenue for the Tribes, which is great. However, they should play by the same economic rules as other businesses, which in no way impede businesses from succeeding in our country.  Of course, many of these Tribal-owned businesses are the main source of support and income for If our labor laws work for any other business, they should also work for them.  American citizens, including Native American citizens of our country, don't lose their rights as workers because of the ownership of the organization and company that they happen to be employed by. That is a key tenet that needs to be balanced with, of course, Tribal sovereignty, which I am a strong supporter of.  If the discussion were simply about Tribal employees, it would be a different discussion. To be clear, it is about businesses that are owned by Tribes, and we simply don't have an analogy on the State and local side with very few exceptions. I am sure there is one somewhere. But, in general, municipalities and counties are not the owners of operating businesses that compete in the private sector.  Now, I want to talk about what is possible with regard to enhancing the rights of workers and labor. Instead of these kinds of policies that take away the rights of workers, including Native American workers, we should be moving forward on policies that put workers first.  My bill, the Giving Workers a Fair Shot Act, would do that. The bill would provide reasonable solutions to address the growing inequality in the United States by helping workers and ensuring that companies follow the law, emphasizing the need for corporate accountability.  It would remove unfair obstacles to forming a union, enhance transparency from employers, and increase penalties for violating our labor laws, which are strong but often not enforced.  First, all too often, employers frequently drag their feet on a newly formed union's first contract for months, sometimes for years, often with the goal of avoiding an agreement. Sometimes that means a newly certified union that the voters have voted in fails to receive a first contract.  My bill would set up a first-contract arbitration system where the union or the employer has the option of seeking mediation if they feel one party is not responding adequately to a negotiation request.  It would also ensure that no taxpayer funds are used for union busting or persuaders, activities like planning and implementing activities that deter employees from joining or forming a union. Again, it simply makes sure that no taxpayer funds are used for that explicit purpose.  Third, the bill updates the National Labor Relations Act's definition of ``supervisor.'' Too often, workers are reclassified as supervisors for effectively gerrymandering bargaining units. This updated definition helps prevent that sort of manipulation and would make it easier for employees to be able to form a union if they so choose.  Fourth, the bill reaffirms the importance for the government to protect workers from having their rights violated by increasing criminal and civil[[Page H101]]penalties for individuals and executives who violate critical labor laws.  Injured workers and worker deaths should never be simply a cost of doing business. These robust protections help make sure that this is truly a criminal issue for the few bad actors that exist on the employer side.  Finally, the legislation empowers shareholders and creates new accountability for CEOs and executives by preventing the CEO and chairman at a publicly traded company from being the same person. We would all love to work for ourselves, but that is not in the long-term economic interest of the shareholders, the customers, or the workers.  The bill also expands insider trading restrictions for executives to 1 year after they leave a company.  In my district and across Colorado, people are clamoring for proactive policies that actually help address the income gap and put the needs of middle class families and workers first. Policies like the Giving Workers a Fair Shot Act would do that.  Now, this legislation that we are seeing here today is not the only controversial legislation we are seeing this week. Unfortunately, the next rule up will be one that takes away our constitutional rights as  The FISA reauthorization legislation has been described as a compromise, but that is not the case.                              {time}  1430  This legislation is not the necessary FISA reform bill that many in Congress, including myself, have called for, which is why I and so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are opposed to it in its form and support the Amash-Polis amendment, cosponsored by many others.  It is also why the current FISA reauthorization bill is opposed not only by privacy and civil liberties groups and consumers but also technology companies and job creators across the political spectrum. Businesses are, rightfully, afraid that, if this bill passes, it will make it even harder for American companies to engage in international commerce.  Many countries in Europe, for example, will simply refuse to do business with a technology company that is housed in the U.because they are afraid of what will happen to their citizens' data, perhaps even in contravention of their own stronger privacy laws.  This bill does not make any steps in the direction of reform that are necessary. It falls short on several grounds. In fact, in some ways, it makes the FISA program worse by codifying the ``abouts'' collections term that refers to the NSA searching through the internet traffic to collect not only communications to or from an intelligence target but also those that simply mention an identifier used by a target, even though that has been declared unconstitutional twice. It could be the name of a city or State or even a country that can be used as an identifier; in theory, subjecting close to 100 percent of tax and emails and internet traffic to warrantless searches.  This bill fails to consider the core concern that I have and that many Members on both sides of the aisle share; namely, the government's use of section 702 information against American citizens in investigations that have nothing to do with national security and does not require a warrant or the due process of our  Instead, the bill codifies the ability of the government to access the content of our emails and telephone calls without a warrant. It creates an unprecedented and unworkable ``optional'' warrant, which is merely window dressing but does nothing to address the legitimate concerns.  These massive flaws could have been addressed, had we proceeded under regular order, but this version was reported only from the Intelligence Committee and bypassed the Judiciary Committee, which was cut out of negotiations when they agreed to go along with the Intelligence Committee railroading their committee. That is why I signed a bipartisan letter with dozens of our Members demanding FISA be handled under regular order.  I am proud to have offered the amendment that will be considered later with Representatives Lofgren and Amash and others that would provide a better path to keep American citizens safe and protect our privacy and ensure that American companies can remain competitive abroad. It will protect our constitutional rights and keep us safe.  My amendment, which is based off the USA RIGHTS Act, ends backdoor searches, ends reverse targeting, bans ``abouts'' collections, and strengthens FISA court oversight and transparency. I think these are all commonsense and necessary changes that Americans have been demanding for years.  Mr.Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to oppose the FISA reauthorization and support the Amash-Lofgren amendment when they are brought forth shortly.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

857,topic-id,589,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I also want to address something my friend, Mr.Cole, said.  Again, I am sure you can find a few instances in municipal and State government, but I am sure the gentleman would agree that, relative to size, they are very few and far between. Even most municipal golf courses are run by private operators under contract to municipalities. I am sure the gentleman can find a couple that aren't.  I have interacted with businesses in my district that are owned by Tribal nations, and I worked with them. There are a number of provisions in law that help them. I support those.  But I do believe that workers don't give up their rights simply because they work for a company that happens to be owned by a Tribal nation, as opposed to an American or even a Native American citizen of our country who, in their personal capacity, is the owner of a company and would not have the same ability to deprive workers of their rights as a company that was owned by his or her  So, again, we want to make sure we support Tribal autonomy. And I do. Perhaps there is a bill to be had here, but it is simply not this bill.  I want to share a story of one of my constituents from Fort Collins, Colorado, that I think will bring this back to what our body should be doing.  I understand there are arguments on both sides of this. I understand there are people on both sides of the aisle who have concerns and also who support this bill. But it is not the urgency that we face with regard to deferred action or child health insurance.  In July of 2017, Carla and her husband from Fort Collins found out they were expecting another child. Both Carla and her husband work full time. Carla works at a local childcare center. Her husband works at a local retail store.  Even with their two full-time incomes, like many Americans, they felt the Children's Health Insurance Program was the only medical coverage for them, and Carla enrolled in  Carla is due to deliver her baby in March of this year, but she worries that, when the baby comes, she won't have medical coverage anymore. Unfortunately, Carla is right to worry. Right now, Colorado is expected to run out of CHIP funding at the end of February, just a few weeks before Carla is due.  That is why this issue is so urgent, Mr.For the tens of thousands of children and pregnant women, like Carla, we can't wait another minute to provide a permanent extension of the Children's Health Insurance  But instead of finding a bipartisan fix for the Children's Health Insurance Program or for deferred action or to keep the government open, instead, here we have yet another bill that people will have different opinions on, and I feel that it undermines workers' rights and is not supportive in the way that I would be of the rights of our nations. It is, unfortunately, another example of misguided priorities.  We have precious little time--I believe 4 days--until the funding of the government expires. We should have acted on the Children's Health Insurance Program last year. We should have acted on deferred action last year. We need to act now.  Mr.Speaker, for that reason, I oppose the underlying bill, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.

1647,topic-id,1378,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary time.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule. This rule provides for the consideration of three bills out of the Financial Services Before I turn to the bills, I want to talk about the urgent issues that are not scheduled for floor time this week.  Why aren't we debating appropriations bills to keep the government funded through the end of this fiscal year?  Just 2 weeks away from another government shutdown, yet, instead of discussing how we can keep government open through the end of the year, we are debating unrelated bills.  We are halfway through the current fiscal year and we are forcing a month-after-month crisis of government funding. This is no way to run a government or a business. Agencies need certainty. Our constituents need to know that they can rely on government services and the security of our We should be discussing appropriation bills now.  In addition, there are over 800,000 DACA recipients, or Dreamers, that don't have any certainty, whose ability to work legally hinges upon a court decision that is on appeal.  In my home State of Colorado, there are over 15,000 Dreamers from countries far and wide, young, aspiring Americans who grew up in our country and know no other country, who are able to work legally today, but who risk the expiration at any moment by the whim of a court.  Every day, over 100 DACA recipients lose their protected status or it expires. We need to take up, in this body, a permanent solution for Dreamers, a pathway to citizenship so that they don't have to rely on the whims of the court system to protect them.  Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have demanded that Speaker Ryan bring an immigration bill to the floor. In fact, in the past, he said he would do so--last week, the week before. Yet we still haven't brought forward the Dream Act, or the Hope Act, or any of the bills that I am proud to cosponsor, that are bipartisan, that would address the urgent issue of how we can ensure that Dreamers are able to work legally.  Even as we speak now, there are students on the Capitol lawn participating in an organized walkout in support of ending school gun violence. Students in Colorado are joining as well. I sent a letter to be read to the students who are doing that because I hope that we agree that no young person should have to fear going to school, nor should any parent have to fear sending their child to school.  I strongly support sending more resources to schools that create supportive environments, that foster emotional and mental health. And, yes, we need to do more on gun violence, including universal background checks.  So why aren't we discussing those bills here today?  In addition, the administration's budget eliminated title IV-A of the Every Student Succeeds Act, which is the very kind of support and enrichment grant that helps schools support health and mental health services and counseling. So in the administration's own budget, it would undermine our ability to keep schools safe.  School safety funding is not a replacement for gun safety measures, but it can help reduce violence by supporting our children in school and creating a safe learning environment.  Those are some of the pressing issues that we could be considering; I dare say that our constituents are demanding that we consider. I dare say our continued ignoring of these issues is one of the reasons that the congressional approval rating is so low. Nobody is calling my office asking for these obscure bills today on regulations of big banks.  I am getting calls from constituents about reducing gun violence in schools; finding a permanent solution for DACA recipients; keeping government open, and protecting the integrity of our elections from foreign interference.  My colleagues must have short memories because we just forget how hard the financial meltdown of 2008 was on the country's middle class. While Wall Street banks were getting taxpayer bailouts, nearly 7 million Americans lost their homes, workers lost thousands of dollars in retirement accounts, and our unemployment rate spiked to 10 percent.  Since Dodd-Frank was signed into law, we have avoided another major meltdown. The banking system is strong again because of the Dodd-Frank reforms, yet my Republican colleagues continue to bring bills to the floor that are aimed at crippling financial regulators to put banks ahead of the safety of the financial system, consumers, and the economy.  H.1116, the TAILOR Act, would require that Federal regulators tailor any action to limit the burdens on financial institutions. What this bill does is force Federal regulators, those in charge of protecting consumers and our system from risk, to conduct a time-consuming re-analysis limiting what they look at to the burdens on financial institutions, the very protections that were put in place in Dodd-Frank and, instead, change those to financial institutions, not to ensure consumer protection, to reduce costs rather than ensure protection.  It is almost like you are giving such authority to the tailors that they cut up your whole suit, and that is not what we want. If there are adjustments that need to be made, we should make them through statute, not give broad authority to government regulators to shred consumer protections.  H.4545, the Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act, would establish a new Office of Independent Examination Review, yet more bureaucracy and paperwork, and have financial institutions appeal and postpone supervisory determinations, creating yet more Republican red tape, more big government committees that the Republicans seem so fond of at the cost to taxpayers.  This is, again, one of those bills that could have been easily tailored to provide targeted improvements to the exam process, but, instead, the Republicans want to set up more government committees and more red tape.  H.4545 takes away the financial regulators' ability to supervise financial institutions, instead, creating new government panels that risk putting consumers at additional risk.  The last bill being considered under this rule is H.4263, the Regulation A+ Improvement This bill would increase the annual exemption threshold under the SEC's Regulation A+ for companies to sell initial public offerings while being exempt from registration and disclosure requirements.  The purpose of the JOBS Act, as my colleague from Colorado mentioned, is to help startups and small businesses access capital by easing some security regulations. Regulation A+, unlike these other two proposals, actually reduces regulations, so it is a good bill. I plan on supporting it. It would make it easier for smaller, nonpublic companies to access capital by allowing them to offer shares to the general public.  So two bills setting up new bureaucracies and new Republican red tape commissions that tie up government, and one that actually reduces regulation, which I think will have more Democratic support.  Currently, a company offering up to $50 million in securities is exempt from SEC registration requirements. This bill is very simple. It just raises the threshold from $50 million to $75 million. Compliance costs are very expensive. So for a company in that range, they are often prohibited from accessing capital markets.  The SEC has the authority to raise the offering limit, something that Congress gave the SEC the authority to do. The JOBS Act requires the SEC to review the limit every 2 years, and if they decide not to increase it, the SEC has to report to Congress.[[Page H1557]]  According to the Kauffman Foundation, startup activity has increased steadily over the past 3 years. Startups are a major job creator in our communities. Reducing red tape and bureaucracy is a good idea. Startups create 3 million jobs annually, and we need to continue to find ways to support startups and entrepreneurs.  So, again, the biggest problem with all of these bills is that they have nothing to do with what the American people are demanding Congress act on. Two of them create more Republican red tape, bureaucracy, give more power to the Federal One of them helps small businesses raise capital by reducing regulation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-03-14-pt1-PgH1554-6.txt,1910,PROJECT SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS GRANT PROGRAM AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2017,2018.0,14.0,January

46,topic-id,1739,"Mr.President, January is National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention In a recent proclamation, President Trump continued what President Obama had begun in making this the ninth annual year where we designate our first month of the year to awareness and prevention of trafficking, awareness and prevention of this crime against humanity.  President Trump issued a call to action. The proclamation said, in part:       Human trafficking is a modern form of the oldest and most      barbaric type of exploitation. It has no place in our world.      This month, we do not simply reflect on this appalling      reality. We also pledge to do all in our power to end the      horrific practice of human trafficking that plagues innocent      victims around the world.  I commend the President for his strong stance, and I commend the U.Senate for the work we have done over the past several years, in a bipartisan way, to help combat trafficking. We made some progress.  About 6 years ago, Senator Blumenthal--who will speak about this topic later on the floor--and I cofounded the Senate Caucus to End Human Trafficking and legislation since that time to increase penalties on people buying sex from children; stop international trafficking by U.Government contractors overseas; find missing children more quickly--the most vulnerable among us--by ensuring that their photographs and other identifiers are available; improve data on trafficking to find out what the problem is, where it is going; and, of course, change the paradigm--treat children who are exploited as victims rather than, as they have been treated over the years, as criminals.  We have made some progress in these areas, but I have to tell you, despite these efforts and despite the increasing awareness of the fact that trafficking occurs right here in this country, in all of our States, we now know that one form, at least, of sex trafficking is actually increasing in our country. Think about that. It is increasing in this country, in this century. What experts say when you ask them about it is that is primarily because of one reason; that is, the fact that the internet is being used to sell sex.  By the way, doing it on the internet, it turns out, occurs with ruthless efficiency. Victims I have visited across Ohio tell me, including one this past Friday in Ohio: Rob, it has moved from the street corner to the iPhone, from the street corner to the cell phone, from the street corner to the internet.  There was discussion earlier from my colleague from New York about the role opioids play in causing harm in our society. Of course, the internet combined with opioids is deadly. The young woman I met with on Friday was one of those who had become addicted to opioids--in her case, fentanyl, which is an incredibly powerful, dangerous drug--and depended on her trafficker to be able to provide that. That is one form of dependency you see in sex trafficking. And again, online is where people are increasingly being bought and sold.  This increase in sex trafficking is a stain on our national character. It is only Congress that has the power to stop it.  There is one website--backpage.com--that is the leader in online sex trafficking. They have knowingly sold underage girls online. I say that because we have done an investigation, and we determined that. We now know from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that backpage.com is involved in nearly 75 percent of all child trafficking reports the organization receives from the public.  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, along with then-ranking member Claire McCaskill and now-ranking member Tom Carper, has conducted an extensive, 18-month investigation into online sex trafficking and specifically backpage.com. We found that backpage.com knowingly facilitated criminal sex trafficking of vulnerable women and young children. It coached the traffickers on how to edit adult classified ads to post so-called clean ads for illegal transactions, and then it covered up evidence of these crimes in order to increase its profits. All this was done at the cost of human suffering--and sometimes human life--with the sole purpose of increasing the company's profits.  In the fall, I testified on this issue in front of the Senate Commerce Committee--about our legislation. With me at the witness table was Yvonne Ambrose, a mother whose 16-year-old daughter, Desiree, was found murdered on Christmas Eve 2016 after being sold for sex on backpage.  Desiree's death should never have happened--and neither should online sex trafficking of minors happen at all--but this tragic trend is compounded by the fact that backpage has evaded justice for its role in these tragic crimes. Courts across the country have consistently ruled that a Federal law--and this is why Congress has such a key role to play here--called the Communications Decency Act actually protects backpage and others from the liability they should have in sex trafficking.  The Communications Decency Act is a well-intentioned law originally enacted back in 1996, when the internet was in its infancy, and it was meant to protect third-party websites from being held liable for crimes that users might commit on those websites. Ironically, part of the original intention of the Communications Decency Act was to protect children from indecent material on the internet by holding liable users who send explicit material to children. Now this same law is being used as a shield by cynical sex traffickers who promote and engage in online underage sex trafficking with immunity, thanks to this Federal law.  Congress didn't intend for this broad immunity in the law--I am convinced of that--but numerous courts across the country have made it clear that their hands are tied because of the legal precedent that has been formed. As the lawmaking branch of the Federal Government, it is up to Congress to fix this injustice. No one else can do it.  In the most blatant call for congressional action I have seen yet, in August of last year, a Sacramento judge cited the broad immunity provided by the Communications Decency Act in dismissing pimping charges against backpage.com. The court opinion stated:       If and until Congress sees fit to amend the immunity law,      the broad reach of Section 230[[Page S53]]     of the Communications Decency Act even applies to those      alleged to support the exploitations of others by human      trafficking.  That is an invitation to Congress to act. It is clearly up to Congress to act. It is past time we update this 21-year-old law for the 21st century and allow victims who have had their most basic human rights violated to get justice against those who facilitate these crimes.  We have an opportunity this month during National Human Trafficking Prevention Month to fix this. We can and we must.  The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, or SESTA, is a bill I introduced with my bipartisan colleagues--Senator Blumenthal, who will speak later this afternoon, and Senators John McCain, Claire McCaskill, John Cornyn, Heidi Heitkamp, Amy Klobuchar, and 18 other colleagues. As of this morning, that legislation has 64 cosponsors. It is totally bipartisan, supported by both sides of the aisle. It is popular: 64 out of 100 have already cosponsored it because it will fix this injustice with two very narrowly crafted changes to the Communications Decency  First, it will allow victims to get the justice they deserve by removing the Communications Decency Act's broad liability protections the judge discussed, specifically for websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking crimes.  Second, it will allow State attorneys general to prosecute these websites that violate Federal sex trafficking laws. These changes will hold bad actors like backpage accountable while doing nothing to impair the free internet. In fact, they will protect websites that do not actively and knowingly engage in online sex trafficking.  The ``knowing'' standard is a high bar to meet. The California attorney general, Xavier Becerra, testified at the Senate Commerce Committee about that this fall. He said:       We have to prove criminal intent. We can't win a      prosecution unless we can show the individuals we're      prosecuting, like Backpage, had the intent--the knowledge--to      do what they're doing. The legislation we have before you is      very narrowly tailored. It goes only after sex trafficking.  The Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act passed the Senate Commerce Committee by a vote that was unanimous. It was bipartisan. It was unanimous, and the legislation has the support of an extraordinary coalition of law enforcement organizations, anti-trafficking advocates, trafficking victims, survivors, faith-based groups, and even some major tech players, although some in the tech community continue to be concerned. This includes the Internet Association, which now represents companies such as Facebook, reddit, Amazon, and others. It was endorsed by businesses, including Oracle, 21st Century Fox, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, and the Walt Disney Other companies such as IBM and others have stepped up to support it.  Last year, 50 attorneys general across this country wrote a letter calling on Congress to amend the Communications Decency Act in the exact way we are proposing in this bill--50.  Again, in the Senate, a bipartisan group of 64 Senators has now cosponsored the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Those 60-plus cosponsors are significant because 60 is how many votes we need in the U.Senate if there are objections to the legislation to be able to get it passed. We already have that many Senators who have now put their names down. They said they want to be part of the solution to this tragic problem. They want to stop this increase in sex trafficking that unconscionably is happening in this country in this century.  So we shouldn't wait any longer to pass this bill in the Every day we do, those who sell women and children will be allowed to continue that, continue to profit, and victims will continue to be denied justice.  It is not an issue of politics or partisanship. It is about preventing exploitation and providing justice. I am hoping we can have a vote on this bill in the Senate this month, during National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention This Thursday is National Human Trafficking Awareness I urge the leadership to have the bill on the floor as soon as possible. We have every reason to act and no reason not to.  These victims deserve justice, and Congress should help provide it. Passing the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act is an opportunity.  Thank you.

593,topic-id,2356,"Mr.President, I want to thank my friend and colleague, Senator Blumenthal, for his commitment to this issue. We started this caucus to end trafficking 6 years ago, and during that time period there has been some significant progress made here in the Senate and the We have been able to pass legislation to help crack down on trafficking.  Unbelievably, in this century in this country, sex trafficking is increasing, not decreasing, despite our good efforts. We have increased the penalties on those who purchase sex from underage children. We have changed the dynamic of how the Federal Government and HHS look at this issue and these girls who get engaged in trafficking and get trapped into the system and to treat them like the victims they are rather than as criminals.  We have done more to increase awareness of this issue. We have required for missing kids, which are probably the most vulnerable of all, that there be a photograph or another identifier, which, unbelievably, for the most part there was not prior to that. We have made some progress.  Senator Blumenthal and I have written legislation with regard to Government contractors who overseas engage in human trafficking--and our tax dollars go for that. So we have made some progress, but it is still increasing.  Why? Senator Blumenthal talked about it. The experts are unified on this. The main reason we see an uptick is because of the dark side of the internet. The Senator quoted the statistic earlier about an 850-percent increase in reports of sex trafficking over the last several years prior to 2015. The reason that was true was because we saw the emergence of these companies like backpage.com, which probably has about 75 percent of the commercial sex traffic on one site, and the ruthless efficiency of the internet getting engaged on this issue. So we have to address this issue.  Here is the tragic part of this. Not only are more and more lives being ruined and there are more and more heartbreaking stories, but it is because of a Federal law that provides immunity to these websites. So it comes right back here, right to these desks, right to this Congress, right to us as legislators to fix this problem, not to try to smooth it over but to actually fix the problem, which is that some of these online trafficking sites are immune from prosecution because of a Federal law. It was a well-intended law that was written 21 years ago, I think. It is the Communications Decency Ironically, it was put in place to make it a crime to send pornography to kids online, but it has been twisted and used by these trafficking sites to provide them the ability to say: You can't touch us; you can't go after us. That is so because part of what the law says in trying to promote the internet is that if you post somebody else's material on your site, you are not liable. All we are saying is that if you know this involved trafficking--and Senator Blumenthal talked about his experience as a prosecutor; this is a high bar, a known standard--then you can't get away with this. The standard we use, by the way, for Federal trafficking is the Federal law. So we allow victims to have their day in court, but they can't get it now.  The stories are really sad. Let me tell you one. We spent 18 months investigating this in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and what we learned was truly tragic. You had girls who were trafficked on these sites. In one case a mom testified that her daughter had gone missing for about 10 weeks, as I recall--missing. This is a 14-year-old girl. What would you do as a parent if your daughter was missing for 10 weeks? You would go crazy. She tried everything, and someone finally told her: There is this website called backpage.com; you might want to check it out.  She did, and she was aghast at what she saw, but she was relieved by one thing. She saw a photograph of her daughter, knowing, then, that she was still alive. So she picked up the phone and called backpage.com and said: I just saw my daughter. She has been missing for 10 weeks. I saw her on your website. Thank you for taking down that ad that is trying to sell my daughter for sex online. This is my daughter. She is underage.  Do you know what the backpage operator said at the other end of the line, according to this mom? They said: Did you pay for the ad, ma'am? She said: No, I didn't pay for the ad. This is my daughter. They said: Well, we can't take down the ad. We can't take down the ad.  What kind of evil is behind that kind of a business practice? Well, what we learned, as we increasingly dug into this issue, is that it is all about profit, and you can imagine this is a very profitable business. Profits came first, to the point that people would place ads with backpage that indicated that it was for an underage girl, and backpage would then get to the purchaser of the ad and say: You know what, we need to change your ad a little bit. You need to edit out this word ``schoolgirl'' or ``cheerleader'' or ``Lolita,'' referring to a novel about an underage girl. So they knew these ads were being run by people who were advertising underage girls, and they not only ran the ads but they sanitized the ads first.  That just shouldn't happen in this country. It shouldn't happen anywhere in the world, but certainly not with a Federal law providing protections for organizations like that.  That is all we are saying. We want Congress to pass a law that says that if you engage knowingly in facilitating this kind of activity, you are subject to liability. You have to be held to account. Is that too much to ask?  Senator Blumenthal talked about it as a former prosecutor. We allow State prosecutors to go after these sites, which they cannot now. They have to use the Federal standard. So we are not trying to create a whole new area of law. It is a Federal standard that has been passed by this body.  When these victims go to court, they are rebuffed: Sorry, ma'am. In one court last August, a Sacramento judge basically invited our legislation. He said to Congress: The way that law reads, even somebody who exploits women and children online has immunity. Congress, this is your job.  So that is all this legislation does.  Senator Blumenthal talked about the House legislation. There was strong House legislation that was introduced[[Page S87]]that still bears that same H.number. Then it was changed in the Judiciary Look, I am glad that there is more awareness and consciousness about this issue and that both the House and Senate want to act, but let's not water this legislation down. Let's not take away this core element of our legislation that simply says that under the Communications Decency Act, we should have the opportunity to allow people to sue and allow prosecutors to go after these evil websites.  We can set up new causes of action. That is fine. We can do more things as we have done in this body. As I said, over the last 5 or 6 years, we passed a number of important bills to try to raise the consciousness and to try to help on this issue, but if we don't deal with this internet part, we will continue to see an increase, which is a stain on our national character--that at this time in our Nation's history, we are seeing an increase in people being sold for sex online, often underage.  Another story came not from testimony before the permanent subcommittee where we spent 18 months studying this, but it came before the Commerce Committee, and Senator Blumenthal was there for part of this. This woman came forward. By the way, you could have heard a pin drop in that room when she talked about her 16-year-old daughter who was sold on backpage.com and was sold to a man who murdered her on Christmas Eve of 2016. This is what this mom said: My daughter never should have been on that site; that should never be allowed. She is right. It should never be allowed. How can we allow that to happen?  So Senator Blumenthal and I introduced this legislation. We had 24 cosponsors almost right away, and it was bipartisan from the start. This is not a political or partisan issue. As of yesterday, I think we had 64 cosponsors. These are thoughtful Members, including the Presiding Officer today, who looked at this legislation. They have heard the arguments from both sides. The other side of the argument is from the tech community, some of whom are supporting our legislation, some of whom are not. But for the people in technology who are concerned about this, I just have to state: I don't get it. This is very narrowly crafted for this issue. We are not trying to affect the freedom of the internet--just the opposite.  If you don't start cracking down on this obvious crime against humanity, which is what I believe trafficking is, I think we are going to see much broader legislation to deal with the internet. This just says: If you are violating a Federal law on trafficking and you are doing it knowingly, you are facilitating it, you are assisting it, then you have to be held liable and held to account.  In fact, we keep in the law a Good Samaritan provision that says if a website wants to clean up its site, it is protected. The good guys should be protected. We want them to clean up their site. We want to be sure that we continue to have freedom of the internet, but we don't want to allow--nor do I think it was ever intended in this law to allow--criminal activity to occur that affects our children and our constituents over the internet without any sense of accountability or responsibility. It is narrowly crafted. It is focused on a real issue that affects real people.  On Friday I was back home in Ohio, and I was at a drug treatment center. I had an opportunity to meet some of those who are recovering addicts. As often happens when I am in those kinds of settings, it turns to what kind of treatment options are out there for trauma. Why? Because there is a link between opioids--particularly heroin and fentanyl--and trafficking. This is what has been told to me many times by some of these women, sometimes underage: Senator, trafficking has moved from the street corner to the iPhone, from the street corner to the cell phone. That is a reality.  I met a woman on Friday who was going through treatment, and part of it is to treat the trauma that is associated with this. Drug treatment is one thing, but the trauma associated with sex trafficking, repeated rapes is a course that is a deeper and even more difficult road to recovery. I believe she will recover. She has a great attitude. She gets it. She is going to have to focus on it and dedicate herself to it.  I will just tell you that this is a real issue in our communities today. It is affecting every single State in this body, and we cannot continue to ignore the reality that while the internet has brought a lot of good things to us and the internet has helped our economy to grow, there is a dark side and this dark side of the internet is why we think it is so important for us to address this issue and address it now so that the next mom who is out there right now wondering, ``Where is my daughter? She has gone missing,'' will not find that she has been advertised online to multiple men, that her life is forever changed, and that she will never achieve her God-given potential in life because of the trauma she has experienced. That is happening right now today.  We have to pass this legislation. It will help. I am convinced it will help. It will help to avoid the reality today, which is that these websites in your communities don't care and they are not going to care until we make them accountable.  This month is National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month--President Trump just wrote a beautiful proclamation about it. It was a call to action. President Obama did previously. Thursday is the day in which a lot of the advocates will be here in town talking about this issue. I just urge my colleagues and their staff, if they are listening today, please sign up on this legislation if you haven't already. To our leadership, let's get this to the floor for a vote. This should not be an issue that we drag out. Let's deal with it. We spent years studying this. We know what the issue is. We know what the problem is. Then, to my House colleagues, let's work together to actually solve this problem.  For those in the tech community who continue to oppose this legislation, I ask you to look into your hearts and think about the impact this is having on families all across the country. Yes, we all want a better world, and that is part of what many of these internet companies are professing to want, and many of them, by the way, have spent considerable resources in fighting trafficking. But if you don't get at this issue--it has moved from the street corner to the smartphone. If you don't get at this issue, I don't believe we will see the progress that all of us desire.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Lee). The Senator from South                           National Security  ",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgS85-2.txt,924,WE SHOULD DEBATE A NEW AUMF REGARDING AMERICAN TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN,2018.0,9.0,March
1509,topic-id,3238,"Mr.President, we just had a vote in this Chamber on a very significant piece of legislation. It was the motion to proceed to it. It was agreed to with good Republican and Democratic majorities, with both sides of the aisle supporting moving to this debate.  Because we have cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, I feel confident that we will get to an end point, and we[[Page S1781]]must. This issue of trafficking human beings is something the Senate must stand up against, particularly because there is a Federal law that now permits trafficking online that otherwise would be considered a criminal act. I want to talk a little about that legislation tonight.  We probably will not have the final vote until Wednesday, and some of the information I will provide tonight will be setting the reasons, the basis for doing this legislation. Then, between now and Wednesday, we will have to learn more about the specifics of it, what is happening online, and how the U.Senate can step in and provide the legislation to remediate what is an obvious problem to anyone who looks at this issue.  Human trafficking is such an egregious crime. We all, I hope, agree with that. It is also a very lucrative crime--$150 billion a year is the estimate, and that is probably second only to the drug trade in terms of the amount of money involved. Think about this. This is selling human beings.  The Senate has taken steps in this body in a bipartisan way over the past 6 or 7 years to focus on this issue, and I certainly commend my colleagues for that. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, and I, as a Republican, started a bipartisan caucus to stop human trafficking about 6 years ago. We started with the two of us, and now there are a couple of dozen. There are many Members who are engaged and involved in this.  Over those past 6 years, the Senate has passed legislation to increase the penalties on those who buy children for sex. For the first time in a decade and a half, we increased the Federal penalties.  We have helped to stop international trafficking by U.Government contractors overseas with legislation that was signed into law.  We have helped with regard to finding missing children by requiring for the first time that those missing children have a photograph attached to them. Unbelievably, until that legislation, most kids in my home State of Ohio and other States who went missing did not have the information provided to law enforcement and others--people who work in shelters, people who are in the juvenile justice system--to be able to find those children. Why is that so important? Because, as you can imagine, kids who go missing are sometimes the most vulnerable to being trafficked.  We also passed legislation to improve the data on trafficking. There is legislation called the Sex Trafficking Data and Response Act, which we passed in this body to provide better information about this problem so we could come up with better solutions by understanding what is going on. Trafficking is in the shadows. It is very profitable, but it is an illicit activity. So that legislation was critical.  By the way, the primary author of that legislation was Senator Ron Wyden of Senator Wyden will probably be on this floor over the next couple of days talking about some of the concerns he has about the online legislation we have, but I want you to know that Senator Wyden has been out front on opposing trafficking through this Sex Trafficking Data and Response I was the lead Republican on that legislation, so I worked with him, and I commend him for that.  We also passed legislation to change the paradigm in Federal law and treat these children who are trafficked as victims rather than as criminals. The key is to get these young people into treatment, longer term recovery, and deal with what is, as you can imagine, a very traumatic situation--often related to drugs as well, so drug treatment. Something that I think is perhaps the most important thing we can do is to understand that these are victims who, in order to get back on their feet, need to be taken from the criminal justice system and put into the kind of treatment they need.  Despite efforts here in the Senate--and by others around the country, by the way--to deal with this trafficking issue and raise an awareness of it, unbelievably today, as we stand here in this country, we are seeing an increase in one type of trafficking, and that is sex trafficking. You might ask, how could that be possible? We passed all this legislation to help. We have gotten increased consciousness about the issue. People are more aware of the problem, and certainly there is a consensus that this is something we ought to crack down on. Yet it is happening. I will tell you what the experts say. They say it is happening for one simple reason, and that is that more and more women and children are being sold online--the ruthless efficiency of the internet. So that is where this legislation focuses, and it focuses there because that is where we see the problem.  Traffickers are using the internet to sell women and children, and we have a responsibility to act. If we don't act, we will allow a Federal law that was passed by this body 21 years ago, which I think inadvertently has created part of the problem by shielding these websites, to remain.  I will talk more about this later in the week as we get into the specifics of our legislation and why it would address the problem, but the bottom line is that we have a real problem.  The anti-trafficking group Polaris--we recently received its 2017 report. The report illustrates the true nature of the crisis. This is the heat chart put up by It shows the locations of cases reported to the National Human Trafficking Hotline last year alone, in 2017. As we can see--and this explains why we see such strong, bipartisan support for our legislation--this is happening everywhere, in every State in the Unfortunately, it is increasing, not decreasing, despite all the efforts locally and even here at the Federal level.  The national hotline that Polaris runs--and I hope to be at that hotline, by the way, later this week, as they are opening a new facility and expanding what they are doing--experienced a 13-percent increase in reported cases nationwide just last year. So despite all the efforts, they are actually seeing an increase. In my home State of Ohio alone, 371 cases of human trafficking were reported to the hotlines. Across the country, their hotlines handled a record 8,759 cases in 2017, up from 7,737 reported cases in 2016. Again, these are only the cases that are reported. That doesn't mean there aren't many, many more cases out there that are not reported to the hotlines.  In the 10 years they have operated these hotlines, by the way, human trafficking reports have increased 842 percent. Again, it is unbelievable that this is happening in this country in this century and increasing.  I chair the Permanent Subcommittee on A couple of years ago, being interested in this issue, we started to talk to some of the experts around the country. I met with people back home--particularly the victims of trafficking and some of the survivors--and I kept hearing the same thing from everybody, whether it was the advocacy groups for those being trafficked, law enforcement, or the social service agencies that are helping to treat these women and girls who are dealing with the trauma we talked about earlier. The one thing I kept hearing was the word ``backpage.'' That is just one website, but it seemed as though there were a lot of people being trafficked on that one website. I certainly heard it back home, where these women and girls said to me: Rob, this has moved from the street corner to the smartphone, and backpage is where I was trafficked.  Nearly 75 percent of all child trafficking reports that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children receives from the public involved backpage--75 percent of the reports.  Another anti-trafficking organization called Shared Hope International says that service providers working with child sex-trafficking victims have reported that more than 80 percent of their clients were bought and sold on backpage.  We talked earlier about how lucrative this business is, but one website seems to have practically monopolized it.  With that knowledge, in 2015 the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, led by Ranking Member Claire McCaskill from Missouri and me, conducted an investigation. We spent 18 months researching this. We looked at every angle of this issue, and specifically we looked into how backpage operates. It wasn't easy because backpage was not willing to cooperate, as you can imagine. What we did find was that the company was far more complicit in these crimes than we had previously thought.[[Page S1782]]  We subpoenaed backpage for their company documents, and they refused to comply. When you refuse to comply with a subpoena around here, normally we can kind of tell people: Well, if you don't comply, we will bring the full weight of the criminal law on you. They still wouldn't comply. So we had to come to the floor of the U.Senate to enforce the subpoenas, which hadn't been done in 21 years around here. Fortunately, when we made our case to our colleagues here in the Senate, everyone in the Senate said: Yes, let's be sure they do comply by taking this to the criminal justice system and allowing our lawyers here to take this case. So we did.  We thought, well, we will win a case at the district court level, which we did, and that will be it. No, they appealed that. We won a case at the circuit court level, and we thought that was it. No, they appealed that. Are you getting the drift here that they did not want to supply these documents and did not want to testify? Finally, we took it all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Supreme Court agreed with us and told them that they had to comply, with the threat of criminal sanctions if they did not.  Having won that, we then found ourselves in possession of over 1 million pages of documents. In other words, they flooded us with documents, and our lawyers did a good job going through them. Through this investigation, we found what some of us had kind of thought might be the case, which was that this company was actually complicit. In other words, they knew what they were doing, and they were knowingly facilitating criminal sex trafficking of vulnerable women and children. They actually coached traffickers on how to edit the adult classified ads to post so-called clean ads for these illegal transactions. Then, of course, they would cover up evidence of those crimes in order to increase their own profits.  In 2006, as an example, backpage executives instructed staff to edit the text of adult ads--not to take them down, mind you, but to edit them--which is exactly how they facilitated this type of trafficking. By October 2010, backpage executives had a formal process in place, we learned through all these documents, of both manual and automated deletion of incriminating words and phrases in ads.  This is an email from one of backpage's executives in 2010. It says:       I'm attaching a spreadsheet with the most current list of      coded items to be stripped out. Email your lists to me by the      end of the day. . . .  In other words, they were telling these people who were posting ads: Oh, you can't say this word or that word because then law enforcement will know that we are engaged in selling underaged girls online. So they told them to take out those words. It is unbelievable.  What kinds of words were stripped out of the ads, allowing sex trafficking posts to stay up without violating the posting words? These are the kinds of words they took out: ``teenage,'' ``little girl,'' ``school girl.'' ``Cheerleader'' was one of them. For those of you who are literary types, one was ``Lolita,'' which is a novel about an underaged girl and an older man, and also ``fresh'' and ``AMBER Alert.''  These are the kinds of people we are dealing with here. Once these incriminating words were removed, the posts could then go on the website. That is how backpage coached the traffickers on how to get away with their crimes. Again, this filter didn't stop the ads, even though they knew it was illegal activity; they only edited them to try to hide that. So it didn't change what was advertised--the fact that these were underaged girls; they only edited the way it was advertised. Of course, this did nothing to stop the criminal activity, but it facilitated it knowingly.  The incentive? Why would backpage go through all of this? Quite simply, profits. This is a very profitable enterprise.  What is the cost of these crimes? It is very profitable, but the cost is human dignity, trauma. The cost is far more than money; it is suffering and sometimes human life. I have heard stories about this. I know my colleagues in the Senate have heard stories about it, and that is why there is so much support for this legislation across the country. These individual stories are compelling, they are powerful, and they are heartbreaking.  Imagine for a moment that your daughter is missing. She has been gone for several weeks. She is 14 years old. Someone says: You ought to look on this website called backpage. So you do. You look on backpage--you are a mom--and you find your daughter.  This is the story of Kubiiki Pride and M.She told her story bravely before our Permanent Subcommittee on She told us the details, and we were able to use that as part of our investigation and to come up with a legislative response. She said she actually told backpage--she called them and said: I found my daughter. She has been missing for weeks. She is on your website. Thank you for taking down the ad and helping me to connect with my daughter.  As you can imagine, these were sexually explicit photographs of a 14-year-old girl. She didn't know whether she was alive or dead, so she was excited to find her but appalled by what she saw, as any of us would be.  What did backpage say? We can't take down the ad because you didn't pay for it, did you?  She said: Of course, I didn't pay for it; she is my daughter.  That is the level of evil we are talking about.  This is another story of another brave individual who has come forward. This is Nacole, the mom, and J.Nacole also bravely testified in front of the Permanent Subcommittee on J.was a 15-year-old when she ran away. She loved her family, and she wrote them a 5-page letter saying how much she loved them, but she chose to leave the safety of her family and home, and she ended up in a homeless shelter for teens. A 22-year-old woman who was posing as a teen there approached her and said, ``I can help you make some money'' and then introduced her to a pimp, who then sold her on backpage. For more than 3 months, she was sold online multiple times a day.  Finally, an undercover police officer posing as a customer rescued her. Thankfully, he did, because for some many of the girls, the story goes on and sometimes ends in a very tragic way.  This is Yvonne Yvonne actually testified before the Commerce She and her mom did a beautiful job talking about her heartbreak and her tragic encounter with backpage. Yvonne got a call on Christmas Eve in 2016 that every parent dreads. It was about her daughter They said in the call that her 16-year-old daughter had been murdered after being exploited and sold for sex on backpage.com. One of the backpage customers apparently was the one who murdered her beautiful daughter.  Yvonne is honoring Desiree's memory by working with us to try to hold these websites accountable, and Kubiiki and Nacole are fighting for justice.  These are only three examples tonight, but there are so many others and so many I have experienced back home. Again, these are heartbreaking stories. One girl told me she started to be trafficked at age 9 by her father. Some others have told me of not having parents at home, being in foster homes and leaving the foster homes either when they were emancipated at age 18 or earlier and the horrible situation they found themselves in.  I have had the opportunity to meet with survivors in cities around Ohio--in Dayton at Oasis House, in Columbus at Alvis, in Akron, Toledo, Cincinnati, and The majority of these young women tell me the same thing about backpage. Usually there are drugs involved as well that create a dependency.  Unbelievably, for years, these websites have gotten away with this because when parents like Yvonne, Kubiiki, or Nacole file a lawsuit for damages to try to stop what is going on, they are told: We are immune. When the prosecutors in these local communities step up and ask: ``How could this illegal activity be going on? This is illegal to do on the street corners, certainly it is illegal to do online,'' the judges say: We are immune.  We will get into this later as to why that happens, how it happens, and what[[Page S1783]]we are doing about it in this legislation. I look forward to that discussion. I look forward to the debate on the Senate floor as to how we came up with a very targeted and very specific approach to this that doesn't interfere with the freedom of the internet at all, but it does stop activity that never was imagined. When Congress passed a law 21 years ago, it never imagined it would permit this kind of criminal activity online.  Tonight I thank those families who had the courage to step forward, tell their stories publicly, and channel their grief into something constructive, which is to come up with a legislative solution that helps address this problem so the next 14-year-old daughter or 16-year-old daughter does not find herself in these same horrible situations, with all the trauma and all the heartbreak that occurs.  Justice cannot be seen, but its absence can be felt, and that is what is happening now, an absence of justice. Those who have been trafficked online only see the websites that knowingly facilitated it to prosper and escape legal consequences. That has to stop. That is an injustice to me.  I look forward to further debate again this week. I look forward to the vote on If we can pass the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, we will make a difference. We will save lives. We will save women, girls, and boys from going through this traumatic experience and instead enable them to achieve their God-given potential in life.  I yield back.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                      Yemen War Powers Resolution  ",CREC-2018-03-19-pt1-PgS1780-3.txt,924,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2018.0,19.0,March
1562,topic-id,2072,"Mr.President, last night I came to the floor to talk about legislation we are debating in the Senate this week that has to do with combating human trafficking, an issue that every Senator in the Chamber cares about. Last night, I talked about some of the women and children who have been exploited online, their stories--some of the heartbreaking stories.  This opportunity we have before us is to pass legislation that addresses that very directly because we are seeing in this country, in this century, unbelievably, an increase in trafficking right now. The experts all say it is for one primary reason; that is, because the trafficking is moved online.  The ruthless efficiency of the internet, the dark side of the internet--Mr.President, you have been involved with this issue in our committee. As you know, we spent a couple of years coming to this point, an 18-month investigation of what is happening online, why it is happening, and then coming up with a legislative solution. The reports of human trafficking to one of the major anti-trafficking groups in the country, called Polaris, through their hotline and through their text line, have increased 842 percent over the past 10 years. This is consistent across the board in talking to other experts. There is this increase. When they look at it, where they see it is happening is online. Victims have told me, have told you and other Members, this has now moved from the street to the smartphone, from the street corner to the internet.  According to National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, nearly 75 percent of the child trafficking reports it receives from the public involve one single website; that is, backpage. That is why we spend a lot of time looking into backpage, why this was happening, and how we could address it.  According to Shared Hope International--another advocacy group--the number is even higher than 75 percent. We researched this through a process that many in this body were involved with. Claire McCaskill was the ranking member of the Permanent Subcommittee On We investigated that. I see she is on the floor now. She and I, along with our subcommittee, along with you, Mr.President, and other members of the full committee, looked into this issue. What we found was even more shocking than we expected. We knew people were being trafficked online by this website. We knew they had to be complicit with some of this. What we didn't know was they were actually taking ads and altering the ads, editing the ads to try to hide the fact that people were selling underaged girls online. As they put it, they were cleaning the ads for illegal transactions and then covering up the evidence of these crimes in order to increase their profits.  Last night, I talked about three brave mothers who shared the tragic stories of their daughters who were exploited and sold for sex on backpage.com. Their daughters were between the ages of 14 and 16 when they were trafficked. Kubiiki Pride was one of the women we talked about. She is also part of a documentary called ``I am Jane Doe.'' It tells the stories of her family and other families. It is a powerful, powerful presentation, and it is powerful in that you can feel their frustration, feel their pain. It is not easy to see, but it is important to see, and I recommend it. You can go on Netflix and find ``I am Jane Doe.''  Unfortunately, for those mothers and countless others, backpage has gotten away with this. It is not because people haven't tried to sue them, prosecutors haven't tried to go after them; it is because the courts have consistently said they are shielded from prosecution, they are shielded from these lawsuits. They are shielded by a Federal law, one we passed in this Chamber 21 years ago.[[Page S1828]]It is called the Communications Decency It was a well-intended law. In 1996, the focus was, when the internet was in its infancy, trying to ensure there could be freedom of the internet.  Ironically, part of the original intention of the Communications Decency Act was to protect children from indecent material on the internet by letting websites remove and block some of that explicit material. Now that same law is being used as a shield by online sex traffickers who promote and engage in this with immunity. This Federal law is being used by websites to get away with something that would be illegal, criminal if they were to do it on the street corner.  Congress did not intend this broad immunity, but numerous courts across the country have made it clear their hands are tied because of the illegal precedents that have been set the way the courts have interpreted this law. As the lawmaking branch of the Federal Government, it is up to us to fix this injustice. No one else can do it.  One of the Federal courts said this cannot be fixed by litigation; it has to be fixed by legislation. That is why America's district attorneys, 50 of the State attorneys general in this country, judges all over the country, and many others have called on Congress to amend the Communications Decency Act and fix this injustice.  In one of the most direct calls for congressional action yet, in August of last year, a Sacramento judge cited the broad Communications Decency Act in dismissing pimping charges against backpage.com. The court opinion stated: ``If and until Congress sees fit to amend the immunity law, the broad reach of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act even applies to those alleged to support the exploitation of others by human trafficking.''  This judge issued an invitation to Congress to act. Others have as well. Websites that knowingly sell vulnerable women and children for sex are profiting and getting away with sex trafficking because of a Federal law. It is up to Congress to do the right thing, to fix this loophole. That is why my coauthor, Richard Blumenthal, who is on the floor this evening, and I introduced the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, or SESTA, alongside a bipartisan group of four other original cosponsors: Senator John McCain, Senator Claire McCaskill, Senator John Cornyn, and Senator Heidi Soon, others joined us. In that first day, we had 24 cosponsors, bipartisan. Soon, we had a majority of Republicans and majority of Democrats cosponsoring this legislation. I want to thank those five original cosponsors because they helped us put together legislation that was targeted, focused, and actually fixes the problem.  SESTA will provide justice for victims of online sex trafficking and hold accountable the websites that knowingly facilitate these crimes by making two very narrowly focused changes to Federal law. First, it allows victims to get the justice they deserve by removing the Communications Decency Act's broad liability protections for a narrow set of bad actors, specifically for websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking crimes. Second, it will allow State prosecutors and State attorneys general to prosecute these websites that violate Federal trafficking laws.  SESTA says if you are violating sex trafficking laws and you are doing it knowingly, you are facilitating it, then you have to be held to account. That is common sense. This bill includes legislation from the House side that creates new criminal penalties. It creates a new Federal crime for websites that have the intent to promote or facilitate illegal prostitution.  All of these changes will help to hold bad actors accountable while doing nothing to impair the free internet. In fact, SESTA will protect websites that do not actively and knowingly engage in online sex trafficking. We do that by preserving the Communications Decency Act's Good Samaritan provision, which protects good actors who proactively block, and screen for, offensive material, thus shielding them from frivolous lawsuits.  SESTA's fair, commonsense approach is why this bill has an extraordinary coalition of support. National law enforcement organizations, including the Fraternal Order of Police, faith-based groups, the civil rights community, major businesses, even including a number of tech companies, support this legislation. Most importantly, anti-trafficking advocates and trafficking survivors are the ones who support They are the ones we listened to when we drafted this legislation. They are the folks back in Ohio, back in Connecticut--back in our States--who came to us and talked to us about this issue. They are the ones we not just listened to but actually worked with to help draft something that would work to close this loophole.  This bill makes all the sense in the world, and it will do its part in helping to close this gap, in helping to deal, in this century, in this country with the amazing ability that people have to exploit someone online criminally and not be held liable.  I thank Leader Mitch McConnell for his leadership, for his commitment to combat sex trafficking, and for putting this bill on the floor for a vote.  I thank Senator John Thune, who chairs the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and Bill Nelson, who is the ranking member. They held a hearing on this bill and marked it up, and it addressed some of the concerns that had been expressed by the tech community.  Here in the Senate, we now have over 60 cosponsors. This has not been an issue of politics or partisanship. It has been an issue of the heart. It is about preventing exploitation. It is about providing justice. There are some in this Chamber who will want to change this legislation over the next couple of days as we debate it.  I have a great deal of respect for my colleague from Oregon, Senator Ron I talked about him last night on the floor. I talked about the work he has done to combat human trafficking. I talked about the legislation I did with him to provide better data for sex trafficking, which was his legislation. He was also a leader in passing the Communications Decency Act, which we are amending through this legislation. I understand he is passionate about that bill that passed 21 years ago.  We took a very targeted approach here, which is why the Internet Association, which represents much of the tech community--not all but much of it--actually endorses our efforts. This is the Senate's immediate opportunity to help stop online sex trafficking while protecting a free and open internet. It is the right balance. It has already passed the House of The White House has shown a commitment to it and is willing to sign the legislation. Now it is the Senate's turn to act.  So let me tell you where I stand. I stand with law enforcement officials all around the country and with prosecutors all around the country who have asked us to pass this legislation to give them the tools they need to stop this exploitation. I stand with Kubiiki Pride, whom I talked about earlier, Nacole S., Yvonne Ambrose, and the mothers across the country who have had their children exploited at the hands of online sex traffickers. I stand with the young women and children I have met in Dayton and Columbus and Akron and Toledo and Cincinnati and Cleveland--all over Ohio--who are sex trafficking survivors, who are victims who want justice.  I know that, together, we will all stand on the right side of history when the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act is voted on, has passed this Chamber, and eventually becomes law so as to immediately help provide justice for these victims. Justice cannot be seen, but its absence is felt. Those who have been trafficked online, who see the websites that have knowingly facilitated in this prosper and escape legal consequences, are the ones who have experienced real injustice. They have felt that injustice. We can right this wrong. Let's pass the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act to provide these victims the justice they deserve.  I notice again, as I mentioned earlier, the coauthor of this legislation--my colleague--is on the floor. He is a former Federal prosecutor. He has dealt with these issues both as a prosecutor and as a legislator. We are the cochairs and cofounders of the Caucus to End Human Trafficking, which we started 6 or 7 years ago. I thank him for his work on this important legislation.  I yield my time to Senator Blumenthal.[[Page S1829]]  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2018-03-20-pt1-PgS1827.txt,924,ALLOW STATES AND VICTIMS TO FIGHT ONLINE SEX TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2017--,2018.0,20.0,January
1565,topic-id,150,"Mr.President, I know there are other Members who are interested in speaking.  Let me just say, Senator Blumenthal's role as a prosecutor has informed him; therefore, the legislation is better for it.  We just heard what Senator Blumenthal said. He understands this bill inside and out and the fact that there are well-meaning amendments that are being offered that would derail this legislation, which is something we want to avoid. We want to get this to the President's desk for his signature and begin to save people.  I notice my other colleague, Senator McCaskill, whom I mentioned earlier a couple of times, is on the floor. She was the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee that investigated this issue of looking at the websites and that came up with not just how it was happening and why it was happening but a legislative response.

1709,topic-id,2550,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk about the issue before the Senate, and I am very pleased the Senate is finally taking up this legislation. It has to do with stopping sex trafficking specifically--a growing scourge in our country and really a stain on our national character--which is girls, women being sold online.  The legislation is called the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking It includes the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, or That has gone through a process here in the We had hearings on it. We had a markup. This is an issue many of us have been working on for many months--in fact, for the last couple of years--doing the investigations to come up with how to deal with this problem.  I am very pleased that we now have the opportunity here in the Senate to take up this legislation and begin the process of turning the tide, changing this horrific situation where, in this country, in this century, we actually have an increase in the trafficking of human beings--specifically women and children being trafficked online. I thought the speech earlier by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell laid this out very well. He talked about the fact that there has been an eightfold increase, in the most recent data from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children; that is, between 2010 and 2015, there was an eightfold increase in the incidence of trafficking. He also talked about the fact that this is growing because of this growth of the internet, that the internet--specifically this one website--has caused this increase that Congress has the ability to address through a change in a Federal law that can be targeted and focused and can make a huge difference in the lives of those who would be trafficked and undergo the intense trauma that results.  I am very pleased we are taking up this legislation. I thank Majority Leader McConnell for putting the bill on the floor.  I know we have an important omnibus spending bill coming up, and I know the Senate needs to focus on that, but first let's get this commonsense legislation passed. Let's take this opportunity to do something that is actually going to help immediately on this issue of sex trafficking.  I also thank Senator John He is the chairman of the Commerce Committee, which had the hearings and marked up this legislation. I also thank his colleague, Ranking Member Bill Nelson, for his work on this. We held a powerful hearing. I had a chance to testify there and testify about the work we had done in another committee investigating this issue. We heard from victims, and we heard from experts. At the end of the day, that vote in the Commerce Committee was unanimous--Republicans and Democrats alike saying: We get it. We need to address this issue.  We have had a lot of collaboration on this over the last couple of years. I would say it has been a truly nonpartisan effort, not just a bipartisan effort, which is rare around this place. In particular, I would like to thank the coauthor of the legislation we are dealing with, and that is Richard Blumenthal, who, as a former prosecutor, understands these issues because he prosecuted sex trafficking cases.  I also thank Senator Claire McCaskill because it was Senator McCaskill and I who headed up the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which looked into this issue. We spent a year and a half studying it, and we were able to find out shocking information about what is going on online.  I also thank Senator John Cornyn, Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Senator Amy Klobuchar, and Senator Ted They are a group of Senators who were the initial cosponsors of this legislation and have helped us put this legislation together in a way that addresses the issue in a very focused and targeted way, so we are going to actually have the result we are looking for but without affecting what some were concerned about, which was the freedom of the internet. We all believe in the freedom of the internet, but we also know that committing these kinds of horrific crimes on the internet has to be something people are held accountable for.  I want to take a moment to recognize a couple of other leaders in this effort, one of whom is a Senator, and the other is his spouse, and that is Cindy and John I hope they are watching these proceedings over the next week as we take up this legislation, debate it, and I hope pass it on the floor of the Senate, because they have been very involved.  John McCain from the start, as one of the leaders on this issue here in the Senate, helped us put together the legislation. He was with me on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations as we looked into this matter. John can't be with us here on the floor, but I know his presence is felt. I will tell my colleagues that it is felt by me, as well as the influence he has had on this legislation and on many of us in bringing up this issue.  One reason he brings up this issue a lot is that he has a spouse who is passionate about it and has spent a lot of time working on it. The McCain Institute has specialized on this issue of human trafficking, and Cindy McCain has been a tireless advocate globally on this issue. So I thank both Cindy and John for their inspiration. Again, I am confident that as we get it across the finish line here, they will be celebrating with us.  We have 68 cosponsors of this legislation now, and, again, for those who follow scorecards around here, that is unusual. We have a majority of Republicans, and we have a majority of We have a situation here where everybody is affected by it in their They get it, and they understand that this is a Federal responsibility to change this law because it is a Federal law that creates this opening for websites to engage in this kind of behavior without accountability. They are effectively shielded from prosecutions or from lawsuits. This legislation takes away that shield.  We have heard from the FBI, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children; we have heard from Polaris, which runs the national tip line on human trafficking. All kinds of experts have told us that trafficking is not just increasing, but it is increasing because of the ruthless efficiency of the internet.  One website--backpage.com--is involved in the majority of online sex trafficking. One anti-trafficking organization has said that backpage is involved in about 75 percent of the online trafficking reports it receives from the public. Another organization, Shared[[Page S1745]]Hope International, says it is even more than that. So think about that. We have this increase in trafficking. It is primarily being caused by this movement from the street corner to the smartphone, as victims have told me back home, and there is one website that has the majority of this activity. That is what we studied.  As we looked into it further, Senator McCaskill and I were shocked to find out that not only is this activity going on on this website, but they were complicit in the sense that they knowingly facilitated criminal sex trafficking, including coaching users--people who were placing ads with them--to post clean ads so that they wouldn't indicate--which was very obvious in the initial ads that were presented--that these were underage girls. As an example, taking out words like ``schoolgirl'' or ``cheerleader''--they told them to do that so they could still place the ads; in other words, get the money for the ads. As you can imagine, this is a very lucrative business. So they were saying that they needed to clean it up. That practice covered up evidence of these crimes. It actually also made it harder for law enforcement to follow up on these cases. They did it for a very simple reason. They wanted the ads because they increased their profits, but obviously they had an incredibly detrimental impact, and still do, on women and children around our country.  I spoke earlier this week on the floor about Kubiiki Pride because she testified before us and she is also part of a documentary called ``I Am Jane Doe.'' If you are interested in this issue, check it out. It is on  Kubiiki Pride told us this alarming story of a mom whose daughter goes missing. She can't find her. She was told to look on this site called backpage. She does, and she sees her daughter's photographs there--sexually explicit photographs.  She calls backpage and says: That is my daughter; she has been missing. She is 14 years old, and she is on your website. Thank you for taking down the ad.  Their response: Did you pay for the ad?  She said: No, of course I didn't pay for it. I am the mother.  They said: We can't take down the ad because you didn't pay for it.  That story tells us how evil these websites are.  Let me tell you another story about Yvonne Yvonne testified before the Commerce Committee, and you could have heard a pin drop when she was telling her story. Her daughter was 16 years old and she was trafficked on backpage.com. She was sold for sex on backpage.com at 16 years old. Yvonne got a call on Christmas Eve 2016, the call no parent ever wants to get. The call was from law enforcement saying that her daughter, Desiree, who was being trafficked at the time on backpage.com, had been murdered.  Yvonne is honoring Desiree's memory by getting engaged in this issue and helping us to pass this legislation. I appreciate her challenge and her grief. But she is also sure that this legislation is the thing that would have kept girls like her daughter from getting involved in this, because when she went after backpage to try to hold them accountable, she was told: I am sorry; they have immunity under Federal law.  That Federal law, by the way, is called the Communications Decency It was put in place with good intentions to help protect the freedom of the internet. It protects websites from liability when users put something on their site, but it was never meant to protect criminal activity. It has been misinterpreted, in my view, by the courts, but it also needs to be clarified, because it is not as clear as it should be, and that is what our legislation does.  This legislation, by the way, was enacted back in 1996--22 years ago, when the internet was in its infancy. There needed to be something to help provide protection from liability. But, unfortunately, it has been used as a shield by these criminals to be able to sell women and children online without accountability.  The same law that was actually written back then was also focused, in part, on keeping indecent material--pornography--from going to children, ironically, and now it is being used to shield these traffickers. I know Congress did not intend that broad immunity, and I know we need to fix it.  By the way, the district attorneys around the country agree with us on this--prosecutors. They have asked us to change this law. Their associations have even been involved in this issue. Fifty State attorneys general have written to us, asking us to do this, including, by the way, some former State attorneys general who are now Members of this body.  In the most blatant call on Congress yet, we had a court in Sacramento, CA, say: You have to fix this law because, otherwise, we can't do anything to keep people from exploiting women and children online. A number of courts have said this and basically have called on Congress--welcomed us to enter into it. The one in California said: ``If and until Congress sees fit to amend the immunity law, the broad reach of the Communications Decency Act even applies to those alleged to support the exploitation of others by allowing trafficking.''  In other words, they are asking Congress to step in and do something.  That is what this does. It allows online sex trafficking victims to get the justice they deserve and it allows prosecutors to hold these websites accountable.  We do it with two very narrow changes. First, allowing these victims to get the justice they deserve by removing the broad liability protections for a narrow set of bad actors. In fact, we actually say that for the good actors, there is a Good Samaritan provision: If you want to clean up your website and get the offensive material off, you are protected.  Second, it does allow for the State prosecutors to go after these websites, which they can't do now. So it takes the Federal standard--it is not a new standard; it is Federal law, which is already a criminal act--and says, allow these State prosecutors, these State attorneys general, to prosecute these websites that violate these Federal laws.  It is incredibly important to pass this. We did it narrowly. We have a knowing standard here; in other words, to be affected by this, you have to knowingly be facilitating, supporting, or assisting sex trafficking. We did that because we wanted to be sure it was focused on this issue and not affecting the broader freedom of the internet.  We have a lot of support now. A couple of weeks ago the White House announced its support for this legislation. I mentioned that 68 Senators are now supporting it. It passed in the House of Representatives about 10 days ago with over 300 votes.  It has support from around the country, most importantly. All of the groups are focused on this issue of how to avoid women and children from getting caught in this web of human trafficking and then how to help them when they get out to provide for the important recovery efforts that are needed from the trauma of this. Those groups, of course, are strongly supportive.  Law enforcement has been terrific. The Fraternal Order of Police stepped up early on in strong support of this legislation. So have all of the other law enforcement groups represented here in Washington through their national offices. We appreciate their help.  We appreciate the fact that parents have been willing to come forward and tell these difficult stories, as was the case of Kubiiki Pride, as was the case of Yvonne Ambrose, whom I talked about earlier, and her daughter, They told their stories from their heart in order to get Congress to wake up and do the right thing. We now need to do that.  This legislation is now before this body. We expect to have a vote next week on it. We need to do all we can to address this stain on our national character. We need to do all we can to provide these victims the justice they deserve. We need to do all we can to ensure that we stop the selling of women and children online.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

1027,topic-id,3481,"Mr.Speaker, I am delighted to have the opportunity to share some thoughts with you during this Special Order hour at the request of the minority leader.  I am a professor of constitutional law, as those of you who watch our proceedings here may know by now, and I would like to talk about the Constitution, and I will get there before this is over.  But I want to start, Mr.Speaker, with a basic question of political science, which is: Why does it seem as if it is so hard for us to get the people's business done in Congress these days?  Why does it seem so difficult that, even when we have a vast consensus on what to do about a particular issue, we still can't get it done?  Why is it that the approval rating of our institution, according to the most recent Rasmussen poll, is at 15 percent, which I think most people would agree is a pretty dismal showing for the people's Congress and here in the people's  Well, I want to talk about this problem in some historical and constitutional perspective, and I hope that it opens up some roots of thinking and feeling that might enable us to transcend some of the paralysis that now besets the United States  Of course, the simple explanation that is often given colloquially is that everybody in Washington is just fighting, and you have got the two parties at each others' throats, and everybody is so divided that nothing happens.  This explanation, although it turns out to be wrong, of course, has a long lineage to it. In fact, the Founders wrote very widely at the time our Constitution was adopted about the problem of faction, and they said, if you look at James Madison in Federalist 10, for example, he identifies faction as the central problem in the political life of a democracy. But he says that the latent causes of faction are sewn in the nature of man, and we see them everywhere.  Madison cites a zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many other points, as well as speculation as a practice. He cites, also, an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for preeminence and power; and he invokes the human passions that have divided mankind into parties, inflaming them with mutual animosity.  So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities, Madison writes, ``that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions and incite their most violent conflicts.''                              {time}  1645  In other words, even when there is not something real and big to be fighting about, people will find something small, trivial, and petulant to fight about. And those of you with little brothers and sisters might agree that is just the way it is. Sometimes it is in human nature for people to fight.  But the Founders understood that faction was something that would arise in a democratic society where people have the liberty of thought and expression. In fact, Madison said one of the ways that you could deal with the problem of faction is to destroy the liberty that gives rise to faction, but that, of course, plunges us into authoritarianism, monarchy dictatorship. One way you get rid of all the different views is you go to one party. You create a one-party state like they have got in North Korea, and then there is no conflicts because everybody does what the one party says.  So Madison dismisses that and says that is not going to work. We are not going to be able to remove the sources of faction, but why don't we try to control the effects of faction. And the way you do that, he said, is that if--in order to control the effects of a majority tyranny is you have a bill of rights that defends the rights of the minority so that people in the majority can implement their policy preferences, but they can't extinguish the rights of the minority, the right to speak, the right of press, the right to dissent, the right to vote, and so on.  But also, Madison said, if you extend the size of the republic, if you create a big country, then even if you get a majority on one particular issue, the majorities are shifting because then you will have a different majority on another issue and a different majority on another issue and so on.  But what happens, he says, if you have a faction that is tyrannizing the society, but it is not a majority faction, it is a minority faction? What if you have a small group that is able to hijack the process and prevent the majority from having its way? Well, he thought, there, democratic processes and Republican government would take care of it.  He says this: ``If a faction consists of less than a majority''--a minority of people--``relief is supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote.''  The minority ``may clog the administration, it may convulse the society, but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the Constitution.''  In other words, Madison is assuming that, when it comes to public policy, the majority will eventually get its way if the governmental process is working correctly.  Now, let's fast-forward to 2018. I am taking three issues where the vast majority of the American people agree as to what should be done to deal with this serious, serious public policy problem.  Let's start with the problem of high prescription drug prices. Now, Congress passed a law saying that the government could not negotiate for lower prescription drug prices in the Medicare program with the big pharmaceutical companies, and it will not surprise you to learn that the big pharmaceutical companies who invest a lot of money and campaign contributions also paid for a lot of lobbyists to go and lobby for that provision to be put into the law.  So the Federal Government can negotiate for lower prescription drug prices[[Page H1648]]in the Medicaid program, it can negotiate for lower prescription drug prices in the VA program, but for Medicare, because this provision got slipped into the law, we can't negotiate; and it is costing the taxpayers $25 billion to $30 billion a year, and, of course, driving up everybody's prescription drug prices. The majority of Americans have at least one prescription drug, and one-fifth of Americans have four or more prescription drugs.  Well, 92 percent of Americans support allowing the Federal Government to negotiate free-market style with the prescription drug companies for lower prices in Medicare--92 percent of Americans support that. All right. So that is case number one. Hold that in mind.  Case number two. This is something that should be familiar to you, in the wake of the discussion about the Parkland massacre that took place. I tried not to lapse into calling it a tragedy. Romeo and Juliet, that is a tragedy. Hamlet, that is a tragedy. Macbeth, that is a tragedy. What happened in Parkland, Florida, was a massacre. It was terrorism that took place in a public school. It was a preventable public policy debacle that that young man could walk into a gun store and purchase an AR-15 and that AR-15s are so available that people can get them even when they are not qualified to possess even a handgun.  In any event, after Parkland and after the Pulse massacre, and after the Las Vegas massacre, and after the San Bernardino County massacre, and after the Sandy Hook massacre, and after the Virginia Tech massacre, guess what, 95 percent of American voters--95 percent support a universal criminal and mental background check on all firearm purchases in the United That is more than 9 out of 10 Americans--19 out of 20  If you include the margin of error, it might be 98 percent. It might be almost everybody except for the leadership of the NRA and the CEOs of gun manufacturers who support a universal background check.  If you go to a licensed gun dealer and you can't purchase a gun because you failed the background check, why should you be able to go to a gun show and buy one? Why should you be able to go to the internet or the parking lot of a 7-Eleven and buy one? It doesn't make any sense.  So the common sense of the American people, 95 percent of American voters favor universal background checks, yet nothing is happening. Just like with giving the government the power to lower prescription drug prices, despite the fact that more than, you know, 9 out of 10 Americans support it. The President of the United States, President Trump, called for it in both of his two State of the Union I think the vast majority of the Members of Congress would vote for it if it were brought up for vote, yet nothing happening. So that is case number two.  Let's look at case number three. Another thing that has been very much on the mind of the public and in the public policy debate, 83 percent of Americans favor continuing the DACA program and passing the Dream Act and allowing the Dreamers a path to citizenship in the United These, of course, are 800,000 young people who were brought to America with their families when they were kids, grew up here, know this as their country, are in the armed services, are working here, are in school. And we have 83 percent of the American people who say, quite logically, exercising their common sense, let's create a pathway for those people if they are in school, if they are working, if they are in the armed services, to stay here and to become American citizens, yet, again, nothing happening in  Now, why not? What is it that is going on? So we go back to the problem of faction. Obviously, people are going to have different views. That is the oxygen of democracy. There is nothing wrong with that. We are not ashamed of that. We have different political parties here. It is much better to have two parties or more than that, than to have one party, a one-party system.  You know, Thomas Jefferson, in his first inaugural address, said: ``We are all republicans, we are all federalists.'' Lincoln tried to strike the same note when he first took office, and Lincoln said: ``We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.''  So our greatest Presidents and our greatest leaders have understood we fight like cats and dogs in elections. That is how it works in a democratic society. There is a political contest. But once we are in, we try to stand for the whole public, the whole common good. We try to remember that we are not just here to represent one party.  Washington reminded people that the word ``party'' comes from the French word ``fete'', a part, one part of the whole. You represent a party. You are just representing a part of the whole. We have got to try to aspire to represent everybody. Yet, given the human condition, given the nature of political passions and moral passions that Madison discusses in Federalist 10, we know that parties are inevitable.  We accept that in a democratic society. We cherish the fact that people can form political parties that articulate different agendas and different values. So that is not the problem. So what is the problem? Why is it the case that the United States Congress cannot even bring to a vote three measures that have overwhelming public support: to allow the government to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices; to pass a universal criminal and mental background check; and to pass the Dream Act to help deal with the crisis of these young people who have been thrown into a limbo because of President Trump's action last year? Why can't we do it?  Well, there are a couple of reasons I want to identify, and then I want to call on all of us in Congress to try to take us to a higher ground. The young people who are protesting about the nightmare of gun violence, which makes America an absolute outlier state--in terms of industrialized countries, our rate of homicide and suicide by gun violence is simply off the charts when you compare it to other industrialized countries like the United Kingdom or Canada or France or It is not even close. We are losing tens of thousands of people a year.  The point I was making here is that we have this puzzlement about why we can have massive popular agreement and consensus, political consensus as to what to do, yet a bottleneck in Congress where we get this paralysis and this inaction.  The young people who have ignited a revolution across the country against political complacency with respect to gun massacres in public places like schools and movie theaters and concerts and churches and so on, they are focused very heavily on the problem of money and politics, and I think that the vast majority of the American people exercising their common sense would agree that money and politics distorts the public agenda.  We know that the NRA has put tens of millions of dollars into our politics, just as we know the prescription drug manufacturers have put tens of millions of dollars into our politics, so I think the right to identify that is one strand of the problem.  But even with that, I think here, in Congress, there is a major failure of political leadership, Mr.Speaker, and I think it goes to something that, at least, used to be called the Hastert Well, the former speaker has been discredited, but the rule, unfortunately, is still operational. And the Hastert Rule is a rule that has been adopted by the majority caucus, which says that no legislation will be brought to the floor of the House of Representatives unless it passes the Republican caucus first.  Now, think about what that means. If you have got legislation like the Dream Act or like a universal criminal/mental background check act, which has unanimous support by the Democrats and substantial support by the Republicans, such that it would pass overwhelmingly in this body, it never sees the light of day on the floor of the House of Representatives because their rule is they won't bring it out of the GOP caucus to the floor for a vote unless it can get a majority within the caucus.  This means that the majority will, not just of the country, but the majority will of this body is thwarted and frustrated by the Hastert Rule, which I wish Speaker Hastert had taken with him when he left the House of Representatives, because it is fundamentally undemocratic, and we are seeing right now the cost of this rule, which[[Page H1649]]enshrines minority preferences and minority control against majority public opinion.  Now, I hasten to say, of course, we have got a bill of rights, so what we are talking about is not allowing the majority to trample the constitutional rights of the minority. What is happening here is that a political minority is trampling the policy rights of the majority so that the majority policy preferences of the American people and of Congress are being stymied by virtue of minority control in this body.                              {time}  1700  Now, this is something that our distinguished and thoughtful colleagues on the other side of the aisle can fix. They can say they are no longer going to abide by that rule. They will allow us to have a hearing on a universal criminal background check. They will allow us to have a hearing on whether the government can negotiate for lower prescription drug prices. They will allow us to have a hearing on the Dream Act, and they will allow us to have a vote on it.  We are not saying everybody has got to agree. They have got the right to vote against it. But doesn't the minority at least have a right to a vote on those issues which reflect the massive policy preferences of the American people?  Don't we think that has got something to do with the very low esteem within which we are held by the American people today? That, when it is very clear what almost all Americans want, we cannot legislate their preferences into law?  Mr.Speaker, in Federalist Paper 10, Madison told us that the problem of democracy is the problem of faction. And right now we have got a tiny minority faction driving the entire train of government, and there is not enough space, there is not enough room, for the will of the people to govern.  That is why America is disenchanted with the leadership of Congress and what is happening here. We are seeing it in election results around the country. We are seeing it in public opinion polls. We are seeing it in marches and rallies and walkouts all over the country, and that is good.

It gives everybody the right of free speech so we can talk about what is going on.  The Founders never guaranteed us perfection. Madison said, if people were perfect, we wouldn't need government in the first place. But they gave us a structure within which we could improve things, reform things, and make things better.

They are thwarting progress across the board on everything from prescription drug prices to the ban on assault weapons and a universal criminal/mental background check, and to the The American people are increasingly unsatisfied and frustrated with this situation.

Government is just the people who go to do the job. Sovereignty belongs always with the people. We the people.  That is why the right of free speech and protest and assembly are so critical. That is where the people come together and tell us what they want; the right to come to the town meetings, to call us up, to email us, and so on.  But we have got a high responsibility. Those of us who aspire and attain to public office are nothing but the servants of the people. There are no kings here. There are no queens here. There are no titles of nobility in the United States of It is in the We have no slaves here. We have no serfs here. Just equal citizens, all of us. Those of us who get into public office are acting as the servants of those people we are sent here to represent.  Madam Speaker, our people want us to get past all of the procedural obstacles and choke holds that have been put up here at the behest of big money and big special interests, and they want us to get a job done.  Let us start with these three things, which the vast overwhelming majority of the American people--Democrats, Republicans, Independents alike, everybody--agree we need:  A universal criminal/mental background check on firearm purchases in We need to give the government the power to negotiate in Medicare for lower drug prices for our people so our mothers and fathers and grandparents can get the prescription drugs they need at affordable prices. We need to pass a Dream Act so we can deal with the crisis situation of hundreds of thousands of young people whose lives have been thrown into limbo over the last year.  We can do those things. We can make that happen.  Madam Speaker, I would invite you or any other Member of Congress to respond. I reach out in a spirit of openness, affection, and, as much as possible, transpartisanship to say: We have got to get America moving in the right direction again.

449,topic-id,2240,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss my thoughts on recent protests in Iran and the important upcoming decisions by the President with respect to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the  While I am mindful that we have limited visibility into Iran and continue to learn more about the circumstances and motivations of the recent protests, one thing is clear: A significant portion of the Iranian people are not satisfied with their government and are increasingly willing to make their dissatisfaction heard. It is important that we support their right to peacefully express their views and demand that the Iranian Government respond with constructive dialogue, rather than force.  It was notable that Iranian President Ruhani implicitly recognized the validity of the protests earlier this week when he reportedly said:       It would be a misrepresentation and also an insult to      Iranian people to say they only had economic demands. . . .      People had economic, political and social demands  That is according to President  Acknowledging the need for reform, Ruhani continued:       We cannot pick a lifestyle and tell two generations after      us to live like that. It is impossible. The views of the      young generation about life and the world is different than      ours.  Now is the time to support the Iranian people in their quest for a government that is more representative and supportive of their interests. Unfortunately, some have suggested that our response should be to withdraw from the JCPOA, an action that I believe would only serve to embolden the hardliners in Iran and leave the United States more isolated from our allies. Withdrawing from the JCPOA and reimposing nuclear-related sanctions on Iran would immediately change the narrative inside of Iran, uniting reformists and hardliners alike in their opposition to what they view as a hostile United  While some would argue that the recent protests in Iran are symptomatic of what they view as a flawed JCPOA, I would suggest otherwise. In reality, the nuclear deal exposed one of the Iranian regime's central vulnerabilities--namely, that the regime can no longer simply blame sanctions imposed by the United States and the international community for its economic woes at home. It is becoming clearer to the Iranian people that it is actually the regime's corruption, financial mismanagement, funding of malign activities, and hegemonic ambitions that are at the root of their government's inability to enable job creation and to ensure that necessities like food and gasoline remain affordable.  In the coming days, the President has several important decisions to make with respect to the In October, President Trump acknowledged that Iran is meeting its commitments under the JCPOA, but he chose not to certify that continued sanctions relief is ``appropriate and proportionate'' to the actions taken by Iran with respect to terminating its illicit nuclear program. By the end of this week, President Trump is again required to decide whether to issue such a certification. I expect he will again choose not to do so.  The more consequential decision for the President this week will be whether to continue waivers of nuclear-related sanctions, as he is required to do under the Choosing not to continue such waivers would immediately snap back U.nuclear-related sanctions, thereby putting the United States in violation of the Let me be clear. This would be a unilateral action on behalf of the United States that would put us in violation of an international agreement, not just with Iran but with the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China, as well.  By all accounts, the JCPOA is working as intended, and Iran is verifiably meeting its commitments under the deal. It is important to remember what the JCPOA was designed to do and what it is now achieving. The JCPOA commits Iran to never seeking to develop or acquire a nuclear weapon; effectively cuts off all pathways for Iran to achieve a nuclear weapon during the period covered by the agreement; and increases the time it would take for Iran to acquire enough material for one nuclear bomb from 2 to 3 months to at least 1 year. When this agreement was signed, they were within months of having that capability. It dramatically reduces Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium and the number of installed centrifuges. It has prevented Iran from producing weapons-grade plutonium and has subjected Iran to robust monitoring by the IAEA to verify its compliance.  Withdrawing from the JCPOA at this point would provide no benefit and would actually leave us more isolated and less able to deal with the various challenges posed by The crippling sanctions regime that brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first place only worked because the international community was united in its determination to keep Iran from achieving a nuclear weapon. If we withdraw from the JCPOA unilaterally--and in the absence of a clear violation of the deal by Iran--there is no reason to believe that our partners in the P5+1 would join us. In fact, French President Macron has said that there is ``no alternative'' to the JCPOA and told the U.General Assembly that ``renouncing it would be a grave error.''  General Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Armed Services Committee last year:       I believe that the U.would incur damage vis-a-vis our      allies if we unilaterally withdraw from the Our allies      will be less likely to cooperate with us on future military      action to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and      less likely to cooperate with us on countering other      destabilizing aspects of Iranian behavior that threaten our      collective interests.  Our sanctions may snap back but not those imposed by the rest of the world, many of whom have begun building economic ties to Iran since the JCPOA was signed. Our international partners would then blame us, not Iran, for the failure of the deal.  Some, including President Trump, have argued that we can and should dissolve the JCPOA and renegotiate a better deal. This is a highly unrealistic proposal. We were only able to achieve the JCPOA after years of sustained multilateral diplomatic efforts and the imposition of aggressive international sanctions in concert with our partners. It will likely be impossible to replicate those conditions if the United States unilaterally withdraws from the  Contrary to President Trump's belief, threatening to walk away from the[[Page S127]]deal actually weakens our ability to address the JCPOA's perceived flaws by alienating our partners. Instead, we should remain committed to the JCPOA and lead the international community in imposing additional sanctions, where necessary, to change other Iranian behaviors--namely, their respect for human rights, ballistic missile development efforts, and other malign activities.  We must also seek to help enable the Iranian people to make their choices heard, including by encouraging the adoption of social media and other means of communication. We could start by building upon general licenses issued by the Obama administration designed to encourage the export of communications technology to  Secretary Mattis told the Armed Services Committee at his confirmation hearing: ``When America gives her word, we have to live up to it and work with our allies.''  If the President decides this week not to continue nuclear-related sanctions relief for Iran, he will be effectively choosing to restart the Iranian nuclear program, thereby making military conflict with Iran more likely.  Withdrawing from the deal would also be a devastating blow to our efforts toward diplomacy with North Korea--and for that matter, any future diplomatic efforts to constrain aggressive behavior by our adversaries. Why would any nation engage with us in serious dialogue to resolve differences if they fear we will later withdraw unilaterally, even when the other parties are complying with the agreement?  Regardless of whether you supported the JCPOA before it was signed, the truth is that it has removed the greatest threat we faced from Iran while also preserving all other means to address Iran's malign activities. Let there be no doubt--Iran continues to be a state sponsor of terrorism and an abuser of human rights. Iran continues to destabilize the region through its development of ballistic missiles and support of proxies in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, and elsewhere. If Iran behaves this way without a nuclear weapon, imagine how much worse a nuclear-armed Iran would be.  Fortunately, our nonnuclear sanctions on Iran remain in place and are unaffected by the In fact, Congress authorized additional sanctions in July to help deal with these issues. The administration should work with our international partners and use all tools at its disposal, including by ramping up nonnuclear sanctions, where necessary, to counter Iran's unacceptable behavior in these other areas.  Abrogating the JCPOA only invites another nuclear crisis like the one we are currently facing with North Korea--a concern echoed by General Dunford when he appeared before the Armed Services Committee and said: ``It makes sense to me that our holding up agreements that we have signed, unless there's a material breach, would have impact on others' willingness to sign agreements.''  Many have criticized the JCPOA as a ``flawed deal.'' For example, concerns have been raised that certain provisions sunset after a period of years, thereby delaying rather than permanently preventing Iran from achieving a nuclear weapon. If the concern is that Iran may seek to resume nuclear weapons development activities after these sunsets--a concern that I share--the appropriate course of action is not to throw out the deal but to work with our international partners to ensure that necessary restrictions on the JCPOA are appropriately extended or supplemented.  As I noted before, Iran has committed in perpetuity not to develop or seek to acquire nuclear weapons. We should not take them at their word; we should verify their adherence to this commitment, just as we are doing under the If at any point in the future we have evidence to suggest Iran is taking steps that would indicate a violation of that commitment, we should use that information to rally the P5+1 and other international partners to take a unified stand against such efforts. Unilaterally withdrawing from the JCPOA would seriously damage our ability to exert such leadership in the future.  Again, according to General Dunford, in the absence of the JCPOA, Iran would likely resume its nuclear weapons program and ``a nuclear-armed Iran would likely be more aggressive in its actions and more dangerous in its consequences.'' General Dunford also told the committee that ``the intel community assessment is, in fact, that Iran is in compliance right now [with the JCPOA], and therefore, I think we should focus on addressing the other challenges: the missile threat they pose, the maritime threat they pose, the support of proxies, terrorists, and the cyber threat they pose.'' I wholeheartedly agree with General Dunford's assessment.  Our troops in Iraq and Syria are operating in close proximity to Iranian-aligned militias, including those who previously targeted American troops. Unilaterally withdrawing from the JCPOA could embolden these hardline militias and possibly result in Iran giving them a green light to begin targeting U.forces once more.  Furthermore, while I have full confidence in our military's ability to fight and win wars when necessary, we cannot escape the reality that military contingencies to respond to both a nuclear-armed North Korea and Iran would result in massive loss of life and national treasure and greatly stress our military's capacity and capabilities.  In conclusion, I will return to where I began. Now is not the time to impose a self-inflicted wound upon our foreign policy and standing in the world. Unilaterally withdrawing from the JCPOA would empower Iranian hardliners and dramatically undermine the reform-minded protests we should be seeking to empower. Worse still, it would leave us more isolated in the international community and, by extension, less able to address the range of national security challenges posed by Iran, North Korea, and our other potential adversaries.  We must not abdicate the JCPOA or American leadership on these issues. Therefore, I urge the President to stay the course with respect to the JCPOA, while also rallying the international community to take effective actions intended to change other unacceptable behaviors by the Iranian regime to suppress dissent at home and sow instability abroad. We must not squander this opportunity by making the story about the United States rather than the courageous Iranians who at great risk to themselves have taken to the streets to demand a better future.

1721,topic-id,1323,"Madam President, I rise, as I have many times for nearly two decades, to shed light on the long struggle of Liberian refugees in the United States, and to make the case for this administration to extend Deferred Enforced Departure, or DED, for this population before they face potential separation from their jobs and families when their current DED designation expires on March 31.  I also call on my colleagues to take up and pass the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act, which I offered in some form for as long as I have served in this body, to end nearly 30 years of uncertainty by finally giving these Liberians the opportunity to apply for permanent residency and a pathway to citizenship.  I also would like to take a moment to express my gratitude to those advocates who have stood with me as I have worked for a solution for Liberians in America, including my Rhode Island colleague, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, as well as our colleagues from Minnesota, Senators Klobuchar and  The case of these Liberians is a tragic and historically unique situation. In 1989, a seven-year civil war broke out in Liberia that would claim the lives of over 200,000 people and displace more than half of the Liberian population. This conflict devastated Liberia--halting food production, collapsing the nation's economy, and destroying its infrastructure. By 1991, an estimated 14,000 Liberians fled to the United States seeking refuge from the conflict. In March of that year, the Attorney General granted them the opportunity to register for temporary protected status, or  Every subsequent administration has renewed TPS for Liberians each year until the end of the first civil war, but the prospects for a safe return ended when Liberia plunged into a second civil war from 1999 to 2003. This horrific conflict ended with the departure from power of former President Charles Taylor, who is currently serving a fifty-year prison sentence, issued by the Special Court for Sierra Leone, for war crimes.  In 2014, Liberia's still poverty-stricken and recovering infrastructure faced the challenge of responding to the Ebola virus outbreak in West Liberia had fewer than 200 licensed doctors to contend with the outbreak among the country's population of over 4 million people.  Throughout this succession of conflict and tragedy, Liberians who sought refuge in the United States have had the option to remain here lawfully under TPS or DED while conditions remained unstable in  This is not amnesty. In order to participate, these Liberians are required to pass periodic background investigations, pay hundreds of dollars in fees,[[Page S1754]]and stay out of trouble with the law. Many of these Liberians who have been through this process for decades are perhaps among the most vetted and rigorously examined individuals in the United States today.  They have also received work authorizations, enabling them to work and start businesses, pay taxes, and raise families. Many have full-grown American citizen children who attend American schools and serve in our military. At the same time, they have not been afforded earned benefits available to American citizens, so they are responsible for paying their taxes, they are responsible to conduct themselves as law-abiding citizens, but they are not building up any type of Social Security benefits or any other benefits like other American workers are. In the years since 1989, they have become our neighbors, our friends, and an important community that contributes a great deal to the diversity and prosperity of States like Rhode  Today, Liberia has only just completed its first democratic transfer of power in decades, and there are still serious concerns about the Nation's ability to maintain peace and deliver essential services to its population.  If the Trump administration fails to extend the DED deadline for Liberians, hundreds of Liberian American families could be separated and uprooted from their jobs and homes, and forced to return to a country that is unrecognizable to them. Moreover, at best, it is unclear how Liberia's recovery could be affected by a sudden and unexpected influx of newcomers from the United  This is why, each time Congress has taken up comprehensive immigration reform--and more recently discussed these issues in the context of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, Program--I have worked to ensure that any adjustment of status provision includes relief for Liberians who have become Americans in every way except on paper. Congress continues to debate the best path forward for Dreamers, TPS recipients, and comprehensive immigration reform, but Liberians cannot wait another month or another year. They have just over 2 weeks before their time is up.  At the very least, the Trump administration should extend DED for this population for 3 additional years while Congress debates a path forward on comprehensive immigration reform.  In my view, with each year that has passed since the first of these Liberians arrived, the case has grown stronger that they should have the option to adjust their status and remain in the communities where they have made their homes and raised their families. We have long since reached the point where simple justice requires that Congress extend this option to these  On several occasions, Congress has granted temporary residents the opportunity to apply for permanent residency when their stays in the United States were prolonged by dangerous conditions in their home countries. In 1988, Congress passed a law offering permanent residency to temporary residents from Poland, Uganda, Afghanistan, and Following the events in Tiananmen Square in China, Congress permitted over 52,000 Chinese nationals to apply for permanent residency. The Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, or NACARA, permitted the same for 259,000 nationals of Nicaragua, Cuba, El Salvador, and The Syrian Adjustment Act permitted 2,000 Syrian Jews to obtain permanent residency. The list goes on. The fact is that there is ample precedent for providing relief for this relatively small Liberian population. Like past Congresses, this Congress must acknowledge the simple fact that the United States is now home to these law-abiding and taxpaying To ignore them or to say otherwise not only threatens to break up American families, but also to turn away a group whose story is quintessentially They fled violence and disease to come here. They worked hard and raised families here. They followed our laws and subjected themselves to rigorous screening and vetting. They deserve the opportunity to make their own decision on whether to stay here or return to  I can say with confidence that Rhode Island will feel their absence if this Liberian community were forced to leave after contributing to our communities for so long, and our country would be poorer for their loss.  There are many examples I could discuss of how the Liberian community has enriched our State, but I will name two: Lance Corporal Abraham Tarwoe of the U.Marines and Providence Police Sergeant Maxwell Both came to Rhode Island from Liberia to start their own chapters of the American dream. They both led exemplary lives and endeavored to give back to their newfound homes through public service in the form of military service and as a member of our local police force in Both of them served with distinction, and our State tragically lost both of them in the line of duty in 2012. They are emblematic of the extraordinary contributions that Liberians have made to my State, and no fulsome discussion of what Liberians have meant to us is complete without mentioning both of these gentlemen by name.  I strongly urge President Trump to do the right thing and extend DED to Liberians living legally in the United I also urge my colleagues to take up and pass the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act and put an end to uncertainty for this population after decades of displacement.

1818,topic-id,1635,"Mr.President, I rise today to express my concern about the continued deterioration of the situation in Yemen and to share my views about the resolution that is currently before us.  The military conflict going on in Yemen has gone on for far too long and has affected tens of millions of civilians who face displacement, famine, and a widespread cholera outbreak. According to the United Nations, more than 15,000 Yemenis have been killed or injured since the war began in March of 2015. The humanitarian situation there has been described as the worst in the world, with more than two-thirds of Yemen's approximately 29 million people facing severe food shortages. An outbreak of cholera has already infected at least 1 million people, marking the worst such outbreak in decades.  Continued instability in Yemen also benefits our adversaries. While we have sought to maintain pressure on al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, and ISIS, the lack of a functioning government or state security apparatus inhibits our ability to go after these groups. Additionally, it is clear that Iran has taken advantage of the current situation to spread its malign influence and provide lethal support to the Houthis, thereby further undermining regional stability and security.  Unfortunately, we have yet to hear any strategy from the administration as to how they would propose to use U.diplomatic leadership to help bring about an end to the conflict in We still do not have an Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, and occasional visits by White House officials are not a replacement for sustained diplomatic efforts by our experts in the Foreign I am encouraged, though, by the appointment of a new United Nations Special Envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, and hope that the U.Government will seek to support his efforts wherever possible.  While the primary conflict in Yemen is between an Iranian-backed Houthi insurgency and a Saudi-led coalition, the United States is involved.  As stated in a letter sent by Secretary Mattis to congressional leadership last week, ``Since 2015, the United States has provided limited support to Saudi-led coalition military operations to restore the U.N.-recognized government of Yemen and preserve Saudi territorial integrity from Houthi aligned forces in Yemen.'' Moreover, according to Secretary Mattis, U.forces are not authorized to use force against the Houthis but do support the Saudi-led coalition with ``intelligence sharing, military advice, and logistical support, including air-to-air refueling.''  Last week, the commander of U.Central Command, General Votel, testified before the Armed Services Committee that our support to the Saudi-led coalition is ``primarily defensive'' in nature and focused on the Iranian-supported ballistic missile threat to Saudi Arabia that originates in Yemen, maritime threats to international shipping in the Bab el Mandeb Strait and the Red Sea, the defense of Saudi Arabia's southern border, and counterterrorism.  However, General Votel also acknowledged that when the United States provides aerial refueling to coalition aircraft, we do not know where those aircraft then go; therefore, they could be going to conduct offensive strikes against Houthi targets, which may result in civilian casualties, which is a major concern for me. Even more troubling, if these aircraft went to conduct strikes against targets outside of[[Page S1815]]Yemen, the United States would be complicit in a much more dangerous and provocative activity.  I have significant concerns about persistent reports of civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure caused by the Saudi-led coalition in Far too many of the strikes by the coalition have killed or injured civilians and resulted in the destruction of infrastructure needed to provide basic services to the population, thereby exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.  It is also clear that more must be done by both the coalition and the Houthis to facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid into and throughout The United Nations and humanitarian organizations continue to express concern about their ability to access seaports and airports and difficulties in distributing aid to vulnerable populations once it is inside the country.  It is important that shipments into Yemen be subject to inspection by the U.Verification and Inspection Mechanism to help prevent the transit of illicit materials in violation of the U.arms embargo, but all parties to the conflict in Yemen have a responsibility, including under international humanitarian law, to allow access to aid by those in need.  We are faced with a very difficult set of issues, and I certainly understand and commend my colleagues, Senators Sanders, Murphy, and Lee, for bringing this issue to the floor. The Saudi-led coalition clearly must do more to end this war and must prosecute this war in a way that limits civilian casualties and the humanitarian crises. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia and the United Emirates, or UAE, remain important partners for the United States, and we share many common interests in the region, including in the fight against al-Qaida, ISIS, and other violent extremist groups.  The resolution before us would establish a blanket prohibition on all assistance to the Saudi-led coalition except for the purposes of countering al-Qaida and associated forces. While I understand the argument for this approach, I believe it would prevent us from exerting influence to limit and hopefully end the conflict. Indeed, it may even cause harm as both sides potentially act more violently.  We can and should engage if there is a possibility that we can help minimize collateral damage by providing the coalition with training and advice on best practices. General Votel testified last week that U.assistance has contributed to improvement by the coalition on these issues. Specifically, the Department of Defense told us that engagement by U.military personnel has resulted in the introduction of a ``no-strike'' list. That is a process which actually puts targets off-limits and ensures that pilots and others understand those targets. They also caused a cessation--an ending--of the use of cluster munitions by Saudi-led forces and the formation of a body to investigate noncombatant casualties. These are positive steps, but it is clear that much more must be done to minimize the impact of the war on Yemeni civilians. I support our continued engagement for that purpose.  Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE face a significant threat from Houthi rebels armed with ballistic missiles, apparently with the technical assistance of the There have reportedly been dozens of attacks against Saudi Arabia since the spring of 2015, including against civilian targets like the international airport in Riyadh, which was attacked in I strongly support the right of our partners to defend themselves against these threats and believe that continued sharing of U.intelligence for defensive purposes is appropriate, especially in light of the fact that tens of thousands of U.civilians, military, and diplomatic personnel also face these threats while living and working in the region around Riyadh and throughout Saudi  I also have concerns that ending all support to the Saudi-led coalition may cause the conflict to escalate. As Secretary Mattis wrote to congressional leadership this past week, restrictions on our ``limited U.military support could increase civilian casualties, jeopardize cooperation with our partners on counterterrorism, and reduce our influence with the Saudis--all of which would further exacerbate the situation and humanitarian crisis.'' Secretary Mattis also expressed concern that withdrawal of our support would ``embolden Iran to increase its support to the Houthis, enabling further ballistic missile strikes on Saudi Arabia and threatening vital shipping lanes in the Red Sea, thereby raising the risk of a regional conflict.''  Therefore, I believe that support by the U.military of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen should not be absolutely prohibited but should be explicitly limited to the following objectives: 1, enabling counterterrorism operations against al-Qaida and ISIS; 2, defending the territorial integrity of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, including against ballistic missile threats; 3, preserving freedom of navigation in the maritime environment around Yemen; and 4, enhancing the training and professionalism of their armed forces, with a primary focus on adherence to the law of armed conflict and prevention of civilian casualties.  Our support for the Saudi-led coalition needs to be considered in a thoughtful and deliberate manner. From a policy perspective, we should distinguish between assistance that is provided for defensive or noncombat purposes and that which could be used to enable offensive military operations in the Yemeni civil war.  Let me be clear. I am not in favor of giving the Saudi-led coalition a blank check. In fact, I believe we should no longer provide aerial refueling assistance unless it is used to enable aircraft conducting counterterrorism missions pursuant to the 2001 authorization for use of military force or countering specific identified threats to Saudi territorial integrity. Indeed, use of our military assets to support Saudi-led coalition efforts or the efforts of other nations to conduct other operations outside this narrow scope would raise very serious legal questions.  Given its comprehensive approach, I do not believe the Sanders resolution is the appropriate vehicle for these issues to receive the careful and deliberate consideration they are due. I understand the Foreign Relations Committee may soon take up this issue, and I urge them to do that. I look forward to engaging further in those discussions when presented with the opportunity.  The administration must make clear to both the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis that there is no military solution to this conflict and that the time has come to reach a negotiated settlement. Congress also has an important role in setting the policy framework for the use of U.Armed Forces overseas and ensuring that U.military capabilities are only used for authorized purposes. At the same time, we should not take action that would unduly restrict our engagement with partners for legitimate purposes and, in doing so, undermine our ability to help bring an end to the conflict in Yemen, ease civilian suffering, and defend the territorial integrity of our partners.  With that Mr.President, I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2018-03-20-pt1-PgS1813-2.txt,1982,HONORING THE LIFE OF CHARLESTON HARTFIELD,2018.0,20.0,January

73,topic-id,1170,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, Congressman Dwight Evans, for allowing me this time to speak.  Mr.Speaker, I heard Mr.Evans talk about King's roots and influence in I just want to note, and this would only be a small moment of my remarks, that as a Morehouse man, we remind everyone that King started at the age of 16 in his matriculation through college and his embarking on the world knowledge that he had at Morehouse College, which I spent just a few years at and graduated from myself.  I hope that there are a number of young people watching today, as well as those seniors whose backs I stand on, because a lot of people talk about King's dream, but I just want to say here publicly, and I have said it[[Page H10]]privately so many times, we don't honor the dream. Everybody has a dream. The question becomes whether you have the courage, the fortitude, and the willingness to sacrifice your future to make that dream come true.  In this body, and as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, which now represents almost 78 million Americans in serving with real icons who paved the way to make this a more perfect union, I appreciate now more than ever the sacrifice that went into making this country what it is, and because of that and because of this time, let me just give 30 seconds of my history.  My mother is from the poorest place in the United She had 15 brothers and sisters, and all she had was a mother, a very dedicated mother who was a housekeeper we call a domestic or some other fancy term now. She was a woman who woke up every day, who would clean other people's houses to make sure that her 15 kids had an opportunity at a better future. You know what created that better future? Historically Black Colleges and  My mother went to Southern She shared a jacket with her sister, who was still in Lake Providence, which is about 200 miles away. I don't know how you do it, but they did it.  My mother, in that HBCU, because of the work of many people, was able to achieve an education, which is the best way to lift yourself out of poverty. She instilled in me two things: one, Cedric, you have to work hard, you have to do everything twice as good as everyone else so you can make it; and two, once you make it, you have an obligation to give back.  That is what is so special about Martin Luther King and the dream and the day that we celebrate. A lot of young people sit around and say: Oh, when I make it, I am going to give back. Oh, when I grow up, I am going to do something.  Well, King did everything that he did at a young age. If you talk about the Montgomery bus boycott, if you talk about our leaders in the civil rights movement, they didn't wait to grow into leadership. They created their own path. The remarkable thing is many of them sacrificed not only their future but their life.  When you talk about King, and to a lot of my middle class African Americans, let me say this, King could have sat back and said: I have mine, you get yours, or my family is comfortable, so I will take the easy path.                              {time}  1930  So for all of us who are doing well, remember, there are a whole bunch of people who are not. We have this ice storm all across the country right now where we are hunkering down in our homes with heat. We have to remember that there are people who are hunkering down on the street, sleeping outside under a blanket because that is all they have.  So we have to, in the spirit of King, remember that we are the greatest country on Earth; and if we don't think it is a perfect Union, we have to make it a more perfect Even if it costs us our life, like it did King, and it cost him his life in Memphis, fighting for sanitation workers; we have to fight for the least among us because this country is only as great as is the least among us.  As long as there are people sleeping on the streets during this blizzard, that means this country is failing. When there are kids in public school that are destined for failure because we have not funded our public schools, this country is failing.  So I would just say that, of all of the great things about King, the one thing that we should remember is his sacrifice, his courage, and the fact that he gave his life to make our lives a better life.  Let me just say that, as I grew up going to some of the best schools in the country, integrated schools because of King and because of the person whom I am going to introduce, I know I stand on their backs, and I know that I have a lot of work to do to make sure that the generation behind me has that ability.  But sacrifice is not easy, and when I think of it, I think of people that I read about in my textbooks, people I studied, people I admired, people whose autograph I sought. And now I actually get to call this gentleman, this distinguished gentleman from Georgia, a friend.  But he is more than a friend: he is an icon; he is a trailblazer; he is a person who saved this country; and he, as a teenager, started his civil rights fight. He marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, knowing that there was hatred on the other side; and he met hatred with love, and he was beaten because he loved and they hated.  But do you know what he did? He marched again.  Do you know what he did? He ran for  Do you know what he did? He welcomed me into this Congress, and he paved a better way for generations so that we could go to some of the best schools in the country.  Mr.Speaker, I have an opportunity to present, introduce, one of the greatest Americans to ever walk on the face of this Earth, one who has sacrificed blood, sweat, tears, and who has stayed on his knees constantly, praying for a better country.  He reminds us all that the Lord will order your steps, but you have to move your feet. He moved his feet across that Edmund Pettus Bridge, and he was beaten so that I could vote without counting how many bubbles in a bar of soap or how many jellybeans in a big tub.

1736,topic-id,914,"Mr.President, I want to speak today on the confirmation of Mr.Gregg Doud, the President's nominee for the Chief Agricultural Negotiator at the Office of the United States Trade In the Senate, we often say, or I hope we often say, that we are only as good as our staff. I have been blessed with the very best. Gregg is one example of why that is true.  Gregg served as senior professional staff on the Senate Agriculture Committee for me during my time as ranking member, 2011 through 2013. We like to say in Kansas that congressional staff are bucket toters. During those few years, we toted a lot of buckets together.  From the early days of the supercommittee and sequestration, multiple iterations of farm bills, animal disease scares, and the oversight of the MF Global mess, or situation, Gregg handled everything that was thrown at him--and all while wearing his cowboy boots with the pointed toes. Capitol Hill certainly isn't where Gregg started cutting his teeth in agriculture.  He hails from Mankato, KS, where he was raised on a dryland wheat, grain sorghum, soybean, swine, and cow-calf operation. Talk about diversified agriculture. He attended my alma mater, Kansas State University, home of the ever-fighting and always optimistic Good luck to them tonight.  Just last September, Gregg was back in Manhattan, KS, where he was honored as the 2017 Kansas State University Department of Agriculture Economics Distinguished Alumni  From K-State, Gregg went on to work for the U.Wheat Associates, which is tasked with developing markets for U.wheat all around the world. Eventually, he became the chief economist for the National Cattlemen's Beef  One of the very first trials that Gregg faced at NCBA was ``the cow that stole Christmas,'' when just before Christmas, in 2003, a case of mad cow disease was confirmed in the United States, resulting in a devastating blow to U.beef exports.  Gregg worked on behalf of the beef industry with the U.Trade Representative, the U.Department of Agriculture, and the State Department to rebuild the reputation and reliability of U.beef exports. Kansas currently ranks as the third highest U.State exporter of beef to the global market.  U.trade policy has been a very hot topic in the last year, and it is one that Gregg certainly experienced and is well-versed. He served as a ``cleared advisor'' and later chairman of the USDA/USTR Animal and Animal Products Agriculture Trade Advisory It is a lot of words but a very important committee. It was during the negotiations of a variety of trade agreements, including Australia, Bahrain, Colombia, CAFTA, South Korea, Morocco, Panama, and Obviously, he has been everywhere.  Gregg's background and experience give him a leg up in the challenge of serving as the Chief Agriculture Negotiator at He understands what trade means to the agriculture industry, and he has the experience to help maintain U.agriculture's role as a reliable supplier around the world. It is certainly a big challenge today.  At a time when the agriculture economy is in a rough patch--fourth year of prices below the cost of production pretty much across the board, all across the country--and commodity prices still falling, farmers and ranchers now depend on trade more than ever. We need continued focus on exporting not just what we make but also what we grow. Let me repeat that. We need to export not just what we make--there is a lot of focus on that with regard to trade policy now coming out of the White House and this administration--but also what we grow.  Kansas farmers and ranchers work hard. On a regular basis, they have to make sacrifices to overcome the weather, overcome obstacles, and make commonsense decisions that have significant consequences. That is why I know Gregg will be successful in the job of Chief Agricultural He is a Kansas cowboy who knows how to roll up his sleeves and certainly get things done.  Gregg understands why strong trading relationships are absolutely critical to agriculture. I am glad he is at the USTR, where he can get to work with Ambassador Bob Lighthizer and lead the charge in advancing the U.trade agenda. Along with partners at the Department of Agriculture--like our champion there, Secretary Sonny Perdue--and the Undersecretary for Trade and Foreign Agriculture Affairs, Ted McKinney, Gregg will ensure that agriculture has a seat at the table and that our farmers and ranchers are being heard.  The U.agriculture industry has worked long and hard to increase our competitiveness and markets around the world, but their work is never finished, and they cannot do it alone. I know that with Gregg riding point, the voices of the hard-working farmer and rancher will be well represented all around the world.  Congratulations to you, Gregg, on your confirmation as the Chief Agricultural Negotiator at the I look forward to continuing to work with you on behalf of U.ag.  One more admonition, one more piece of advice. When you are riding point, just make sure you look over your shoulder once in a while to see if the herd is still there, and if it isn't, don't worry about it, we have your back.  I yield my time.

We are siding with you against tyranny. Do not think you are alone. The American people, our hearts and our souls, are with you; and, yes, we are proud of our President for making sure the world knows that we are officially on the side of those people who are struggling in the streets of Tehran, as we speak, to make sure that the mullah dictatorship is overthrown and replaced by a democratic government.

516,topic-id,1931,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I also want to thank Mr.Gohmert for the great courage that he has had on this issue, the fact that he has been willing to speak up for something that the establishment in this country is trying to shut us up about, trying to put blinders on the American people about what is going on and how we are losing our country.  I was there with Ronald Reagan, and, yes, he was sold a bill of goods in 1986. He was told there were 3 million illegals in the country; and that is what we are going to do, we are going to legalize their status. He had a good heart, Reagan had a wonderful heart, and he saw these people were being exploited and living in the shadows. Three million people, you could take care of that, but the agreement has to be that we are now going to control our borders.  Of course, back then, there was never even any question about whether someone who is here illegally should be getting a government benefit or be able to be treated just like a U.citizen, that wasn't even in the works, but Ronald Reagan said: We will secure the border, and then we will make sure that we take these 3 million people and save them.  Instead, how did it end up? The border security was done not even halfheartedly. We ended up, when all was said and done, with not 3 million people, but 11 million people who eventually came here based on that amnesty program.  Well, today, it is a lot worse what we are facing. Today, the American people are being told a lie. Maybe someone is not just lying directly to them, but they are feeding them a false image of what the issue is today.  How many people have heard about the DREAMers, these wonderful young people, yes, who came here at an early age? The American people are not being told what we are talking about when we talk about the Most Americans think we are talking about 25,000 or 30,000 kids at the most. That is what most Americans think we are talking about.  What we are talking about is 850,000 young people, who, yes, have dreams, and most of them are fine young people, I am sure, but they are here illegally, they have been brought here illegally by their parents, and they want their status legalized.  What will that do? 850,000 young people, not 25,000, almost a million young people, and all right, what will happen when they are legalized? Well, what we are not being told is, as soon as they are legalized, they then have the rights of everybody else, as anyone who is residing here legally should, and, thus, they are eligible for family reunification, and their families that are now being brought in from other countries then have the right to bring in their families. So we have a family reunification that creates a snowball effect and millions and millions more.  Then, of course, we also have, with the legalization, the eligibility for government benefits, which, as I say, during Reagan's time, there wasn't any question you are not going to give benefits to illegal immigrants. Well, now we find illegal immigrants receiving education and healthcare benefits just as if they were American citizens.  In California, they have even treated criminals as if they are citizens, setting up sanctuary cities and sanctuary  Let me note that, with free education and free healthcare, there is no limit to the number of people around the world who will want to come here. By the way, there is no securing the border as long as we are giving education and[[Page H77]]healthcare benefits to people who have come here illegally.  In fact, what we are talking about now is basically opening up major, major expenditures in our budget, that right now we can't afford even to take care of our own people, yet we are going to have an obligation not just for these 850,000 young people, but all of the people whom they will bring in as well, not to mention the millions of other young people throughout the world who will say: My gosh, if I could get there.  And mothers and fathers throughout the world: We have got to get our child there so they can get the education and healthcare that is being provided to young people even when they come there illegally.  Now, let us note, for funds for our education system, our own young people are suffering from a lack of funds for their education; we lack money to have a very good healthcare plan for our people, yet the millions of other people who have come here illegally, we are going to let them drain that money and invite millions more people to come here from overseas.  This is the most dishonest debate that we have had. That whole concept of having millions and millions more coming in because of DACA, the DREAMers? No, no. This is being kept out of the debate; this isn't going to be part of America's vision of what is going on.  The idea that we now have veterans whom we cannot afford to take care of, we have children of our own people whom we cannot afford to educate, we have seniors whom we are trying to take care of, all of these are expenses that we have, and we are already in the hole, yet we are going to take care of millions of other people who have come here illegally, starting with the DREAMers?  There are not just 10 million, by the way, 11 million people here illegally. Let me be clear. We have got, I am guesstimating, 20 million, but I bet there are other people who are much more sophisticated in their analysis than I am on this who say it is even more than 20 million people who have come here illegally.  So what happens? We are draining our resources for people who have come here illegally.  What does that mean? We don't care enough about our own people. That is what we are really saying. Those people are more important than our own people.  Then, of course, you have the fact that people are coming here, and, yes, they are able-bodied, yet they still get education and healthcare, but they get jobs, and, yes, they bid down the wages of people at the lowest end of our spectrum.  I used to be an ice cream scooper at Marineland snack bar. That is what I did when I was in high school. I scooped ice cream.  You know what, those jobs now, what we have got are people who have gone into those jobs so that in order to get people to work for them, they haven't had to increase the wages of the people at that level. And if they have increased wages, they haven't increased the wages as much as they would have had to had they not had groups of people there who say: I will do that work at half the price.  Something else I was, I was a janitor in college. I was a janitor, and I cleaned toilets. There is nothing wrong with anybody, whatever work they have got. We know that we respect every working person in this country.  Yes, I cleaned toilets, and guess what? I looked back a few years ago and found that the salary, the wages, of people who clean toilets has not gone up, the janitors are not making more money.  Now, why is that? Are we saying that people who work at lowly jobs aren't worthy of having a pay raise, they shouldn't benefit? The income of our Nation now is three or four times higher than it was, yet those people in the lower scale have not been going up with that. The main reason is those lowly jobs that they get, they have been bid down, the salaries have been bid down by this massive flow of illegals.  Now, if we care about our people, we have to ask: What is America? America is not one race, not one religion, not one ethnic group. America is a country in which we believe in freedom and we have come from every ethnic group and race in the world.  What makes us Americans, then, is that we have to care for each other. We are an American family, but that being an American family means we must take care of those people who are less fortunate in our country before we spend and even borrow more money in order to take care of the needs of people who have come here illegally.  Let us just note the worst part of this whole debate is that Republicans and others who are concerned about this are being labeled like we are anti-immigrant. Well, in fact, we know that immigration is an important part of our country.                              {time}  1900  But this is the greatest lie of all because we believe that our country has been prospered by having a legal immigration system. We, in fact, take in a million legal immigrants a year. So anyone who is thinking about this should think about it. That represents more legal immigration into our country than all the other countries of the world combined, allowing people to immigrate into their country, all the other countries of the world.  Yet, because we don't want to destroy this system, we don't want it to go out of control, we are being labeled as anti-immigrant, even though we sing praises for those people who have come here legally.  In fact, the people who are the most anti-immigrant are the ones who mix the title ``illegal'' and ``legal'' together. And what we have got now is the worst possible outcome in that we have limited resources being drained away from our own people of every race, religion, and ethnic group, and jobs that are being bid down by illegals; and everyone, including legal immigrants, are being hurt.  But what we have now is a recognition that we cannot even enforce the law. We have sanctuary cities in which criminals are being kept from being arrested by Federal agents.  What is that all about? Who do we care for?  Now we are saying our police can't even protect our families; and that if there is some criminal gang from another country that comes here, that we are going to have a sanctuary State or a sanctuary city for these people.  This is absolutely ridiculous. It is a horror story, and it is up to us to alert the American people that we are losing our country. We are losing our country.

It was mentioned by the naysayers on the other side of the aisle that the NLRA, the National Labor Relations Act, started in 1935. If you go back to that legislation--and it still exists today in the same form--you see that Federal, State, and local governments are exempted from the act for good reason.  This was supposed to always be a private sector labor relations act and bill. Now, we can argue the pros and cons of that all day long, but that is not the debate here today. The fact of the matter is that governments were specifically exempted.  Mr.Speaker, why does that not include our Native American friends who have sovereign nations?

1468,topic-id,582,"Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and my underlying legislation, H.4061, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act of 2017.  Madam Speaker, when folks back home save for retirement, college, or a down payment on a house, they expect that the system is both safe and geared towards maximizing their benefit.  A beautiful thing about America's free enterprise system is how anyone can participate in the marketplace, strengthen the economy, and earn a dividend of the American That opportunity, however, is not guaranteed, and, as lawmakers, we have a duty to protect it.  My bill will help us do just that by improving the Financial Stability Oversight Council's process for reviewing nonbank financial institutions for potential systemic threats. We must be clear that simply designating more companies as systemically important financial institutions doesn't make our system safer.  The FSOC can better serve the American people by working with prudential regulators and the private sector to address threats to our economy before they transform into calamities.  Would you say it is sufficient for firefighters just to identify a house that is on fire?  Of course not. The key is preventing the fire in the first place.  This is the problem that we face with the FSOC's oversight of nonbank financial institutions. The FSOC may be able to identify tinderboxes, but fails to explain how they might be made less flammable, and, instead, the Council defaults to what should be the heavyhanded regulations of last resort.  To be sure, the FSOC has begun to recognize the benefits of leveraging the expertise of prudential regulators, as well as providing increased transparency. In recent years, they have taken steps to improve the designation process, including the February 2015 guidance providing increased transparency in the nonbank SIFI designation process.  These 2015 reforms were welcome, and this legislation will codify many of[[Page H1622]]them into law, as well as provide a path for a nonbank financial company to eliminate risk rather than be designated.  Importantly, our legislation will ensure a company's primary regulator has a meaningful role in the SIFI designation process. After 8 years, if we don't take steps to address the obvious shortcomings of the FSOC, like the nonbank designation process, the regulator intended to protect financial stability could very well become a liability.  The American Action Forum has found that additional capital requirements resulting from a SIFI designation of asset management firms could affect American retirees in the amount of at least $100,000 in potential savings over the lifetime of their investments.  That is why these reforms included in H.4061 are critical to the more than 90 million investors who rely on the services of asset management firms to achieve their most important financial goals.  Companies must have a chance to de-risk before the FSOC can saddle their customers with such extraordinary losses. This bill will give them that opportunity. I am proud to have worked with my colleague and friend across the aisle, Representative  John Delaney, on this strongly bipartisan piece of legislation. I want to thank Chairman Hensarling for his support and leadership in moving this bill through our committee and onto the House floor.  This bill has 58 original cosponsors: 29 Democrats, 29 Our bill demonstrates that there can be broad bipartisan support for increased transparency of the FSOC designation process.

436,topic-id,623,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Garrett for organizing this Special Order today to shed light on what has been going on in Iran not just the last couple of weeks, but, really, since 1979.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak out for the good people of Iran who are protesting against an oppressive regime that has imposed tyranny on them for nearly four decades. Scores of people have been arrested and some killed for daring to speak out against their government.  Mr.Speaker, they have good cause. For far too long, the authoritarian terrorists of Tehran have pursued an aggressive military buildup and a massive police state that oppresses its people.  Since the Iranian Revolution in 1979, their leaders have chosen global and regional conflict instead of promoting a healthy domestic economy and peaceful relations with their regional neighbors. I could spend a long time highlighting the litany of basic human rights violations of the regime as well, but the Iranian Government's malfeasance, public corruption, and betrayal to their citizenry needs to be brought to light on the world stage.  Mr.Speaker, as recently as last year, in the State Department's annual Country Reports on Terrorism, Iran was once again identified as the foremost state sponsor of terror. The crime and terror Iran spreads are conducted at the expense of ordinary Iranians whose taxes go everywhere but to themselves and their prosperity.  The unemployment rate is over 12 percent, according to the World Bank, and youth unemployment is staggeringly high. And all of this, despite Iran being rich in natural resources and having potential for having a great economy.  Two years ago, the U.entered a deal in hopes of encouraging a more peaceful Iran, not to mention passing along billions in direct cash payments to them.  Furthermore, if that wasn't enough, it has been recently reported that the Department of Justice, under President Obama, abandoned a massive international narcotics investigation against one of Iran's international terrorist clients, Hezbollah, just to not upset the Iranian regime during the negotiation of the nuclear deal.  That is right, Mr.Hezbollah is not just in the global terror business; it is a transnational criminal organization that is a major global drug trafficker, including right here in the Western Hemisphere and Latin  For anyone who has not read the recent article in Politico Magazine, titled, ``The Secret Backstory of How Obama Let Hezbollah Off the Hook,'' it is worth your time. You will learn how Hezbollah is operating throughout Latin America and, indeed, facilitating the transfer of drugs into this country.  Despite all of their contrition and dealmaking, the Iranian regime has[[Page H69]]not changed. This perilous regime is still exporting and smuggling weapons to its clients in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, and Hezbollah and Iran continue to threaten Israel, among other nations, and are still a destabilizing force throughout the Middle  After all of the Iranian regime's terror, crime, and corruption, do you think the Iranian people would have benefited from this?  Mr.Speaker, all you have to do is turn on the TV to see the Iranian people's answer, and it is obvious that they have had enough. This kind of tyranny does not belong anywhere, especially in the 21st century.  The everyday people in Iran want the same thing the average American wants: freedom to live without fear of their government, to live and work in peace, to be with their loved ones, and to worship as they see fit.  The good people of Iran are standing up to tyranny, and we should stand with them. I want those protesters seeking freedom from oppression to know that we are with them, that the American people are with them.

As we all know, our financial regulatory agencies are not without their flaws. From time to time, examiners offer decisions that are misguided, and these decisions deserve to be challenged. Managers of financial institutions that believe that the decisions passed down by their examiners are wrong deserve a chance to challenge those decisions at an independent forum and, if necessary, in the courts. We are all better served by a financial supervisory structure that subjects decisions to the scrutiny of further review.  I know community bankers in western Pennsylvania who have struggled with their examiners for years to get flawed determinations changed. In many cases, these individuals were doing the right thing for their companies and their communities. Without the benefit of a clear timeline, this process has been allowed to drag on.  Without a truly independent review process and protection against retaliation, these men and women working in[[Page H1629]]our community financial institutions understand that they are facing an uphill battle.

I emphasize bipartisan. I listened to the other side of the aisle, and it sounds like there would be no support for this legislation, but there is support for this legislation. I wonder if the ranking member has been having some of the conversations with some of her members, because, over the past few years, we have learned that one-size-fits-all, those rules, are a recipe for a more concentrated and less dynamic financial system.  I spend a lot of time talking with community bankers, credit unions, and their customers. They complain about skyrocketing compliance costs and regulatory burdens that force them to take attention away from their core businesses when they continue to add staff not to serve customers but to work on compliance issues.  Consumers complained about higher prices, fewer choices, and less access to important financial products. Small- and mid-sized institutions play an important role in financing the dreams and aspirations of Main Street businesses and middle class families.  Unfortunately, these institutions are disproportionately affected by the one-size-fits-all rules coming out of Washington, D.Banks and credit unions are merging or closing altogether, and new banks are not forming to take their place. Storied institutions with multigenerational relationships in their communities are being forced to close their doors and abandon the cities and towns they once served.  It is very sad, Mr.Speaker, to see a small town with a shuttered bank. We see it across western Pennsylvania and we are seeing it across the country.  This has an unmistakable impact on our economy. I remind the other side about the studies where, because of the overregulation over the last 10 years, that 650,000 fewer small businesses have been created; 6.5 million fewer jobs, that is 6.5 million fewer people paying Social Security tax, 6.5 million people fewer paying Medicare tax; critical, critical jobs that have not been created.

She is the longest serving woman in the history of the House, which is quite an accomplishment.  Ever since joining Congress, Marcy has been blazing trails, and I have been honored to know her for many years and to work with her on important issues impacting working families.  She has been a steadfast advocate for labor unions, fighting to ensure that hardworking men and women get paid a decent wage, and she has been fighting efforts to ship good American jobs overseas. Marcy knows that labor unions are a critical part of our country, creating a middle class and moving us all forward.  She has also been a strong advocate for our military and national security.  Her work is far from done. I know she will continue to be a powerful voice in our Caucus, and I look forward to many more years working with Marcy on issues that are important to the American people.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-14-pt1-PgH1588.txt,1757,S.J.

334,topic-id,2129,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak on behalf of nearly 800,000 Dreamers, young people who were brought to this country as children who today are living in fear and uncertainty. As a result of the Trump administration's decision to end the DACA Program, these young people are at risk of losing their legal status and, in fact, face deportation from the only home that most of them have ever known, and that home is the United States of  This is one of the great moral issues of our time, and it is an issue that must be dealt with now as part of the budget negotiations. It cannot be kicked down the road any longer. We must pass the Dream Act now as part of the current budget negotiations.  In the last 6 years since the DACA Program was established, these young people--again, people who were brought to this country as infants, in many cases--were finally able to breathe a sigh of relief. For the first time in their lives, they could walk the streets of this country without fear, without worrying about being arrested, without worrying about being deported. Think about what it means to live in this country every single day knowing that, at any moment, you could be arrested or deported. What DACA finally did is to give these 800,000 young people a legal status and a protection so they could go out and work, so they could go to school, and so they could serve in the U.military without fear.  As we all know, tragically, on September 5, 2017, President Trump announced the end of the DACA Program through Executive order. President Obama had established it through Executive order, and President Trump ended it through Executive order. In his announcement, President Trump noted:       I look forward to working with Republicans and Democrats in      Congress to finally address all of these issues. As I have      said before, we will resolve the DACA issue with heart and      compassion, but through the lawful democratic process. It is      now time for Congress to act.  That is Donald  The President was right. It is time for Congress to act. It is time for Congress to not kick the can down the road.  Our Republican President, Mr.Trump, told the Republican-led Congress to get to work on a DACA fix, and I say today to the Republican leadership: Let's do it. Let's do it now. That is what President Trump asked you to do. Listen to him, and let's do it--not next month, not in March, but right now--as part of the budget agreement.  People are working on this issue now. We can come to a consensus. We can pass the Dream Act if there is a political will to do it.  Let us also be very clear. Despite what some have said, this is an urgent matter that must be addressed now. Since President Trump rescinded the DACA Program in September, more than 15,000 Dreamers have already lost their DACA status and are now subject to deportation. Each day the Congress does not act, 122 people lose their DACA protections, and 851 people each and every week. This is a matter of urgency, and we have to act accordingly.  But I want to assure my Republican colleagues that not only is this the right thing to do from a moral perspective and from an economic perspective, but it is also exactly what the American people want. Nobody here is asking anybody in the Senate to rise up and to be extraordinarily brave and courageous. Why don't you just do what the American people want us to do? No profiles in courage are needed now. Poll after poll has shown that the overwhelming majority of the American people want to provide legal status to the Dreamers and to protect them from deportation. From a political perspective, this is not a difficult decision.  A Washington Post-ABC poll from September 2017, a few months ago, found that 86 percent of Americans support allowing Dreamers to stay in the United So 86 percent of the American people support providing legal status to This is not a tough political decision.  Another recent poll conducted by Quinnipiac found that 77 percent of voters and 65 percent of Republicans support legislation to protect Dreamers and provide them an opportunity to work, to go to school, and to pursue a pathway to citizenship.  Another poll conducted by CNN last month found that by an 83-percent to 13-percent margin, Americans support efforts to allow Dreamers to remain in the United States instead of facing potential deportation. Only 15 percent believed that Dreamers should be deported.  Passing the Dream Act is also in our national security interests. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recently noted:       The United States faces extraordinary security challenges      that are placing growing pressure on our Armed That      is why we need legislation that will provide a pathway to      citizenship for those immigrants who, among other attributes,      are serving or have served in the military, whether they are      in America legally or were brought here illegally as      children.  That is former Secretary of Defense Robert  In addition, just last week three former Secretaries of Homeland Security wrote to House and Senate leadership expressing both their strong support for a DACA fix and for the urgency of acting now. Secretaries Chertoff, Napolitano, and Johnson warned of the need for Congress to act immediately and emphasized how the agency needs time to implement a new program. Without it, they caution that the delay will sow uncertainty in the business community and drive undocumented individuals further into the shadows, with immediate deportation looming for tens of thousands every single month.  Let us be very clear that when we talk about the DACA Program and when we talk about these young people receiving legal status, these young people are vetted, they pay a fee, and the vast majority of them are now at jobs important to our economy. They are in school or they are in the military. In order to get DACA status, they could not be convicted of a felony or a significant misdemeanor or pose a threat to national security or public safety. As almost everybody recognizes, these[[Page S92]]are fine young people whom we should be very proud of and should not be talking about deporting them.  DACA gave these young people a shot at the American dream, and having been given that opportunity, they seized it and they are excelling and contributing to our country--to their country--in so many ways. With 91 percent of DACA recipients in the workforce, they play an important role in our economy. Many hundreds of Dreamers have taken up the call to serve in our Armed Can my colleagues imagine a young Dreamer now serving in the Armed Forces, putting his or her life on the line to defend this country, and then reading about Members of Congress who think we should deport them? How outrageous is that?  Furthermore, there are some 20,000 DACA recipients who are currently teaching in our schools. We desperately need good teachers, and 20,000 DACA recipients are doing just that.  Yet, because of President Trump's cruel decision to rescind the DACA Program, as well as the Republican-controlled Congress's failure to act, these young people's lives and livelihoods have been thrown into chaos and uncertainty.  It is our job to enact a legislative fix now. The President has called for a fix. The vast majority of the people of this country want to see a fix. A fix is important to our national security. It is the right thing to do. Let us do it.  I am, however, very concerned that President Trump is using the 800,000 Dreamers as a bargaining chip to force the taxpayers of this country to pay for an $18 billion wall. Now, some may remember that during his campaign for President, Donald Trump told the American people that it was the Mexican Government that would be paying for the wall. Well, it turns out that it didn't quite work out that way, and now it is the taxpayers of this country who are supposed to pay for a wall.  Let me be as clear as I can be. We cannot and we must not hold the lives of 800,000 young Dreamers hostage in order to fund a wall that the vast majority of the American people oppose. We cannot and we must not allow Donald Trump to shut down the government to fund this wall, but that, it appears, may very well be--for whatever reason--what Donald Trump wants.  Let me remind my colleagues what Donald Trump said last August at a rally in Arizona, the Presiding Officer's home State: ``Believe me, if we have to close down our government, we're building that wall.'' August 22, 2017, Donald  Now, I do not know why Donald Trump may be pushing for a government shutdown. Maybe he thinks it will work well for him or work well for the Republican Party politically. I have no idea, but I do know that the idea of a government shutdown is a very bad idea. Maybe Republicans will gain from it, maybe Democrats will politically gain from it. I do not have a clue. What I do know is, the American people will lose from a government shutdown, and, in a bipartisan manner, we must do everything we can to prevent that shutdown.  A shutdown would harm tens of millions of Americans who would be unable to access vital government services; it would disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands, or more, Federal employees who depend upon a check to provide for their families; and, in fact, it would endanger members of the U.military who are putting their lives on the line to defend our country.  The U.Congress has a responsibility to the American people to prevent a government shutdown and to work in a bipartisan manner to reach a budget agreement that is fair and that addresses the very serious problems facing not only DACA recipients but the working people of our country.  So I say to my Republican colleagues, you control the White House, you control the U.House, and you control the U.You have a responsibility to govern.  For President Trump and the Republican leadership to allow DACA to expire without a new program in place is not only a failure to govern, it is an act of extraordinary cruelty.  We know President Trump wants to build a wall, I guess somewhat like the Great Wall of The problem is, building walls may have made sense in the 14th century, but I would inform the President that technology has somewhat changed since then, and our job is to provide strong border security in the most cost-effective way we can, and that way is not building a wall. Ironically, while the President wants to spend $18 billion to build a wall, he is taking money away from other far more important and effective border security measures.  Let me quote from an article that appeared in today's New York Times:       The Trump administration would cut or delay funding for      border surveillance, radar technology, patrol boats and      customs agents in its upcoming spending plan to curb illegal      immigration--all proven security measures that officials and      experts have said are more effective than building a wall      along the Mexican border.       The wall also has become a bargaining chip in negotiations      with Congress as lawmakers seek to prevent nearly 800,000      young undocumented immigrants from being deported.       But security experts said the president's focus on a border      wall ignores the constantly evolving nature of terrorism      immigration and drug trafficking.  In other words, if we want strong border security, if we want to keep people out of this country who should not be coming into this country, if we want to keep drugs out of this country, building a wall is not the most cost-effective way. It may have been a great idea in the 14th century in China when they built their Great Wall, but it is not a great idea in 2018, in the United States of  So let me just conclude by saying, we are at a very important moment in history. If we do not do the right thing, if we do not do the moral thing, if we allow some 800,000 young people--people who have spent virtually their entire lives in this country, who know no other country, who see the United States of America as their home--if we betray them, if we take away their legal status, if we allow them to be deported, this will be a moral stain on this country that will never ever be wiped out.

816,topic-id,2343,"Madam President, despite Donald Trump's assertion last May that ``our country needs a good shutdown,'' the truth is, shutting down the government is a serious and dangerous action that we must do everything possible to prevent.  Shutting down the government would impact tens of millions of our fellow Americans who would be unable to access government services. It would severely impact Federal employees who would not get the paychecks they expected. It would also have a very significant impact on our Armed In other words, we must do everything we can to prevent a government shutdown, which is exactly what will happen if a budget agreement is not reached by January 19, when the short-term continuing resolution expires.  I am very disappointed, therefore, that the Republican Party, which controls the White House, the U.House, and the U.Senate, is pushing us closer and closer to a very dangerous government shutdown. The Republican leadership in Congress and the White House must not allow this shutdown to take place. They have to compromise. They cannot get it all.  As everyone knows, in 2011, Congress passed the Budget Control The centerpiece of that bipartisan legislation was that there would be parity in defense and nondefense spending. That agreement continued in the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. All of these bills provided equal amounts of funding for defense and nondefense purposes. Any future effort to increase the Budget Control Act caps must continue to[[Page S34]]adhere to this principle of parity. In other words, we have had a bipartisan agreement now for 6 years that has continued on four separate budgets. But now, threatening us with a government shutdown, the Republicans want to break that agreement.  I was very disturbed to hear Senate Majority Leader McConnell on the floor yesterday say:       Since fiscal year 2013, defense cuts have outpaced domestic      spending cuts by $85 billion. To fix this, we need to set      aside the arbitrary notion that defense spending be matched      equally by new nondefense spending. There is no reason why      funding for our national security and our servicemembers      should be limited by an arbitrary political formula that      bears no relationship to actual need.  That was Senator McConnell on the floor yesterday.  Unfortunately, what Senator McConnell said was inaccurate and misleading. His statement conveniently ignored the fact that mandatory spending on domestic programs like Medicare have been severely cut over this time period. He also ignored the fact that during this period, the Defense Department has also received tens and tens of billions of dollars in funding through the Overseas Contingency Operations funding, which is not capped at all.  If you include the Overseas Contingency Operations funding, the reality is that overall defense spending has gone up, not down, over this time period, while nondefense discretionary spending has been severely cut.  Further, Senator McConnell ignores a very, very important reality; that is, nondefense discretionary spending as a percentage of GDP is now at a 40-year low. This longstanding agreement regarding parity for defense and nondefense spending is not some kind of inside-the-beltway, esoteric issue. It is an issue that will impact tens of millions of working families in this country who, today, are struggling to keep their heads above water.  Over the last 40 years, while the middle class of our country has been shrinking, the people on top--the top 1 percent--have been doing phenomenally well. The actions of the Republican Congress in the last year have only made a bad situation, an unfair situation, even worse. In the United States today, some 28 million Americans have no health insurance. Yet, over the last year, the Republicans have attempted to throw an additional 32 million people off of the healthcare they have, including proposed cuts for Medicaid by up to $1 trillion over a 10-year period.  Tragically, the United States has the highest rate of childhood poverty of nearly any major country in the industrialized world. Instead of doing all that we can to end childhood poverty in this country, the Republicans have proposed to once again make a horrific situation even worse by cutting nutrition programs for children, cutting the WIC Program for low-income pregnant women, cutting the Head Start Program, after-school programs, and funding for public education.  There are millions of senior citizens in this country who can barely make it, and I sometimes wonder how in God's Name they do make it on $12,000, $13,000, $14,000 a year in Social How do you keep your house warm, how do you buy the food you need, how do you buy the prescription drugs you need to stay alive on $13,000 or $14,000 a year? There are millions of senior citizens in this country in that position. Yet, despite that reality, over the last year we have had to fight off one Republican effort after another to cut Social Security COLAs, to raise the retirement age, or to even privatize this life-or-death program.  Further, the Republicans have proposed massive cuts to LIHEAP, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which is keeping people warm in Vermont today when the weather goes below zero. All over this country, millions of people, often senior citizens, depend on this program. Yet President Trump, in his budget, proposes to wipe it out completely. Republican leaders are also proposing cuts to the Meals on Wheels program, senior housing programs, and  Today, in a highly competitive global economy, when we need to have the best educated workforce in the world, when the new jobs that are being created require a higher education, hundreds of thousands of bright young students desperately want to get a college education, but they are unable to do so because their families lack the income. But Republicans, incredibly, want to make that situation even worse by proposing massive cuts in the budget they recently passed to Pell grants--the major source of funding to help low-income young people get a college education--and other financial assistance programs for college. In my view, we should be making public colleges and universities tuition-free. Republicans today are proposing to make it harder for our young people to get the higher education they need.  During this budget process, when the Republicans want to expand military spending by some $100 billion--$100 billion--over the next 2 years, by far the largest increase in military spending in American history, we will not turn our backs on working families, the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor. The U.Government must do more than greatly expand military spending and give tax breaks to billionaires. Our job is to protect the working families of this country, and that is what the new budget must do. That means we must have parity between defense and nondefense spending. That is why this budget--the proposed budget--that we are working on now must address the many crises facing the working families of the United That is what the American people want, and that is what we must deliver. Among many other things that must be included in the new budget that we are working on is full funding for community health centers, which provides primary healthcare, dental care, mental health counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs to some 27 million Americans in every State in our country. It has been more than 3 months since funding for community health centers has lapsed. Our Nation's 1,400 community health centers in roughly 10,000 communities throughout this country are deeply worried right now as to when they will get the funding they need.  I just spoke to the leadership of community health centers in Vermont the other day. They have had a longstanding problem--as have community health centers all across this country--in retention and attracting new doctors and nurses into their programs. What we are seeing now is a situation where many people who might want to work at a community health center are saying: Why would I want to go there when the Republicans are delaying funding for this vitally important program?  If we do not act soon, 70 percent of the funding for community health centers will be cut and 2,800 health centers will close their doors. Community health centers must be funded at the levels contained in the bipartisan legislation introduced earlier this year. I congratulate Senator Blunt and Senator Stabenow for their bipartisan work on this issue, and there are a number of other Republicans who are cosponsoring that legislation. We could pass it tomorrow if it were on the floor of the Let us do that.  The offsets to the prevention program of the Affordable Care Act that were included in the December 21 agreement are unacceptable, and they must not be repeated. The Blunt-Stabenow bill has nine Republican cosponsors. This bill represents a modest 5-percent increase in funding at a cost of just $2 billion over 5 years--the very least we can do to address the major crisis of primary healthcare in America, especially in rural  As you know, Federal funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program expired on September 30, 2017. If the CHIP program is not reauthorized, 9 million children in working families will lose their health insurance. Can you imagine that we have a Congress prepared and acting to give tax breaks to the richest people in this country, but somehow or another they have not gotten around to reauthorize and re-fund the Children's Health Insurance Program? That must be done immediately and, once again, without regressive offsets which take money from other health insurance programs.  We must keep our promises on pensions. If Congress does not act soon, the earned pension benefits of more than 1.5 million workers and retirees in multi-employer pension plans could be cut by up to 60 percent. We must not rescind the promise we made to 1.5 million workers.[[Page S35]]  We must expand Social Security services for seniors. Since 2010, Congress has cut Social Security's operating budget by 16 percent, and Republicans want to cut it another 4 percent this year. These budget cuts have resulted in the loss of more than 10,000 employees, the closing of 64 field offices, and reduced hours in many others. In Vermont, one field office has seen its staffing cut by 30 percent. According to a recent Washington Post article, 10,000 people died in the past year while they waited for decisions on Social Security disability benefits. We need to increase the funding for these vital services by at least $1.4 billion just to bring staffing back up to where it was in 2010.  We need to keep our promises to our veterans, the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend our country. Right now, we have tens of thousands of vacancies in the Those vacancies must be filled. Veterans must be able to get high-quality, timely healthcare.  We must fight the opioid and heroin epidemic that is sweeping this country. All over America, we are seeing tens of thousands of people, often young people, overdosing on opioids and heroin. States and communities all over this country need the resources for prevention and treatment. That is an issue that cannot be delayed. It has to be dealt with now.  Everybody knows that in the last several months, we have seen disastrous hurricanes impact Texas and Florida and Puerto Rico and the Virgin In Puerto Rico today, there continue to be many people who still do not have electricity. We must pass disaster relief right now that is adequate and that treats Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands just as we will treat Texas and We cannot continue to delay given the enormous suffering that is existing in Puerto Rico and in the Virgin  Very briefly, let me touch on another issue of enormous consequence which simply cannot be ignored. On September 5, 2017, President Trump announced that he would be rescinding President Obama's Executive order on That decision means that some 800,000 young people who have known the United States of America as their only home--this is where they grew up; this is where they went to school--are on the verge of losing their legal status in terms of education, in terms of employment, and in terms of serving in the military if that program is not reestablished. Without the legal protections afforded by the DACA Program, these young people live in a constant fear of being deported. Since the President's announcement in September, more than 11,000 people have lost the protections under DACA, with there being approximately 22,000 set to lose their legal protections by the March 5, 2018, deadline.  Any spending agreement must address the fear and uncertainty that has been unnecessarily caused by the administration's reckless actions, and a clean Dream Act must be signed into law as part of the budget negotiations. Protecting the Dreamers and moving these young people toward citizenship is not some kind of wild and radical idea; it is precisely what the American people want. A recent Quinnipiac poll showed that 77 percent of the American people support providing legal protections to the This is an issue that must be dealt with, and it must be dealt with now.  When history looks back on this period, I do not want it to see a U.Congress that worked overtime to protect billionaires and large corporations and a Congress that turned its back on working families and the children and the sick and the poor. I do not want history to look back on this period and say that Members of Congress thought it appropriate to spend $100 billion more on the military but were not concerned about veterans who did not get the healthcare they needed or some 800,000 young people who are now frightened that they will lose their legal status.  As the U.Senate, we must get our priorities right, and we need a budget that deals not only with military spending but with the needs of the middle class and working families of this country.

On issue after issue, the American people want action, and they are not getting it. What they are getting is exactly what they don't want but what powerful special interests do want.  This month marks the 10th anniversary of the collapse of Bear Stearns, one of the largest investment banks in America, whose greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior triggered the worst economic crisis since the Great What is the response of the U.Senate to that? Are we talking about breaking up the large banks that have become much larger? Is that what we are talking about? Are we talking about protecting consumers who are paying 20 percent, 25 percent in interest rates on products they buy at a department store? Are we talking about taking on the payday lenders who are squeezing the lifeblood out of poor people who, in desperation, have to borrow money from them? No, that is not what we are talking about. We are not talking about the need to guarantee healthcare to all people. We are not talking about the affordable housing crisis. We are not talking about the fact that millions of moms and dads in this country can't afford childcare. We are not talking about the global crisis of climate change. We are not talking about our crumbling infrastructure, our rigged trade deals that have resulted in the deindustrialization of That is not what we are talking about.  What we are talking about at this particular moment, right here in the U.Senate, is the deregulation of some of the largest banks in America, some of the very same banks that nearly drove the economy off a cliff in 2008. That is what we are talking about.  Just last week, the Congressional Budget Office told us that the legislation on the floor right now will ``increase the likelihood that a large financial firm with assets of between $100 billion and $250 billion would fail.''  We are not talking about protecting consumers. We are not talking about breaking up large banks. We are not talking about taking on the power of Wall  What we are talking about is deregulating some of the very same banks that drove this economy into the worst economic downturn since the Great In other words, this legislation will make it more likely that we will see another financial crisis, another taxpayer bailout, and massive dislocation of our economy.  What CBO tells us is that this legislation will increase the deficit by more than $450 million over the next decade--$450 million. This bill, which benefits some of the largest banks in America, will cost us over $450 million. Who is going to pay for that? The big banks? It will be the American taxpayers who will be picking up this tab.  The question we have to ask ourselves, which we don't very often--although the American people, I think, understand this emotionally in their guts--is this: How does it happen that a bill like this gets to the floor while we are not dealing with the issues the American people are concerned about, whether it is gun safety, whether it is DACA and protecting the 1.8 million young people who are eligible for that program, whether it is the high cost of prescriptions? How does this particular bill get to the floor of the Senate? The answer is pretty obvious. Follow the money.  Since the 1990s, the financial sector has given more than $3.2 billion in campaign contributions. Let me repeat that. Since the 1990s, the financial sector--Wall Street, other parts of the financial sector--has given over $3.2 billion in campaign contributions. Last year alone, the financial sector spent over $200 million on lobbying. That is why Congress is spending day after day trying to make life easier for large financial institutions while continuing to ignore the needs of working families.  Instead of listening to lobbyists in Washington, maybe, just maybe--I know it is a very radical idea, but maybe, just maybe, we might want to listen to the American people. The American people believe, as I do, that we should strengthen, not weaken Wall Street regulations.  Now is not the time to be talking about deregulating large financial institutions. Now is the time to take on the greed and power of Wall Street, break up the large financial institutions in this country, and stop big banks from ripping off the American people by charging outrageous and usurious levels of interest rates. That is why I have submitted two amendments to this bill that I would like the Senate to vote on this afternoon.  The first amendment would break up large financial institutions so that the taxpayers of this country will never have to bail them out again. The second amendment would establish a 15-percent cap on the interest rates private banks charge their customers on credit cards and other consumer loans.  Before I talk about these amendments, let's be clear. Fraud is the business model of Wall It is not the exception to the rule; it is the rule. Since 2009, major banks in this country have been fined more than $200 billion for reckless, unfair, and deceptive activities. By the way, those fines take place within a very weak regulatory climate, but here are just a few examples of the kinds of activities that large banks have engaged in.  In August 2014, Bank of America paid $16 billion to settle charges that it lied to investors about the riskiness of the mortgage-backed securities it sold during the runup to the financial crisis.  In November 2013, JPMorgan Chase settled for $13 billion for lying to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac about the quality of the mortgage-backed securities it sold them. Settlement documents revealed how every large bank in the United States committed mortgage fraud.  In April of 2016, Goldman Sachs reached a $5 billion settlement for marketing and selling fraudulent mortgage-backed securities that were the foundation of the housing crisis.  In July of 2014, Citigroup reached a $7 billion settlement for mortgage fraud. Then-Attorney General Eric Holder said that Citigroup's ``activities contributed mightily to the financial crisis that devastated our economy in 2008.''  If you are thinking that the illegal behavior of Wall Street executives was limited to the housing crisis, that it was a one-time thing, guess again. Let me give some more examples.  In May of 2015, five banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, paid $5.4 billion in fines after pleading guilty to ``a brazen display of collusion and foreign exchange rate market manipulation,'' according to then-Attorney General Loretta  In March of 2014, the FDIC accused 16 large banks, including Bank of America, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase, of fraud and conspiracy in an epic plot to manipulate bank-to-bank interest rates that underpinned at least $350 trillion in global financial transactions.  In April of 2011, Wachovia was fined for laundering billions of dollars in illegal drug money. The Federal prosecutor said, ``Wachovia's blatant disregard for our banking laws gave international cocaine cartels a virtual carte blanche to finance their operations.'' That was from the Federal prosecutor. The fine was less than 2 percent of the bank's $12.3 billion profit.  On and on it goes. Mortgage fraud, money laundering, currency manipulation, bribery, conspiracy, rate tampering, and collusion are the routine[[Page S1707]]practices of Wall Street; they are not the exception. This is their business model.  Our country can no longer afford to tolerate the culture of fraud and corruption on Wall Let us never, ever forget--although, I fear many people have already here in Congress--that during the financial crisis of 2008, the American people were told that they needed to bail out huge financial institutions because those institutions were too big to fail. Do people remember that? They were just too big to fail. If they had gone down, the whole economy would have gone down with them. Yet the four largest financial institutions in this country--JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo--are, on average, 80 percent larger today than they were before we bailed them out. Today, they are 80 percent larger than they were before we bailed them out because they were too big to fail. Does that make sense to anybody? Left alone, that is not even an issue that will be talked about here on the floor of the  Incredibly, since the financial crisis, JPMorgan Chase has increased its assets by more than $1 trillion. Bank of America has seen its assets grow by more than $800 billion. Citigroup has grown by over $547 billion. After Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia, it nearly tripled in size.  No single financial institution should be so large that its failure would cause a catastrophic risk to millions of Americans or to our Nation's economic well-being. No single financial institution should have holdings so extensive that its failure would send the world economy into crisis. If an institution is too big to fail, it is too big to exist, and we should break it up.  Let me be very clear. We should not just be concerned about the danger these institutions pose to taxpayers. The enormous concentration of ownership within the financial sector is harming the middle class and damaging the economy by limiting choices and raising prices for consumers and small businesses.  Today--and it is important that people understand this, but unfortunately it is not an issue that is discussed at all, not here in Congress and not much in the media--the six largest banks in America have over $10 trillion in assets, equivalent to 54 percent of the GDP in When we talk about having the United States move in the direction of an oligarchy, when we talk about a handful of institutions and billionaires controlling the economic and political life of this country, this is what we are talking about.  Let me repeat. The six largest banks in America have over $10 trillion in assets, equivalent to 54 percent of our The top six banks hold more than half of all credit card debt, control over 90 percent of all bank derivatives, underwrite about a third of all mortgages, and control over 40 percent of all bank deposits.  If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, I have a sense about what he would be saying. He would say break them up, and he would be right. That is exactly what my first amendment would do.  Specifically, this amendment would require the Federal Reserve to break up any financial institution whose total exposure is greater than 2 percent of our Nation's GDP over the next 2 years. These banks would include JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, U.Bancorp, PNC Financial Services, Capital One, and the TD Group--financial institutions that have a combined total exposure of more than 77 percent of our Nation's None of these institutions would be able to receive a taxpayer bailout from the Federal Reserve or gamble with the federally insured bank deposits of the American people. Under this amendment, no financial institution could have a total financial exposure above $398 billion.  Call me old-fashioned, but I believe the function of banking should be boring. The function of banking should not be about making as much profit as possible in gambling on derivatives and other esoteric financial instruments. The function of banking should be to provide affordable loans to small businesses in order to create jobs in the productive economy. The function of banking should be to provide affordable loans to Americans to purchase their homes and their cars. Wall Street cannot be an island unto itself, and I hope very much that my colleagues will support this important amendment.  Not only do we have to break up these very large banks, but we also have to stop them from ripping off the American people by their charging outrageous interest rates and fees, and that is exactly what my second amendment would do.  Incredibly, since the Wall Street crash, credit card companies have raked in over $1.2 trillion in revenue from interest and fees they charge consumers, including over $160 billion in 2016 alone. That is unacceptable. At a time when the American people hold a recordbreaking $1 trillion in credit card debt and desperately need some relief on that debt, my second amendment would establish a national usury rate of 15 percent on credit cards and other consumer loans.  In America today, incredibly, millions of our people are now paying credit card interest rates of 20, 25, or even 30 percent. I am not just talking about the payday lenders who are acting in a way that is totally unbelievable in ripping off the poorest people in our country. Let's be clear. When credit card companies charge over 20 percent in interest on credit cards, they are not engaged in the business of making credit available; what they are involved in is extortion and loan sharking. That is what they are engaged in.  Interestingly enough, if you read the religious tenets of the major religions throughout history, whether it be Christianity, Judaism, or Islam, what you will find is a universal objection and disgust to usury. This has existed for thousands and thousands of years. People know that it is immoral to lend money to poor people, struggling people, and then charge them excessive interest rates. That is in the religious teachings of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and other religions.  In the ``Divine Comedy,'' Dante reserved a special place in the Seventh Circle of Hell for people who charged usurious interest rates. Today, we don't need the hellfire and the pitchforks, and we don't need the rivers of boiling blood, but we do need a national usury law that caps interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15 percent.  Despite the fact that banks can borrow money today at less than 1.5 percent from the Fed, the average credit card interest rate today for consumers is now 16.84 percent. Borrow money at 1.5 percent from the Fed, and then charge consumers an average of 16.84 percent.  Further, if you get a credit card from a store like Macy's, Kohl's, Lowe's, or Sears, interest rates are even higher. Stores like these are charging customers an average interest rate of 26 percent, and many of the stores rely on these high interest rate cards for more than a third of their revenue. They are making money not just by selling clothing or washing machines or shoes; a substantial part of their profit scheme comes from the high interest rates they are getting on these financial transactions. What that means is, if you buy a $500 refrigerator from Lowe's, Home Depot, or Sears on one of their credit cards, you will likely owe an additional $130 in interest on a $500 refrigerator. How is that? Do you think that is an issue we might want to talk about just for a moment? I know the consumers of this country don't pour hundreds of millions of dollars into lobbying or billions of dollars into campaign contributions. I understand that. But maybe, just maybe, we might want to remember the folks back home.  Establishing a usury law is not a radical concept. Up until 1978, about half of the States in our country had usury laws on the books that capped credit card interest rates, but those States' interest rates were obliterated by a 1978 Supreme Court decision, that of Marquette National Bank v. First of Omaha Service, which concluded that national banks could charge whatever interest rates they wanted if they moved to a State without a usury law. So all of these credit card companies moved to South They moved to Delaware, which had no interest rate caps, and they charged people in Vermont or in Kansas--or in every other State in the country--interest rates of 20 to 30 percent.  This has to stop. The American people are sick and tired of being ripped off by the same financial institutions[[Page S1708]]they bailed out 10 years ago--what a world. We bail out the crooks--taxpayer money bails them out--and they charge the same people who bailed them out 20 to 30 percent interest rates on loans.  This amendment simply applies the same statutory interest rate cap on credit cards that Congress imposed on credit unions in 1980, capping interest rates at 15 percent, except under extraordinary circumstances. In other words, if you get a credit card through a credit union, you are going to be paying, in almost every case, no more than 15 percent. That is mandated by Federal law. By and large, that law has worked for about 40 years. Unlike big banks, credit unions do not come begging the American taxpayer for huge bailouts. Ten years ago they didn't come for a huge bailout. Credit unions have survived and thrived on a 15-percent cap, and the time has come to extend that cap to private banks as well. There is nothing radical about that. It exists for the credit unions in this country, and it should exist for the large banks.  There has even been support for this concept in the In 1991, former Senator Al D'Amato offered an amendment to cap interest rates at 14 percent that passed on a vote of 74 to 14. It was not a radical idea, and it passed by a huge vote in 1991.  Here is what Al D'Amato, the Republican chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said in 1991:       Fourteen percent is certainly a reasonable rate of interest      for banks to charge customers for credit card debt. It allows      a comfortable profit margin but keeps banks in line so that      interest rates rise and fall with the health of the economy.  That was an accurate statement in 1991. It is even more accurate today.  Let's be clear. Credit cards are no longer used just to buy luxury items. We all know that. All over this country, people are buying their groceries, their food, and other basic essentials with credit cards. Commuters are paying for the gas they put into their cars on their credit cards. Young people are paying their college expenses with credit cards.  According to the Federal Reserve, 44 percent of the American people could not pay for a $400 emergency expense, like a car accident, if they could not charge it on their credit cards or borrow money from a payday lender, a friend, or a family member. That is the reality of America today. It is not a reality we discuss here in the Senate, but that is the reality, nonetheless.  Given that reality, it seems to me that if we are going to respond to the needs of the American people, we need to deal with the issue of usury and stop large financial institutions from ripping off the American people.  Madam President, with that in mind, I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be called up and reported by number: the Sanders amendment 2114 and the Sanders amendment 2155; further, that the Senate vote on the Sanders amendment 2114 without intervening action or debate; and that following disposition of the Sanders amendment 2114, the Senate vote on the Sanders amendment 2155.

1097,topic-id,2219,"Thank you, Mr. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution states in no uncertain terms that ``Congress shall have power to . . . declare war.''  Let me repeat it. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution states it is Congress that has the power to declare war.  The Founding Fathers gave the power to authorize military conflicts to Congress, the branch most accountable--not to the President but to Congress--and that is the issue we are going to be debating today.  For far too long, Congress, under Democratic and Republican administrations, has abdicated its constitutional role in authorizing war. The time is long overdue for Congress to reassert that constitutional authority, and that is what today is about.  That is why I and 14 cosponsors of this resolution--Senators Lee, Murphy, Warren, Booker, Durbin, Leahy,[[Page S1802]]Markey, Feinstein, Wyden, Merkley, Blumenthal, Gillibrand, Schatz, and Baldwin--that is what we are doing with S.54.  What we are saying is, if Congress wants to go to war in Yemen or anyplace else, vote to go to war. That is your constitutional responsibility. Stop abdicating that responsibility to a President, whether it is a Republican President or, as in the past, Democratic  I expect that colleagues today will be arguing about what the word ``hostilities'' means within the context of the 1973 War Powers What does the word ``hostilities'' mean? Some will argue that American troops are not out there shooting and getting shot at, not exchanging gunfire with their enemies, and that we are not really engaged in the horrifically destructive Saudi-led war in That is what some will argue on the floor today--that we are really not engaged in hostilities; we are not exchanging fire.  Well, please tell that to the people of Yemen whose homes and lives are being destroyed by weapons marked ``Made in the USA'' and dropped by planes being refueled by the U.military on targets chosen with U.assistance. Only in the narrowest, most legalistic terms can anyone argue that the United States is not actively involved in hostilities alongside Saudi Arabia in  Let me take a minute to tell my colleagues what is happening in Yemen right now because a lot of people don't know. It is not something that is on the front pages of the newspapers or covered terribly much on television.  Right now, in a very poor nation of 27 million people--that is the nation of Yemen--in November of last year, the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator told us that Yemen was on the brink of ``the largest famine the world has seen for many decades.'' That is from the United So far, in this country of 27 million people--this very poor country--over 10,000 civilians have been killed and 40,000 civilians have been wounded. Over 3 million people in Yemen, in a nation of 27 million, have been displaced--driven from their homes. Fifteen million people lack access to clean water and sanitation because water treatment plants have been destroyed. More than 20 million people in Yemen--over two-thirds of the population of that country--need some kind of humanitarian support, with nearly 10 million in acute need of assistance. More than 1 million suspected cholera cases have been reported, representing potentially the worst cholera outbreak in world history. That is what is going on in Yemen today as a result of the Saudi-led war there.  Here is the bottom line: If the President of the United States or Members of Congress believe that support for this war is in the U.interests--and I think some do--if you think that the United States right now, for our own interests, should be involved in the civil war in Yemen, being led by Saudi Arabia, then Members of the U.Senate should have the courage to vote for U.participation in that war. It is nothing more complicated than that.  If you want to come to the floor of the Senate and make the case as to why you think it is good public policy for us to be involved in the civil war in Yemen, come to the floor and oppose our resolution, but what I hope very much that we will not see today is the tabling of this motion and the refusal by Members of the Senate to vote up or down as to whether we wish to continue aiding Saudi Arabia in this humanitarian disaster.  If you believe, as I do, that we should not get sucked into this civil war, which has already caused so much human suffering, please vote against tabling the motion to discharge and vote with us on final passage. If you believe the United States should continue to assist Saudi Arabia in this war, I urge you to have the courage to tell your constituents that is your decision and why you have made that decision when you vote against final passage. In other words, if you support the war, have the courage to vote for it; if you don't, support the resolution Senator Lee, Senator Murphy, and I have introduced.  Let me give my colleagues at least two reasons why Congress must reassert its constitutional authority over the issue of war and why we cannot continue to abdicate that responsibility to the President, and those have everything to do with the two most significant foreign policy disasters in the modern history of the United States--the war in Iraq and the war in In both of these cases, Congress sat back and failed to ask the hard questions as two administrations--one Republican, one Democratic--led us into conflicts with disastrous consequences.  Interestingly, today is a historically significant day for us to debate this resolution. Fifteen years ago today, on March 20, 2003, the war in Iraq began, and the bombs started falling in Baghdad--15 years ago today. I was one of those who opposed the Iraq war in the beginning, and today it is now broadly acknowledged that the war--that war--was a foreign policy blunder of enormous magnitude. That war created a cascade of instability around the region that we are still dealing with today in Syria and elsewhere and will be for many years to come. Indeed, had it not been for the war in Iraq, ISIS would almost certainly not exist.  That war deepened hostilities between Sunni and Shia communities in Iraq and elsewhere. It exacerbated a regional conflict for power between Saudi Arabia and Iran and their proxies in places like Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, and it undermined American diplomatic efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The devastation experienced by Iraq's civilians was enormous. A recent academic study by U.S., Canadian, and Iraqi researchers found that over 400,000 Iraqi civilians--nearly half a million people--were killed directly or indirectly as a consequence of that war.  That war led to the displacement of nearly 5 million people, both inside and outside Iraq, putting great stress on the ability of surrounding countries to deal with these refugee flows.  We have also seen this more recently in Europe as the large numbers of people fleeing the Syrian war have generated a backlash in European countries, giving rise to anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiments.  The war in Iraq led to the deaths--to the deaths--of some 4,400 American troops and the wounding, physical and emotional, of tens of thousands of others, not to mention the pain inflicted on family members. By the way, that war in Iraq cost us trillions of dollars--money that could have been spent on healthcare, education, infrastructure, and environmental protection.  The Iraq war, like so many other military conflicts, had unintended consequences. It ended up making us less safe, not more safe.  It must be said that the Bush administration and the President lied when he told the American people: ``[Saddam's] regime is seeking a nuclear bomb, and with fissile material could build one within a year.'' That was not true.  Vice President Dick Cheney lied when he told us:       There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of      mass destruction. There is no doubt he is amassing them to      use against our friends, against our allies, and against us.  Dick Cheney--not true.  No one disagrees that Saddam Hussein was a brutal, murderous dictator, but it is now known he had nothing to do with 9/11. The Bush administration lied to the American people. Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction. It was not connected to 9/11.  The American people were misled by the Bush administration into believing that the Iraq war was necessary to prevent another 9/11, and Congress did not challenge them on those claims in a way that Congress should have--with disastrous consequences.  That was a Republican administration. Now let me tell you about a Democratic administration where, once again, Congress refused to assert its constitutional responsibility.  Let us go back to 1964, to a conflict that began under similarly false premises. President Lyndon Johnson cited an attack on a U.ship in the Gulf of Tonkin as a pretext for escalating the U.intervention in Vietnam and sending more and more and more troops into that quagmire.  But we now know from declassified recordings that Johnson himself doubted that the USS Maddox had come[[Page S1803]]under fire on August 4, 1964. As we all know, that alleged attack was used to push for the Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorizing Johnson to escalate U.military involvement in Vietnam, and we now know that the Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, misled Congress and the public in order to generate support for that resolution.  You don't have to believe me. This is what LCDR Pat Paterson wrote in a paper for the U.Naval Institute: ``The evidence suggests a disturbing and deliberate attempt by Secretary of Defense McNamara to distort the evidence and mislead Congress.''  Paterson, interestingly enough, also quotes another author who wrote:       To enhance his chances for election, [Johnson] and McNamara      deceived the American people and Congress about events and      the nature of the American commitment in They used a      questionable report of a North Vietnamese attack on American      naval vessels to justify the president's policy to the      electorate and to defuse Republican senator and presidential      candidate Barry Goldwater's charges that Lyndon Johnson was      irresolute and ``soft'' in the foreign policy arena.  Interestingly enough, that author is H.McMaster, President Trump's current National Security  Lyndon Johnson's administration misled both Congress and the American people into that war, just as the Bush administration misled us into the war in Iraq, and what disasters both of those wars were. The war in Vietnam nearly destroyed an entire generation of young people. Almost 60,000 died in that war, and God knows how many came back wounded in body and in spirit. It almost destroyed an entire generation. Yet Congress abdicated its responsibility in Vietnam, as it did in  The truth about Yemen is that U.forces have been actively engaged in support of the Saudi coalition in this war, providing intelligence and aerial refueling of planes whose bombs have killed thousands of people and made this humanitarian crisis far worse. U.involvement in the Yemen war has also proved counterproductive to the effort against al-Qaida's affiliates. The State Department's ``Country Reports on Terrorism 2016'' found that the conflict between Saudi-led forces and the Houthi insurgents has helped al-Qaida's and ISIS's Yemen branch to ``deepen their inroads across much of the country.'' In other words, as we see again, when there is chaos, when there is mass confusion, ISIS and their allies are able to jump in.  Furthermore, while Iran's support for Houthi insurgents is of serious concern for all of us, the truth is that this war has increased, not decreased, the opportunities for Iranian interference.  The Trump administration has tried to justify our involvement in the Yemen war as necessary to push back on Well, another administration told us that invading Iraq was necessary to confront al-Qaida, and another told us that the Vietnam war was necessary to contain None of that turned out to be true.  The Congress, at those times, should have asked the hard questions, which they didn't ask. The Congress should have taken its constitutional role seriously and should have done what the Constitution demands that it do, and that is what my cosponsors and I are doing today.  I see my colleague Senator Lee here. He has been very active in standing up for the Constitution on this issue, and I will yield to him in a minute. But here is the bottom line--and it is not a complicated line; the Constitution is clear: The U.Congress decides whether we go to war. There is no question in my mind that by aiding Saudi Arabia in the way that we are doing, we are assisting in war. We are in a conflict.  If Members of the Senate think that conflict makes sense and is good public policy for the United States of America, vote down our resolution. If you agree with Senator Lee and me that it is a bad idea, support us. But what I would urge in the strongest possible terms is that Members of the Senate have to end the abdication of our constitutional responsibility. Accept it; vote yes or vote no.

If we think back on the modern history of our country and if we think of the two most significant foreign policy decisions--the war in Vietnam and the war in Iraq and the unbelievable unintended consequences that those two destructive wars had--what we conclude is that in both of those wars--one under a Democratic President and one under a Republican President--the Congress abdicated its responsibility. It did not ask the right questions. In both instances, we got into those terrible wars based on lies. The Johnson administration lied as to why we should get involved in the war in Vietnam, and the Bush administration lied as to why we should get involved in the war in  It just seems to me that if nothing else, based on those two examples of what the war in Vietnam did and what the war in Iraq did, Congress has to take a deep breath and understand that the people who wrote the Constitution were not fools when they said it must be the elected people who are closest to the constituents who have to debate these issues and who know that decisions being made will result in the loss of lives of the people in their own States, and we have abdicated that responsibility.  No one can predict whether the decisions made by Congress are going to be good decisions with regard to war and peace, whether we are going to do better than Presidents did. I don't know. At the very least, we have to accept our responsibility and not simply take the word of Presidents who in the two most recent, significant wars have lied to the American people.

1841,topic-id,822,"Mr.President, the resolution that we will soon be voting on is really very simple. It has two basic points. Point 1, I and the 14 other cosponsors of this resolution believe that under the definitions laid out in the 1973 War Powers Resolution, U.forces have been introduced into the Saudi-led war in Yemen, a war which is causing a humanitarian disaster.  I would say to my good friend Senator Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, that this war has been going on for 3 years. Some 10,000 civilians in Yemen are dead and 40,000 have been wounded. A million are dealing with cholera right now, and millions have been displaced. You come tonight on the floor and you say: We are going to hold a hearing. That is good, but it is 3 years too late.  The issue that we are dealing with right now is whether or not the U.Senate and the U.Congress accepts its constitutional responsibility on the issues of war. This is not a complicated issue, and I don't think anybody here disagrees. Article I, section 8, of the Constitution says not that the President can make war and send our young people into harm's way. It is the Congress of the United States that should make war.  Our role now in Yemen working with the Saudi-led intervention there is one of hostilities under the War Powers Resolution of the United It is not just my view on this. As many may know here--as I suspect the chairman of the committee knows--last November, by a vote of 366 to 30, the U.House of Representatives agreed with the essence of what Senator Lee and I are trying to do, and the House passed a nonbinding resolution stating that U.involvement in the Yemen civil war is unauthorized. Every Member of the Democratic leadership voted for that, as did the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed  An editorial in the New York Times today states:       The United States initially deployed forces to combat Al      Qaeda in Yemen under post-11 congressional      authorization measures. But Congress never specifically      approved military involvement in the Saudi-Houthi war even      though the Constitution and the 1973 War Powers Act give      lawmakers a role.  The New York Times:       For too long, Congress has abdicated its role as America      prolonged its stay in some wars and expanded into others. And      presidents have been too reluctant to share these crucial      decisions with lawmakers. Resolutions like this--  The one we are debating--     can and must force serious debate and accountability.  I say this to my friend the chairman: I think now of the two major foreign policy disasters that have taken place in our lifetime--1, the war in In that war--a Democratic administration under an otherwise very good President, Lyndon Johnson--he and the Secretary of Defense misled and lied to the American people with regard to the Gulf of Tonkin That is now established fact as a result of declassified information. The United States got sucked into that war, and my generation--the young men of my generation--suffered so terribly. Over 60,000 died, and many others came home wounded in body and in spirit. The U.Congress abdicated its responsibility at that point in 1964.  Fifteen years ago--oddly enough, on this day--there was the war in Iraq, under a Republican administration, and the administration lied to the American people again. Where was Congress getting the facts? We had the[[Page S1827]]Vice President of the United States: Oh, Saddam Hussein is building weapons of mass destruction. There is a connection between Saddam Hussein and Iraq and the 9/11 perpetrators.  It was a lie. It was a lie. Mistakenly, Congress voted to approve the war based on false information.  So what I say today is that it is time for the Congress to accept its constitutional responsibility. I don't know how well we will do. Maybe we will screw it up as well. It is very possible. But that is what the Founding Fathers suggested, and I think they were right. We are closer to the people--the House and the Senate--than is the White House, this White House or any other White  So there are two issues today. Do we accept our constitutional responsibility to vote on matters of war? I would suggest that every Member of the Senate vote yes. Don't duck your responsibility. Don't abdicate your responsibility. Second of all, this war in Yemen, in my view, has been a humanitarian disaster as a result of Saudi intervention. But the most important vote is, do we actually have a vote on whether American troops are involved in the war in Yemen?

Union members have a collective voice to fight for higher wages, better benefits, safer workplaces, fewer injuries, fewer deaths, lower rates of gender-based violence.

His caring for kids is unmatched, and he is a great asset to his State of Oregon, to this body, and to our country.  We have 2 weeks until funding for the government runs out. Alongside our talks about extending government funding, we have also been engaged in serious bipartisan negotiations on a number of issues that should coincide with that deadline. We have to lift spending cuts, pass disaster aid, a healthcare package, reach an agreement to enshrine DACA protections alongside additional border security, and of course there is the issue of 702 as well.  Those negotiations, though difficult, have been proceeding quite well. In fact, the four congressional leaders met with representatives from the White House last Thursday and had an encouraging meeting. Unfortunately, following that meeting, the White House issued a series of unreasonable demands entirely outside the scope of our ongoing negotiations about DACA and border security. It is part of a pattern of behavior on the part of this White House during sensitive bipartisan negotiations.  Over the past year, the White House has much more frequently been a disruptive force rather than a unifying force. To throw down a list from the hard-line wing of the White House at the last minute is not a very fortuitous or smart thing to do.  I hope we can keep on the track that we were on because the issues we are facing are mounting, and a major deal requires dedicated, bipartisan effort. Democrats are going to keep working toward a global agreement with our Republican colleagues, one that lifts the spending caps for defense and urgent domestic priorities in tandem, that sends our men and women in uniform the support they need, and that puts a downpayment on tackling the pressing issues here at home, such as combating the opioid epidemic, improving veterans' healthcare, and shoring up pension plans. These are every bit as important as helping our troops.  Our troops are extremely important, but we are a great country, and we don't have to say: To help the troops, we can't help the victims of opioid addiction. To help the troops, we can't help the veterans who once were troops themselves. To help the troops, we can't help working Americans keep the pensions they paid into year after year. All these folks want is to retire to a life of some degree of dignity.  When the majority leader said this morning that he is not for parity, he is saying we can't do both. He is telling victims of opioid addiction, many of whom are soldiers who have PTSD, and he is telling pensioners--some miners in his own State--and he is telling veterans who have to wait in line for healthcare that this country can't do both, that we can't protect our military, give them the funds they need, and deal with our domestic needs.  When Donald Trump ran, he said that we have to pay more attention to What the majority leader is saying is that is not the case. So let no one be fooled. When the majority leader says he is not for parity, he is not for helping opioid folks to the extent they need, he is not for helping veterans to the extent they need, and he is not for helping pensioners to the extent they need. We Democrats are there for both--helping the military and helping these folks here.

274,topic-id,620,"Mr.President, first, as we begin the 2nd session of the 115th Congress, I welcome all of my colleagues back from the holiday break and wish them a happy new year, and I wish our country a wonderful 2018. I was also very gratified to see two of the best former Vice Presidents we have ever had on the floor today for the ceremonies. I am glad to see former Senators Mondale and Biden--former Vice Presidents Mondale and Biden--as feisty and as strong as they have ever been and giving us their opinions.  It is also very exciting to welcome two new Members to this body who will be joining the Democratic caucus, Tina Smith from Minnesota and Doug Jones from In joining this esteemed body, both bring a wealth of experience and individual passions.  Former Lieutenant Governor Tina Smith brings with her several years of experience serving at the highest levels of State Government, where she focused on economic development and expanding access to rural broadband and affordable healthcare, issues she will continue to fight for here in the In that work, Governor Dayton praised her as ``extremely intelligent, quick to learn and always open to hearing others' views.'' She was also dubbed the ``velvet hammer'' by the mayor of Minneapolis for her ability to work across the aisle but also to get tough when she needs to be. Those are precisely the kinds of qualities that make an effective The people of Minnesota are lucky to have Senator Smith, and we look forward to welcoming her in our next caucus.  We also look forward to welcoming Senator Doug Jones--the first Democrat from the State of Alabama in a quarter century. He, too, represents[[Page S3]]the very best of public service, the very best of America, and the things we aspire to in this country. One story from his biography stands out. As a second-year law student, Doug Jones skipped class to attend the trial of the Klansman ringleader of the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, an event that shook the conscience of our country and helped launch a mighty movement for civil rights. That day a young Doug Jones was moved by the disposition of justice, but he was left with the impression that other members of the conspiracy had escaped the reach of the law. So 24 years later, when Doug Jones became the U.attorney for the State of Alabama, he pursued charges against two more Klan members involved in the bombing, winning their conviction and delivering a long-delayed but righteous justice. With his work, justice rolled down like a mighty stream. He will continue to fight for civil rights and many other issues here in the I know he cares deeply about the CHIP program, which covers 150,000 young I hope we can get that done for his State and this country very soon.  Doug Jones was an excellent candidate. Like Senator Smith, he will make an outstanding Senator--she for the State of Minnesota and he for the State of The voices of Jones and Smith will add to the diversity of energy of our caucus. I predict that both will become influential voices in this historic  Each of their States had great football victories this weekend, I might add.

525,topic-id,1136,"Mr.President, yesterday the four congressional leaders had a positive and productive meeting with Budget Director Mulvaney and representatives from the White House, including Mr.It was a good first step, but there is a lot of work to do. Ultimately, the budget agreement must lift the spending caps with parity between defense and urgent domestic priorities, it must include disaster aid, a healthcare package, and an agreement to enshrine DACA protections alongside additional border security.  Like our Republican colleagues, Democrats want to make sure our men and women in uniform have the resources they need to do their jobs. There is not an argument about that, but we also want to make sure there are crucial investments in economic development and job creation here at home--programs that support the middle class and help it grow.  That includes a number of things, including funding needed for the opioid crisis. Life expectancy has gone down in America for the first time in years because of deaths from the opioid abuse by young people and middle-aged people. Are we just going to shrug our shoulders at that? There is a lot more to do. It affects rural areas, urban areas, and suburban areas. There have been 63,000 Americans who have died from drug overdoses. Those are deaths on the battlefield, in a sense, as well--often the flower of our youth, the prime of America, so many in rural areas. These are kids who were full of potential. Many were veterans dealing with the wounds of war. They served our country and didn't get what they needed when they came home.  I had a father cry in my arms. His son had been grappling with opioids. Finally, they had persuaded the son to sign up for a treatment program, but the treatment program didn't have the funding it needed so there was a long waiting list, and the son died of an overdose while waiting on that list. We can't have that anymore.  What about veterans' healthcare? These are people who risked their lives for us. We need to do it.  What about millions of hard-working Americans who need pensions? One of the issues Americans are most worried about is pensions and retirement. For years, they paid into these plans. They were told: You know, when you retire, you are not going to be rich, you are not going to be able to buy luxuries, but at least you will have a life of dignity. Now those pensions have been robbed from so many people throughout the country. Are we going to shrug our shoulders?  I hear the majority leader say he is not for parity. ``Parity'' is not just a word, it is veterans, people who need opioid relief, and middle-class folks and working people who need pensions. Are our Republican colleagues going to do what they just did in the tax bill and abandon the middle class? Are our Republican colleagues going to do what they tried to do in the healthcare bill and take away healthcare from millions of working people, people in the middle class? ``Parity'' is the term we use around here. I would rather call it defending middle-class Just as it is important to defend America from foreign enemies, which our military does so bravely and proudly, we have to defend America here.  I plead with Leader McConnell not to abandon the middle class in this bill. Funding the military is a worthy goal and so is helping the middle class. For the past year, unfortunately, our Republican colleagues have been doing what the very wealthy people want and ignoring the middle class and working people. That is one of the reasons right now so many Americans say they would rather have a Democratic Senate than a Republican I would rather have a Senate that helps the middle class, whatever the political outcome, but our colleagues don't seem to be going for that.  I say to Leader McConnell, my friend, you cannot let the hard right dictate what you want because the hard right and their wealthy benefactors are not where America is. It is not even where the Republican Party has always been.  Now, in addition to parity helping the middle class, we need to do other things. We should pass a disaster package that treats all States and territories fairly given the necessity of relief in Texas, California, Louisiana, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.Virgin By the way, we need to make sure we straighten out things in the West so the Forest Service isn't robbed of the funding they need to prevent future forest fires as they take the money out to handle present forest fires. We need to do that.  I know a lot of Congressmen from the House want aid. Even though many of them opposed aid when New York and New Jersey had a crisis, we are not going to play tit for tat, but we want a fair bill, and we want our priorities recognized as well.  Finally, there are the This must be done now. Leader McConnell seems to think there is no urgency. We disagree strongly--respectfully but strongly. There is an urgent need. We have hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of Americans who want America to be their country--who were[[Page S29]]brought here through no fault of their own, who are working in our factories and offices, who are going to our schools, and who are serving in our military. Right now, every morning they wake up with a pit of fear in their heart that they will be deported and separated from their families. There is a very strong urgency there, and we have to get the Dreamers taken care of as well as these other needs.  So our language, our proposal on this budget deal is to take care of the middle class in terms of pensions and opioids and veterans, take care of disaster relief, take care of the healthcare problems we face--we all know about CHIP, community health centers, and healthcare extenders--and take care of both the border and the We can do it all. We should do it all.  It is no secret that in each of these areas right now there are sticking points, but there are potential points of agreement. All five parties continue to have discussion groups on these four circles of areas--and to do them concurrently and come up with solutions quickly so we can meet that January 19 deadline because nobody wants sequestration to go into effect for the military or nonmilitary side of the budget. Our goal should be a global agreement on all these issues by January 19. That is the best way to resolve the issues we face.  I see my dear friend from Georgia waiting, and I yield the floor to him.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-04-pt1-PgS28-3.txt,1036,1300,2018.0,4.0,January

658,topic-id,1188,"Mr.President, we have barely over a week to negotiate a broad package of must-pass items, including an extension of government funding, a deal to lift the spending caps for both defense and urgent domestic priorities, a healthcare package, disaster aid, an agreement to protect the Dreamers, and to provide additional border security.  The path forward on some of these issues is very clear. There are significant bipartisan majorities that would vote to extend CHIP, or the Children's Health Insurance Program, and community health centers. There seems to be a growing consensus on how we can pass the 702 FISA Court program.  I am also confident that we could assemble a disaster aid package that addresses the needs of all of the States and Territories--Texas, Florida, Louisiana, California, the Western States that have been plagued by fires, Puerto Rico, and the U.Virgin Islands--as well as modifying what the Forest Service does so they don't spend all of their money simply fighting forest fires and not do the job they are intended to do, which is to prevent future forest fires by careful forestry programs.  Even where the path is murkier, the outlines of a deal exist. If we don't lift the spending caps in short order, the sharp ax of sequestration will fall on the military side of the budget and on the domestic side of the budget. That is a scenario everyone wants to avoid.  The majority leader continues to insist that we should raise the budget caps unequally, sparing our military but not critical domestic programs that create jobs, grow our economy, and help the middle class. We Democrats believe we absolutely must provide the resources our men and women overseas need to protect our country. We believe that strongly, but we also know that there are many important issues here at home--combating the opioid crisis, improving veterans' healthcare, shoring up pensions for millions of hard-working Americans who are approaching retirement, and dealing with rural development and rural broadband. These items are all crucial to the middle class.  The deadly scourge of opioid addiction has contributed to the first consecutive-year decline in life expectancy in the great United States of America since the early 1960s. That is an astounding and alarming fact that should rouse everyone in this Chamber to action. It is not occurring in most of our Western country allies.  Some of our veterans have been waiting in line for healthcare at veterans hospitals for over a year. These men and women served our country bravely. We have a solemn responsibility to serve them when they come home, and we are not living up to that responsibility right now.  Over a million Americans paid into pension plans with the expectation that they could retire with basic dignity. For so many of them--teamsters, miners, food workers--pensions have fallen short, and a lifetime of careful savings may be ripped away from pensioners at the last moment. We could make progress on each of these issues through a budget that lifts the spending caps equally for defense and nondefense.  The Republican majority, which conveniently forgot its long history of opposing deficits when passing a $1.5 trillion tax bill, cannot, in good conscience, turn around and complain about deficits here. So let's make the investments we all know are essential in both our military and in our middle class.  Even on the most challenging issue we face, the fate of the Dreamers, there appears to be a path forward. Yesterday's immigration meeting at the White House was encouraging for two reasons. First, practically everyone at the table--including some of the most conservative voices on immigration, like the Senator from Iowa--agreed that we must resolve the future of Dreamers by passing DACA protections into law. That is a very positive development.  Second, President Trump appeared to endorse a narrow deal to protect the Dreamers, leaving the thornier issues for a later debate on comprehensive immigration reform--a debate that, personally, I would welcome, the sooner the better.  But first, we have to do this narrow deal. President Trump also backed off his demand that a DACA deal include an expensive and ineffective border wall across the entire length of the southern border. Of course, the devil is in the details. We Democrats have repeated time and again that we are ready, willing, and eager to support an effective, practical border security measure in a deal that enshrines DACA into law. The President yesterday seemed to agree with that. We agree with that. For these reasons, the meeting was encouraging.  Last night, a Federal judge ruled against the Trump administration's handling of the termination of the DACA Let me be very clear. The ruling last night in no way diminishes the urgency of resolving the DACA issue. On this we agree with the White House, which says the ruling doesn't do anything to reduce Congress's obligation to address this problem now. A court case, of course, is no guarantee of lasting security. A higher court can quickly overturn it. Unsurprisingly, the Department of Justice responded to the ruling last night by saying that it ``will continue to vigorously defend [this] position, and looks forward to vindicating its position in further legislation.'' So the fact remains that the only way to guarantee the legal status for Dreamers is to pass DACA protections into law and to do it now. For that reason, a resolution to the DACA issue must be part of a global deal on the budget.  We cannot tolerate delay. Delay is a tactic employed by those who do not wish to see a deal. Let me just say, promises that maybe in the future we will do it--particularly on immigration--have vanished by the wayside.[[Page S115]]Unless DACA is on a must-pass deal--a must-pass bill--in terms of a global agreement, people are rightfully skeptical that it will ever happen. Somehow, somewhere, someone will say: I can't do it.  Let's not forget that the House has been a graveyard even for immigration proposals that have had bipartisan consensus here in the So it must be on a must-pass bill. Otherwise, we are not going to get it.  Congressional negotiators and the valiant group here in the Senate led by Senators Durbin and Graham are focused on this issue right now. The meeting they had yesterday--I talked to both Senators Durbin and Graham last night and this morning--provides a clearer picture of the parameters of the deal. The iron is hot. We should strike now. Delay will snuff out the hope of getting an agreement that both sides can live with. Let us press forward. Each side is going to have to give.  I am confident, though, that both sides can come to an agreement on border security. I am convinced now both sides want to find a consensus on Some will support a deal enthusiastically, others reluctantly, but, nonetheless, an agreement is within reach. We ought to get it done through the Senate, through the House, and onto the President's desk for signature now. So let's get the job done.  I yield the floor.

778,topic-id,954,"Mr.President, in the second half of the 115th Congress now, let's talk a little bit about a new direction. Let the induction of these two Senators this afternoon be the beginning of a new direction for the Senate in the second half of this  The first half of the 115th Congress was not a year to be proud of. Partisan legislation emerged from the majority leader's office and was dropped on the floor of the Senate, sometimes merely hours before we were asked to vote on its final passage. Procedural gimmicks were used to avoid the Senate's long history of debate and bipartisanship. An economy wracked by unfairness and inequality was made even more unfair and more unequal by the Republican majority, which almost delighted in revoking consumer protections to help big business, installed a pro-corporate Supreme Court, drove up healthcare premiums, and passed a tax bill dramatically skewed to the benefit of big corporations and the very wealthy. All in all, 2017 was a great year for wealthy Republican donors but a lost year for the middle class and the working men and women of this country.  We Democrats hope this year is different--focused on the middle class rather than the rich and powerful, focused on helping them in the ways we have done in the last decades, with both Democratic and Republican Presidents, rather than this trickle down that benefits the few at the top and does not benefit the very many in the middle.  In these first few weeks, we have a chance to start off on the right foot. We have 2 weeks to negotiate a budget deal that also must address a host of other issues, including CHIP, community health centers, disaster aid and, of course, the  Democrats would also like our country to make a downpayment on urgent domestic priorities like combating the opioid epidemic, a scourge that for the first time helped cause our life expectancy to decline because of the higher death rate from opioids.  We want to improve veterans' healthcare. They served us, and we must serve them. We must shore up pension plans for millions of hard-working, middle-class Americans who put money in every month and, because of the stock market crash and sometimes corporate misdeeds, aren't getting what they put in for. These items are crucial to the middle class.  Take opioids, for example. In 2016, a record 63,000 Americans died of drug overdoses, and two-thirds or more were opioid-related. It is a full-fledged epidemic that strikes the rich, the middle class, and the poor alike. It strikes urban America, suburban America, and rural America alike.  I had a father cry in my arms because his son a had decided to turn himself around and signed up for a treatment program, but the line was so long because the funding is so scarce that the young man died of an overdose before he could enter treatment. The opioid crisis is stealing our youth. We have known about it for years. It is not new. It is heartbreaking how much we know about it, but how little we have done about it.  The American people sent us here to do the Nation's business. That means addressing its greatest challenges. So let's make a real investment in this budget deal and how we treat this scourge. The budget is the right place to start.  A few years ago, we made a promise to hundreds of thousands of children who were brought to the United States through no fault of their own that if they registered with the government, we wouldn't deport them. We said: We want you to be Americans, learn in our schools, work in our companies, serve in our military. So 800,000 Dreamers came forward and did that because, above all else, they wanted to be They don't know another country.  Now we are faced with a deadline. In a few months, protections for Dreamers will evaporate. A thousand Dreamers are losing protected status each week. It is time that Congress passed DACA protections into law and fixed this once and for all.  Democrats, including myself, led by our great Senator from Illinois, a member of our leadership team, Mr.Durbin, have said over and over again: We are ready to negotiate a reasonable package of border security to pass alongside We believe in border security. We want to make it work. We want to make it real, not just be symbolic; we believe in it. If our Republican colleagues and the President engage in good-faith negotiations without unreasonable demands like an absurdly expensive, ineffective border wall that many Republicans publicly oppose--and privately many more do--I don't doubt we can reach an agreement on DACA that is acceptable to both sides. I would like to thank our Acting President pro tempore for his active involvement in this regard as well.  In contrast to a year of chaos and ineffectiveness--a year in which little was accomplished, and what was done was done for the wealthy and the narrow special interests--I hope this year can be one of bipartisanship, focused on improving the stock of the middle class. They are the ones hurting in They are the ones who need help. They are the ones who worry about the future of this grand, wonderful country.  We can start on the budget with opioids, veterans' healthcare, pensions, children's health insurance, and disaster aid. We can resolve the fate of the Dreamers and say to these hard-working kids that America has a place for them too.  Later today, the four congressional leaders will meet with Budget Director Mick Mulvaney and representatives of the White House to begin these negotiations in earnest--I hope--and will work for their success.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-03-pt2-PgS3.txt,1036,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2018.0,3.0,March
781,topic-id,699,"Finally, a word on national security. The Senate has a role in conducting the Nation's foreign policy, but as head of state, the President of the United States represents our country to the world. That is a very serious and very sober responsibility that requires restraint, intelligence, sound judgment, and a respect for the moral authority that comes with the awesome responsibility of being the world's sole remaining superpower.  Over the course of the past year, President Trump, unfortunately, has progressively squandered the moral authority that comes with the Presidency[[Page S4]]of the United States--a moral authority that this country has taken generations to build, that helps us bring a light to the world and helps us economically in every other way, as the world has always looked up to America and our ideals.  Unfortunately, that moral authority is declining under President Trump's leadership--and declining rapidly. It may have reached the low point yesterday when President Trump, in tweet after tweet, offered a very poor representation of the United States to the world. More than that, President Trump's ``foreign policy by tweet'' is doing serious damage to the country. While we have serious issues to address abroad, President Trump seems happy with macho boasts and belligerent threats that get us nowhere. If any one of us were in a classroom with someone who behaved as President Trump has, we would ostracize them; we would straighten them out. We don't hear a peep from the vast majority of our Republican colleagues about this, many of whom are hawks.  We have serious issues to address abroad. President Trump's ``foreign policy by tweet'' will not advance our standing in the world. It will not reassure our allies or other nations that it is better to work with us than against us. What it will do--what it has already done, unfortunately, is unsettle our allies and embolden our adversaries. What it will do is cede leadership in the world to China, which is eagerly awaiting every opportunity to drive a wedge between our country and other countries around the world. Without a steady and reliable hand at the helm, our allies may be uncertain that they can continue to trust the United States to honor our commitments and maintain a steady course.  China and Russia are rushing to fill the void left by an unsteady United President Xi of China aspired to this position of being a world leader in his new year's speech when he said that China, not the United States, would be the ``keeper of the international order'' in 2018. If President Trump continues snubbing our allies, recklessly threatening other nations, and showing leadership on the world stage that can only be described as puerile, the world may look to Beijing, not Washington, for international leadership.  Again, I repeat: Where are our friends, the Republican hawks, who have been so concerned about America's leadership in the world, who have decried the fact that President Obama did not do enough for that leadership? If he were here, my dear friend, Senator John McCain, would typically stand up and speak about this, and hopefully he will be back soon to do so. But for the rest of my Republican friends, I would say with sincerity--not with partisanship, but out of love for the country and the leadership we have shown for decades and decades--that our Republican friends should, please, tell the President: Stop tweeting; start leading.  We are almost through a calendar year of the Trump President Trump can no longer be given the benefit of the doubt that comes with learning one of the toughest jobs in the world. My Republican colleagues should not be given a pass by the American people if they fail to speak out or take action against this behavior. Their silence, unfortunately--I have to say, I feel this sincerely--is complicity in the degradation of the Presidency and the power of this country.  The American people expect our President to represent the United States with dignity and strength. That is not what we saw yesterday. It is time we all start speaking out against it.

790,topic-id,2626,"Mr.President, there are a number of outstanding matters before the Senate that must be addressed by January 19. We must pass an extension of government funding. We must reach a deal to lift the spending caps to spare devastating cuts to our military support and funding for urgent domestic priorities. We must extend the Children's Health Insurance Program and community health centers and the 702 FISA Court program. We must pass disaster aid, and we must resolve the future of the  Some of these issues, particularly CHIP and FISA, could have been dealt with by the majority a long time ago. There are bipartisan majorities that would have voted to extend those programs, but the majority leader chose not to put them on the floor because they were busy pursuing a partisan ``favor the wealthy'' tax bill.  Some of these issues still require further compromise. It is no secret that we haven't come to final agreement on the spending caps. Both Democrats and Republicans want our troops to have the resources they need to do the tough job we ask of them. At the same time, we Democrats want to make sure that we are making the right kinds of investments in the middle class. The whole campaign was about the middle class, and now we are going to abandon them because there are such needs for defense. The two are not mutually exclusive. We don't believe they are, and our Republican colleagues have sort of lost their grip on saying: Well, we can't increase the deficit, after a $1.5 trillion tax cut mainly for the wealthy and powerful corporations.  So we are fighting hard to make sure we are making the right kinds of investments in the middle class. That is why we are pushing hard to raise the spending caps on the domestic side, so we can do more in the fight against the opioid crisis, so we can do more to help our brave veterans get quality healthcare, and so we honor the promise made to over a million pensioners who contributed to and earned every penny of their pensions. These are all very important issues. Ask a mom or dad whose kid is addicted to opioids whether that can wait. Ask a pensioner who is so nervous that he or she will not get enough dollars to retire on and feed themselves. Ask a veteran who has been waiting in line for healthcare because the Veterans' Administration is not fully funded for the healthcare needs of our veterans. They all think those are just as important--not more, not less than funding defense. We will stand firm and strong that both are important. The only argument our colleagues seem to have against this is that it increases the deficit and, as I said, they lost all claim to that one with the tax bill.  Now, teamsters, carpenters, and miners have worked their entire lives under the expectation that they could retire with a sense of dignity afforded by a modest pension. These are the ones our colleagues seem to be just adamantly opposed to. Let them go home to their miners, to their teamsters, to their food workers and tell them: You don't deserve a pension even though you paid in every month.  We can't just shrug our shoulders and do nothing. We ought to fix it.  My friend, the majority leader, thinks defense is important, but the other is not. We Democrats believe both are important, and we must and should do both together. Surely, the deficit, again, can't be the problem after adding over $1.5 trillion in red ink. So let's make investments we know are essential in our military and in our middle class.  We will also have to make sure the disaster package treats all our States and territories fairly; that California and Puerto Rico and the Mountain West and the U.Virgin Islands get the aid they need, just like Texas and Louisiana and  We have to reach agreement on a new healthcare package that admits the new reality of our healthcare system. The Republicans repealed the individual mandate in their tax bill, an act that will raise premiums and lower coverage. The old healthcare compromise legislation was crafted before the Republican tax bill. Patty Murray has said, under new circumstances, we need a new proposal. We cannot just enact the previous Alexander-Murray bill because of the change our Republican colleagues made to the healthcare system.  Then, of course, there is the DACA issue. That is going to require further compromise. There are many Republicans in this Chamber who want to enshrine DACA protections into law--as every Democrat does--just as there are many Democrats who would pass additional border security measures into law--smart, reasonable, and practical border measures. A deal on this issue can be reached if both parties are committed to good-faith negotiations.  The problem thus far has been President Trump's insistence on a completely ineffective and absurdly expensive wall as part of any deal on  In fact, we learned this morning, in a stunning New York Times article by Ron Nixon, that the Trump administration is proposing to cut back from smart border security measures to pay for a border wall. I ask unanimous consent that the article by Mr.Nixon in the New York Times be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  According to the Times, which reviewed internal budget guidance from the OMB, the Trump administration would cut or delay funding for border surveillance, cut or delay funding for radar technology, patrol boats, and, maybe more crucially, Customs officers, all to ask taxpayers to pay for the wall--funding to upgrade surveillance aircraft, extremely effective at stopping illegal crossing at the border, particularly drugs, denied; funding to hire new Customs officers, denied; funding for video surveillance with infrared cameras in areas with high incidents of border crossings, cut to ``offset the[[Page S83]]costs of Presidential priorities.'' What an absurd proposition.  Security experts have testified for decades that effective border security includes a variety of technologies and resources, drones, infrared sensors, Customs and Border Patrol agents, and officers. In some places, secure fence is appropriate. We agree with that. These were all ideas included in comprehensive immigration reform. That the Trump administration would cannibalize funding for these smart border security measures to pay for a wall that will not work makes no sense.  He said he campaigned on it. Oh, no, Mr.You campaigned on a wall that Mexico would pay for. We are waiting, but, again, to take away the things that are needed to protect the border for a symbolic and ineffective political gesture is wrong. There is nothing to this than politics. President Trump is fighting for an empty symbol rather than smart policy that will actually produce better security at our borders. We Democrats are willing, able, and eager to work with our Republican colleagues and the administration on smart, effective border solutions.  As I have said, there may be a few defined places where a secure fence makes sense, but a medieval wall that you can't see through across the length of the southern border will not make us any safer. Walls can be scaled over. Walls can be tunneled under. There are, as I have been told, many tunnels under the wall in San Diego, some of which have not been detected.  There is also the issue of eminent domain. The Federal Government would have to conscript hundreds of square miles of land from American citizens to build a wall. The administration still hasn't produced plans for where to put it, and, of course, President Trump promised, once again, that Mexico would pay for it, not taxpayers. If you can read anything into the election, it was for that. The polling data shows the majority of Americans don't believe the wall is the right thing to do.  It is not responsible to insist that American taxpayers pay for an absurdly expensive and ineffective border wall or else the government shuts down. If the President goes down that path and insists on the wall or shuts down the government, which he said back in September, make no mistake about it, a government shutdown will fall entirely on his shoulders.  If President Trump can find a way to get Mexico to pay for the wall, while American taxpayers pay for things that really make a difference to secure the border, he should reveal that to the American people. Until that time, Democrats will work with our Republican colleagues on smart border security, effective border security, just as we fight to protect the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, 8, 2018]    To Pay for Wall; Trump Would Cut Proven Border Security Measures                             (By Ron Nixon)       The Trump administration would cut or delay funding for      border surveillance, radar technology, patrol boats and      customs agents in its upcoming spending plan to curb illegal      immigration--all proven security measures that officials and      experts have said are more effective than building a wall      along the Mexican border.       President Trump has made the border wall a focus of his      campaign against illegal immigration to stop drugs,      terrorists and gangs like MS-13 from coming into the United      Under spending plans submitted last week to Congress,      the wall would cost $18 billion over the next 10 years, and      be erected along nearly 900 miles of the southern border.       The wall also has become a bargaining chip in negotiations      with Congress as lawmakers seek to prevent nearly 800,000      young undocumented immigrants from being deported.       But security experts said the president's focus on a border      wall ignores the constantly evolving nature of terrorism,      immigration and drug trafficking.       ``People that are dealing with this issue know that a      third-century solution to a 21st-century problem is not going      to fix this long-term,'' said Representative Will Hurd,      Republican of Texas and a former C.I.officer. Mr.Hurd,      whose district includes more than 800 miles of border      territory with Mexico, has pushed for more funding for      sensors and other border security technologies.       Homeland Security officials have long and frequently      described border security as a holistic system, made up not      just of walls and fencing but also patrol routes, lighting,      cameras, sensors and personnel.       David Bier, a policy analyst with the Cato Institute, said      a border wall would do little to stop the drug trade. Most of      the cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines smuggled into the      United States come through legal ports of entry rather than      areas that would be stopped by a wall, according to the Drug      Enforcement       Nor would a wall stop illegal immigration, other experts      said. Data from the Department of Homeland Security and      research groups like the New York-based Center for Migration      Studies show that most undocumented immigrants now simply      overstay legally obtained short-term visas--and did not sneak      across the border.       ``So unless the wall is 35,000 feet high, it's not going to      do much to stop those overstaying these visas,'' said Robert      Warren, a fellow at the Center for Migration Studies who has      worked on immigration issues for Republican and Democratic      presidents.       Additionally, Mr.Warren said, many people who have been      stopped by the Border Patrol in recent years are seeking      asylum --including some who simply walk up to agents and      surrender.       Mr.Trump's budget request for a wall represents more than      half of the $33 billion spending blueprint for border      security over the next decade. It either eliminates critical      funding for border security programs or shifts money from      them, threatening to leave gaping holes. A Government      Accountability Office study released last February found that      Customs and Border Protection has not shown how much fencing      and walls bolster border security.       An internal budget guidance document for the 2019 fiscal      year shows that the White House Office of Management and      Budget asked officials at the Homeland Security Department to      reduce or delay funding requests for additional border      security technology and equipment. Instead, the document      instructed, Homeland Security should dramatically increase      funding for a wall on the Mexico border.       Homeland Security officials said the plans are subject to      change. Still, the document underscores the priority that a      border wall remains for Mr.Trump, who promised its      construction during his presidential campaign. It also      instructed the department to seek $1.6 billion in the      upcoming fiscal year to build 74 miles of a border wall--     about $700 million more than Homeland Security officials felt      they needed to build that.       Parts of the document were viewed by The New York Times;      the rest of it was based on reports by the Democratic staff      of the Senate Homeland Security       The cuts include money for a remote video surveillance      system in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas, an area known      for high numbers of border crossings and drug smuggling. The      system is composed of infrared cameras mounted on poles,      towers and buildings, allowing Border Patrol agents to track      attempted smuggling and border crossings.       In the internal document, the White House budget office      called the surveillance system important but said its funding      requests were lowered ``to offset the costs of presidential      priorities not funded in the D.H.request.''       Customs and Border Protection faces several cuts.       Its $7.9 million request for technology upgrades to its P-3      surveillance aircraft--which operates thousands of miles      beyond American borders to track narcotics being shipped from      Colombia, Peru and other drug producing countries--was      denied. In 2016, the latest data available, the P-3 aircrews      contributed to 145 drug seizures, helping American and      foreign authorities capture a combined 34,108 pounds of      marijuana and 193,197 pounds of cocaine.       The internal document also suggested delaying a request to      buy 15 new Coastal Interceptor boats to catch drug smugglers.      The agency had sought nearly $15 million to replace its aging      fleet to keep up with drug smugglers' smaller, faster boats.       It also would cut nearly 200 of the 500 canine units that      customs officials say play a key role in programs to prevent      terrorism and drug smuggling. The dogs' handlers would then      be reassigned to ports on the southwest border to help with      staffing shortages.       ``The lack of funding and the elimination of the canine      teams is shortsighted and poses a serious threat to border      security,'' said Tony Reardon, the president of the National      Treasury Employees Union, which represents customs officers.      ``If you are going to focus on border security, you can't do      that without talking about the men and women who man these      ports of entry.''       Perhaps most significantly, the proposed budget would not      fund the hiring of new customs officers--the agents who      denied 200,000 people from entering the United States at      ports of entry in fiscal 2017 and who stopped 600,000 pounds      of drugs, including cocaine, heroin, meth and fentanyl.      Customs officers also intercepted nearly $70 million in      illicit currency, much of it headed back across the border to      fill the coffers of Mexican drug cartels.       Experts said the absence of hiring funds could potentially      have the most impact on border security; the agents form a      crucial line of defense against smugglers and terrorist      threats. An internal Customs and Border Protection review      showed that the agency's ranks were about 3,700 officers      below required levels, according to the National Treasury      Employees       By comparison, Mr.Trump has called for hiring 5,000      additional Border Patrol agents[[Page S84]]     and 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.       ``A wall is the single most expensive thing you can do in      terms of trying to secure the border, and not necessarily the      most effective on its own,'' said Doris Meissner, who was the      top immigration official during the Clinton administration.      ``If you want to be strategic about it, you want to invest in      technologies and programs that can stop threats well before      they can actually get to the border.''

1437,topic-id,679,"Mr.President, finally, on the tax bill, I just note that, once again, every day the more people learn about this tax bill, the more they don't like it. Stock buybacks continue at a hugely rapid rate. Aid to workers is much, much smaller, and the American people are learning this bill was of, by, and for the wealthiest Americans and the most powerful corporations. That is wrong. We welcome the debate on the tax bill because the more people learn about it, the more they don't like it.  Since the beginning of the tax debate, Republicans have insisted their bill is about cutting taxes for working Even though the bill would direct 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent, Republicans said workers were the focus. Even though they made corporate tax cuts permanent but let the individual tax cuts expire, they said the middle class would be the real winners.  Democrats warned that if you gave big corporations and the wealthiest Americans the lion's share of the tax cuts, those benefits wouldn't trickle down to employees and the middle class. We warned that corporations would do what they always do when they have profits--distribute them amongst themselves. Even though big companies like AT&T were already paying low effective corporate rates, they had been shedding jobs and investment for years even before the tax bill.  Unfortunately, our warnings proved prescient. Almost every day, we hear a new story about a corporation using the savings from the Republican tax bill to purchase its own stock, called a stock buyback, which boosts the corporation's stock price to provide a reward for wealthy executives and shareholders.  Just this morning, the Kentucky-based chemical company Ashland announced a brand-new $500 million share repurchasing program. And last night, the total amount of corporate share buybacks surpassed $225 billion since the Republican tax bill became law.  Stock buybacks are a big reason why workers no longer see the benefits of record corporate profits. Why? Because instead of investing corporate profits in things that benefit the long-term health of the company and its workers--like higher wages, new equipment, research and development, or new hires--corporations spend the money on share buybacks.  In fact, stock buybacks were illegal until 1982, which is about the same time that wages stopped increasing with corporate profits.  Republicans dutifully remind us that companies are also handing out bonuses. Yes, a few. But let me highlight the disparity between buybacks and investment in workers: According to a recent analysis by Just Capital, only 6 percent of the capital allocated by companies from the tax bill's savings has gone to employees, while nearly 60 percent has gone to shareholders.  The theory behind the Republican tax bill was to allow corporations and the richest Americans to keep more of their already outrageous wealth, and maybe the benefits will trickle down to everyone else. As we are already seeing, that idea was a folly, and the American middle class will eventually pay the price.  Because of the enormous cost of the Republican tax bill, $1.5 trillion, the deficit and debt will grow over the next several years and Republicans are already targeting Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare for cuts to make up the difference. So on top of a tax cut that mostly goes to the folks who need it the least, the Republican tax bill is an excuse for Republicans to come after Social Security, Medicare, and  That is why the bill is so unpopular that Republicans have abandoned it in last two special elections in Virginia and  The American people are already waking up to the reality that the Republican tax bill was not the middle-class miracle the Republicans promised, and in November, they will have the chance to move America in a dramatically different direction by voting for a party that actually wants to focus tax relief on working America, not corporate  I yield the floor.

1708,topic-id,2385,"Mr.President, since the Republicans jammed through a massive corporate tax cut in December, hardly a day goes by that we don't read about a corporation using the savings to purchase its own stock. The average citizen may ask: What is that all about?  Well, when a company purchases its own stock, it is sort of artificially making less stock, buying it back, and raising the price of the shares. Why do they do that? There are two reasons, both to benefit the corporate CEOs but not the workers. First, corporate CEOs have a lot of the stock themselves, so they make money; second, they look better when the stock price goes up. But the stock price isn't going up because the company has sold more goods, been more productive, bought new machinery, or found a new product. The stock simply goes up because they have decreased the number of shares. It is a scam in a certain sense, helping corporate CEOs, helping shareholders--80 percent of the shares are held by the top 10 percent, so it doesn't really help average Americans, and that is including 401(k)s--but it doesn't help the worker.  We have heard many claims from our Republican friends: Pass this tax bill, and the workers will benefit. Well, unfortunately, now we see who is really benefiting. Just as we predicted, it is the corporate CEOs and the wealthiest of  Just recently, the total amount of share buybacks surpassed $220 billion this year. According to the market data firm, TrimTabs, share buybacks in 2018 averaged $4.8 billion a day--a day--double the pace for the same period last year.  For a few weeks, right after the President passed his tax bill, what happened? They had these companies announce bonuses for average workers. Very few Americans saw those bonuses--a lot of hoopla, but not much else. The bonuses--not wage increases, not new hires, but one-time annual bonuses--anyone who gets them, God bless them; there have just been so few. Those bonuses are being overwhelmed by a deluge of corporate share buybacks, which do not benefit the average worker, but benefit the CEOs and the heads of the companies.  According to an analysis by JUST Capital, only 6 percent of the capital allocated by companies from the tax bill has gone to employees, while nearly 60 percent has gone to shareholders--again, to the corporate CEOs who own those shares, the wealthiest of Americans who own the vast majority of shares. Ten times more capital is going to shareholders than to workers.  So this bill, which is poorly structured and aimed at the wealthy, ain't working. The more Americans see it--you know, there was an initial thrust: Oh, we like the tax bill. At first, it was unpopular as we talked about it here on the floor. Then, with these bonuses and the stock market going up, popularity went up a little. Now it is flattening out and even heading down. In the last three polls, fewer people liked this tax plan, and that is going to keep happening, my Republican friends, because they know what it was aimed at and you know what it was aimed at--the corporate CEOs who came to lobby you and the wealthy individuals who came to lobby you. It is no wonder the American people are starting to turn on the Republican tax bill. Polls have shown its popularity is underwater and trending downward, not up.  This idea that tax cuts would be a political panacea for Republicans come November is losing altitude fast. Remember, that is what our Republican friends said: Well, maybe people are upset with the President's tweets, and maybe this and that are not going so well; maybe they are not accomplishing that much, but now, with the tax bill, we will win the election.  Well, look at the Pennsylvania election where a Democrat won the district[[Page S1743]]that Trump carried by 20 points. This is the kind of district that our Republican friends need to carry. These are Republican suburbs in blue-collar Southwest  Early in the race, what did Republicans do? They tried running ads about the tax bill to help their candidate, Rick Saccone, during the first few weeks of These were the super PACs, the Koch brothers, and all the others who will benefit hugely from the tax bill. Somehow they believe that because they will benefit, everyone is going to think they have benefited.  They ran these ads, often paid for by the Two-thirds of the ads mentioned taxes--two-thirds of all Saccone's ads, both by the Koch-like super PACs and by Saccone himself. The next week, 36 percent mentioned taxes. Guess what. After 2 weeks of these tax ads, our Republican friends tested it out, and they got rid of taxes as an issue. It wasn't working. It wasn't working with fairly well-off middle-class Pittsburgh suburbanites or blue-collar workers in Greene County and Westmoreland County and Washington County in Southwest PA, which are areas where people had voted for  It is eerily similar, folks, to the Governor's race in Virginia--the same thing. That was before the bill passed, but still, Republican candidate Ed Gillespie started his campaign on a tax plan similar to the Republican tax plan. He had to give it up because it wasn't getting traction.  The American people are smart about this. They know what is going on. They know the vast majority of this goes to the wealthy. They know the amount that is going to them is small. They know their tax break is temporary and the corporate tax break is permanent. Most of all, they know we have created a huge deficit. And how are some of our Republicans friends saying we pay for the deficit? Cut Cut Social Cut healthcare. That is not what the American people want.  Poll after poll shows healthcare is far more important to the American people than tax cuts. Do you know why? If you get a break on your taxes of $20 a week and your premiums go up several thousand dollars in a month or even several hundred dollars in a month, that little increase is wiped away. Our Republican colleagues, even in their tax bill, caused premiums to go up by monkeying around with healthcare.  The Republican Party needs to wake up and realize that by giving massive benefits to corporations and the wealthy, it is never going to be a popular issue for them in the election because it is a terrible policy for the average middle-class and working It gets to the contradiction at the core of the The President talks like a populous but governs like a plutocrat. Let me repeat that. The President talks like a populous but governs like a plutocrat. He just got rid of a Wall Street executive--Gary Cohn--and now he is putting in as his economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who has favored the wealthy, Club for Growth policies--help the wealthy and all of America will benefit--throughout his whole career. That is not how Trump ran. That is not what he tells working people when he goes to a big tent in But that is what he is doing. Sooner or later, it catches up with you. The Pennsylvania election showed it is catching up faster than our Republican friends would like. The President talks like a populous but governs like a plutocrat.  President Trump said that his tax bill would be a middle-class miracle, but the actual legislation is a miracle for the wealthy corporations and the richest 1 percent. As I said, part of the problem is that the President surrounds himself with the wealthy elite. Those are his advisers. These wealthy elites push for tax cuts for the rich and rhapsodize failed economic orthodoxies like trickle-down. That applies to Larry Here is a man who is a cheerleader for Bush-era economics. He ignored the housing bubble and actually recommended--Larry Kudlow, the man who is now going to give the President economic advice--that Americans buy stock in the fall of 2008 when everyone else saw that the economy was about to collapse. Does anyone think Larry Kudlow is going to bring a renewed focus on improving the middle class? Forget it. He believes in the plutocracy. He has his whole career. That is who President Trump picked. He is getting rid of one and putting in another, like going from the frying pan into the fire.  By the way, I think the President loves having the big crowds of working-class people in those tents, but who are his real friends? They are the very wealthy. That is who he hung out with in New He cares what they think, and that is why his policies are so aimed at them.  My Republican friends, in a nutshell, this is the problem you face. Your rhetoric is all about helping working people, but your policies and the people developing them are all about helping corporations and the rich.  I am not against the rich or corporations. God bless them. Let's hope they do well. But average Americans need far more help than the top 1 percent and wealthy corporations. Give it to average folks. They need it. They are still struggling with paying for college, affording a vacation, helping their elderly mom and dad through a healthcare problem. They are who need the help, not the top 1 percent. But our Republican colleagues aim everything at that top 1 percent.  If we would only get rid of Citizens United, that awful decision that allows the wealthy to have such huge influence on the Republican Party, the super PACs--individual Members have super PACs funded by the wealthy. I wish we could get rid of it on both sides, Democratic and Unfortunately, it doesn't look like the Supreme Court is doing it.  The rhetoric of Republicans: Help working people. The policies of Republicans: Help the wealthy corporations and the rich. As we have seen in poll after poll and in recent elections, the American people are waking up to that reality.  It is hard to make a tax cut unpopular, but Republicans have managed to do it by designing a bill that will direct 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent and $1.5 trillion to the deficit and then threaten to cut Medicare and Social Security to make up the difference. My colleagues, that is a toxic combination, and Republicans will not be able to run on it because only a very few wealthy Americans support that agenda.                                 Russia  Mr.President, now on a different matter--A little more than a week ago, our friends in the United Kingdom--England, Great Britain--suffered an attack on two individuals by a nerve agent. In a joint statement today, the leadership of the United States, the UK, France, and Germany agreed that Putin was behind it. To her great credit, Prime Minister May demanded an immediate response from Putin and promised appropriate countermeasures. She has already expelled 23 Russian diplomats, and I hope she takes additional action. Expelling 23 diplomats is strong action, but we need more.  Mr.Putin--he is a bully. I grew up in There are a lot of bullies around You have to stand up to them, or they will keep taking advantage of you. That is how a bully works.  Let's compare Prime Minister May's action to President Trump's. It is a study in contrast when it comes to Prime Minister May was quick and decisive about countering Russia's aggression. President Trump can hardly seem to utter a peep in criticism of President Putin--a man who is trying to undermine the power of the United States, a man who is trying to undermine the very democracy of the United States, the beauty of It was on full display this week when, instead of personally defending our ally Britain, President Trump didn't say a word about the attack, directing everything through aides or statements.  President Trump warns all the time that ``we need to get smart'' about other countries taking advantage of the United I agree. I tend to agree with the President on China is taking advantage of us, and President Trump, to his credit, is doing more than the Bush or Obama administrations did. But guess who is taking advantage of us even more than They meddle in our elections, continue to sow division on social media through Russia-linked bots or building an intelligence machine to meddle in our elections again later this year. Putin constantly attacks our allies, our friends.[[Page S1744]]  President Trump, when are you going to get smart about the threat Russia poses to the United States and our allies?  We in Congress, 98 to 2, the Democrats and Republicans together--Leader McConnell and I worked this out. We voted to implement mandatory sanctions against Guess what, President Trump hasn't even implemented them. What is he afraid of? What is he hiding?  Hopefully, we will get an announcement today that maybe he is implementing sanctions after what Russia did, but that is not enough. As my friend from New Jersey has suggested, the President should further sanction Putin and anyone else involved under the Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act for this heinous attack in the  We are still waiting for President Trump to direct our intelligence agencies and the State Department to use the resources we have provided them to combat Russian cyber attacks. We have heard from officials who are in charge of cyber security. They have gotten no direction from the White House, no orders to do anything. We are still waiting for actions to harden our election security, and we are still waiting for President Trump to utter one word of public criticism for what Putin is doing to the United States and democracies around the world.  I say to President Trump: Your silence speaks on this issue. Your silence speaks volumes to the Russian Government and America's other adversaries, as well as our friends and allies. Finally, it speaks volumes to the American people. More and more Americans are asking: Why is President Trump so afraid to take on probably our 1 menace, Russia? What is he hiding? What is going on? Why?  It is ringing in America's ear. The President is not going to escape it.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2018-03-15-pt1-PgS1742-4.txt,1036,1700,2018.0,15.0,March
1071,topic-id,815,"Mr.President, today I want to make a few remarks on 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection  Section 213 of 2155, making online banking initiation legal and easy--the intent of this provision, which I introduced as an amendment during Committee consideration of 2155, is to facilitate the ability of financial institutions to reach new and potentially underserved consumers by making it possible to offer products and services to consumers through online and mobile applications. I would like to clarify that, with respect to references in this provision to ``copies,'' ``scans,'' or other reproductions of a consumer's government-issued identification, this is, intended to apply to all methods of obtaining information from an identification card, including color and black-and-white copies.  Section 215 of 2155, reducing identity fraud--with respect to section 215 of the bill, ``reducing identity fraud,'' the intent is to provide options for permitted entities to crosscheck consumer information with the Social Security Administration, SSA, in such a way that is efficient for those entities, as well as the In particular, the intent of this provision is to allow a service provider or other permitted entity to contact the SSA's Consent Based Social Security Number Verification database pursuant to appropriate consent provided to a permitted entity--such as a creditor--and to then provide the ``yes/no'' response from SSA to permitted entities who request such information in the future. In this way, creditors can receive the important validation of a name, date of birth, and Social Security number as part of the consumer report they receive when underwriting a credit application. This would result in fewer inquiries made to and received by the Furthermore, as mentioned, this provision would require consumer consent as part of the normal credit application process, similar to how creditors request consumer consent to obtain consumer credit reports in connection with an application. Under section 215, consumer consent can now be given via electronic signature obtained by the creditor or other permitted entities. Nothing in this provision would require consumers to fill out extra forms, provide extra signatures, or do anything that would significantly alter their expectations for a seamless application experience. The goal is to inform consumers of the possible inquiry to the SSA and allow them to provide consent via the chosen method by the creditor, which now includes electronic signature.  The second point I would like to clarify regarding section 215 is the importance of ensuring the SSA will implement this section with all deliberate speed, with no unreasonable delay to the process. As the author of this provision, it is my expectation that the SSA will have the database described in this section operational within 1 year of the bill's enactment, assuming the appropriate reserve of user fees. Every day that goes by without the[[Page S1715]]SSA implementing the changes called for in section 215 will lead to more children unknowingly becoming victims of synthetic identity theft and having their credit ruined.  Section 310 of 2155, credit score competition--the word ``competition'' in the title of section 310, ``credit score competition,'' is the heart of the intent of this part of the bill.  When enacted into law, Section 310 will put in place a mechanism by which credit score model developers may submit their models to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for validation for use by the enterprises, if the models meet validation criteria that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have established. Lenders will be able to choose the model that they wish to use. The end result of enactment of section 310 of 2155 will be a competitive market between the developers of empirically derived, demonstrably predictive, and statistically sound credit scoring models, with appropriate regulatory oversight from the Federal Housing Finance Agency under which both consumers and lenders would benefit. A lack of such a market thus far in the mortgage finance arena has stifled innovation in credit scoring.  Section 310 allows for more than one credit score model provider to have a validated model for use by the enterprises. The Director of the FHFA is given the responsibility to see that the validation process is undertaken in a timely manner for all applicants and that the methodology and results behind each validation decision is released to the public.  Unlike the request for input the FHFA issued in December 2017 on this subject, section 310 does not make specific reference to any credit score model provider. That is deliberate. Section 310 opens the enterprises up to use any model that is able to pass the validation process.  Some critics have raised the specter that providing mortgage lenders the opportunity to choose among credit scoring models validated and approved by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac might trigger ``a race to the bottom.'' That is prohibited under section 310, as validated models are first deemed to not threaten the safety and soundness of the enterprises in order to be used.

1187,topic-id,256,"Mr.President, as chairman of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development, today I wish to engage in a colloquy to discuss legislation that I introduced, the Housing Opportunity Mortgage Expansion, HOME, Act, with several of my colleagues to address an issue involving the Federal Home Loan Bank, FHLB, system. The FHLB system is a cooperative organization of 11 banks that support a mission of ``helping American families realize the dream of home ownership, stimulate the creation of affordable housing, and improve the local business environment.'' FHLBs are privately capitalized by their 7,300 members and are subject to strict oversight by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, The HOME Act is designed to correct the FHFA's perceived statutory limitation in the FHL Bank Act that does not permit captive insurers to be considered a class of the eligible insurance companies for membership in  In 2016, the FHFA determined that captive insurance firms were not insurance firms for purposes of the FHLB In making this determination, the FHFA abruptly terminated the membership of approximately four dozen captive insurance entities, including mortgage real estate investment trusts, REITs, that were active and responsible members of the FHLB system. These insurance captives greatly contributed to the affordable housing mission of FHLBs through the use of private capital versus taxpayer dollars, something that we should always encourage. I thank Senators Duckworth, Johnson, and Baldwin for their support of this legislation, which I am hopeful will receive favorable consideration by this body in the future.

I fought for reforms in 2015 with the USA Freedom And now here we are debating the latest need to balance privacy and security.  Since Congress last reauthorized section 702, we have learned a great deal about the operation of this program. These revelations have highlighted the risks that it poses to privacy and civil liberties. This program needs to be reformed, but, Mr.Speaker, this is not the bill to do it.  Rather than provide meaningful reforms, the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act would reauthorize section 702.

And this was not denied by[[Page H106]]the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, the gentleman from California (Mr.Schiff).  We are going to hear an awful lot about warrants on the floor and how this fixes the problem, but here the FBI has said in no uncertain terms to one of our congressional aides that they are never going to have to use this warrant requirement, which was drafted by the Justice Department that has opposed warrants all along. If ever we have seen the fox not only watching the henhouse but inside the henhouse, this is it. It isn't even a fig leaf being small or otherwise. It is simply a way to divert the attention of this Congress away from what is really going on.  Furthermore, the bill would provide a path for the NSA to restart the practice of ``abouts'' collection, which has been described by the ranking member. The proposal grants some committees 30 days to review any effort to turn ``abouts'' collection back on, giving Congress little or no say on this matter.

1055,topic-id,1068,"Mr.President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Washington to talk about the challenge that women both here in the United States and across the world are facing from the excesses of this administration.  What we have seen time and again is that the Trump administration has exhibited a dangerous obsession with rolling back women's reproductive rights here in the United States and abroad. Just in the past 14 months in office, this administration has launched a multipronged and aggressive assault on women's rights. One of President Trump's first acts in office was to reinstate and greatly expand the global gag rule, which prohibits U.funding for international women's health organizations that so much as mention abortion. What they did was to say that this is not going to just affect those organizations but any health organization that the United States puts funding into. This action will cause a significant increase in unsafe abortions and maternal deaths across the developing world. The administration has proposed budgets that would eliminate all Federal funding for Planned Parenthood, and, going even further, would prohibit States that on their own would direct Federal funds to Planned Parenthood for those same health services. They would prohibit States from doing that.  Most recently, the State Department reportedly removed data on reproductive healthcare from its annual human rights report. So is the idea that if you don't give people access to data, then it doesn't happen? The administration instructed career employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to remove words such as ``fetus,'' ``diversity,'' ``evidence-based,'' and ``science-based'' from their official vocabulary.  Well, if we are not basing decisions at the CDC on evidence-based and science-based data, then what are we basing it on? As Senator Murray says, they are basing it on ideology. Well, that is a lousy way to make a decision about where to put our healthcare money.  This administration has even attacked women's access to birth control, issuing new rules that allow almost any company to opt out of the birth control benefit in the Affordable Care  Simply put, you cannot support women's empowerment unless you support women's access to family planning. Recently, the United Nations Population Fund's ``Family Planning 2020'' report explained why women's access to all healthcare services, including abortion, is so vital both to women's advancement and to their country's economic development. The report says:       Every woman and girl must be able to exercise her basic      human right to control her own reproductive health. Access to      safe, voluntary family planning is fundamental to women's      empowerment. It's also fundamental to achieving our global      goals for a healthier, more prosperous, just, and equitable      world.  The report goes on to say:       Rights-based family planning programs have a greater ripple      effect than almost any other development investment, from      saving lives and improving health to strengthening economies,      transforming societies, and lifting entire countries out of      poverty. It is the surest path to the future we want.  Well, I couldn't agree more. Study after study demonstrates that access to comprehensive healthcare services is closely correlated to the economic success of women and their families. By contrast, lack of access to basic healthcare services, including family planning counseling and all birth control options, is a major factor in perpetuating the dangerous, life-threatening cycle of poverty.  Now, I think it is really ironic that those who seek to outlaw abortion do so under what they say is the pro-life banner. I think it is ironic because we know from experience that outlawing abortion doesn't end abortion, it simply drives it into the shadows and unsafe conditions. Like many in this Chamber, I remember the days before 1973, when abortion was against the law. An estimated 1.2 million women each year resorted to illegal abortions, typically performed in unsanitary conditions by unlicensed practitioners and often resulting in infection, hemorrhage, and even death. Just about every woman of my generation has a story about a friend or an acquaintance who had to resort to this kind of risky, dangerous abortion or who thought she had to resort to that.  Well, I don't think we want to go back to those days. We know that right now in the United States, we have the lowest level of abortions that we have had since 1973. That is a success that is directly attributed to the increased access to contraception that is in the Affordable Care  We know that again and again, studies have found that policies to limit or ban abortion outright have the unintended consequence of dramatically increasing abortion overall. Conversely, when family planning services are accessible, the rates of unplanned pregnancies and abortion go down. Again, according to the Guttmacher Institute, we are seeing success in terms of reducing the number of abortions and unintended pregnancies.  Now, what we have seen internationally is that the global gag rule has had especially lethal consequences. It denies access to safe abortions and, in doing so, it dramatically increases abortions overall. A Stanford University study of implementation of the global gag rule during the George Bush administration found that the number of women having induced abortions more than doubled in countries that were most impacted by the policy.  Today, in Nigeria--which is the one country we have data on to date, based on the expansion of the global gag rule in the Trump administration--health workers on the ground estimate that because of the administration's new global gag rule, there will be an additional 660,000 abortions in Nigeria from now through 2020, and that could result in nearly 10,000 additional maternal deaths.  The Trump administration claims it wants a smaller government. The President ran on a platform promising to get the government out of people's lives. Yet it is doing everything possible to inject the government and law enforcement into some of the most intimate, difficult, and personal decisions a woman has to make.  This is not only insulting, but it is condescending to all women. We don't need guidance from the government for an adult. We need to be able to consult those we choose to consult and make[[Page S1704]]our own decisions about the healthcare we need.  To take away women's access to full reproductive health services, including abortion, is demeaning and unacceptable. We cannot allow the Trump administration to turn back the clock and put women's lives at risk.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

From North Korea to Syria to Venezuela, there is really no end in sight for growing tensions and conflict in the world. Our military presence in Afghanistan is growing, we have approved lethal weapons for Ukraine, and we are forging a new partnership with NATO in I support these efforts, but without a vigorous diplomatic capability to back our military, these initiatives risk failure. Sadly, instead of providing for a robust diplomatic corps, the administration has laid the foundation for a weakened U.hand on the international stage. Ultimately, this places Americans at risk. As Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said, it forces his men and women to buy more bullets. Equally critical is the opportunity this provides for the great power conflicts to continue and to fester.  In November, I wrote to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, Senator John McCain, to express bipartisan concern over the administration's State Department hiring and promotion rates. I was told that the statistics we had received from the American Foreign Service Association were wrong and that the redesign of the State Department is not forcing anyone from their jobs.  Unfortunately, since that time, the State Department has lost even more precious, diplomatic talent. Congress has received a budget request that cuts even more personnel, and Foreign Service hiring and promotion rates continue to plummet. Last month, the highest ranking senior Foreign Service officer, Tom Shannon, announced that he, too, would be retiring. With his retirement, we will have no senior Foreign Service officers serving in the Department's leadership.  To date, we have only one active career ambassador who will serve in the entire State Department, and he is not even working in the building. Aside from the mass exodus of critical talent, we are allowing decades of investments made by our country and our diplomats to dwindle along with their ranks.  For the past 2 years, the Senate has also received abysmally low budget requests for the State Department and  Meanwhile, our problems aren't declining. The Kremlin continues to sow chaos across the globe. China increasingly flexes its muscle by buying strategic properties throughout Europe, Africa, and the Middle We are facing the greatest refugee crisis since World War Our intelligence community repeatedly warns that in this year's midterm elections, Russia will repeat another hybrid operation against the U.election. The obvious response to these challenges should not and cannot be to reduce the operational capacity and personnel of the lead agency that is responsible for alleviating global crises and promoting the United States' public face throughout the global outreach. That is the State  Just this month, the New York Times revealed that the State Department had failed to spend any of the $120 million allocated to fund the Global Engagement Center, which is aimed at countering state-led misinformation campaigns. While America is under attack and Western democracies are under attack by misinformation campaigns, the State Department's response has been totally insufficient. It has been not to spend any of the money that Congress has allocated. It seems the administration is completely unaware of Special Counselor Mueller's indictment against Russia's Internet Research  I wish to spend a minute to read from excerpts of Mueller's indictment of 13 Russians, which came out last month. If we can look at this through objective eyes, it reminds us all of the threats we face because of Russia's interference.  This is stated in Mueller's document:       The [Internet Research Agency] is a Russian organization      engaged in operations to interfere with elections and      political processes.  I am quoting now from the indictment.       By in or around September 2016, the [Internet Research      Agency's] monthly budget for Project Lakhta (its interference      operation in the U.S.) exceeded 73 million Russian rubles      (over 1,250,000 U.dollars).  They are spending, on a regular basis, 1.25 million in American dollars on this interference operation. For all of the people out there who think this is a partisan issue, this is not a partisan issue. This is an issue about interfering in our democracy. We can see how much they are willing to spend to do that.  Continuing to quote from the indictment:       Defendants and their co-conspirators also traveled, and      attempted to travel, to the United States under false      pretenses in order to collect intelligence for interference      operations.       In or around 2016, the defendants and their co-conspirators      also used, possessed and transferred, without legal      authority, the social security numbers and dates of birth of      real U.persons without those persons' knowledge or      consent. Using these means of identification, defendants and      their co-conspirators opened accounts at PayPal; created      false means of identification, including fake driver's      licenses; and posted on Internet Research Agency-controlled      media accounts.  That is the Russian entity that is doing this.  Think about that. We know of the Kremlin's efforts to influence and use the American people to its own advantage. It is laid out pretty clearly in this indictment from Robert Yet, somehow, the State Department is incapable of spending $1 of the money that has been allocated by Congress toward countering Russia's most overt, public messages against the United  This is truly remarkable and, sadly, disappointing. The American people deserve better. Unfortunately, the Global Engagement Center is not alone in its lack of support from the administration. According to an analysis of data from the Office of Management and Budget, last year the State Department spent just 79 percent of the money that Congress had authorized for the conduct of foreign affairs, the lowest level in the last 15 years.  Many of us on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would agree that most of our greatest global achievements--the Marshall Plan, the end of the Cold War, and the reduction of nuclear weapons--have been secured through diplomacy. Without it, I fear we will stray far from President Trump's ideal of brokering deals and instead cause irreparable damage to one of America's most precious resources--our diplomatic corps. That will harm this country's standing in the world and will have us viewed as weak by our great power adversaries.  The hollowing out of the State Department under this administration will cause irreparable damage to America's diplomatic efforts, and it will harm our country's standing in the world. Congress has to step in and make sure this doesn't happen.  I yield the floor.

1078,topic-id,648,"Mr.President, I rise today, as my colleague from North Dakota has just done, to speak in support of Senate bill 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection  In response to the 2008 financial crisis, many individuals overreacted to the role that smaller institutions played. In the rush to react, these institutions became overregulated. But since the drafting and enactment of Dodd-Frank nearly 10 years ago, Congress has looked for ways to lessen the damaging effects it has had on our financial system in As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, thousands of pages of Federal mandates were imposed upon even the smallest of financial institutions.  Community banks all across the country are the key source of lending and other financial services on Main Street throughout this I believe we should not, and must not, continue to require them to comply with the same regulations as our largest financial institutions that are, perhaps, subject to systemic risk.  This bill before us today fixes that by offering a commonsense approach to ensure that our small and medium-sized financial institutions are no longer subject to excessive regulation that has choked the life from them in the country.  Senate bill 2155 is a result of almost 10 years of negotiations among Members of both parties. This legislation was negotiated in good faith between Republicans and Democrats to find common ground. In a time when partisan politics have derailed many efforts, the bill before us moved through regular order out of the Banking Committee, where a lengthy and robust amendment debate occurred. Many of us in this body, including the Presiding Officer, have spent hours upon hours negotiating since the enactment of Dodd-Frank to get to this point today. This is a bipartisan bill. This is a good product.  Time and again, I have advocated for conducting thorough cost-benefit analysis on financial regulations. I believe it is Congress's role, when tasked with oversight authority, to ensure that the costs of rules from Washington do not outweigh the benefits for consumers. However, even a simple examination of the activities of small and medium-sized banks shows that their practices provide no systemic risk to our financial system.  Many Dodd-Frank regulations are inappropriate for these institutions in the country. This has become abundantly clear to most of us. As regulatory overreach progressed, community banks and, in turn, local economies began to fall on hard times.  In the 115th Congress, I believe the dynamics have shifted. Beginning with our work to reform our Nation's tax system, the economy has been performing well. Unemployment has dropped; the total number of individuals returning to the workforce has increased. In the Senate, we now have a unique opportunity to unlock the chains of stagnation that have halted the growth of a lot of our small business.  Community financial institutions provide more than 60 percent of small business loans in this country. Too often, it is easy to forget that the personalized touch of community banks has been what started the process for success of some of the most accomplished businesses in the United States of I believe we must pass this bill if we want that to continue--if we want to keep creating jobs in this country and opportunities for our people.  In response to my friends from the other side of the aisle who oppose our efforts here, I have one simple message: The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act--the bill we have before the Senate now--is a thoughtful, bipartisan effort to correct and rightsize regulations that were hastily prepared.

From the summer of 2004 through 2009, my constituent Brian was deployed a total of six times on combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan as a United States Marine Corps helicopter mechanic.  As a junior marine, he would haul trash daily to the airbases' burn pits. He helped burn all the unit's trash and stood security watch on the burn pits, which are always located near work or housing areas in airbases.  During each deployment, Brian would smell the trash burning in the pits and was always in the path of the smoke. He would often wear rags across his mouth and nose to reduce the foul smell and filter the smoke from the air he was breathing.  After some time, Brian developed breathing troubles, and the base medical center provided inhalers that helped temporarily. When he was home in between the deployments, he had breathing treatments and was diagnosed with bronchitis on multiple occasions.  In 2013, Brian developed a serious case of pneumonia. An abscess had formed in the lower lobe of his left lung. It ruptured, filling the lobe with fluid. The doctors removed a portion of Brian's left lung to save his life. The surgery kept him alive but greatly reduced lung capacity and functionality.  In 2016, Brian was offered the option to retire early from the United States Marine The Veterans Administration reviewed his case and determined a 100 percent disability rating. He is currently going through more testing due to undiagnosed heart issues and elevated blood level count for his blood cells, and he is still being treated for lung problems.  To this day, Brian reports having rib cage pain and nerve damage from the lung surgery on a daily basis.  Brian is, unfortunately, not the only servicemember whose health is deteriorating due to exposure to harmful substances from burning of waste in military bases.  While we are glad to see action taken in the NDAA for fiscal year 2018, we need a more permanent solution. I am proud to cosponsor H.1279, Helping Veterans Exposed to Burn Pits Act, that would create a center of excellence within the Department of Veterans Affairs to better understand the health effects and treatments associated with burn pits.  I also encourage our United States military to provide proper breathing safety apparatuses and reconsider their current policy of having burn pits on or near our bases.

While most were downsizing, Daisy Lopez-Cid was planning her empire. In 2007 and 2008, she dove in feet first and opened her office. By 2016, office number two made its debut, and both have been churning out steady numbers since their doors opened.  Daisy was ranked in the top 250 sales agents in the country 4 years in a row; and, in 2015, she was ranked number 3 in the  She joined NAHREP, the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals, in 2008, and quickly realized how the association's mission to advance sustainable Hispanic home ownership lined up with her core values as a real estate professional.  To give back to the organization that has empowered her for so long, she now serves as the NAHREP 2018 national president.  Recently, when Hurricane Maria hit our native island of Puerto Rico, she traveled down there for over 2 weeks, bringing down thousands and thousands of pounds of supplies: food, water, medications, clothing, and so many other of the bare essentials that we need for living every day.  She went down door to door, and people in Puerto Rico welcomed her into their homes and welcomed the much-needed help that helped lift up the island, along with so many entrepreneurs in central Florida who helped with our brothers and sisters in Puerto  Although real estate was not her first career, it was clear to see that this former New York paralegal had found her calling in real estate. Daisy is someone you want to have in your corner, as her zest for success is contagious, and her wisdom speaks beyond her years. Her vast real estate knowledge and love for education and for educating her agents has allowed her firm to grow on Broadway in Kissimmee, and to put more families into homes.  Daisy has a passion for customer care that is contagious, and her 50 agents will tell you that she is in it to win it.  Her goal is and has always been quality over quantity, and that makes Daisy a success. It is a priority for her to educate her agents and equip them with the tools they will need for success.  She also serves as a trustee in our local community college, Valencia College, where we worked together to create Poinciana Valencia campus, which now is up and running and serving thousands of folks in south Osceola  And for that, Daisy Lopez-Cid, we honor you.

1609,topic-id,591,"Mr.Speaker, it is a personal thrill for me to participate in this special hour. I want to thank the gentlewoman from California for doing a very good job of surprising our guest of honor this evening. She did it very well because she did it on policy.  She got Marcy to come here on a night when she should be celebrating, but she didn't hesitate to come down here to talk about what is wrong with Wall Street, which shows you how committed Marcy Kaptur is.                              {time}  1945  When I think of Marcy Kaptur, I think of a string of pearls. She is always providing pearls of wisdom to all of us. We have heard from many Members who have spoken about the fact that she has mentored them. I know when I was a young Member here--young only in time served--that it was Marcy who came up to me a number of times to show support and to provide me guidance.  She also has a very elegant way, a very simple and elegant way that she comports herself. When she talks about issues, she talks with great passion, but with great dignity--again, a reflection of a string of pearls.  She has never forgotten her roots. She has never forgotten her constituents. Now, her blood may be red, but there is a lot of blue running through them because she has always been there for the blue-collar worker. And she oftentimes in caucus is the conscience for all of us because she reminds us about the working class: What are we doing for the working class, lower middle class Americans?  Her commitment to economic justice cannot be lost on any of us because that has been one of the main principles that has really directed her work here and has been a moral compass for her.  So when the financial meltdown happened, Marcy had such a passion for wanting to right this terrible wrong, and she was no longer serving on the Financial Services Committee, but she had a thirst to learn everything she possibly could about what was necessary to reform the system. And I remember her coming to a briefing that I had with some experts, and then she invited me to a briefing that she had with some experts because all she wanted to do was get to the truth of what we needed to do.  She has conviction that she, I think, reflected in all she did through that financial meltdown because she was going to stop at nothing less than wholesale changes to fix the system, because, as many of us felt: never, ever again.  So as I think about the fact that we are celebrating the longest serving woman in the history of the United States House of Representatives, I feel so privileged to say that I know you; that I have served with you. There is no one who is more ethical in this building than you; there is no one more compassionate in this building than you; and there is no one more committed to economic justice in this building.  There has never been, nor do I think will there ever be, anyone who cares about Ohio like Marcy  Marcy, thank you for being a beacon for all of us to follow.

59,topic-id,1429,"Mr.President, today marks a sad and, frankly, shocking day for too many of America's children and hard-working families because it has now been 100 days since funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program and community health centers expired.  History has shown us that there is a whole lot that can get done in 100 days. It took Thomas Jefferson only 17 days to write the Declaration of Independence; the brave allied forces who landed on D-day advanced through France and liberated Paris in only 80 days; and Congress managed to pass 15 major pieces of legislation during President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first 100 days in office. Yet, here we are, 100 days past the deadline of September 30, and Congress still hasn't managed to pass long-term legislation to reauthorize what we call CHIP--the Children's Health Insurance Program--and to fund our community health centers.  We have a strong bipartisan bill funding CHIP, which was passed out of committee. I give our chairman and ranking member kudos for working together. I was proud to work with them. It came out of committee with only one ``no'' vote and has waited and waited and waited on the floor of the Senator Blunt and I have a bipartisan bill to continue funding community health centers, and 70 Members of the Senate have signed a letter supporting long-term funding for community health centers, which expired September 30--100 days ago.  Right now, we are in a situation where 9 million children and their parents don't know what is going to happen long term. As soon as this month, 100,000 children and their families in Michigan have begun to get letters saying that their children will lose coverage, and they are trying to figure out what is going on.  Imagine being a parent who is working hard. A lot of folks I know are working two jobs, trying to hold it together. You don't have health insurance; you earn too much for your children to be able to get Medicaid health insurance, so the Children's Health Insurance Program is your lifeline. It is your lifeline. It gives you peace of mind to know that if your daughter falls and breaks her arm or your son gets a cough that won't go away, you can take them to the doctor.  What if those children have something worse than a broken arm or a cough? What if they are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes or asthma or cancer? Just imagine being that parent and getting a letter which says that your child may no longer have health insurance. It is not necessary. This is not necessary.  We could do this tomorrow. If we thought it was important enough to bring it to the floor, we could get a vote--and I believe it would be overwhelmingly bipartisan--tomorrow if[[Page S62]]there were a sense of urgency, an understanding, about how these parents feel and how these children feel.  So what would you do if you got that letter? Would you tell your kids? You don't want them to worry about it. What would you do? I believe hard-working families--and we are talking about working families, people with jobs, working--deserve better.  Then we have community health centers that serve 25 million people across the country, including 300,000 veterans and 7.5 million children. Our health centers are doing a phenomenal job. At more than 260 sites across Michigan, our health centers are serving 681,000 people, including about 13,000 Michigan veterans.  This month, health centers that were supposed to receive a new 12-month grant are only getting a small amount of funding to get them through the next few weeks, not knowing what is going to happen again. By June, Michigan's community health centers will lose over $80 million in funding, and over 99,000 patients will lose care.  Last month, I had the opportunity to visit two of our great Michigan community health centers, each of their networks operating more than one site--Hamilton Community Health Network in Flint and Western Wayne Family Health Centers in Like clinics across Michigan, these centers are serving literally thousands of Michigan families every day--people of Michigan who don't have medical care for one reason or another. Now those thousands of people are at risk of having no place to go if they get sick or if they need preventative care so that they don't get sick.  Hamilton Community Health Network will run out of funding in April, and Western Wayne Family Health Centers will not get their full funding this month. They were asking me: Should they lay people off? How should they be planning for their centers? What should they be doing?  That means 15,500 people are wondering what will happen to them if they or their children get sick or slip on the ice--which there is a lot of in Michigan--and sprain an ankle.  Felicia knows what it is like to live under that cloud of fear. She wrote me a letter indicating that in 2011 she was an AmeriCorps volunteer serving in Lansing and didn't have health insurance. When she started feeling tired all the time and losing weight, she went to the Center for Family Health in Jackson, MI, another great center. The Center for Family Health, which served 29,000 patients in 2016, will run out of funding in March if we don't act.  Felicia was diagnosed with stage 4 Hodgkin's lymphoma--pretty scary stuff. The Center for Family Health helped her get her health coverage through Medicaid and care from the University of Michigan, including chemotherapy and later a stem cell transplant.  Felicia wrote me:       Now I am feeling awesome, I am cancer-free, and I am      working part time while I am finishing up college. I feel      that I owe my life to the Center for Family  Felicia knows the importance of community health centers; one in Michigan saved her life. People like Felicia and children who are covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program, which we call MIChild in Michigan, shouldn't have to wait a day longer. They are counting on us to get this done. It has been 100 days of uncertainty that did not have to happen.  Let me say that again. We have a bipartisan bill reported out of the Finance The House has reported their version. There is no reason we can't immediately put a 5-year extension on the floor of the  Senator Blunt and I and our cosponsors of our bill have always assumed that once CHIP came to the floor, we would be adding in community health centers, for which there is strong support, and we would be able to get this done. People would know that their neighborhood health center is there. Their children can go to the doctor instead of sitting for hours in the emergency room. They would be able to see their doctor if they got sick. It has been 100 days since funding has expired for community health centers and children's health insurance. That is 100 days too many.  I have been coming to the floor every week to say: Let's do it today. Let's do it tomorrow. We don't have to wait and hold them as bargaining chips in some bigger appropriations negotiation. These are families. These are kids. These are people who want to have confidence in us that we will do our jobs. This one can get done. It could have gotten done before the holidays. What a great Christmas present that would have been. It can get done now.  On behalf of the 25 million people who use those community health centers, the 9 million children and their parents who use the Children's Health Insurance Program, I call on all of us to have the sense of urgency and the leadership--the leader--to bring this up. We can get it done in a day. We would all feel good about it because it would be something we would be doing together instead of having these families wait and wait.  Mr.President, before yielding, I want to acknowledge our newest Senator, Mr.Jones, who is here, and thank him. Even as he was in his happiness, and rightly so, on the evening he found out he was going to be the next Senator, he mentioned In listening to that acceptance speech, it did my heart good to know that children's health insurance was at the top of our newest Senator's mind at that important time, and it is a pleasure to see him on the floor this evening.

A lot has changed since the Michigan PTA was first established in Battle Creek on May 19, 1918. Parents today are as likely to learn school news via Facebook or text messages as they are from notes sent home, and students are as likely to learn their lessons on laptops and tablets as they are on the chalkboard.

They do that in the best way possible, by bringing together families, educators, school boards, nonprofit organizations, businesses, community leaders, and elected officials around a common cause: promoting the welfare of Michigan children in school, at home, and in the community.

I know the pages love them. I come to the floor to talk about my State, really brag about my State, and recognize an Alaskan who has made a difference--made a difference in their community, whether it is a small community or a big community in the State, in the country.  I have repeatedly stated--I am sure not all my colleagues agree, but maybe some of them do--that Alaskans live in the greatest State in the greatest country in the world. We certainly have the most beautiful landscapes and all the seasons. I was in Fairbanks and Anchorage over the holidays. It was wonderful. Winter is such a great time in the great State of For those who love snow, Alaska is the place to be, so we want everyone to come visit. But it is truly the people and strong communities throughout Alaska that make our State so great--such a welcoming place.  For those of us who live in Alaska, sustainable community is everything. Living in one of the most magnificent places on Earth, also, certainly has its challenges. We depend on each other. Our traditional knowledge, our ingenuity, our warm-hearted nature, and our determination to overcome these challenges is what makes our State great and is often the theme of our ``Alaskan of the Week'' speeches.  Today I wish to transport you to the village of Tuntutuliak--a village of about 400 people, southwest of Bethel, AK, on the 700-mile long, mighty Kuskokwim River--and introduce you to a truly amazing elder who, for 77 years, has worked tirelessly for his community and for our This is James Charles, who is our Alaskan of the  Over the past decades, when there has been a meeting on the Kuskokwim concerning fish or wildlife or subsistence, James has been there helping to create and shape a fishing and hunting community and regulations, not only for the region but for the entire State of  James was born in 1940 in a fish camp below Helmick Point on the Kuskokwim During that time, Alaska was being devastated by a tuberculosis epidemic. In fact, in the mid-20th century, Alaska Native people experienced the highest incidence of tuberculosis of any population ever. This is one of the many challenges we talk about.  Sadly, the epidemic took James's father, his uncle, and both grandparents, leaving his mother and the community[[Page S44]]to care for her three children. The community--like many still, unfortunately, in Alaska--didn't have hospitals or clinics. They didn't have medicine. The Federal Government basically turned a blind eye to the havoc that this disease was wreaking over all of Alaska, particularly in our small villages.  What the community did have was each other. They had food, and they had the bounty of the land. They had elders to help teach the young people in the village the true meaning of subsistence living.  James's mother, Emma, hunted and fished to feed the family, and she and James's uncle taught James how to be a conservationist, only taking enough fish and wild game to survive and ensuring enough was left for other villagers--lessons he has passed on to the younger generations of Alaskans, year after year.

He has 5 children, 15 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren. He is so committed to keeping the culture and tradition alive that none of his kids or great grandkids are allowed into his house unless they are able to speak Yupik, the traditional language of his people.

He has been a legislative correspondent and rose to be a legislative aide where he oversaw issues related to my work on both the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Most notably and importantly for this body and, I believe, for the entire country, Alex was the key member of my staff who drafted 756, the Save Our Seas Act, the SOS Act, an important bipartisan piece of legislation we worked on with Senator Whitehouse and others. It passed the Senate last year.  This legislation, which is awaiting movement in the House, will address a very important issue not only for Alaska but for the entire country, which is the epidemic of marine debris affecting our oceans, our shorelines, inland waterways, coasts across the globe, fish and wildlife habitat, and the health and sustainability of our fisheries.  What Alex was able to do in terms of this bill is very impressive. He brought together an impressive coalition of industry and conservation groups to support the bill. In addition to working on that important legislation--which we are hopeful will move in the House and get signed by the President--Alex ran point on hearings that I chaired at the Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast  He has a bachelor of science degree from High Point University in North Carolina and a master's degree in applied political science from American He is an avid outdoorsman, as you can probably tell.

540,topic-id,335,"Mr.Speaker, the people live like paupers while the mullahs live like gods.  For weeks, tens of thousands of brave Iranians have courageously stood up in over 70 cities and chanted: ``The people live like paupers while the mullahs live like gods.''  They challenge their failed government. They have done so in the face of violent repression, imprisonment, torture, and even death.  Why?  They are fed up. They are fed up with poverty and unemployment; fed up with economic depravation and rampant corruption; fed up with an oppressive theocratic regime that mismanages their own country, mistreats its own people, and spends billions of dollars sowing the seeds of war and funding terrorists while its people suffer.  Ayatollahs recklessly pursued nuclear weapons instead of creating jobs and building infrastructure for their own people. The regime's apologists have long argued that these policies are popular and they give Iranians a national sense of pride, restoring their place as a regional power.  A regional power?  It is more like regional thugs.  In Iraq, Iranian-backed militias have executed and beat civilians, looted homes, and destroyed people's lives. In[[Page H54]]Lebanon, Iranian-backed Hezbollah aims tens of thousands of rockets at Israeli citizens. Syria backs Bashar al-Assad's vicious regime. Iran sends weapons and money to militants in Yemen, Bahrain, and It has become the biggest purveyor of mayhem in the Middle East, pouring billions of dollars into nefarious activities while their own people are impoverished.

The United States and our allies should use the menu of sanctions available to us to target human rights violators and the Ayatollah's thugs who forcefully repress their fellow citizens.

93,topic-id,1182,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Scott for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to 140, which would strip protections from workers who are employed by a Tribally-owned business but are not Tribal members. This includes protection from harassment and discrimination in the workplace.  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employers from discriminating against employees, does not apply to Tribal enterprises. A non-Tribal worker employed by a Tribally-owned casino, for example, cannot file a harassment or discrimination claim in Federal court or with the Equal Employment Opportunity Instead, collective bargaining agreements fill the gap by including provisions that enforce their right to a fair workplace.  By stripping their collective bargaining rights, this legislation eliminates the only recourse that these workers have against discrimination and harassment. This is one of the many unacceptable consequences of this bill.  Now, I have two letters. One from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and one from the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, both of which raise strong objections to the majority's attempt to exclude workers from the rights enshrined in the National Labor Relations  Mr.Speaker, I include these letters in the                                         International Brotherhood                                                 of Teamsters,                                 Washington, DC, December 6, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members      of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, I am again      writing to[[Page H117]]     express our strong opposition to H.986, the Tribal Labor      Sovereignty This legislation would exempt all Tribally-     owned and -operated commercial enterprises on Indian lands      broadly defined from the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).      We urge you to vote no when the House considers this      legislation.       If H.986 were to become law, hundreds of thousands of      workers at these enterprises, including Teamsters, would be      stripped of their protections and rights under the NLRA,      including the right to organize and collective bargaining. It      would deprive both Tribal members and non-member employees of      the right to form or join unions and to bargain collectively      for better wages, hours, and working conditions. We should be      working to expand the rights and ability of workers to earn a      decent living for themselves and their families and to secure      a safe and healthy workplace.       While Tribal casinos have been the focus of discussion,      this legislation affects not just casino workers. Since the      1980's Tribes have expanded business interests beyond      casinos. They now operate many different revenue producing      commercial enterprises--construction companies, mining      operations, and power plants, to hotels, water parks and ski      resorts, to name a few.       In 2004, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) (in San      Manuel) ruled that Tribal casino workers should have NLRA      protections. Shortly after the San Manuel decision,      legislation, in the form of amendments, was twice offered to      block the NLRB from enforcing the San Manuel decision.       These amendments were rejected. Since then, the NLRB has      proceeded in a measured fashion asserting jurisdiction on a      case-by-case basis. The NLRB will not assert jurisdiction      where it would interfere with internal governance rights in      purely intramural matters or abrogate treaty rights.      Otherwise, the NLRB will protect workers' rights at tribally      owned enterprises by asserting jurisdiction. With its case-     by-case approach, San Manuel takes a careful approach to      balancing of tribal sovereignty interests with Federal labor      law.       It should be noted that other important federal laws that      protect workers apply to Indian businesses, such as the      Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Fair Labor Standards      Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and Title      III of the Americans with Disabilities Indeed, courts      have denied attempts to gain exemptions on numerous occasions      ruling commercial tribal enterprises should not be excluded      from such laws. NLRA rights and protections should not be      treated differently.       Proponents assert that they are seeking the same exemption      as state and local governments. However, this is inaccurate,      The NLRA only exempts actual government employees and not      private sector employees performing contracted out government      functions. Also, a substantial majority of workers at these      enterprises are not Indian or Tribe members, and thus have no      ability to influence tribal governance, since non-tribal      members are prohibited from petitioning a tribe.       The bill could also undermine enforcement of existing labor      contracts and the decision workers made to organize and      bargain collectively. When a collective bargaining agreement      expires, a Tribe could unilaterally terminate the      relationship with the union without consequence under the      The employer's obligation. to bargain could be      eliminated.       Employees of tribal enterprises have no constitutional      rights to protect against employers. Only the NLRA gives them      free speech rights. Absent the NLRA they have no protection.      Workers cannot be left without any legally enforceable right      to form unions and bargain collectively just because they are      employed at tribally owned enterprise.       Finally, the United States requires its trading partners to      implement and abide by internationally recognized labor      standards, while H.986 deprives workers at these tribal      enterprises of these core rights--the right to organize and      bargain collectively.       To focus solely on the NLRA raises the question of the true      motivation for this legislation. It is regrettable that the      principle of tribal sovereignty is being used to cloak an      attack on the basic rights of workers to organize and bargain      collectively. The Teamsters Union respects tribal      sovereignty. However, we do not believe that this principle      should be used to deny workers their collective bargaining      rights and freedom of association. We urge you to oppose the      Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act and to VOTE NO on H.986 when      the legislation comes to a vote in the House of                Sincerely,                                                   James Hoffa,     General                                  ____         American Federation of State, County and Municipal            Employees, AFL-CIO,                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2018.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members      of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal      Employees (AFSCME), I am writing to urge to oppose 140, as      currently amended to expand the exemption of employers under      the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).       140, as amended, is Just another attempt at passing the      so-called Tribal Sovereignty Act, which would deny protection      under the NLRA to many workers employed by tribal-owned and -     operated enterprises on Indian land. A great majority of      these workers are not Native Americans and in recent years      there has been a substantial expansion of enterprises that      would be impacted by this legislation, including not only      casinos, but mining operations, power plants, saw mills, ski      resorts, high-tech firms, hotels, and spas.       AFSCME supports the principle of sovereignty for tribal      governments, but does not believe that this principle should      be used to deny workers their collective bargaining rights      and freedom of association. We oppose any effort to exempt on      an across-the-board basis all tribal enterprises from the      NLRA, without regard to a specific review of all the      circumstances, as is currently provided by National Labor      Relations Board (NLRB) standards. Workers must not be left      without any legally enforceable right to form unions and      bargain collectively, especially in instances where they are      working for commercial operations competing with other      businesses.       AFSCME strongly urges you to oppose 140, as amended,      when it comes before the House for a vote.

1747,topic-id,1475,"Madam President, I rise today to reflect on the landmark legislation that this body passed with overwhelming bipartisan support last week. It isn't every day that folks in Congress can work together in a bipartisan way to get something done that will benefit Main Streets across rural America, but that is exactly what we did last week. I am very proud of that effort.  I say a big thank-you to the chairman of the Banking Committee, Chairman Crapo, for the work he has done, his ability to listen, his commonsense perspective, and his patience. It would not have happened without those qualities that Chairman Crapo exhibited.  I also want to single out three Senators who worked very hard on this bill. There are a number of others who did, too, but I am just going to mention Senators Heitkamp, Donnelly, and Those folks did yeoman's work in bringing into view the challenges that our banking industry has out there, coming up with solutions for those challenges, and coming up with consumer protections to put into this bill to move it forward. There were many others. I think there were 17 or 18 cosponsors on the Democratic side of the aisle, but I say a special thank you to Senators Heitkamp, Donnelly, and Warner for their advocacy, input, knowledge, expertise, and their ability to work to get things done.  People ask me: Senator Tester, why did you write this bill? Well, I was a part of the folks who wrote this bill for good reason. I remember very well that during the financial crisis, then-Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson came in--it was in 2008, I believe--and said that we were on the cusp of a financial meltdown in this country. I remember some of the free and irresponsible activities that were done in the financial system. I remember bringing regulators in front of the Banking Committee and ripping them up one side and down the other as to why we had gotten into this situation. In the end, we came up with a bill called Dodd- Dodd-Frank was put together after a lot of public input and a lot of hearings, and it was put into effect really to regulate the folks who got us into the situation we were in. At that moment in time, we had banks that were too big to fail, folks who were doing no-doc or low-doc loans, and foreclosures happening everywhere. We put in the regulation.  One of the things we heard when we put in the Dodd-Frank regulation was that it was a big bill and that it was going to need to be changed, adapted--however you want to put it--moving forward. I believe that bill was passed in 2009. Here we are 8 or 9 years later, and we look at Dodd-Frank and see that in some cases, it has done exactly as was intended, especially for the larger banks. Some could argue that there is more work to be done there.  One of the negative things that resulted from the Dodd-Frank regulation was that some of that regulation bled down onto our local community banks and credit unions. This is particularly concerning to me because I come from a very rural part of this country. It is a small town where, when my grandfather homesteaded, they had all sorts of options when they marketed their grain. In the 1940s and 1950s, when my folks took over in my small town, I believe there were five grain elevators there. When Sharla and I took over in the late 1970s, there were three. Today, there is one.  You ask, why does that have anything to do with the banking industry, Jon? Well, it is consolidation. And the consolidation didn't happen overnight; it took decades. You end up with less competition in the marketplace when it comes to selling your grains.  That same thing could be adapted to what has gone on in our community banks over the last 8 or 9 years, where they have been bought up by bigger banks. The bigger banks will tell you that they have to get bigger to be able to compete with the regulations put on them. So they were bought up, and the same thing will extrapolate out over time.  Those folks who say: Well, this isn't necessary because banks are making a lot of money--look, banks may be operating today, but they are looking into the future, as any good business does, and they are saying to themselves: Do I really have what it takes to stick around? They can see the writing on the wall, and they are selling out because of it. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about this--this will result in less consumer choice and more consolidation, making the bigger banks even bigger and really helping the folks who caused the crisis back in 2008--ultimately, the biggest of the big banks.  We have seen the consolidation at grocery stores, grain elevators, and even bars. The truth is that it isn't all due to one single thing. The consolidation in the financial industry and on the ground isn't due to just regulations. Technology has its impact, and a moving population also has its impact.  As I looked at this 5 years ago, I said: If we don't do something to tweak Dodd-Frank, we are going to end up in a situation where we don't have consumer choice to buy that house or expand that business or start that new business--what entrepreneurs do. So as a policymaker, I thought it was my job to look ahead to the next generation of people who are going to be out there in rural America, whether it is a Main Street small business or a farm or a family who is working for a business. That is why I helped write this bill, because from a rural America perspective, it was the right thing to do, and it was time to do something for the next generation, for our kids and our grandkids, so that they could have the kind of opportunity that, quite frankly, my folks and my grandparents had given to my generation.  I am not the kind of person who will sit back on the sidelines and complain about stuff over a cup of coffee. When we see a problem, my folks taught me to work and try to fix it. I see a problem, and there is little doubt in my mind that if we had not done what we did last week to give some regulatory relief to community banks and credit unions, things would have continued to get worse in rural They still may get worse in rural America, but at least we have done what we needed to do in this body to try to change that.  There are some out there who, for whatever reason--and I haven't quite been able to figure it out yet--are spreading misinformation about this bill. Maybe it is just the day we live in. So let me set the record straight about this bill.  This bill does not help the Wall Street banks. It does not. Those who say it does are not correct. This bill does not set us up for another financial crisis. In fact, the authors of the original Dodd-Frank bill, Chris Dodd and[[Page S1778]]Barney Frank--both smart guys whom I admire--wrote:       As the authors of the original Dodd-Frank reform law, we      want all Montanans to know that the banking bill Senator      Tester helped write does not dismantle Dodd-Frank as some      people claim. Jon knows Montana and challenges facing rural      While we did not agree with every part of this bill,      it helps local credit unions and community banks across      Montana while keeping protections in place that are designed      to prevent another financial crisis.  Those are the original authors. That is why it is called Dodd-Frank--because it is from Chris Dodd and Representative Barney  The other thing the bill does not do is it does not leave banks unregulated. There is implication by some out there that this bill deregulates 25 of the 40 largest banks. To me, that implication is that now they are no longer regulated. The fact is, all the banks are highly regulated for safety and soundness. Quite frankly, this does not leave banks unregulated. They still have plenty of regulation to go through.  In conclusion, the bill we passed last week does several things. I believe it is going to increase access to capital, particularly in rural I think it makes the regulation fit the risk, while still continuing to crack down on risky behavior. It has great consumer protection components to it. Last and certainly not least, from my perspective, it is good for rural  I yield the floor.

594,topic-id,1335,"Mr.President, the beginning of a new session of Congress provides a good moment to look back at the previous year and take stock of the challenges ahead, and today what I would like to do is just take a few minutes to talk about the national security challenges facing our country and the importance of equipping our military to meet them.  By the end of the Obama administration, our military was facing a serious readiness shortfall. The Obama administration's failure to prioritize defense had left our armed services with manpower deficits and delayed the acquisition of 21st century weapons and equipment. Military effectiveness had been compromised by a culture of micromanagement in the Obama administration that seriously hampered the ability of troops and commanders to respond to conditions on the ground in a timely fashion, but within days of his inauguration, President Trump made clear that all this was going to change.  You can look at the situation we faced in the Middle The timeframe I am referring to right here, the mound of ground that is held by ISIS, that is in January of 2017.  Well, just a week after his inauguration, President Trump issued a Presidential memorandum on rebuilding the military. He directed a review of our military's readiness, and he set out an action plan to address manpower shortfalls, maintenance backlogs, acquisition costs and delays, and other drains on our military capabilities. President Trump also acted to free up military commanders to make decisions and to respond to conditions on the ground.  The fruits of his commitment to rebuilding our military and trusting our military leaders are already evident, most notably in the significant gains made against ISIS in 2017.[[Page S88]]  If you look at the chart I just showed, in January of 2017, and then you look at December of 2017, in terms of territory held, ISIS has been routed. In the first 11 months of the Trump administration, over 15,000 square miles were liberated from ISIS control, exceeding the total area freed in the preceding 2\1/2\ years. ISIS has lost over 98 percent of the territory it once held, and it hasn't gained any back.  Just a month ago, Iraqi Prime Minister al-Abadi declared his country ``fully liberated'' from In Syria, ISIS has lost control of its strongholds and now only remains in small pockets of the country.  All told, in the last year, more than 5.3 million people have been freed from the brutal grip of ISIS--more than double the previous gains. Families who have spent years fearing for their lives are seeing a chance for stability, peace, and order. If this year has shown us anything, it is that we can trust our military to do its job and deliver results.  President Trump delegated tactical authority and permitted our military to take action when action was needed, and military leaders credit this tactical authority for significant gains made on the ground.  The swift rise of ISIS was enabled, in part, by the Obama administration's shortsighted desire to withdraw from the fight against terrorism in the Middle The withdrawal of U.troops--on a timeline the Obama administration announced to our enemies--left a power vacuum in the region, and ISIS stepped in to fill the void. This is a mistake we cannot repeat.  While we have made tremendous strides against ISIS in the last year, we cannot simply take these wins and let our guard down. We know ISIS and other dark actors can operate in the shadows of the internet and social media, using their extensive networks to recruit and influence other would-be attackers in the United States and around the world.  As chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which shares jurisdiction over some of these matters, I am committed to looking at what steps we can take to thwart terrorist recruitment and planning efforts and to keep America safe. Next week, I am holding a Commerce Committee hearing on what social media companies can do in this fight.  While we focus on combating terrorism, we cannot forget the conventional threats faced by our Nation and our allies. I mentioned gains against ISIS and Syria, but there remains the alarming challenge of growing Iranian influence there. Syria provides a convenient land bridge to connect Iran with Hezbollah in Lebanon, which is well on its way to being a proxy for the Iranian  Of course, we continue to see the deadly consequences of Iran's continued smuggling of arms to Houthi rebels. Iran is a serious threat to stability in the Middle East and to our allies there, and we need to keep that in mind as we consider the failed Iran nuclear deal and the ongoing protests in  We also have to stay focused on the threat posed by North South and North Korea reestablished communications and just met to discuss the upcoming winter Olympics in South They announced, in addition to North Korea sending a delegation to the winter games, the two countries have agreed to hold military talks, but North Korea said it will not discuss its nuclear program at this time.  I think North Korea's nuclear program has to be addressed as a condition of any lasting peace, and the United States should lead its allies in making that crystal clear. While the talks are a notable development after 2 years of no communication between the two countries, we obviously need to be wary of North Korea's motives. We will have to see what actions follow and if the talks lead to any substantive steps by North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program.  President Trump and Ambassador Haley have made it clear that North Korea must abandon its dangerous ambitions, and increased sanctions are providing additional pressure. We should make no concessions without fundamental progress. Of course, this will require cooperation from China to help exert pressure on North Korea and uphold U.resolutions.  China has sought to tip the regional balance in its favor by objecting to the installation of missile defense platforms that would defend the United States and our allies against North Korean missiles. Meanwhile, it has been simultaneously expanding its own military, continuing to develop islands in international waters and exercising economic coercion.  President Trump's national security strategy correctly acknowledges both China and Russia as challengers to American influence, interests, security, and prosperity.  I have spoken on the Senate floor more than once to denounce Russia's continued annexation of Crimea, its subversion of Ukrainian sovereignty, and its efforts to undermine NATO, not to mention its continued denial of attempting to meddle with our election. Both the conventional challenges that our Nation continues to face and the persistent threat of radical terrorism underscore the perennial need to ensure that our military is the best prepared and the best equipped fighting force in the world.  I have said it before, and I will say it again. If we don't get national security right, the rest of what we do here is just conversation. We have to be able to defend our country and our allies.  Yes, investing in our national security and restoring our military, especially after years of neglect, will come at a cost, but as Army Chief of Staff GEN Mark Milley has said, ``The only thing more expensive than deterrence is actually fighting a war, and the only thing more expensive than fighting a war is fighting one and losing one.''  In the next few weeks, the Senate will have a chance to vote to increase funding for our troops and to take real steps to restore our military readiness. I hope my colleagues across the aisle will work with us. If there is any issue--any issue--in this Chamber that should be bipartisan, it is this one. It is not an exaggeration to say the security of our Nation, our ability to live as a free people, depends upon the strength of our military. It is time to make sure our military men and women have the resources they need to defend our                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgS85-2.txt,1534,1300,2018.0,9.0,March
1569,topic-id,1208,"Mr.President, we are quickly turning to the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act legislation, coupled with the legislation that has come over from the House of Representatives, and I hope we will get a big bipartisan vote in support of that legislation when it is voted on, probably tomorrow.  Let me just say that for more than two decades, the commercial internet has been an undeniable force for good. It has delivered economic opportunity to people who would not otherwise have had it. It has empowered marginalized citizens around the world to fight back against oppressors. It has expanded educational opportunities and made news and information more accessible, and more. But like any tool, the internet can be used for evil as well as good, and right now, certain corners of the internet are being exploited to facilitate sex trafficking, including the widespread trafficking of children.  Each year, thousands of children are sexually trafficked within the United That is right. Thousands of children are trafficked each year in the United States--not in some faraway country but right here at home in our communities. More and more every day, this trafficking is being facilitated via the internet. Three out of four children who have been sexually trafficked in this country have been trafficked online.  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children reported an 846-percent increase in reports of suspected child sex trafficking from 2010 to 2015. The increase, the national center reports, is ``directly correlated to the increased use of the internet to sell children for sex.''  Obviously, dedicated prosecutors and law enforcement around the country are working every day to combat the proliferation of sex trafficking on the internet, but some of their efforts have been stymied by a provision of a 1996 law called the Communications Decency The provision in question--section 230--was meant to protect websites from being held accountable for material people create and post on their sites. It is thanks in part to this provision that such popular sites as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have been able to flourish. But certain websites have used this provision to defend themselves in court cases dealing with criminal activity that they have knowingly allowed or participated in--specifically, sex trafficking.  Needless to say, Congress never intended this provision to be used to protect websites that knowingly and deliberately facilitate trafficking, but courts have generally held that this provision does not permit them to hold websites accountable for knowingly facilitating sex trafficking.  Courts have also made clear that if Congress wants to ensure that these trafficking accomplices can be prosecuted, it needs to provide some more clarity on this provision. That is what we are here to do today.  Senator Rob Portman of Ohio has been a leading voice in the Senate in the fight against human trafficking, and the legislation before us today includes his legislation, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which will prevent section 230 from being used as a defense by those who are knowingly cooperating with sex traffickers. Under this Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, State law enforcement officials will be able to prosecute websites that knowingly assist in or facilitate sex trafficking, and victims will be allowed to sue websites that violate the Federal sex trafficking statute. State attorneys general will now also be allowed to file civil suits against websites that knowingly facilitate trafficking.  The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act is an outstanding bill and a great credit to Senator Portman and the others he worked with to get it considered here on the Senate floor. It addresses a hole in our laws that is allowing sex traffickers to exploit the internet to facilitate their trafficking, but it ensures that only bad actors are targeted, and it maintains the key freedoms that have allowed the internet to flourish. Under this legislation, websites can only be prosecuted if they knowingly facilitate or support trafficking.  This bill is strongly supported by Members of both parties. In fact, 67 out of the 100 U.Senators are cosponsors of this bill. This bill is supported by[[Page S1834]]the White It is supported by law enforcement organizations. It is supported by organizations that fight sex trafficking. It is supported by faith-based organizations. It is also supported by a number of major technology companies. I was proud to help facilitate conversations with a number of technology companies that resulted in solid support for this bill among members of the technology community.  The process of getting this bill to the Senate floor today has been characterized by a wonderful degree of bipartisanship. I am hoping that continues as we debate this bill over the next couple of days, and I encourage my colleagues to reject any attempts to slow this bill down with amendments. We have a remarkable degree of consensus on the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, both within and without Congress, and we should not disturb this momentum. We need to get this bill over the finish line. Every day that we wait for this bill to be enacted into law is another day in which websites in the dark corners of the internet can facilitate the heinous practice of sexually exploiting vulnerable human beings.  During the Commerce Committee hearing that I chaired on this bill, we heard testimony from Yvonne Ambrose, whose daughter, Desiree Robinson, was sexually trafficked repeatedly before being murdered. Desiree was just 16, a bright and loving girl who dreamed of becoming a doctor in the Air Instead, she was raped and murdered by a man twice her age who had sought her for sex after seeing her advertised on an internet site.  Every day across this country, there is another Desiree being trafficked. Some of these children are not yet teenagers. They should be going to basketball games and birthday parties. Instead, they are being taken to homes and hotels and being violated by strangers. Some, like Desiree, will die there.  Fighting trafficking has to be a priority for all of us.  I am proud to have helped draft two bills that became law earlier this year to address human trafficking in commercial vehicles. But while we have passed some good legislation over the past few years, there is a lot more work that needs to be done. There are many more Desirees out there in danger, and we have an obligation to do everything we can to protected them.  The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act will strike an important blow against this new wave of traffickers exploiting the internet to sell children, and the bill it is now part of, a bill that we are considering today--the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act--will further boost SESTA's impact by establishing new criminal penalties for facilitating sex trafficking.  I urge my colleagues to pass this bill and to get it to the President as soon as possible. There are a lot of children out there who are waiting for our help.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

49,topic-id,2441,"Madam President, before the chairman leaves the Chamber, I wish to thank him for his leadership as chairman of the Judiciary He has done an extraordinary job of bringing people together to really come up with a solution to this problem.  This is a problem that has existed for years--almost two decades. The first DREAM Act was filed in 2001, I believe. It has been some 16 years, and they have failed to produce a result. Now, think that through. That was through President Bush, and it was through President It was actually at a time when, in 2009, not a single Republican vote would have been necessary to pass the DREAM Yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle could not produce a result. So we know we need to do something different.  There are things in the Dream Act that we need to file and put into a bill. In fact, it was instructed into a bill that I and Senator Lankford and Senator Hatch filed called the SUCCEED It is a way to provide certainty for the DACA population, but it also needs to be paired up with reasonable border security provisions so that we get the broad base of support we need for enduring policy here.  There are some people who are talking about withdrawing from negotiations and trying to threaten a government shutdown to get something slammed into a year-end spending bill. But if you really care about the long-term certainty that we want to provide these young people who qualified under the DACA Program, the last thing you should do is to play politics and get something half baked into a provision that will always be a target of the next year-end spending bill. Why don't we do something crazy and actually sit down, check our Members on the Republican side and the Democratic side who have extreme views on this issue at the door, and solve the problem.  I have taken a lot of criticism after filing the SUCCEED Act because I had a lot of people who said that I was soft on immigration. Well, I respectfully disagree with some of my friends who are themselves Republicans and conservatives, because I don't think they have it right. I think that the young men and women who qualify under the DACA Program, who were brought to this country through the actions of their parents, through no fault of their own, deserve a respectful, compassionate, physically sustainable solution, and certainty. I have been working on it, and I have been taking the criticism ever since I filed the bill. I even had a congressional district in North Carolina censure me, saying, ``shame on you,'' for actually coming up with something that made sense.  One thing that I said, though, when we filed that bill, is that what we did in the SUCCEED Act had to be paired with reasonable, sustainable border security measures and interior enforcement measures--things that are important if we want to make sure that a decade from now, 15 years from now we are not back here again worried about a new DACA population that has come across the borders.  I have had some people insisting that having a secure border is not compassionate, that it is unfair, but I would actually submit to my colleagues that not having a secure border is irresponsible. Talking about not being compassionate, allowing things to occur with an unsecured border--to me, having a secure border is a hallmark of compassion. That is a little bit of what I want to talk about. So let's stipulate to that.  Working with Senator Durbin--and, incidentally, Senator Durbin and I[[Page S55]]have been talking about this issue for about a year and a half--I knew that we were going to be here with the DACA Program and that we needed to work on it. So I reached out to Senator Durbin and said that I am willing to try to come up with something that makes sense, but we have to be willing to accept something different from all of the random ideas and come with a compromise. We made progress in terms of how to deal with the DACA population, but some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are unwilling to talk about the reality that we should also put into place, and pair with what we do for the DACA population, border security and interior enforcement that makes sense.  Back in February I spent about a week down along the southern border. I was on patrol boats on the Rio I was riding horseback in certain areas of the border. I was out in the interior area where enforcement actions are taking place every night. I spent a lot of time down there. One thing that struck me was some of the briefings that we received from border security. I am going to get to what I consider to be the most heartbreaking last.  We want to talk about what is going on. We have people come to this floor--my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--and say: We must do something to address the opioid epidemic in this country. I agree. That is why I voted for the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery I spoke on the floor several times as a first step toward trying to get a handle on something that is poisoning almost 60,000 people a year--killing them. They are dying from overdoses in this The reality is that the vast majority--and we will get to a slide in a minute--of those illicit drugs, including heroin and fentanyl and the other kinds of drugs that are extracted from opium and are killing people, are coming across the southern border. We simply don't have the resources at our land ports and in the areas where drug smugglers cross illegally to stop them. The consequence of that in a State like North Carolina is that more people are dying from drug overdoses today than are dying from automobile accidents--about 1,400 a year. It is even worse in a number of other  We were at a land port in Laredo, and they were saying that on any given day, millions of doses are probably getting through because they are concealed. They are hidden in trucks. They don't have the capacity to inspect every vehicle. So they are coming across this border ostensibly legally--obviously, through the legal process of entry--but carrying illicit drugs, and we are only capturing a fraction of them. A part of what we are proposing in this bill is additional resources to interdict more of those drugs, to make it less likely that somebody could come across the border by use of a pickup truck or by using backpacks full of poison that will ultimately get into the blood streams of people who will ultimately die--many of them, tens of thousands a year. That is a case--a compassionate case--for border security.  This is the number that I was talking about earlier: 15,469 deaths in 2016 alone related to heroin. A lot of these are coming across the border. But only about 1.5 percent of all of the drugs that are estimated to come across the border are being seized today. How do you actually increase this seizure rate? You put the resources and authorities in place so that the Border Patrol and Customs and immigration resources down on the border can actually find them, and arrest, charge, convict, and incarcerate the people who are poisoning the men and women and boys and girls in this country.  There is also another thing, and this is something that when I was down on the Texas border just stuck with me. I was on a 7,500-acre ranch, which is really, really small in Texas terms. I was talking with the ranch owner, who said that over the last 10 years, they had actually recovered 100 bodies on this ranch alone. If you do the math, that means they are finding a person who has died trying to come to this country illegally about every six weeks on this small ranch. Over the past 20 years, we have had about 10,000 people die crossing the border, and about 1,000 of them are children.  If we had a secure border, at least we would have the knowledge and the situational awareness to know where these people are so that they don't languish somewhere in the middle of nowhere after they cross the border or after they have paid somebody $1,000, $5,000, or $10,000, in some cases, to carry them across the border. Then, they leave them. They take them across the border and then tell them that Houston is just a few miles away. Well, Houston is an hour-and-a-half plane ride away from where they cross the border.  So we need border security for the protection of people who are making the poor decision to come across. If we have a secure border, it is much less likely that any of them will ever attempt to do it, except for the legal ones. Then there is the other thing that is happening on the other side of the border. The 10,000 people who have died over 20 years are those whom we have identified--I am sure there are many more who we didn't--who were found on U.soil after crossing the border.  One other thing I learned when I was down in Texas is about the criminal actions and the criminal gangs, basically--they call them plazas and cartels--that basically run every mile of the border. If you pass through one of those plazas and you don't pay the toll, you are likely going to die. In one case, there were 72 people who were murdered because the human smuggler failed to pay the plaza bosses the so-called toll when he was supposed to get them across the border. So they ordered the execution of men, women, and children just to send a message. This is one of the many examples that we have.  So there is no question in my mind that of the 10,000 people who have died over the last 20 years on American soil, there were probably thousands or tens of thousands or more who have died in the hopes that they could get across the border.  If we have a secure border and if we work on our immigration systems, we can get for those parents and people who want to come to this country legally an opportunity to get here without harming themselves or harming their children. If that is not a compassionate case for a secure border, I don't know what is.  Now we are in the final stages of trying to negotiate a deal, and Chairman Grassley did a wonderful job of summarizing what we have proposed as a starting position for negotiation with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I hope they will be willing to come to the table and negotiate in good faith and recognize that their approach over the last 16 years has failed. They promised the Dreamers a solution, and they failed to deliver. They have failed to deliver under a Republican administration. They have failed to deliver under President Obama, when they had supermajorities. We are not going to let them fail this time.  Giving the DACA population certainty, coming up with a solution that makes sense, getting a border that is secure, making sure that the poison that is coming across the border and killing tens of thousands of people a year is reduced, is, in my opinion, the scope that we need to negotiate to get to an agreement. If we have Senator Durbin, Senator Bennet, and others who have negotiated portions of the immigration issue open their eyes to the broader opportunity to come up with a balanced policy that addresses the concerns on both sides of the aisle, we can be the Congress and President Trump can be the President who actually solve this problem and, along the way, make it far less likely that it will be another problem for another Congress to solve 10 or 15 years from now and that, then, may take 10 or 15 years to solve.  This will have an enduring impact. This will have a compassionate impact. This will provide certainty to the DACA population. This will allow me to go home and say: I did something meaningful to secure the border and protect our But we have to have people come together and negotiate in good faith. It needs to start this week, and we need to continue it until we come to terms.  People need to be willing to compromise and accept something less than perfect, because everybody's perfect conceptions of what we should do here have all one thing in common: They have all been resounding failures. They have been unkept promises.[[Page S56]]Along the way, our homeland is not as secure as it can be, and people are dying in the process. Hard-working people who are eligible for the DACA Program are uncertain about their future.  So, again, I want to thank Chairman Grassley for his hard work and his leadership and willingness to engage. I want to thank the I was with the President for an hour and a half last week, along with Chairman Grassley and others. We are going to be meeting again in the White House tomorrow. Hopefully, we will be joined by our Democratic colleagues who have been invited to the meeting, and we will negotiate something that makes sense.  Now is the time for us to deliver. The empty promises of the past are insufficient. We need to provide an enduring solution, and an enduring solution is a fair solution for the DACA population and a responsible solution for border security. If we do that, I think we will look at this as something meaningful--something the Presiding Officer and I did when we came in here in 2015.  We got tax reform. That is meaningful.  We have been promising immigration reform forever. This is not all of it. We have more work to do. But this is a big first step, and it requires bipartisanship, compromise, and a genuine commitment to negotiate.  I hope my Democratic colleagues will take the invitation seriously, come to the table, negotiate an agreement we can all be proud of, and we can give the certainty that we should give to the DACA population.  I thank the chairman for the opportunity to speak on this and for his continued leadership on this issue.  ",CREC-2018-01-08-pt1-PgS50-4.txt,2291,LETTER OF RESIGNATION,2018.0,8.0,January

1134,topic-id,747,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity today to be able to advance an important piece of bipartisan legislation. The Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act seeks to bring fairness to the Federal financial regulators' examination appeals process by instituting a uniform framework free from examination retaliation.  Our community banks and credit unions currently have no independent recourse in the appeals process of examination decisions. These institutions often lack the experience, capacity, and resources needed to effectively resolve challenges to Federal financial regulators' examination determinations as each regulator has its own different rules and standards for the appeals process.  Under the current examination appeals framework, appeals of material supervisory determinations, which are decisions of significant consequence that can have serious impact on the financial institution's future, run through the agency that handed down the decision in the first place.                              {time}  1330  Mr.Speaker, that is like asking an arresting police officer to also be the judge and the jury when a case goes to trial.  Put simply, this legislation will move away from that framework and establish an independent office of review to address appeals of serious consequence, and harmonize and consolidate the appeals process across the various Federal regulators so that the review process is fair and predictable.  One banker in Colorado put it to me this way: ``The Dodd-Frank Act has added complexity and uncertainty to the entire exam process and to the bank's ability to serve its customers confidently and in full compliance of regulations.''  He continues: ``For instance, overlap between the OCC and CFPB is an ongoing issue. The OCC lost regulatory oversight with the Dodd-Frank Act and the foundation of the CFPB, especially in the fair lending world. When the CFPB made it clear they were not going to examine the banks over $10 billion on fair lending the way that the OCC had historically done it, the OCC started expanding the way that they assessed a bank's Compliance Management Program to add questions about fair lending, including transaction sampling and testing. It creates a very burdensome environment as well as duplication and the risk of double jeopardy.''  Mr.Speaker, an examination environment that runs the risk of duplication and double jeopardy between agencies isn't tenable and puts our community institutions at risk of being examined into extinction.  This environment is further complicated by the reality that, currently, institutions that want to appeal double jeopardy examination results would have to appeal through two regulators who likely aren't communicating with one another about the other's exam determinations.  The Examination Fairness bill before the House today would solve this problem by establishing an Office of Independent Examination Review, which would function as a consolidated, sober judge of the examination appeals process. This newly created office under the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council would provide a community bank or credit union an avenue[[Page H1628]]for independent recourse to appeal a material supervisory determination where fairness, transparency, and timeliness are paramount. Because this new review process only applies to material supervisory determinations, the new process is limited in scope and reserved only for the most serious appeals.  This legislation is also careful not to constrain the power of the regulators to pursue enforcement actions or to prevent them from issuing a further material supervisory determination. In fact, enforcement actions resulting from a determination would continue to be enforced under this new appeals process until the independent office either agrees with the finding of the regulator or overturns a determination of the regulator.  Mr.Speaker, by creating consistency; instituting timeline expectations of examinations and appeals; increasing transparency; and adding independent, sober review of appeals to the rights of the financial institutions, H.4545 will go a long way to usher in a new environment of fairness in the examination appeals process for small banks and credit unions. Giving these institutions independent recourse in the appeals process will create greater certainty that they won't have to reduce their financial service product offerings because of an unfair or untimely review.  Mr.Speaker, that translates to greater assurances for communities across the country that their small banks and credit unions will be able to provide a mortgage for their home, a loan for their car, and capital for their small businesses to be able to grow.  This measure passed out of the Financial Services Committee with strong bipartisan support, with a majority of our Democrat colleagues joining with us to be able to support exam fairness.

1297,topic-id,689,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling for his leadership on this issue, as well, and for considering this bipartisan legislation today.  Mr.Speaker, the ever-growing burden and complexity of financial regulations is creating an environment of difficult choices for community banks and credit unions. Often, they must choose to incur the costs of complying with a regulation or cease to offer the financial product the regulation modifies. Whatever choice these community institutions make, it is the local consumer and the local economy that loses.  Burdensome regulations drive up the costs of financial products and limit choices for consumers, which decreases a community's access to financial products and services that help their families to be able to buy their first home, to help small businesses grow.  In districts like mine in Colorado, that amounts to real economic impact, especially in towns where the community bank or credit union on the corner is the only true access to credit that the community has.                              {time}  1615  When smaller institutions are unable to absorb the costs of additional compliance, it is the small towns across America that are disproportionately affected.  As one banker from Colorado recently wrote me: We have seen time and again the impact of this regulatory environment consume many hours and resources of our compliance, credit, and audit teams despite the relatively simple business model that we follow.  Mr.Speaker, that is why the bipartisan TAILOR Act's consideration on the floor today is so important. The TAILOR Act directs the Federal financial regulators to take into account the risk profile and business model of institutions as they develop new regulations, making them more targeted, more deliberate. The TAILOR Act also instructs regulators to weigh the impact that new regulatory burdens will have on smaller institutions, meaning real relief from compliance burdens for banks and credit unions.  To put the impact of regulations into perspective, the Dodd-Frank Act alone created 400 new rules and came with 30,000 pages of explanation. In my travels across Colorado, I have heard far too often that community institutions have been forced to stop making home loans or loans to small businesses because they can't afford to hire more employees to manage the added compliance paperwork.  The TAILOR Act would make sure that the compliance burdens are considered when new regulations are made so that community financial institutions won't have to choose between the needs of their communities and complying with regulations out of Washington, D.Community banks and credit unions need to be able to prioritize their customers and the needs of their communities instead of prioritizing compliance with heavy-handed regulations.  One community banker from Colorado brought this into focus when he wrote me saying: Providing a real-time view of risk and continual review of such a risk applicable to each financial institution allows regulators to direct their attention to developing issues that could have the most damaging effect. With the number of financial institutions declining to historically low levels, the redeployment of focus based on complexity makes sense.  Mr.Speaker, in Colorado, mortgages haven't been made, loans to expand small businesses have been denied, retirees and recently employed workers have been turned away, and relationships between community bankers and their neighbors have been discarded. The one-size-fits-all approach to regulating the financial services industry has resulted in decreased access to much-needed credit.  America is now in a position to be able to address this. The trickle-down effect of regulation intended to respond to the culpable actions of the big banks after the 2008 financial crisis is harming Main Street and the ability of everyday Americans to be able to realize their financial goals. Directing the regulators to refocus their regulations will help Americans start achieving their goals once again.  Once more, the regulators themselves have acknowledged the need for tailored regulations. Both Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Powell have acknowledged the significant need for a return to common sense in the financial regulatory landscape. Mr.Speaker, the TAILOR Act, which passed out of the Financial Services Committee with broad bipartisan support, does just that.  Mr.Speaker, I would again like to thank Chairman Hensarling for considering this measure here today.

1657,topic-id,548,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.Buck) for the time, and I appreciate consideration of the rule here today.  Mr.Speaker, both of the bills being considered under this rule amount to real relief for our Nation's community banks and credit unions.  H.1116, the TAILOR Act, which passed out of committee with bipartisan support, will direct Federal financial regulators to tailor their regulations to the risk profile and business model of our institutions, meaning that regulation intended for the largest financial institutions will no longer burden the smallest of our institutions.  Our community banks and credit unions have long suffered the consequences and costs of complying with extensive heavyhanded and onerous regulations. They were created after the 2008 financial crisis. While many of these regulations are necessary for financial institutions of all sizes, many are not.  Complying with manifold regulations has significantly hampered the ability of our community institutions to offer credit to small businesses, help families get a mortgage, and extend loans to retirees and the recently employed. As one community banker wrote to me: ``We have seen time and again the impact of this regulatory environment consume many hours and resources of our compliance, credit, and audit teams despite the relatively simple business model we follow.''  By requiring financial regulators to consider the cost of compliance on smaller institutions as well as whether or not a regulation is necessary for an institution based on the size and risk profile of that institution, the TAILOR Act will go a long way to alleviate the burden of heavy regulation on our community banks. In turn, this will lead to renewed economic growth for our local communities that rely heavily on the presence of community banks and credit unions in their own hometowns.  The other bill being considered under this rule, H.4545, which also came out of committee with bipartisan support, the Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act, will provide certainty for community banks and credit unions that they will have independent recourse should a bank examination result in a determination that they disagree with.  If a bank or a credit union receives an examination decision that it finds unfavorable, the only recourse it has under the current structure is to appeal that decision directly to the same regulator that arrived at that decision in the first place. The Exam Fairness bill included in this rule will change that reality by creating a new Office of Independent Examination Review that will serve as an independent appeals office, providing banks and credit unions with uniform and predictable avenues to appeal examination determinations of significant consequence.  At this independent office, sober review of the agency's determination, transparency, and timeliness will be paramount, meaning that financial institutions will no longer have to wade through long delays in their appeals process and will no longer have to fear retaliation from a financial regulator because they appealed the examination results. Mr.Speaker, this amounts to new assurances to community banks and credit unions that they will have fair recourse in the examination process should they disagree with an examiner's findings.  I would like to thank the Speaker for advancing this rule.  I urge my colleagues to support the rule so that our community banks and credit unions can realize real relief.

1080,topic-id,2635,"Mr.President, I want to address two issues today. One, briefly, is the issue of guns about which many of our Democratic colleagues have come down to speak. Then I want to speak about the financial services regulatory reform bill we will be voting on later today.[[Page S1719]]                              Gun Legislation  Mr.President, first, on the former topic, a number of our Democratic colleagues have been down here, and we have heard a real passion and concern about the victims of gun violence in our country. I certainly understand and respect their passion. I have spent a lot of time working to find sensible measures that will help address this in ways that do not infringe on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. It does feel like we are at a somewhat different moment here, so I hope we can choose to get something done--something constructive--and stop talking past each other and find where there is common ground. I suggest four steps by which we ought to be able to find reasonable consensus in the Senate, ought to be able to get to 60 votes, and be able to at least modestly make some progress in this space.  One is a bill that has been introduced by Senators Cornyn and Murphy, a bipartisan bill that is called Fix The fact is, our background check system is only as good as the data that is in the system, and we have an inconsistent quality of data. The data is provided, generally, by the Some States provide excellent, comprehensive, up-to-date data--other States, not so much. The Cornyn-Murphy bill would encourage better compliance and better data from the Better data means we would have a better NICS system.  A second piece of legislation is a bill I have introduced with Senator Coons, and the sort of nickname for this legislation is ``Lie and Try.'' Our legislation would make it possible for more States to prosecute people who commit felonies when they attempt to purchase firearms; that is to say, it is those people who knowingly lie about their own criminal backgrounds--who deny their criminal histories--in the hope that they will be able to somehow circumvent the NICS system and buy firearms. It actually happens every day in America that convicted felons, who obviously know they are convicted felons, deny that and attempt to buy firearms they are not entitled to.  Our legislation would simply require the FBI, when it discovers that someone has committed this sort of felony, to inform the law enforcement in the State from which that person comes so the State would be able to prosecute, if it would choose to. It is only about enforcing the laws on the books. I often hear from my friends who are Second Amendment supporters, as I am, that we ought to do a better job of enforcing the laws on the books. This is an opportunity to do exactly that.  A third opportunity for us is to recognize that the people whom we deem to be so dangerous that we will not allow them to fly on planes--the people on a terrorist watch list who could show up at airports with valid IDs and boarding passes, and we will not let them get on a plane as we think they are that dangerous--should also not be allowed to walk into gun stores and buy firearms. Senator Collins and Senator Heitkamp have introduced legislation. I am a cosponsor of it. It states that if someone is so dangerous that we believe them to be a terrorist and we won't let them fly, then we also will preclude them from legally buying a firearm.  Lastly, Manchin-Toomey is legislation that Senator Manchin and I introduced some years ago, and the idea behind this legislation is simply to require a background check on commercial gun sales. Whether they occur at a gun show or over the internet, these commercial-scale transactions ought to be subject to a background check so that we can determine whether the prospective buyer is somebody who we all agree shouldn't have a firearm--a dangerously mentally ill person, someone who has committed a violent criminal act, someone who is otherwise simply disqualified from having a firearm. The only way we can actually achieve that is if we have some mechanism to determine whether a person is disqualified in this fashion. So Senator Manchin and I have legislation that will do that without infringing on the absolutely essential constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.  These four items would be very constructive--fix NICS, ``Lie and Try'' legislation, a ``No Fly, No Buy'' bill, and the Manchin-Toomey legislation. I hope we are going to make some progress in this space, and those would be candidates for doing so.  Mr.President, let me shift to 2155, the legislation we will be voting on later today. This legislation is long overdue.  Let me be very clear about this. The financial crisis we experienced is a decade behind us now. The Dodd-Frank financial services regulatory bill--a massive construct that wildly overregulates financial services--was signed into law 8 years ago, and we have done nothing really meaningful to roll that back over these last 8 years.  This bill is the result of years of bipartisan work, an untold number of hearings, and an extraordinary amount of testimony, and now we have a product that we are going to, I hope, pass later today to begin to roll back some of this excessive regulation.  I thank all the Democratic and Republican Members who worked to get this product to where it is today. Senator Shelby, when he was chairman of the Banking Committee, laid much of the groundwork for this. Chairman Hensarling in the House, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has done great work in this space. Of course, Chairman Crapo, as chairman, has done an outstanding job.  We are at a point where we are very close to finally making some progress on this overregulation.  I will disclose up front that I have my own personal experience and bias in this space, having worked with a great group of men and women in eastern Pennsylvania and western New We launched a community bank back in 2005, and it was an amazing experience, a great experience. It was a very successful bank.  Back in 2005 when we launched, I was shocked to learn how heavily regulated a small, tiny, startup, brandnew community bank was. It seemed to me that we needed permission from the regulators to change the color of the drapes in the lobby of the bank, and this was all before Dodd-Frank was passed. Dodd-Frank came along several years later and made things much, much worse--way too prescriptive, way too much discretion of power in the hands of regulators, a terrible trickle-down effect whereby extensive regulations that were purportedly meant to constrain large financial institutions also imposed huge costs on small banks. We have gotten to the point where, arguably, small banks are now too small to succeed.  Thirty years ago we had 14,000 banks in America, and today we have fewer than 5,000. The trend toward consolidation in banking was underway before Dodd-Frank, but Dodd-Frank dramatically worsened it. One data point makes it very clear. Before the financial crisis, before Dodd-Frank came along, we used to routinely launch, on average, over 100 banks per year across It was an ordinary thing for a group of business folks to come together and decide they were going to launch a bank to serve their community. It is a great thing when people do that because it introduces new competition, new choices for consumers, and new access to capital. There were over 100 per year routinely for decades. From the time that Dodd-Frank was passed up through to this year, we have had five new banks start up in We have completely destroyed the entire de novo banking industry, and there is a price for that. There is a price to communities, there is a higher cost of credit, there is less available capital, and that doesn't serve anyone well.  Our legislation, this bill we are going to vote on later today, is going to improve the overall regulatory environment. At the same time, it is going to make improvements for consumers. Let me touch on a few of the features.  One is designed to improve access to mortgage credit. Section 101 of the bill provides regulatory relief for financial institutions if they originate a mortgage and keep that mortgage on their portfolio.  When a financial institution originates a mortgage and sells it, which is a very common practice, there is this sense that the financial institution doesn't care about the borrower's ability to repay. It happens not to be true, but there are very, very extensive regulations that are very onerous, and they make it more difficult for borrowers to meet the criteria that are acceptable. Well, if the bank is keeping the loan on[[Page S1720]]its own books, then it should be obvious to everyone that the bank has every incentive to make sure the loan is made to someone who can repay it. So this section provides some relief and some more flexibility so that the bank can actually make a loan that works for that consumer rather than one that works for whatever bureaucrats have decided.  Section 107 allows relief from some of the regulations in the manufactured housing space. It is based on legislation that I introduced with Senator This will help consumers who are using manufactured housing, which is one of the most affordable ways of having a home.  There are consumer protections like section 301, which protects consumers' credit by giving consumers greater control over their credit reports.  There is section 302, which protects veterans' credit by helping prevent medical debt from improperly harming a veteran's credit report.  There is help for community banks--the very small banks that are not systemically important to their neighborhood, much less the entire economy. They are wildly overregulated. This diminishes that burden modestly. It simplifies, for instance, their capital requirements.  Section 202 exempts very small community banks from the Volcker rule. Why would we need to exempt them from it? Not so they can engage in the proprietary trading or the kinds of investments that the Volcker rule precludes, but it recognizes that community banks don't do that anyway. They have never done that. They end up, instead, having to spend a whole lot of money proving that they don't do that which they have never done. It doesn't make any sense. This regulation relieves them of some of that burden.  Section 210 will allow very small banks to have a little bit more time between the onerous exams they are subject to periodically. It is still very onerous, but at least there is some relief here.  There is a change in how we treat bank holding companies. We have, unfortunately, as a result of Dodd-Frank, this concept of too big to fail. We have enshrined it in law by creating what we call SIFIs, or systemically important financial institutions. These are officially designated ``too big to fail.''  Frankly, no institution should be too big to fail, but it happens under Dodd-Frank automatically when a bank hits $50 billion. That is a ridiculously low threshold, so this bill takes that automatic SIFI designation up to $250 billion. Frankly, it shouldn't be automatically based on the size of the institution; it should be driven by the conduct of the institution, the kind of business they do. But at least we are raising the threshold from $50 billion to $250 billion.  By the way, this is problematic, actually, for banks that are a little larger than $250 billion. They still have this onerous, complex, expensive regime that they have to comply with, while their competitors, which might be just a few billion dollars smaller, are relieved of this burden. So there is an unfairness in this. I intend to work with regulators to basically have this SIFI designation reflect the activity of the institution rather than just the size.  There is another provision, section 402, which deals with the supplementary leverage ratio, which goes by the acronym The SLR is basically a minimum capital ratio. It takes a look at the entire balance sheet of a bank and says: Regardless of what those assets consist of, we are going to have a minimum capital requirement. That, of course, is in addition to all the specific capital requirements that are associated with the various category of assets. That whole regulatory regime remains in place, so we have both simultaneously.  This legislation has a very, very narrow exception for this secondary SLR capital requirement. It simply holds that for those handful--there are really only three custody banks, banks that have as their principal activity the custody of securities for other financial institutions. When they take custody-related cash and they put it on deposit with the Fed or another central bank, that is a risk-free transaction. There is no risk to an American bank having a dollar-denominated deposit with the Fed; therefore, this legislation recognizes that you should not have to be hit with an additional capital requirement for such a transaction. That is a constructive feature.  Some have mischaracterized this and suggested that, oh my goodness, we could have deposits with the Turkish central bank or the Greek central bank. That is clearly factually wrong. The criteria for eligibility is very, very narrow, and it is only at the most secure central banks in the world, and by the way, mostly it is the  A quick additional word about this too-big-to-fail doctrine. I feel very strongly that no institution should be too big to fail, and no institution should get a taxpayer bailout. Some of my colleagues seem to agree with that and have been very critical of a bailout that would occur for a financial institution.  I would suggest that the best way to avoid taxpayers having to bail out a financial institution is not to attempt to prescribe every conceivable activity through massive regulation but, rather, have a bankruptcy code that allows the failure to be resolved in bankruptcy. The people who should be wiped out in the event of a failure of a financial institution are the shareholders and unsecured creditors, not taxpayers.  So for those of my colleagues who have come down here and expressed great concern about potential bailouts, join me in my legislation, which adds a chapter to the Bankruptcy Code so that we can successfully resolve even a very large and complex financial institution where we should, which is in bankruptcy, and not pose a risk to American taxpayers. Senator Cornyn and I have legislation that would do that. It really, over time, can completely end the debacle of too big to fail, and that would be a very constructive development as well.  Let me conclude by saying that this bill, 2155, which is called the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, is very aptly named. The goals expressed in the title are actually achieved in this legislation. I am confident we will make progress on all of these fronts if and when--and I think we will--we pass this legislation later today.  I certainly urge my colleagues to support this, but my last plea is that this not be the last word on financial regulatory reform. This is a constructive step in the right direction, but it is a modest step forward. Much more needs to be done if we are going to have a safe but robust competitive financial system that is capable of fueling the economic growth that our economy is capable of.  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The assistant Democratic leader.

1825,topic-id,1492,"Mr.President, I would like to say how glad I am to have Senator Menendez back in the saddle as our ranking member on Foreign Relations, and I thank him so much for his speech and for his leadership on our very important committee.  I join my colleagues from the Foreign Relations Committee in their critique of President Trump's handling--or maybe we would call it mishandling--of foreign policy. I am most concerned about how U.power, prestige, and diplomacy have been weakened across the world as a direct result of this The United States has stood as a world leader of liberal democracy, the rule of law, and human values since the end of World War Our actions abroad have not always been perfect, but over the decades, we have earned the world's respect because we have acted on our principles.  After the fall of the Berlin Wall, authoritarian regimes were in retreat. Today, authoritarianism is back on the march. The President himself even cheers them on, praising Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, and others who fashion themselves President for life of one-party, repressive regimes.  In this President's short but raucous and chaotic tenure, he has diminished our standing within the world community by grossly offending other nations and their leaders, including many of our closest allies, by abruptly changing foreign policy with no clear policy basis, and by denigrating countries and an entire continent with comments laced with racism. The President issues conflicting messages. World leaders and international diplomats cannot rely on his word or his tweets. He has plenty of criticism for our friends and allies but little for strongmen like Vladimir The world is alarmed. It is less stable under this  Secretary Tillerson had disagreements with the President, and early on, the President undercut and sidelined him. The day before Mr.Tillerson was shown the door, the Secretary broke with the White House by directly pointing the finger at Russia for using a chemical weapon on the ex-British spy in his homeland, and this incident shows that the President will not tolerate daylight between his own corrupt[[Page S1820]]political beliefs and the views of his lieutenants.  During confirmation hearings for Mr.Pompeo, our committee must find out whether he will hold fast to traditional American values or bend to the President's servility to Vladimir Putin and other autocrats around the world.  The President's own diplomacy has been chaotic and dangerous. He has alienated one of our closest friends and biggest trading partners--the country of He insists that Mexico will pay for this offensive wall that he says is necessary to keep out rapists and criminals.  The President has imperiled our relationships with both Mexico and Canada with his threats to tear up NAFTA, which he seems to say over and over again. In my home State of New Mexico, border communities rely on the integrated border, and border communities rely on the economy that has been built up over the last 24 years. We have a trade surplus with NAFTA negotiations continue, but there has been a chill on economic activity in States like New Mexico, Texas, California, and  The President has shaken the world with his grade-school taunts about nuclear weapons--a deadly serious subject. He chided Secretary Tillerson that talking to North Korea won't work, undercutting the Secretary once again, and then suddenly agreed to meet and even negotiate with Kim Jong Un without the careful diplomatic work needed to ensure success. I support diplomacy as the best solution, but rash diplomacy can easily lead to rash wars, and impulsive decisionmaking is extremely risky.  I hope the President seriously studies the issues between now and any meeting, brings an experienced team, and sets realistic and achievable goals for any negotiation. He must understand that diplomatic failure is potentially catastrophic. A war would likely result in 20,000 casualties a day in the opening week, and Secretary Mattis has warned that there would be, in his words, ``the worst kind of fighting in people's lifetimes.''  I do not trust this President to follow the constitutional process required to go to war. That is why I am cosponsoring 2047, prohibiting any President from launching a preemptive strike on North Starting a war with North Korea would only undermine the security of the United States and our regional allies and should not be done without approval of the American people through the  The President's attitude toward Russia and Vladimir Putin complicates our ability to gain support for our efforts overseas. Russia interfered with our democracy and continues to interfere in the affairs of our allies.  There is no good explanation why he has not directed our Nation's security agencies to take all possible action in response to Russia's interference with the 2016 election, and increasingly we see in the special counsel's investigation how Russia is playing a bigger and bigger part. There is no reason why this administration took so long to begin to implement Congress's sanctions against Special Counsel Mueller's investigation has already produced indictments against Russians and key officials from President Trump's campaign, but the President himself does not send the message to deter future interference by The President's failure to fight back, his resistance to sanctioning the Russians, and his subservience to Putin betray the national trust.  The President's hostility toward Iran's agreement to disarm its nuclear weapons program is mind-boggling. Director Pompeo reportedly shares this hostility. But just last week, the commander of U.Central Command, Army GEN Joseph Votel, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Iran deal is in our national interest. Defense Secretary Mattis and the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, Joseph Dunford, also agree. Our close allies--also signatories to the deal--agree it is in the international community's interests.  This is not the United States the world has come to know, rely upon, and believe in. The President's failure to protect our national interest weakens our position within the world community.  Morale at the State Department is suffering as our foreign policy suffers. Any new Secretary of State must work to reverse this. This Congress and the world have watched as the President and the Secretary of State have hollowed out the State  Highly experienced and talented Foreign Service officers have been fired, pushed out, reassigned to menial tasks, and ignored. Many senior diplomats have just packed up and left. Nicholas Burns and Ryan Crocker, who served as Ambassadors in both Republican and Democratic administrations, have warned that ``we are witnessing the most significant departure of diplomatic talent in generations.'' On top of retirements, the number of people who took the Foreign Service exam dropped by more than half between 2016 and 2017. There is real concern that this will have a lasting and negative impact long after the Trump administration.  Director Pompeo will need to answer tough questions during confirmation: Will he impose congressionally mandated sanctions on Russia? What actions will be taken to counter Russia's ongoing cyber warfare? We are on the razor's edge with North As chief diplomat, does he support a preemptive strike against North Korea? What will he do to avoid a disaster? Does he agree with our military leaders about staying in the Iran denuclearization deal? Will he certify Iranian compliance if the facts show compliance? Does he support the President's proposal to decimate the State Department's budget? Will he continue Secretary Tillerson's plan to decrease staff by 8 percent? What will he do to recover agency morale, which we hear over and over is at an alltime low? Will he stand up to this President when long-held American values are at stake?  Director Pompeo will need to prove to the Senate that he will put the State Department and the U.standing in the world back on track. Our international partners do not view the United States as the reliable and strong partner they had in the past. Dictatorships and harsh regimes are emboldened by our lack of attention to free speech and human rights.  President Ronald Reagan said at the Berlin Wall that ``the totalitarian world produces backwardness because it does such violence to the spirit, thwarting the human impulse to create, to enjoy, to worship.''  Dictators now smirk and echo our President, saying ``fake news'' about any news outlet that shines a light on their indiscretions. Leaders like Vladimir Putin are emboldened to continue to try to undermine our democracy and sow conflict and division within the American public.  The world is less stable without a strong, principled United States to lead. It is imperative that the United States preserve and strengthen its diplomatic power, not sabotage it.  With lack of leadership in the executive branch, Congress must step up, particularly the Senate Foreign Relations As I said at the beginning, I am so pleased that Senator Menendez is back to work with Senator Corker to try to assert the role that Congress should be playing in these very important issues.

1378,topic-id,741,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, energy efficiency can provide benefits for consumers, for job-creating businesses, for energy security, and for the environment, but we have got to make sure that it is done right; and that is why I support 2030, Ceiling Fan Energy Conservation Harmonization Act, which was sponsored by my good friend from North Carolina, Richard Hudson, and certainly has strong bipartisan cosponsorship, including Mr.Carter, Mr.Rush, Mr.Peters, and Mr. Mr.Speaker, I would urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.  As most of you know, ceiling fans often come with lights attached, thus, they serve two purposes for consumers. The Department of Energy regulates the energy efficiency of both the ceiling fans and the ceiling fan lights, and stringent new standards are scheduled to take effect in the next 2 years; but for some reason, DOE set the deadline for the ceiling fan light kits in 2019, while the ceiling fan standard deadline is in 2020.  This bill, 2030, would take the logical step of aligning the compliance deadlines for ceiling fans and ceiling fan light kits so that they both occur in 2020. This should ease the compliance burden for some manufacturers, make things easier for retailers, and may help lower the costs, in fact, for all consumers.  Although ceiling fan regulations may not be a front-burner issue, we ought to make sure that we take every opportunity to streamline Federal regs and help keep compliance costs down. That is why I would urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this, what I would consider, noncontroversial bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of 2030, the Ceiling Fan Energy Conservation Harmonization  Mr.Speaker, I agree with the chairman on this issue. It is bipartisan, and we are going to go ahead and do this law right.  Now, 2030 is essentially identical to H.3477, legislation introduced by my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr.Hudson and Mr.The purpose of the legislation is to align the current 2019 compliance deadline for ceiling fan light kit standards with a separate standard for ceiling fans set for 2020.  2030 essentially extends the compliance deadline for the rule amending the standards for ceiling fan light kits by just over 1 year to January 21, 2020, so they can both occur at the same time.  The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, required the Department of Energy to put in place efficiency standards for ceiling light kits. The DOE has determined that increasing efficiency standards for ceiling fan light kits would conserve energy more, while being economically feasible. The DOE finally put forth the standard that, as stated previously, would take effect in January of next year. However, because the DOE did not meet the statutory deadline for promulgating a ceiling fan lighting kit standard, certain backstop requirements have been triggered that would be vitiated by the new regulations.  Some have raised questions as to whether the enactment of this legislation would result in an extension of portions of these backstop requirements. I think it is important for manufacturers that we respond to this question, and it is my intent, later on in this debate, to enter into a colloquy with the chairman in order to provide direction to the DOE and make clear Congress' intent with regard to this matter.  New standards for these kits will save money and reduce carbon emissions, and I believe the sooner they are in place, the better for consumers and for our environment.  Having said that, the bill is not opposed by any environmental, community, or consumer groups. Perhaps this is because it is sensible legislation that will greatly help retailers by eliminating unnecessary burdens for sellers of the products, while only minimally delaying new standards.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to have a brief colloquy with Mr.Upton, the chairman of the Subcommittee on  As I understand the purpose of 2030, it is to delay the January 7, 2019, compliance deadline for the latest ceiling fan light kit efficiency standard so as to align it with the January 21, 2020, compliance deadline for ceiling fans overall. Thus the efficiency standards for ceiling fans and for ceiling fan lights will go into force at the same time on January 21, 2020. Is that correct?

Mr.Mr.Speaker, again reclaiming my time. I thank the chairman and acknowledge that correction.  I understand that, in preparation for ceiling fan light kit standards going into effect in January 2019, many manufacturers have already switched production and produced kits without the device that limits total lamp consumption to 190 watts or less.  Lighting manufacturers have informed me that the limiting device has been a major source of product failure and that, due to the vast gains in lightbulb technology and a huge drop in the price of highly efficient bulbs, it is no longer necessary to have such a device to keep consumption low.  Unfortunately, because the limiter requirement is tied by statute to the date of enactment of the new standard, technically this bill that is designed to ease regulatory burdens may inadvertently extend for an additional year the 190-watt limiter requirement.

1384,topic-id,305,"Mr.Speaker, the gentleman is correct.  I, too, have heard from lighting manufacturers, and I sympathize with the concerns asserted by them regarding potential unintended consequences.  The intent of this bill, and, for that matter, my intent, is to keep the compliance deadline for changes to the 190-watt limiter requirement at January 7, 2019.  We now know that the limiter requirement adds to the cost to consumers, it can compromise ceiling fan reliability, and is no longer needed to meet efficiency standards. The final rule that included the ceiling fan light kit standards also provided that the 190-watt limiter requirement is deemed to be met by any product that complies with the new efficiency standards.  The bottom line is that the 190-watt limiter should no longer be required beginning on January 7, 2019. This bill, 2030, seeks to delay the ceiling fan light kit compliance deadline only, but not to delay the change to the 190-watt limiter requirement.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the chairman for confirming that the provisions[[Page H1661]]of 2030 are not intended to delay the change to the 190-watt limiter requirement.  Mr.Speaker, I believe ceiling fan lighting kit manufacturers have acted in good faith in the run-up to the change in the standard and that they should not be penalized for producing light kits without the 190-watt limiting device.  In my view, DOE should take whatever steps are necessary to revise its rules to allow these otherwise compliant kits to be sold and should take no enforcement actions against manufacturers solely because a kit fails to include the 190-watt limiting device.  That doesn't mean the Department should stop all enforcement to ensure compliance with standards for these kits, but it should specifically forgo action against companies for failing to include a limiting device.  Mr.Speaker, I ask if the chairman shares my view.  ",CREC-2018-03-19-pt1-PgH1659-9.txt,1177,SUPPORTING THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE OF IRAN TO FREE EXPRESSION,2018.0,19.0,March

In recent years, the volume of air travel has steadily risen, with 42 million people traveling domestically in the last days of 2017 alone. Last year, the worldwide number of people flying rose to a historic high of 4 billion passengers.  The high visibility of the aviation sector makes it a persistent target for terrorists who wish to carry out attacks and inflict harm upon U.citizens. As such, the TSA must continue to collaborate with stakeholders and better incorporate proven security tools into security operations. One of the tools that we know to be effective is canine detection teams, particularly in detecting and protecting against explosive threats.  In a May 2017 hearing before the Committee on Homeland Security last year, the Director of the Threat Assessment Division within the Transportation Security Administration attested to the value of aviation screening canine teams, saying: ``Canines are incredibly effective. They can do things we can't even measure with machines.''  The legislation before us today, H.4577, would require the TSA to establish a working group of stakeholders to determine ways to develop a domestic canine breeding network to produce explosives detection canines and modernize canine training standards.  Today, the demand for trained and certified dogs is huge, with more and more security stakeholders coming to appreciate the explosive detection capabilities of our four-legged friends. This heightened demand has led to a shortage, presenting challenges for the U.Government in the procurement of suitable canines.  In testimony before the committee, the TSA and various stakeholders have cited these challenges and expressed concern regarding how to best address this shortage. That is why this legislation is so important.  The working group mandated in this legislation draws from authorities on explosives detection canines and homeland security missions, including the Transportation Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate, national domestic canine associations, academic experts, and domestic canine breeders and vendors.  The knowledge and expertise offered by this diverse group of representatives will ensure that the DHS can implement an effective and impactful strategy to further the development of explosives detection canine teams.  For these reasons, Madam Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgH32-4.txt,1184,2045,2018.0,9.0,January

Canines have become an invaluable asset to the DHS in fulfilling its many important missions and goals.  Even prior to the inception of the Department, canines were utilized by law enforcement and first responder agencies for decades, proving to be one of the most effective and versatile tools in detecting threats and protecting the homeland.  Terrorists are working hard to exploit vulnerabilities in our transportation system, and the U.must utilize all of our available resources to combat these threats. Canines are undoubtedly one such resource, providing a robust and reliable layer of security and giving Americans peace of mind.  If enacted, H.4577 would better position the TSA to achieve and maintain a reliable supply of canines to deploy to not only airport terminals, but also to cargo operations and mass transit systems.

The CBP's National Targeting Center, or NTC, uses the latest technology and analytical tools to identify threats and share that information with both domestic and international law enforcement partners.  The CBP vets foreign nationals traveling to the United States prior to arrival through the use of various sophisticated screening techniques. Time and again, we see terrorist acts carried out by individuals who were not on the Federal radar for terrorism.  In the 17 years since the September 11 attacks, we have made huge investments in this country in intelligence to better connect the dots about those risks.  My legislation seeks to ensure that the NTC is positioned to continue embedding its analysts in overseas operations so that individuals associated with terrorist and transnational criminal networks are prevented from operating with impunity.  H.4578 authorizes the NTC to continue building its collaborative intelligence and law enforcement partnerships to stay one step ahead of those individuals who wish to do us harm or commit other criminal acts.  The bill also authorizes CBP personnel to be posted abroad to perform critical preemptive operations to make sure the travelers and visa petitioners coming to our country are thoroughly screened and vetted.  Mr.Speaker, it is imperative for the DHS and its law enforcement partners to do everything practicable to screen and vet individuals before they arrive at our borders.  H.4578 underscores this imperative by authorizing the CBP to counter terrorist and criminal networks' efforts to infiltrate our borders in a way that has proven effective and adaptive.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.4578.  In closing, H.4578 is a bipartisan bill that was unanimously approved by the Committee on Homeland Security late last year.  The partnerships that the CBP has established to disrupt and dismantle terrorists and other criminal networks are valuable and merit congressional support.  H.4578 provides the CBP with statutory authority to continue these partnerships and it enables CBP personnel to be posted within different Federal and international entities in furtherance of their antiterrorism and homeland security missions.

Madam Speaker, the DHS Overseas Personnel Enhancement Act of 2017 would require the Department of Homeland Security to submit to Congress an overseas personnel assessment and enhancement plan.  Today, roughly 2,000 DHS personnel have been deployed to more than 70 countries around the world. These DHS employees are involved in a diverse range of overseas operations targeted at terrorism prevention, counternarcotics, and preventing human smuggling.  I am particularly interested in the efforts of the National Targeting Center, which is housed within U.Customs and Border Protection, to embed intelligence analysts in overseas information sharing operations with international partners to prevent terrorist and other criminal networks from carrying out attacks and criminal operations with impunity.  In fact, in a short while, the House will be debating H.4578, the Counter Terrorist Network Act, which, among other things, authorizes overseas deployments from the  About half of overseas DHS personnel are from the CBP and are involved, among other things, in screening U.S.-bound passengers at airports, inspecting cargo being loaded on ships bound for the U.S., and training other nations' customs and border force.  Additionally, the DHS also assigns Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agents, Secret Service special agents, and Transportation Security Administration officials to overseas posts to engage with international partners on counterterrorism, counternarcotics, information sharing, and criminal investigations, as well as security screening and vetting programs.  Just last month, CBP personnel were credited with helping Ecuadoran authorities interdict and arrest seven people and 800 pounds of cocaine. Specifically, a CBP team participating in an aerial surveillance mission in drug transit zones near South America tracked a low-flying aircraft that intelligence reports indicated had not filed a flight plan and, with a long-lens camera, snapped images of the plane's tail number and other identifying details and radioed Ecuador who were waiting when the plane landed to arrest the smugglers.                              {time}  1245  According to CBP, its P-3 plane program patrols more than 42 million square miles in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and the Pacific Ocean and last year contributed to 145 drug seizures, helping American and foreign authorities capture a combined 34,108 pounds of marijuana and 193,197 pounds of cocaine, according to Customs and Border Protection records.  More broadly, DHS personnel stationed overseas make important contributions to the Department's efforts in securing the homeland and keeping the American people safe. As such, it is imperative that these individuals are utilized efficiently and effectively. This bill seeks to ensure just that.  In 2016, Congress enacted legislation that the Committee on Homeland Security, on a bipartisan basis, approved to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue a strategy for the Department's international programs.  Among other things, the law required DHS to provide the committee with an inventory of personnel and resources deployed abroad and a 3-year, risk-based strategy to ensure strategic overseas employment of personnel.  The statutory deadline for this strategy was June 2017, 7 months ago. This critical strategy has not been submitted to Congress, as mandated.  H.4567 incorporates an amendment from Ranking Member Thompson that expands the bill's briefing requirement to include information on efforts to implement the strategy. Enactment of this bipartisan legislation should help enhance the effectiveness of DHS personnel at foreign locations.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.4561, the Security Assessment Feasibility for Equipment Testing and Evaluation of Capabilities for Our Homeland Act, and I encourage my colleagues to support its passage, which would require the Department of Homeland Security to develop a new, third-party testing program for Transportation Security Administration screening technology.  We have heard, time and time again, from vendors that it takes far too long to get their technologies through TSA testing processes. TSA's testing and evaluation must be improved not simply to improve management efficiency, but to address the constantly evolving threat landscape.  In November, TSA Administrator David Pekoske testified before the Committee on Homeland Security about the need to accelerate deployment of innovative security enhancements, as terrorist groups are becoming more sophisticated. These bad actors are learning about our aviation security countermeasures and have even gone so far as to post instructions to build devices to evade screening technologies on the internet.                              {time}  1300  As terrorist and criminal organizations become more sophisticated, we must remain one step ahead. H.4561 seeks to do just that and move TSA forward in overcoming technology stovepipes that have hindered state-of-the-art security technology from being integrated into our Nation's transportation systems in a timely manner.  H.4561 is predicated on the view that, by establishing alternative avenues to test transportation screening technologies, TSA will be positioned to introduce innovative security enhancements into checkpoints sooner, and businesses, regardless of their size, will be better positioned to compete.  The committee has repeatedly heard from small security manufacturers about how financially draining it is to wait out TSA testing in the hopes of a contract. H.4561, if implemented effectively, has the potential to get innovative technology produced by small businesses in airport security checkpoints and enhance the effectiveness of TSA's screening operations.  During consideration of this measure in committee, the majority accepted amendments offered by committee Democrats to the bill to ensure that the third-party testing receives scrutiny from the Government Accountability Office and to build integrity into this new program.

On behalf of both Members and staff on this side of the aisle, we also wish Krista Harvey the best of luck in her future endeavors.  Mr.Speaker, H.4561 is commonsense legislation. This bill promotes the incorporation of innovative technology in airport screening capabilities. It does so by requiring DHS to stand up a third-party testing program to accelerate the evaluation of promising transportation security technologies, including 3D-imaging computer tomography, or CT technology.  CT scan technology holds great promise in enhancing the effectiveness of TSA screening operations insofar as transportation security officers would have the benefit of seeing a full 3D multicolor image of whatever the screener is inspecting and getting better detail about any suspect items.  Presently, TSA is testing a number of systems in the lab and in the field and has said that it expects to be able to begin deployment of this new tool to airports by early 2019.  Given the known ongoing terrorist threat posed by electronic devices, CT technology should be introduced into the airport environment in an expedited fashion.

Let me be clear: Like many of the bill's supporters, I strongly believe that we should not take a one-size-fits-all approach to financial regulation. Financial regulation must be appropriately adjusted according to the size and complexity of an institution or class of institutions. That is why Democrats worked so hard to create these flexibilities in Dodd-Frank and regulators are already required to adjust their rules accordingly. For example, the CFPB has exempted community banks from many of the requirements under the qualified mortgage rule, and the Federal Reserve has developed different capital standards for banks based on size.  Moreover, we already have laws like the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act that instructs Federal financial regulators to go through extensive look-back reviews to update and improve their regulations. So while I agree that it is necessary to review and update our regulatory framework from time to time, particularly for our smaller institutions, I oppose H.1116 because the reviews required under the bill tilt too far in the industry's favor and fail to provide sufficient protection to the public's or the consumer's interest.  If enacted, this bill will provide our Nation's largest financial institutions with the opportunity to challenge any revised rulemaking in court if they felt a regulation was not uniquely tailored to meet their business needs.

Again, I think the key question here, as has been asked by so many colleagues: Are Native American Tribes government entities; are they sovereign? The only answer that we can respond with is: Absolutely, yes. They are sovereign. This is not an issue debating NLRB or It is going back to what we have established already that, in fact, a sovereign nation, just like a State or local government, is free from the intervention of  In this case, a sovereign nation has that right. Just as a reminder, over 150 Native American organizations have asked for this legislative effort to be achieved. Why? Because it was working fine up until 2004, and NLRB then came arbitrarily in--sometimes yes, sometimes not--intervening, but, ultimately, they were changing the system in place.  While we are moving back to letting the sovereignty reign in these Native American Tribes, yet we need to make it very clear for the future and not go back to what has precipitated this change.  The bill amends the National Labor Relations Act to clarify that the law does not apply to any enterprise or institution owned and operated by an Indian Tribe and located on Tribal land. It protects the sovereignty of Native American Tribes, reaffirming they are afforded the same rights and protections enjoyed by State and local government.  It ensures Tribes have control over their labor relations and can determine what is best for the workplaces. It eliminates legal confusion and uncertainty that is hindering the ability of Tribal governments to serve their citizens.  Mr.Speaker, that is what it does. It reasserts and reaffirms what we have already said in law. And for that reason, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

1070,topic-id,1615,"Mr.President, today I wish to speak about some specific provisions 2155.  I was proud to be one of the original drafters of Dodd-Frank legislation. We didn't get everything right in that bill. With the benefit of 8 years of hindsight, we have been able to see what has worked and what hasn't.  Most of what hasn't worked well has been the excessive burdens put on community banks. The bill the Senate considered today, one that I am a proud cosponsor of, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, does a lot of good for community banks and many regional banks by reducing some of the compliance costs these banks face, so that they may better compete and end the phenomenon of ``too small to survive.''  Since the crisis, however, what has worked best is increased capital requirements and an updated capital planning regime for medium and large-sized banks. Put simply, no amount of prudential regulation on products or business lines can substitute for requiring banks to keep robust capital cushions. Ensuring that banks hold significant loss absorbing, capital is the best protection we have against the failure of banks during a crisis. It is also the best tool we have to make sure that even in an economic downturn, banks still have the ability to lend to creditworthy borrowers, so that we can rebound quickly from a downturn.  Critically, 2155 makes no changes to the risk-based capital regime for regional and large banks that has been the centerpiece of the Federal Reserve's post-crisis work.  The international Basel III capital accord was agreed by banking regulators in 2010 to 2011. As implemented in the US, Basel III requires a minimum Common Equity Tier 1, CET1, ratio of 4.5 percent, up from 2 percent in Basel Minimum tier 1 capital increased from 4 percent in Basel II to 6 percent in Basel III, which includes additional 1.5 percent on top of the required CET1 ratio. The U.has finalized rules to implement two additional capital buffers on top of this 6 percent baseline tier 1 capital requirement: a mandatory capital conservation buffer, as adjusted by a risk-weighted capital surcharge on U.G-SIBs, and a discretionary countercyclical buffer, which the Fed can use to require additional capital during periods of high credit growth.  These risk-based capital requirements, as implemented by the U.banking regulators, have formed a core part of the U.bank regulatory response to the financial crisis. 2155 changes none of these requirements for regional and large banks.  An important complement to risk-based capital requirements is supervisory stress testing. Stress tests help make sure that banks have adequate capital to absorb losses and more still to lend even in a serious recession so that they will be able to continue to lend to households and businesses. 2155 did not modify the requirement that banks larger than $250 billion must continue to undergo annual supervisory stress tests. Regional banks between $100 billion and $250 billion must also continue to undergo what Chair Powell called before the Banking Committee meaningful, strong, and frequent stress tests.  Let me make clear: 2155 uses the same language as Dodd-Frank to describe the stress test that should apply to banks between $100 billion and $250 billion because we believe the stress tests applied to those banks should continue to be meaningful assessments of the capital adequacy of those institutions under severely adverse conditions. The requirement in section 401 to conduct stress tests of those banks would be satisfied by continuing to apply the section 165 supervisory stress tests to those banks. We have chosen to single out stress tests for banks between $100 billion and $250 billion because we believe it is the most important enhanced prudential standard in section 165 of Dodd- We believe it is prudent for the Federal Reserve to have discretion to apply the other enumerated enhanced prudential standards in section 165 to those or a subset of those banks as part of the strong and tailored regime that should apply to those banks going forward. Indeed, under the bill, the Fed can apply an enhanced prudential standard to those banks for financial stability reasons or simply to ``promote the safety and soundness'' of a bank, which is a low standard. Although the Fed is the entity that is best positioned to make the determination for many enhanced prudential[[Page S1714]]standards, Congress believes that meaningful, strong and frequent stress tests are non-negotiable.  Supervisory stress tests alone, however, do not set any capital ratios or limit any capital actions by the banks. The Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, CCAR, framework, however, integrates supervisory stress testing with risk-based capital requirements to assess the overall capital adequacy of banks, making it the most important supervisory tool the Federal Reserve has for larger banks. Specifically, CCAR requires evaluations of whether each bank's capital provides an adequate buffer for the losses that would be incurred during the stress scenarios, whether its risk management and capital planning processes are appropriately well-developed and governed and how its dividend or buyback plans could affect its ability to remain viable in stressed conditions. The Federal Reserve may object--and has objected--to a capital plan based on quantitative or qualitative concerns. If it does, the bank is not permitted to make any capital distribution without Fed authorization.  The Federal Reserve, without direction from Congress, has taken actions under both former Chair Yellen and Chair Powell to refine the CCAR process to reduce regulatory burdens. For example, in 2016, the Fed announced that smaller banks subject to CCAR would not need to be subject to the same qualitative requirements as larger, more complex banks. That was a sensible change.  Congress has shown it knows how to exercise its article I prerogative in many places in 2155 to adjust, tailor, and modify thresholds for applicability for rules that apply to banks that have $50 billion or more in assets, but Congress has not made any changes to CCAR in 2155. The omission of CCAR and the capital plan rule from the changes that 2155 has made to section 165 and some regulations affecting some banks is intentional and reflects the continued importance this Congress places upon the continued existence of a robust CCAR process and the premise that the Fed will continue to use this most important supervisory tool appropriately.  That covers risk-based capital, but let me reiterate a point I made in my prior floor speech on this bill, about the importance of the leverage ratio. Basel III requires 3 percent tier 1 capital divided by the bank's average total consolidated assets. The U.implementation goes further and requires a minimum leverage ratio of 6 percent for SIFI banks and 5 percent for their bank holding companies. That is generally a good thing. One of the many lessons of the financial crisis was that regulators and bankers alike should approach risk modeling with a degree of humility. A strong leverage ratio is an important backstop to risk-based requirements that depend on banks and regulators' abilities to predict the future.  Current and former Federal Reserve officials from Governor Tarullo, to former Chair Volcker, and former Chair Yellen, to Chair Powell have said that the leverage ratio should in general not be the binding capital constraint for banks, as it tends to be for the custody banks today. The leverage ratio is meant to be, in the words of Jay Powell, ``an important backstop to the risk-based capital framework,'' but noted that ``it is important to get the relative calibrations of the leverage ratio and the risk-based capital requirements right'' because ``doing so is critical to mitigating any perverse incentives and preventing distortions in money markets and other safe asset markets.''  Let's be clear. Section 402 provides relief to only three banks: Bank of New York Mellon, State Street, and Northern I have seen some raise the concern that the language in section 402 could be read to provide relief to a broader set of banks. That is not a credible reading of the statutory language or our legislative intent. Section 402 says that, in order to receive relief, a ``custody bank'' must be ``predominantly engaged in custody, safekeeping, and asset servicing activities'' to gain the benefit of this provision. This provision does not mean that, if a bank has a large custodial business, it should get relief, nor is this an invitation to exclude other assets from the calculation of total assets for purposes of the leverage ratio. This is a targeted fix for a narrow problem.  So what is the net result of all this technical capital planning and stress testing work that the Federal Reserve and other banking regulators have developed since 2008? Today, U.G-SIBs are have two times the amount of capital than they had precrisis. Even if we went through an economic downturn worse than the financial crisis, banks would have 50 percent more capital after absorbing losses than they did in 2008. The substantial increase in capital extends to banks that are smaller than the G-The common equity capital ratio of the 34 bank holding companies in the 2017 CCAR has more than doubled from 5.5 percent in the first quarter of 2009 to 12.5 percent in the first quarter of 2017. This reflects an increase of more than $750 billion in common equity capital to a total of $1.25 trillion by the first quarter of 2017.  That is exactly where we should be.  I am proud to have contributed significantly to both Dodd-Frank and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection 2155 is in many ways as notable for what it doesn't do, particularly with respect to capital requirements, as much as what it does do.

These nominees will oversee all those government contracts. They will influence which companies get billions in taxpayer dollars and what exactly those companies have to do to collect their checks. Without strict ethics rules and oversight, these nominees have the power to significantly influence the profitability of their former employers--the same companies that may, once again, be the nominees' future employers after they have finished their government service.  Mr.Rood may be a decent man, but he is the latest example of this trend. He will come to the Defense Department directly from Lockheed Martin International, where he was most recently a senior vice president. Lockheed is the biggest of the big five defense contractors. In 2016, the U.Government awarded the company over $40 billion in contracts. That was in 1 year.  According to his official bio submitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr.Rood's responsibilities included ``developing and executing strategies to grow Lockheed Martin's international business'' and ``managing marketing and government relations activities'' overseas. In other words, he was responsible for selling Lockheed's products to other countries, and it seems as though he was pretty good at it. Lockheed made over $12 billion--or more than one-quarter of its net sales--from its international customers in 2016.  Here is why that matters. According to Lockheed's most recent annual statement, the international division that Mr.Rood managed made about 66 percent of its sales to foreign customers through the Pentagon's Foreign Military Sales This is a program that allows for the sale of U.defense products overseas.  In that same report, Lockheed acknowledges that its foreign sales are ``highly sensitive'' to changes in regulations and ``affected'' by U.foreign policy. In other words, government officials influence whether Lockheed's foreign military sales barely break even or whether sales shoot through the roof and bring in billions of dollars for  If confirmed as Under Secretary of Policy, Mr.Rood will play a significant role in setting U.defense policy and overseeing the regulation of foreign military sales of those very same products to those very same countries. If he is given this job with no constraints, Mr.Rood could implement policies that increase Lockheed's profitability, whether that is in the interest of the American people or not.  Chairman McCain and I questioned Mr.Rood about this conflict of interest during his confirmation hearing. I asked him a simple yes-or-no question: Would he commit not to seek a waiver from his obligation to recuse himself from Lockheed Martin business, as required by his ethics agreement? That is all I asked.  He hemmed, he hawed, and finally made it clear that, well, no, he would not make that commitment.  So I asked him another simple question: Would he at least recuse himself from policy discussions about the sale of Lockheed Martin products through the Foreign Military Sales Program?  The answer was again clear. No, he would not make that commitment either.  I followed up with additional written questions. I asked: ``Mr.Rood, will you commit not to seek or accept a waiver from your recusal obligations under your ethics agreement?''  Here is his response. ``I am concerned that a commitment never to seek or accept a waiver could unnecessarily restrict my ability, if confirmed, to take an action that is important to U.national security and defense interests should a circumstance arise that is currently unforeseen.''  In other words, no, he would not commit to abide by his own ethics agreement. Just think for a minute about what that means. President Trump has nominated an industry executive to one of our most senior national security positions, and that individual is unwilling to steer clear of the conflicts of interest involved in doing that job.  I think the standard here should be pretty simple. If a nominee cannot do the job to which he has been nominated without seeking a waiver from his ethical obligations, then he should not have that job.  Mr.Rood is not the only Trump nominee with this problem. The President has nominated many other executives from industry to the most senior positions at the Department of The Deputy Secretary of Defense was previously a senior vice president at He now runs the Pentagon's budget process, including making the final call on which defense programs get funding and which do not.  The Secretary of the Army was a senior lobbyist for Raytheon and even ran Raytheon's political action committee. The Under Secretary of the Army, the 2 position, was also a vice president at The Deputy Chief Management Officer previously ran XCOR Aerospace, now a bankrupt developer of rocket engines and space launch systems. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics spent her career at Textron, an aerospace and defense contractor.  I could go on with this list. I don't doubt that many of these individuals are service-minded, and I know that many have also served honorably in government, both in and out of uniform. I also believe that a strong partnership between government and industry is important to our national defense.  Industry experience, in and of itself, does not disqualify someone from public service, but there must be balance. When too many top government jobs are filled by industry insiders, we risk corporate capture of the whole policy making process.  The overrepresentation of defense industry officials at the highest levels of the Department of Defense has real consequences. It suggests to the American people that only one viewpoint or one experience will dominate our policy making decisions. No outsiders, no one with a competing point of view need apply, and the revolving door between industry and government raises questions about who our government serves.  No taxpayer should have to wonder whether the top policy makers at the Pentagon are pushing defense products and foreign military sales for any reason other than the protection of the United States of No American should have to wonder whether the Defense Department is acting to protect the national interests of our Nation or the financial interests of the five giant defense contractors. No man or woman in uniform should have to wonder whether their civilian leaders are putting the private financial interests of themselves and their friends ahead of the safety and the interests of our military servicemembers.  The American people have a right to know who their government works for and that the senior leadership of the Department of Defense is putting our national security first. Everyone has a right to know that. The readiness and safety of our men and women in uniform is too important for any of us to have to ask those questions.  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I will not vote to confirm any nominee from industry[[Page S19]]who does not agree to fully recuse himself or herself from matters involving their former employer for the duration required by their ethics agreement, without waiver and without exception. I think we owe our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines at least that much.  Because he will not make the commitment to abide by his own ethics agreement without waiver or exception, I will be voting against Mr.Rood as Under Secretary of Defense, and I urge other Senators to do the same.

1065,topic-id,800,"Mr.President, on Friday I held a townhall in Springfield, On Saturday we had another townhall, this time in Weymouth, I met with kids at Weymouth High School who are forming a ``Never Again'' group and who want to pass some sensible gun regulations. I met with Dreamers who want to pass I met with people who fled the hurricanes in Puerto Rico and who want to get a comprehensive plan for rebuilding the island. I met with people who live along the South Shore and are deeply worried about rising oceans and the need for building resilience into our coastline housing and infrastructure. I met with people alarmed by the rising cost of healthcare and about Republican efforts to roll back ObamaCare, Medicaid, and I met someone who wants to see us focus more on criminal justice reform.  There is so much Congress could do. There are so many problems the American people are asking us to solve, but not one single person at any of my townhalls, meetings, press interviews, or picking up pizza at Armando's asked for Congress to work on rolling back the rules on some of the biggest banks in the country so they will have a chance to crash the economy again, and that is what the bill on the floor of the Senate does--really. Don't just take my word for it.  The Congressional Budget Office experts say the bill will increase the chances that taxpayers will have to bail out the big banks again. CBO also says the bill could allow Wall Street banks, like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, to significantly reduce their capital requirements. Professor Jeffrey Gordon, an expert in financial regulation at Columbia Law School, says the bill ``will produce a race-to-the-bottom dynamic that will dramatically increase the chance of another financial crisis.'' The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg both editorialized that the bill includes dangerous giveaways to big banks. Nobody back in Massachusetts asked for that.  Buried down in the details of the bill are even more landmines for American families. The bill guts protections for families who buy traditional and mobile homes, and it undermines our ability to enforce civil rights laws--and for what? So banks that are already making record profits can tack on a little more to their bottom line?  If the Senate is going to spend 2 weeks dealing with the big banks, we should be making the rules tougher, not easier. Today, I introduced the Ending Too Big to Jail Act, which would help make sure that big bank executives are hauled out of their corner offices in handcuffs the next time they break the law. That would do more for America's working families than anything in this bill, and I am going to fight to help make it law.  What does it say about Washington Republicans and Democrats who can't come together to support commonsense gun reforms or solutions for working families but can come together to deregulate big banks on the 10th anniversary of the start of the 2008 financial crisis?  Here is what I think it says: Washington has become completely disconnected from the real problems in people's lives. This place works great for people who can hire armies of fancy lobbyists and write big checks, but it doesn't work for anyone else.  This is personal for me. I grew up in Oklahoma on the ragged edge of the middle class. My family struggled, and when it looked like things were getting a little bit better, my daddy had a heart attack and he lost his job and we nearly lost our home. I was 12 years old, and I know what it feels like to hear your mother cry every night. I know what it feels like to wonder if you will have to change schools or move to another town because the bank is going to take your house away. I know it because I lived it.  When the economy collapsed 10 years ago, I would go to bed at night thinking about the millions of people across this country who worked hard, who played by the rules, and then had their dignity stripped away because somebody they never met gambled with their family's future and lost. I wondered back then about the kids. I wondered about their mothers. I wondered about their daddies. A foreclosure isn't just some dry financial transaction; it is the kind of event that can tear a family apart.  The American people aren't going to stand by while big banks and other giant corporations run this economy and this Congress for their own benefit.

1729,topic-id,867,"Mr.President, I am here to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Robert Kennedy's monumental campaign for Kennedy's brief, tragic run at the Presidency has had an enduring impact on so many generations of The reason, I think, is because Robert Kennedy had the courage to challenge a divided nation to face up to its failings, to challenge a divided people to acknowledge their own contributions to our Nation's ills, to challenge us to step back from the stale, cheap politics of the moment, to challenge us to do better by each other.  History may not repeat, but it often rhymes. Conditions are different now, but a lot of the anxiety that swept through the country in 1968 echoes the anxiety of today, especially the economic anxiety felt by millions of Americans who are working harder than ever but feel opportunity slipping away from themselves and from their children.  Too often, our political and business leaders refuse to see this. Instead they hide behind macroeconomic statistics, using them as a shield to dismiss the concerns of the American people as faulty, wrongheaded, or even as nonexistent.  Robert Kennedy understood that America's national economy is not the same as the economic well-being of its people. In 1968, in a speech at the University of Kansas, he spoke eloquently about the differences between them, and here is what he said:       [Our] Gross National Product counts air pollution and      cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways      of carnage. It counts special locks for our doors and the      jails for the people who break them. It counts the      destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder      in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear      warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots      in our cities. It counts Whitman's rifle and Speck's knife,      and the television programs which glorify violence in order      to sell toys to our children.       Yet the gross national product does not allow for the      health of our children, the quality of their education or the      joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our      poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of      our public debate or the integrity of our public officials.      It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our      wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our      devotion to our country.       It measures everything, in short, except that which makes      life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America      except why we are proud that we are  Consider three stats: corporate profits, the stock market, and unemployment.  Today, corporate profits are up--corporate profits that count gun sales for manufacturers whose weapons are used to massacre children in our schools and our streets. Corporate profits that count revenues from drug companies when they quadruple prices for the sick and the desperate. Corporate profits that count revenues of banks like Wells Fargo as they rip off millions of American consumers.  The stock market is up as giant companies pocket trillions in taxpayer money stolen from middle-class families. The market is up as CEOs shut down plants and factories in the United States and move them overseas. The market is up as business leaders, flush with cash, turn their backs on workers while they plow millions and even billions into stock buybacks to goose investors' returns and CEOs' bonuses.  Unemployment is down, but wages have barely budged in a generation. Unemployment is down, but for millions of people, the exploding costs for housing, healthcare, and childcare mean it now takes two jobs to do what one job covered a generation ago. Unemployment is down, but the numbers fail to represent the millions living in rural and urban American communities alike that have given up on the search for a job.  These statistics on corporate profits, the stock market, and unemployment tell us everything about the American economy, but they tell us very little about the lived experience of today's They do not speak to the citizen who fears police violence or the police officer who fears gang violence or the immigrant who cannot speak out about sexual assault at the hands of her boss or the toxic rhetoric flowing through our politics seeking to turn neighbor against neighbor. They do not account for our devotion to our communities, to our churches, and to our children. They tell us virtually nothing about our trials, our challenges, our hopes, or our principles.  Robert Kennedy understood this. He knew we cannot simply run an economy for those at the top and assume it will solve America's problems. In the intervening 50 years since his speech, America ran that experiment anyway and watched it fail miserably.  It is time to try something different. It is time to challenge each of us to do better by each other, to see the dignity in one another, and to put our values first. I believe we can make Robert Kennedy's legacy a reality, and I am proud to fight for it.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Perdue).

Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland, Harris, and my colleague Mr.LaMalfa from California for hosting this important time so that we can come together and talk about the great work that these crisis pregnancy centers do.  In my hometown of Hot Springs, Arkansas, in 1988, a crisis pregnancy center was formed to assist young parents and to protect innocent lives. In the last 30 years, Change Point Pregnancy Center has saved the lives of 2,821 babies by offering and advocating for alternatives to abortion. This center is comprised of compassionate volunteers and staff who invest significant time and energy in our posterity, making a positive difference for our future.  Mr.Speaker, I know firsthand the quality of these volunteers because my own mother was one of them in the early years of the crisis pregnancy center, when it was just getting off the ground.  In addition to free pregnancy testing and ultrasounds, Change Point offers diapers, wipes, and formula through their Earn While You Learn program, which offers supplies to families who attend parenting classes at the center. Families and churches like mine have been vital in supporting Change Point Pregnancy Center, not only by volunteering but also by donating supplies and baby bottles full of change to help fund the center.  Change Point has taught more than 10,000 classes for both mothers and fathers. As Mr.Harris mentioned, these centers are not only for mothers, but they also help fathers and they help parents and families. They give families the tools to succeed rather than the stigma that burdens them.

In just 10 months, Americans will go to the polls to exercise their franchise, believing in the integrity of our democratic process.

447,topic-id,1516,"Mr.President, the Trump administration has come up with a name for its energy policy. The energy policy amounts to, basically, a big, fat cascade of gifts and special favors for oil, gas, and coal companies, which, in turn, make big political contributions. Trump officials call the policy ``energy dominance.'' More accurately, its name would probably be ``fossil fuel industry political dominance'' or one might actually call it ``ignorance dominance'' since the administration willfully ignores scientific understanding, basic economics, market theory, and even the warnings of our national security community.  The situation is not pretty from an environmental point of view. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is busily trying to roll back rules that limit, for instance, emissions of methane, which is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. He is considering walking back fuel efficiency standards that save drivers money at the pump. President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord and was promptly ignored by every other nation on  Last month, on the Interior Secretary's recommendation, Trump took big areas of the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments, in Utah, away from the public and opened them, instead, to big mining and oil and gas interests. Zinke has even proposed to open almost all U.coastlines to drilling by oil and gas companies. That includes drilling in protected areas in the Arctic, drilling up and down the Atlantic coast, expanded drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, and drilling along the Pacific coastline. The plan even includes Georges Bank and other crucial fishing grounds for New  This drilling scheme is likely dead on arrival. Republican Governors in New Jersey, Maryland, and Florida have all denounced the plan, as have Florida's Democratic and Republican It even runs into objections from the When President Obama considered opening the southern Atlantic coast to drilling 2 years ago, the Defense Department told the Obama administration that offshore energy development could interfere with military readiness and missile testing.  Given the dominance of fossil fuel political interests in this administration, the whole Trump energy dominance scheme, of course, neglects the warnings of our national security experts about climate change--climate change as an accelerant of global instability and conflict and climate change as a direct hazard to military installations and infrastructure, from the Naval Station Norfolk to faraway facilities like Diego Garcia in the Indian  In 2008, the National Intelligence Council reported more than 30 U.military installations facing risk from rising sea levels. A vulnerability assessment directed by the ``2010 Quadrennial Defense Review'' found that at around 3 feet of sea level rise, 128 military installations are at risk. Naturally, many of those belong to the Navy--indeed, 56 out of those 128. It is a significant share of the Navy's global footprint, totaling around $100 billion in value.  In 2011, the National Academy of Sciences report, ``National Security Implications of Climate Change for U.Naval Forces,'' recommended the continued review of how sea level rise and changes in storm frequency and intensity would affect coastal installations.  The National Defense Authorization Act, which we just passed, directs the Department of Defense to study how climate change will affect our most vulnerable military bases over the next 20 years, including ``the effects of rising sea tides, increased flooding, drought, desertification, wildfires, thawing permafrost,'' as well as how climate change may drive new requirements for combatant commanders.  The law includes a sense of Congress statement that ``climate change is a direct threat to the national security of the United States and is impacting stability in areas of the world both where the United States Armed Forces are operating today, and where strategic implications for future conflict exist.''  That is a sense-of-Congress statement that has passed this Republican-controlled Senate and the Republican-controlled House and was signed into law by this administration. Thank you to the author of this language, my friend and fellow Rhode Islander, Congressman Jim  Even the U.Government Accountability Office has engaged. The independent oversight agency issued a report titled, ``Climate Change Adaptation: DoD Needs to Better Incorporate Adaptation into Planning and Collaboration at Overseas Installations.''  I think that title gives away the punch line. Surveying our bases and installations across the world, GAO found that weather and climate change pose operational and budgetary risks to infrastructure. GAO recommended that DOD's climate planning efforts be expanded and increased; specifically, that the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force require defense installations to ``systematically track the costs associated with extreme weather events and climate change'' and that DOD better coordinate addressing climate change risks across different DOD installations.  This picture in the GAO report shows an unnamed military facility in the Pacific that has at times been cut off by flooding from access points to its munitions storage complex. If you have a military facility that can't get access to its munitions storage, you have a problem.  This is the picture of the flooded entryway, and this is the picture of the similar entryway under normal circumstances, able to be traveled.  A 2014 typhoon caused flash flooding here that trapped and imperiled American personnel. The point is, when climate change effects inhibit military base operations, defense preparedness requires climate preparedness.  Naval Station Norfolk, the largest Navy base in the world, is a poster child for the devastation that awaits our coastal military bases if we continue to pump out the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving sea level rise. A tide gauge operated at the base since 1927 has shown nearly 15 inches of vertical sea level rise so far. In the broader Hampton Roads metro area, home not only to the Navy but also to facilities of the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, NASA, and NOAA, high tides are already regularly forcing seawater back through storm drains and flooding roadways.  DOD's own environmental research program, the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program, used Norfolk as its case study for sea level rise and extreme storm risks to coastal DOD installations. The study found a ``tipping point'' of about a half meter, 1.6 feet, of sea level rise, at which point ``the probabilities of damage to infrastructure and losses in mission performance increased dramatically.'' This is mapping of the flood hazard around Naval Station  This tipping point at which the mission performance losses increase dramatically is only a few decades away. Retired RADM David Titley, a former oceanographer and navigator of the Navy and leader of its Climate Change Task Force, said Norfolk has about 10 to 15 years to get serious about sea level rise in the region before ``we're really cutting it close.''  In 2017, CAPT Dean Vanderley, who leads infrastructure engineering at the Norfolk Naval base, admitted that sea level rise is ``something where I don't know that we've fully defined the problem. And we have definitely not fully defined the solution.''  Retired CAPT Joe Bouchard, a former base commander, told InsideClimate News that Naval Station Norfolk would need significant improvements to nearly every piece of infrastructure, from electrical and drainage systems to pier improvements, not to mention a seawall. He estimated this work could cost more than $1 billion and take as long as a decade to complete. That is just one base with $1 billion and a decade's worth of work. The DOD has identified over 128 bases that would be at significant risk with 3 feet of sea level rise. I think NOAA's current estimate is for 6 feet of global sea rise by the end of the century.[[Page S126]]  Even though our President is clueless about the basics of climate change, his Secretary of Defense understands and acknowledges the risks. In response to congressional questioning last year, Secretary Mattis said, ``Climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today. . . . It is appropriate for the Combatant Commands to incorporate drivers of instability that impact the security environment in their areas into their planning.''  Well, for political reasons, the White House can't acknowledge the problem so the recently published ``National Security Strategy'' totally disregards all of these recommendations. It will not even mention the forbidden words. We know these words are forbidden in the Trump administration because over and over again the memos leak out about people being told don't say the words ``climate change.''  Instead, with all these warnings from GAO, from senior military officials, from the National Intelligence Council, from a decade of Quadrennial Defense Reviews, and the testimony of Secretary Mattis--instead of listening to that, Trump parrots climate change denial talking points that come from the phony fossil fuel front groups. It is pathetic. Calling this deliberate ignorance ``energy dominance'' may be a fine fossil fuel flourish, but it is completely disconnected from actual safety, security, and military readiness--and don't get me started on what the fossil fuel industry's systematic corruption of our democracy means for America's fabled status as that ``city on a hill.''

722,topic-id,2035,"Thank you, Mr.President, and happy new year to you.  For my 191st ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, I want to take the change of years to reflect on what 2017 meant for our carbon pollution of the Earth's climate and what 2018 may bring.  Our human use of fossil fuels continued to pour carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 2017. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere now stands at almost 407 parts per million--the highest in human history and more than 100 parts per million above the safe range in which human development for millennia has flourished. Each year brings a new record concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere, and this will continue to worsen until the world weans itself off fossil fuels.  Of course, the contamination of our Earth and atmosphere by carbon pollution is matched by the contamination of our politics by unlimited and often hidden fossil fuel industry money, threats, and promises. When the accounting comes for what they have done to the Government of the United States, there will be a lot to answer for.  We are in a heck of a cold snap now, as the boundaries of normal weather get blown out in all directions by climate change, but the underlying, steady warming trend through all these new extremes of hot and cold and wet and dry is obvious.  Here in the United States, everyone in the lower 48, except for a few pockets up in the Northwest where things stayed fairly steady, has seen hotter than average temperatures. This represents hot. This represents cold. As you can see, most of the map matches the hot end. These are the mean temperature departures from average for January to November 2017.  Residents of the desert Southwest and of coastal Texas and Louisiana and much of the Southeast lived through their hottest year ever in 2017. Record warming is this color. You see it all through these areas, record warmest temperature.  Up in the Arctic, where temperatures are rising twice as fast as the rest of the globe, 2017 was the second hottest year ever. In Barrow, AK, the temperature rose so rapidly that computer algorithms kicked in and flagged the underlying data as suspect. The computer felt something must have gone wrong with the equipment and flagged the data as suspect. In fact, the readings were extraordinary, but they were real. That was the temperature.  We also saw a punishing onslaught of extreme weather in 2017, making it the most expensive disaster year in U.history, costing nearly $400 billion in damages. The United States had averaged fewer than six billion-dollar weather-related disasters a year. Between January and late October 2017, we experienced 16, which killed 282 people. Final estimates of the devastation during 2017 aren't complete. It may prove that 1,000 lost lives are attributable to Hurricane Maria and its aftermath in Puerto  The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season brought 17 named storms, 10 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes--those with average wind speeds exceeding 115 miles per hour.  In August, Hurricane Harvey roared ashore with winds over 130 miles per hour, dropping more than 60 inches of rain over the Houston and Port Arthur areas. Areas that aren't even on the[[Page S14]]flood maps found themselves flooded. Scientists agree that the unprecedented Texas deluge was only made possible by a warming atmosphere.  September brought Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which ravaged the Caribbean, including the U.Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Bahamas, as well as Much of Puerto Rico is still without power months after the storm. Abnormally warm waters in the tropical Atlantic fueled this punishing succession of storms.  Out West, 2017's high temperatures and low rainfall created conditions ripe for wildfire.  As of November, more than 6.4 million acres had burned--an area roughly the size of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts--making 2017 the third most active fire year in history.  In October, fast-moving wildfires laid waste to the California wine country, destroying almost 9,000 structures and killing more than 40 people. They were the costliest fires in U.history, bringing $9 billion in damage and $85 billion in economic loss.  In December, the Thomas fire exploded across coastal California, burning over 280,000 acres on its way to becoming the largest wildfire in California history. Notably, fire season should have been over by then in California, extinguished by December's customary winter rains, but not in 2017. Southern California had near-record low rainfall this winter, leaving vegetation desiccated and ready to ignite.  The evidence continued to pile up in 2017 of the connection between climate change and this extreme weather. The American Meteorological Society released a report showing that a majority of extreme weather and climatic events in 2016 were influenced by human-caused climate change. Indeed, the report found that the record average global temperatures in 2016, the record warm waters in the North Pacific, and the record temperatures in Asia simply would not have occurred without human-caused climate change.  We should not--as we too often do--overlook the oceans. The added carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that has run up the concentration to 407 parts per million alters the ocean's very chemistry. The added heat trapped by that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere gets picked up by the oceans, and it raises ocean temperatures. Warmer, more acidic seas destroy coral reefs, displace fisheries, and rise along populous shores. We measure all this already.  With all these alarm bells ringing, how did the United States respond in 2017 to the climate crisis? Our newly inaugurated President, Donald Trump, pointedly ignored the global political and scientific consensus that climate change poses a grave risk to our way of life--a prediction shared by our State universities, our National Laboratories, our major scientific associations, and even our military. President Trump nominated fossil fuel stooge Scott Pruitt to run the Environmental Protection For Energy Secretary, Trump nominated Rick Perry, who uses his office to promote fossil fuel, even announcing a plan to subsidize the coal industry after private meetings with big Trump coal company donors. Then there is Ryan Zinke, Trump's Secretary of the Interior, who decided to reopen public lands to coal mining and wants to roll back the rule limiting methane emissions from oil and gas drilling on our American public lands. It is literally the three stooges.  In May, President Trump announced America's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, leaving the United States the only country on Earth to reject this landmark pact.  This is not leadership; this is its corrupted opposite. This administration is in hock to the fossil fuel industry like no other. Trump and his pals haven't drained the swamp; they have jumped right in with the biggest swamp monsters of all.  The U.Chamber of Commerce pays for a phony ``study'' claiming the Paris Agreement would cost jobs and economic growth; Trump pulls us out of The American Petroleum Institute complains about rules limiting methane emissions; Pruitt and Zinke try to roll them back. The Auto Alliance complains about fuel efficiency standards that the auto companies agreed to for American cars; Pruitt starts a project to water them down. Trump takes money by the shovelful from fossil fuel donors, and Pence dances on the Koch brothers' strings.  Yet 2017 offered reasons to remain optimistic. First is the explosion in renewable energy.  In 2017, renewables provided nearly 20 percent of electricity generation in the United As wind and solar costs fell, utilities across the country--even in red States--invested heavily in wind and solar. The renewable energy industry hit 3.3 million jobs--more than all fossil fuel jobs combined.  More good news: The leadership void left by the corrupted Trump administration was filled by thousands of State and local governments, businesses, academic institutions, and faith organizations which pledged to honor the Paris Agreement and reduce their carbon emissions. The States of California, Connecticut, Hawaii, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Virginia, Washington, and, I am proud to say, Rhode Island, have all declared that they are still in. Alaska announced it would meet its goals. What is more, California and Washington joined with Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Mexico to announce a plan to put a price on carbon to rein in emissions.  Businesses in 2017 exercised climate leadership in the marketplace. Leading asset manager BlackRock helped break the back of Exxon's and Occidental Petroleum's opposition to shareholder resolutions requiring them to report their climate risk to their shareholders. Multinational insurance firm AXA announced it would divest from its tar sands holdings and stop insuring pipelines that transport tar sands oil. Credit rating agency Moody's announced it will consider climate risk in rating coastal communities' municipal bonds. Companies like Microsoft and Unilever have their own baked-in, internal carbon price to help them reduce the carbon intensity of their operations.  Then there are the court battles. In 2017, multiple California municipalities sued fossil fuel companies under the State public nuisance law to seek help with the huge adaptation costs they face as sea level rises and extreme weather becomes more common.  State attorneys general in Massachusetts and New York defeated attempts by ExxonMobil to disrupt their fraud investigation into whether the company has been covering up what it knew about the risks posed by fossil fuels. By the way, at the very end of last year, we discovered there were reports through the American Petroleum Institute of the dangers of climate change from renowned scientists, including Edward Teller, going back to 1959. That is how long this coverup may have been going on.  So these various things that are happening among businesses, among States, among leaders, among other countries, among State attorneys general, and the courts give me hope for 2018. The renewable energy revolution will continue. It is unstoppable as prices drive the market their way. Forward-thinking business leaders will realize they must fight for good climate policy not just within their own companies but also here in They need to start showing up. America's courts will provide a forum for truth and disclosure--two things very scarce in climate denial--which fossil fuel companies, for that reason, have for years fiercely fought to avoid, but judges will insist on answers, plaintiffs are entitled to discovery, and lying in court gets you punished.  World and State and local leaders have picked up the mantle abandoned by Washington Republicans and, who knows, there is always hope. Republicans and Democrats in Congress just might reflect on 2017--on the hurricanes and the wildfires and all the changes already taking place in our home States; may reflect on what all of our home State universities are telling us; may look at where young and independent voters are on this issue; may heed the longstanding warnings of our U.military and maybe--just maybe--step out from under the bullying shadow of the fossil fuel industry and come together to solve our climate crisis.  Here are my 2018 resolutions: Let's put a price on carbon emissions so their release into the atmosphere reflects the true cost, as market theory says it should. This market-based solution is endorsed by leading thinkers and analysts on the left and the right.[[Page S15]]Let's also launch carbon capture and storage, including direct air capture. Let's launch carbon-free advanced nuclear technologies. Let's help America lead the world in the fight to stave off irreversible climate catastrophe with the new technologies that we are the world's best at developing. Finally, for coastal States like my home State of Rhode Island--which faced the irrevocable upward march of warming seas on a warming planet--let's make sure coastal communities have the resources they need to predict and prevent or prepare for the future that looms.  We owe this to our children and to our children's children. We owe it to all future generations that will look back at us and ask: When it was so obvious, how is it possible that the Government of the United States--how is it possible that this city on a hill--could do nothing but the bidding of the most conflicted industry on the planet? In 2018, let's get this right.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

1568,topic-id,2039,"Mr.President, we are more aware than ever of the accelerating pace of climate change and of the serious threat that rising seas, higher temperatures, and changing weather poses. I suppose I don't need to lecture the Presiding Officer from Florida on the threat of rising seas.  The real-time effects of climate change are becoming clearer and clearer every year. Here is a telling example unfolding right now in the  In this graphic, we see the mean area of Arctic sea ice over the last several decades. The maximum yearly extent of the ice, which occurs around this time of year, continues to shrink each decade.  This line tracks the sea ice in the Arctic in millions of square kilometers, running from February through to This is the track of the sea ice extent during the 1980s. If you take all the years in the 1980s and you average them together and you run through the calendar, it is like a clock going this way through these months. You would see the sea ice growing and fading away as spring came to the  That is where the ice was when averaging the 1980s. This green line is the exact same thing; it is just for the 1990s. So we can see how much sea ice has been lost averaged decade over decade.  The blue line here is for 2000. Once again, we see a loss of sea ice--a considerable loss from the levels back as recently as the 1980s.  The purple line right here is the average of the years in this decade so far, from 2010 to 2017--that is the average of those 7 years. This dot is the high, the maximum ice extent recorded in 2016. This lower dot is the lower high of the ice recorded in 2017. So you can see that even though this is the average, the trend remains downward.  This red line is what we have measured so far in 2018. Here we are right now in March of 2018, and it is well below. Decade after decade, we see the ice melting away.  As these facts and so many others relentlessly pile up, it has become harder and harder for the fossil fuel industry and the web of front groups and the Trump administration officials who do its bidding to claim that there is nothing to see here: Folks, move along; it is all just a big hoax.  The University of Alaska is our closest university to the The University of Alaska actually has a climate science center where they are studying and teaching the science of climate change. The University of Alaska also actually has the Ocean Acidification Research As I have pointed out in these speeches over the years, one of the most obvious and pernicious consequences of climate change is that when you ramp the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, the oceans, which cover 70 percent of the surface of the world, absorb not only excess heat, but they actually chemically absorb the carbon dioxide. When that happens, they become more acidic. In the wee hours of a morning months and months ago, I actually did the experiment right here, where I blew the carbon dioxide from my breath through an aquarium bubbler into a glass of water that had pH-sensitive dye in it, and you could see, in the moment that it took for me to exhale that carbon-dioxide-rich breath through the water, how the color changed, and you could measure it against the color chart for pH and see how just that one breath changed the acidity of the water and made it more acid.  That is happening across the planet, and it affects creatures like terrapods, which are a very important species for salmon, which is, in turn, a very important industry for That is why Alaska has the Ocean Acidification Research Center--some hoax.  For this, my 201st ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, I wish to get into some of the reasons why I remain optimistic even in the face of relentless attacks on the environment, both from the fossil fuel industry and from the Trump administration. There are success stories, including bipartisan wins in Congress and major advances outside of We are still making progress on climate and energy policy, even under political siege by the fossil fuel industry.  First, there is an explosion in renewable energy. In 2017, renewables provided nearly 20 percent of electricity generation in the United Wind and solar energy costs fell, and utilities across the country, even in red States, invested heavily. The renewable energy industry in America hit 3.3 million jobs--more than all fossil fuel jobs combined. The private sector is leading renewables purchases. One example is AT&AT&T recently signed onto the World Wildlife Fund's Corporate Renewable Energy Buyers' Principles, a criteria to help energy producers meet the needs of large customers like AT&As part of that commitment with the World Wildlife Fund, AT&T has signed two agreements with NextEra Energy for wind power--220 megawatts from an Oklahoma wind farm and 300 megawatts from a Texas wind farm. It is one of the largest corporate renewable energy purchases in history. I congratulate my Texas and Oklahoma colleagues for these new, home-State, renewable energy jobs, and I congratulate AT&T for its foresight and leadership.  Another business breakthrough came when the massive asset manager BlackRock helped break Exxon's and Occidental Petroleum's resistance and forced through shareholder resolutions requiring those oil producers to report their climate risk to their shareholders, to their investors. I, for one, don't think those shareholders are yet getting the full story.  The multinational insurance firm, AXA, announced that it would divest from its tar sands holdings and it would stop providing insurance for pipelines that transport tar sands oil.  Credit rating agency Moody's announced that it will consider climate risk in rating coastal communities' municipal bonds. So our coastal municipalities in Rhode Island, the Presiding Officer's coastal communities in Florida, and coastal communities across the country are now going to have to take into account the climate risk, what infrastructure and what hazards they face from sea level rise and increased storm activity, and all of the things we associate with climate change. It is going to be part of how the rating agencies value their municipal bonds. That is going to change behavior, and it doesn't matter whether you are a red State or a blue  Companies like Microsoft and Unilever have baked into their own internal accounting their own internal carbon prices to help them reduce the carbon intensity of their operations. And, of course, virtually every Republican who has thought the climate change problem through to a solution has come to a price on carbon as being the market-based solution to that problem.  When the President announced that he would withdraw the United States from the historic Paris Agreement, leaving us as the pariah nation--the only one in the world to reject this global pledge--many American companies pledged that, as to that Paris Agreement, they are still in.  The corruption of the Trump administration by fossil fuel interests has not affected many State and local officials. In Colorado, for instance, the Colorado State Public Utility Commission is working with Xcel Energy to build out a cleaner energy mix and retire older fossil fuel units. Specifically, Colorado is looking to retire 660 megawatts of coal-fired generation--close it down--and replace it with renewables. Their recent request for bids brought a flood of new renewable energy proposals at costs that came in beating out existing coal and natural gas facilities. New-built renewables on price beat out existing fossil fuel. The market is speaking, and it is saying that fossil fuel, even with all its scandalous and well-defended subsidies, can't compete. Fossil can't compete.  On the Paris Agreement, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Virginia, Washington State and--I am proud to say--Rhode Island all declared that they, too, are still in. They will meet their goals. Alaska announced that it would meet its Paris Agreement goals. What is more, California and Washington State have combined with Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Mexico in a plan to put a price on carbon that would reach up and down virtually the entire Pacific coast of the Americas--from Canada all the way down through  One problem for the fossil fuel folks' political influence, which is so deadly[[Page S1833]]effective here in Congress, is that it doesn't do so well in government agencies where the rule of law, not politics, prevails. So the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a Federal administrative agency bound by rule of law, more or less blew off a preposterous proposal by fossil fuel flunkies at the Department of Energy to subsidize coal even more. Instead, FERC recently finalized a rule for energy storage in America's electric grids. This will not only expand energy storage, but it will also accelerate renewables like wind and solar. A recent study predicted that the rule could spur--hold on--50,000 megawatts of additional energy storage across the United States, enough to power roughly 35 million homes. This estimate could turn out to be conservative, if renewables prices keep heading in their current trajectories. That FERC rule, by the way, was unanimous and bipartisan.  FERC oversees the system operators, like ISO-New England, which are steadily improving the role of renewables in regional markets, removing the obstacles that had kept renewables from competing fairly in capacity auctions and dispatch decisions. With wind power being such a large part of Iowa's energy mix, for example, its midwestern ISO figured out the algorithms to treat wind as reliable, baseload power. FERC's storage rule will give these system operators a new avenue for further progress on clean, renewable energy.  Believe it or not, even Congress has acted. Just last month, Congress passed a bipartisan budget agreement that included legislation I cosponsored with Senators Heitkamp, Capito, and Barrasso to spur investment and innovation in next-generation carbon capture, utilization, and storage technologies. Our bill attracted what I would call an unlikely coalition of energy, industrial, agricultural, and technology companies, as well as environment and labor groups.  This bill puts a positive price on carbon reduction through a tax credit for projects that capture and utilize or store carbon dioxide emissions. Without that price signal, there was little incentive to innovate how to turn carbon pollution from powerplants and industrial facilities into something safe or even useful. The bill even incents technologies to pull carbon pollution directly from the atmosphere. The key is that Congress, for the first time, put a dollar value on reducing carbon pollution.  The Senate also just passed a nuclear innovation bill written by Senator Crapo and me to increase collaboration between private industry, universities, and national laboratories in advanced nuclear technologies. Our bill was also cosponsored by Senators Booker, Murkowski, Risch, Hatch, and It would put private innovators together with our National Labs, with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and with the Energy Department--all working together on safe, new nuclear technologies.  My goal here is not only to help bring new carbon-free technologies forward, ultimately to a carbon-free power grid, but also to explore technologies that just may allow us to turn our present hazardous nuclear waste stockpiles to productive use--to generate clean energy, to move those waste stockpiles from the liability to the asset column on our Nation's books. What an achievement that would be.  Although Congress may be blockaded still by fossil fuel interests, it is nevertheless the law of the land that administrative agencies must take into account the social cost of carbon--the cost that fossil fuels carbon pollution imposes on society--in making energy-related decisions. That test will remain, and lawsuits are slowly closing in on the moment of discovery, when lawyers finally get access to the fossil fuel industry's files, and decades of lies, denial, and political manipulation are exposed for all to see.  The well-funded climate denial machine, with its front groups and trick-pony scientists and political muscle operation, can only keep the denial castle propped up for so long. But until that battlement of lies collapses--and it will--until it collapses, nevertheless, progress still continues all around us.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

1225,topic-id,736,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, you know that he may call himself a freshman, but Mr.Ferguson--Ferguson has made his weight felt around here since day one. He ran on a commonsense platform that said: Dadgummit, let's just go and get something done. Let's go and make a difference. Let's stop fussing about it. Let's start doing something about it.  He has developed a reputation as a doer, and I am proud to serve with him. I appreciate him putting together this opportunity tonight.  Mr.Speaker, we talk about tax reform as if it is a line item somewhere. The truth is that it is a feeling. It is a collective sigh of relief that has gone on in every single congressional district represented here.  We have all gotten those calls. I got one just the other day, Mr.Speaker, from a father whose adult daughter had fallen on hard times and has a tough time making the bills work. As someone who had been strapped for the last, 6, 7, 8 years, he was trying to figure out how he was going to help his daughter make the bill balance when he wound up with $1,000 bonus from one of our local employers. It came at exactly the right time to make a difference in his family's life.  It is that collective sigh of relief that better days are coming tomorrow than we had yesterday. I have heard it from the biggest companies in the district and I have heard it from the smallest companies in the district.  The Home Depot is a proud Georgia company. My friend, Mr.Loudermilk mentioned it is headquartered in his district. We have got about seven stores in my district and a distribution facility in our district. Mr.Speaker, $1,000 bonuses from The Home Depot went not to their upper-level management employees, but to their rank-and-file hourly employees at the store. That is real money in somebody's pocket back home. Now, that's just the kind of company that Home Depot is.  We remember that during the economic crisis, when folks were cutting back on everything to try to make the books balance. They kept that program going on Saturday mornings, where you could come out with your kids, where you could build a birdhouse together, where you could build a train together, where you could come together as a family. Even when you didn't have enough dollars to go to a ball game, you could come to your local Home Depot and be present with your children. That is the kind of company they are.  Same thing with My friend from Georgia knows, UPS has a proud tradition. We won them over from Years ago, Oz Nelson made that decision. Folks in UPS brown, 1,700 employees in my district, are getting bonuses because UPS now has more money to go around.  Now, all the money didn't go into bonuses. Let's be clear, it didn't. UPS put $5 billion in their pension fund.  Mr.Speaker, how many times have we talked about pension funds being underfunded in this country and wanting somebody to do something about it?  UPS got some extra dollars and they put those dollars in the pension fund for their employees.  They announced last month, Mr.Speaker, 14 additional 747 purchases. Now, Boeing is not headquartered in my district, but if you live in Washington State or you live in South Carolina, the news that 14 more planes are going to be purchased means something to those families, to those suppliers, to those subcontractors.  Four new 767s being purchased as a result of extra money that wasn't coming to the Federal Government that is, instead, being reinvested.  My friend from Georgia said it best: companies are now, for the first time in a long time, making decisions based on what is best for them, for their customers, for their employees, and for their communities.  Mr.Speaker, we can argue about what kind of public policy we should have, but can't we agree that one where we are prioritizing people and communities first is one that we can all be proud of?[[Page H1688]]  I was pleased to support the bill.

This is for the millions of families, for kids who walk an economic tightrope with their families, the families who balance the rent bill against the fuel bill and the fuel bill against the grocery bill.  I have to say, there was plenty of time in the last Congress to carry out the priorities of the multinational corporations. The people who are well connected, the people who are powerful received permanent, substantial, really massive new tax breaks, and yet the 9 million kids, including 80,000 in my home State who count on CHIP to stay healthy--what they received was a patch. They received something temporary. They received something that didn't resemble the permanent, you-can-count-on-it tax relief the multinational corporations were celebrating at the end of the year. It is a sad statement about the priorities of the Congress at the end of last year and one I hope we will move now in the bipartisan tradition of this program to pass on a permanent basis.  The CHIP program was created in 1997 through a simple idea: No child, regardless of their income, family's status, or geography should go without quality, affordable healthcare. It serves families who make too much to qualify for Medicaid but also don't have access to affordable healthcare through their employer. A lot of these families go back and forth between CHIP and Medicaid, depending on whether a spouse is out of work.  CHIP covers all kinds of essential healthcare for kids from preventive services to dental checkups, to treatment for serious illnesses. For families across the country, that is peace of mind, that is the chance to go to bed at night knowing you aren't going to get crushed by big medical bills in the morning. It means you don't have to have those heartbreaking, right-before-bed conversations about what you are going to do for your sick child, and it doesn't mean you have to just plan on the unexpected emergencies with nowhere to turn. All of that is at risk because of the ``negligence'' of this Congress, and I use that word specifically.  I talked about the skewed priorities at the end of the year, but right now States are stretching their Children's Health Insurance Program dollars to the breaking point. They are trying to make sure kids stay covered, and what we are faced with is termination notices going out. We have to prevent those termination notices for these families. As I said, Congress put a patch on all this, contrasting this to the permanent relief of the multinationals, and the Congress sent a small amount of money to the States to keep them afloat, but make no mistake about it, it is not going to be long before bedlam sets in, once again, and there are real consequences for children and families.  Now, I also want to note that I have been working closely with Chairman Hatch for months now to get CHIP across the finish line. Chairman Hatch knows what it takes. He created this program with our friend Senator Rockefeller and the late, great Senator They demonstrated that kids' health was an issue that transcends ideological lines, and our country is the better for it today.  Chairman Hatch and I made an agreement in September that extends full funding for 5 years, affirms key protections for kids and their families, and gives States certainty they can[[Page S51]]count on to plan their budgets. I note that the leader, Senator Schumer, is here. He has been very supportive of this bill. He sat next to me and Senator Rockefeller for years and is supportive of the children's health program.  The Hatch-Wyden bill passed with a strong bipartisan vote in the Finance Again, I am highlighting the priorities where there was time for the multinational corporations to get that permanent relief, but there wasn't any time to put the CHIP bill--one that had only one vote in opposition in the Finance Committee--on the Senate floor. In the House of Representatives, they weren't pursuing it like we did in the Finance They never could get past a purely partisan approach, out of line with CHIP's long, bipartisan history.  Now, obviously after months of delay, it is time to act, and I want to wrap up with a quick comment about what is going to happen if you don't move and move quickly. Just last week, the Congressional Budget Office announced that the cost of CHIP has plummeted from $8.2 billion to $800 million. That is because premiums in the individual market are set to skyrocket after the repeal of the Affordable Care Act's coverage requirement in the Republican tax bill. Many of the families who currently count on CHIP will have to get their kids' healthcare on the private market at a higher cost. As if Congress needed more reasons to act, the budget office has demonstrated what is now at stake for kids and their families who are counting on quick action for affordable healthcare.  There is a long history, as I have noted, of the Senate working on the Children's Health Insurance Program in a bipartisan way. We started building on that tradition in the Finance Committee with virtual unanimity. Somehow at the end of the last Congress--and your priorities can always be illustrated with what you find time to do--there was time at the end of the year for the agenda of the multinational corporations, but there wasn't time for the youngsters and their families who walk an economic tightrope and depend every night, when they turn the lights out, on making sure there is a way to pay for healthcare if there is an emergency in the morning.  I want it understood that we are working day in and day out now to quickly make sure kids and their families get the certainty and predictability they deserve. They deserve the kind of certainty the powerful got with the tax bill at the end of the year.  So we are going to be on this floor until this critical legislation is passed. It needs to be passed quickly.  I yield the floor.                   Recognition of the Minority Leader  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.

1056,topic-id,1070,"Madam President, first of all, I wish to commend my Pacific Northwest colleague Senator Murray for taking this time to talk about these exceptionally important issues. I had a chance to listen to the thoughtful remarks of our friend from New Hampshire--3,000 miles away from the Pacific Northwest--and she has been, as usual, extraordinarily eloquent and passionate about the cause of women's health, and it is great to be able to follow her.  We can sum up the healthcare policy of the Trump administration in just one word: discrimination. I am here with my colleagues today to discuss a particularly alarming example of the Trump agenda of healthcare discrimination and an example of where the administration is working overtime to make women's healthcare worse.  What is particularly frustrating about this is we are dealing with a bureaucracy run amok. The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, has made a critical judgment. They will put ideology over the law of the land when it comes to the medical care available to the young women in its custody.  Under Director Scott Lloyd, the office has attempted to block several immigrants from exercising their freedom of choice with respect to reproductive health. It has no legal right to do so. This issue is settled law, but this hasn't stopped the Director and its agency from dragging young women into prolonged, taxpayer-funded court battles.  There are roughly 5,000 young people in the Office of Refugee Resettlement's custody. Most of them are from Central American countries. Many of these young women are survivors of sexual violence. They are on their own, and they didn't come here to have somebody else's ideology dictating their medical care. In my view, this office ought to uphold its duty to provide all the care these young women have a right to receive, and it ought to check the ideology at the door.  That is not how the Office of Refugee Resettlement is working under Mr.According to a recent report from VICE News, ``Mr.Lloyd receives a spreadsheet every week containing information on every pregnant teen in their custody.''  He reportedly sought to interfere in a young woman's medical procedure that was actually already underway. In another case, the report says he put a young woman at further risk by directing staff to inform her parents--against her wishes--that she had an abortion.  Last fall, an HHS official was asked about Mr.Lloyd's direction of the office and the matter of interfering in the medical care of young women. Here is what that spokesman said: ``He by law has custody of these children, just like a foster parent, he knows that that's a lot of responsibility and he is going to make choices that he thinks are best for both the mother and the child.''  I say to my colleagues, that is just rampant government paternalism summed up in just one sentence.  Now, it ought to be no surprise, given his background, that this is the direction the office is taking. This is a gentleman who has made a career out of opposing the right of women to make their own judgments about their own healthcare choices. He has fought access to contraception and to a variety of healthcare services that are important to women. His views are right in line--right in line--with this administration's agenda of healthcare discrimination against women.  Right out of the gate, the administration and Republicans in Congress pushed for legislation that would have deprived hundreds of thousands of women the right to see the doctor of their choosing. They made it harder for many of those women to obtain routine, vital medical care from providers like Planned Parenthood, including cancer screenings, prenatal care, preventive services, physicals, and a whole host of preventive services that have absolutely nothing to do with abortion--nothing to do with abortion.  Then the Trump administration sought to deny women guaranteed, no-cost access to contraception. When women have guaranteed access to contraception, it means healthier pregnancies, healthier newborns, a lower risk of cancer, and, particularly, economic fairness for women of modest means, but the Trump administration wants to unravel that guarantee as well.  Then, the Trump team is green-lighting junk insurance policies that drive up the cost of healthcare for women with preexisting conditions, and they are involved in very elaborate--as my colleague knows--discussions with the State of People ought to understand exactly what the Trump administration is saying to Idaho because they are going to say it to other people. The Trump administration is saying to Idaho: You can discriminate, just don't be too obvious about it. That is their position with respect to these junk insurance policies.  The administration is exploring ways to place lifetime limits on the care people can get from Medicaid, and that is a frightful proposition for the millions of older women who count on Medicaid to pick up the tab for their nursing and home-based care.  These are serious healthcare problems around this country. By the way, we never heard anything in the campaign of 2016 about how we were going to turn back the clock on older women for whom Medicaid is often a lifeline for long-term care, but that is what we are dealing with now. These are serious healthcare challenges women face right now--on top of it, a raging epidemic of opioid misuse and abuse and the skyrocketing cost of prescription medicine. When we are talking about the Office of Refugee Resettlement, as my colleagues talked about so eloquently, there is also a lot to be done to fix our broken immigration system.  Finally, it is important, as we get into these issues, to recognize how deep-seated this policy of healthcare discrimination is. The example my colleagues are talking about here today is an example of massive ideological overreach and paternalism. It is happening at the Office of Refugee Resettlement, but it is not the only example. This is behavior that ought to stop.  I thank my colleague, Senator Murray, who has been our go-to person for years and years on women's healthcare. I want her and our colleagues to know that I will be doing everything I can to be a part of their efforts to push back on these policies that turn back the clock and particularly discriminate against the rights of women.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                             Budget Reform  ",CREC-2018-03-14-pt1-PgS1696-4.txt,1247,NIFLA V. BECERRA,2018.0,14.0,March
1125,topic-id,237,"Mr.President, this new law has the power to better the lives of hundreds of thousands of children and their families. It will for the first time allow States to invest Federal foster care dollars in evidence-based services, like substance use treatment and mental health and parenting programs, to prevent the need for foster care by keeping families safely together. It will provide critical new opportunities for families adopting children and relatives caring for kin by making these same services available when a child is at risk of reentering foster care. It will also support investments in Kinship Navigator programs to help grandparents and other relative caregivers who often take on the parenting role at a moment's notice.  The opioid crisis is showing why these investments are absolutely critical. After years of decline in the number of children in foster care, we have begun to see a steady increase, which many attribute to the opioid crisis. According to Federal data, at least 34 percent of foster care entries are attributed to parental substance use. Family First will be a game changer when it comes to fighting addiction, as States will now have many more tools to address these issues without breaking families apart. These tools will not only help with the current opioid epidemic, but they will position our Nation's child welfare system to respond to this crisis and any others that families may face in the future.

1752,topic-id,434,"Mr.President, in a few minutes the Senate will vote on the nomination of Mr.Kevin McAleenan to serve as Commissioner of U.Customs and Border  As the ranking Democrat on the committee with jurisdiction over trade policy, I am particularly interested in working with Mr.McAleenan on an issue that is of longstanding, bipartisan concern; and that is tougher, smarter enforcement of America's trade laws.  Mr.McAleenan is a longtime public servant, and he has been aware that the Finance Committee has put in many hours over the last few years to guarantee that this agency has tough new tools to fight trade cheats and protect our workers. It is vital that those tools be put to good use because their trade-related mission--defending American jobs from trade rip-offs--has too often gotten short shrift. It doesn't matter what kind of trade deals you sign or what laws you put on the books if you aren't serious about enforcing them. That is where their trade mission comes in.  In my discussions with this nominee, it is clear that he understands that when it comes to trade, this country has to do trade done right, and tougher trade enforcement is especially important.  I will close with the mention of another issue that this agency has seen over the last few months, and that is the onslaught of Americans being stopped at the border and forced to unlock their personal electronic devices for inspection. It clearly invades their personal privacy.  Senator Paul and I have introduced bipartisan legislation on this--there is bipartisan legislation in the other body--that recognizes that law enforcement should have to get a warrant before searching a device at the border, and it comes with strong protections to[[Page S1780]]let Americans know when and how they consent to having their devices searched.  In my judgment, this is just common sense, particularly because the U.Supreme Court has already ruled that digital is fundamentally different. They did that when they ruled that law enforcement needs a warrant to search a phone after an arrest.  We are going to keep pushing for our bipartisan legislation. In the meantime, we need to work with this agency on this critical issue that ensures, once again, that this country recognizes that security and liberty are not mutually exclusive and that you can have policies that do both.  I want to continue to engage with him, if confirmed, to make sure that the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans do not disappear at the border.

While he spent his entire time in Congress in the minority party, he made a priority of seeking out opportunities and friends on both sides of the aisle.  Representative Winn served on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs for many years, ultimately becoming the ranking member on the committee. During his time working on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the United States grappled with major world events such as the Cold War, the Vietnam war, and conflict in the Middle In addition to his role on the Foreign Affairs Committee, he also represented the U.as a congressional representative to the United Nations, appointed by President In all of these roles, he was an excellent representative of our country to the rest of the world.  Larry took tremendous pride in serving the people of the Third Constituent service was always one of his top priorities, and he believed that solving problems for his constituents was one of his most important responsibilities. If someone had an issue with a Federal agency, Larry and his staff would make sure that it got resolved. This principle of valuing and serving each individual constituent in the district is one that I try to follow to this day trying to fill his shoes.  He lived a great life outside of Congress as well. Larry was an alumnus of the University of Kansas school of journalism and a proud I have even heard that he taught lifelong Wildcat current Senator Pat Roberts how to ``Wave the Wheat.''

Larry was a mentor to me and so many aspiring elected officials in Kansas, dispensing valuable advice, and old war stories to help guide us along. He had a gift for humor and an ease with people that served him well in all of his endeavors. And most of all, he was a great man.  While we will mourn the loss of Larry, I take comfort knowing that he is now being reunited with Joan, his beloved wife of 73 years, who passed away in 2015. Larry also leaves behind a large and loving family. His legacy will live on through his four children--Larry Winn III, Douglas Winn, Janet Payne, and Cynthia Burr--plus 8 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.  Larry's legacy will live on in other public servants whom he mentored and inspired.

Today, we passed several bills about One was 676, calling out the Iranian regime to stop suppressing and oppressing their citizens who just want those things that are innate to all human beings on this planet, that we believe in as Americans, and that are those inalienable rights that come from our Creator: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  The Iranian people are staging legitimate protests to condemn the Iranian regime for corruption of the economy and funding of terrorist organizations while neglecting the basic needs of the Iranian citizens, only to have their protests in opposition of the corruption by the Iranian regime be shut down and crushed through unwarranted bloodshedding and arrests.  If you look at the Iranian regime over the last 30 years since they took control of Iran, it has been nothing but bloodshed and mayhem. And if you look at the conflicts that we have been involved in in the Middle East since the entry of Afghanistan and the Iraqi wars, if you look at our servicemen and -women who have been harmed in those battles or injured or died, 70 percent of those were caused by Ninety percent of those IEDs were supported and produced by the Iranian regime.  The people of Iran stood up in 2009. The administration of the United States at that time refused to back the Iranian people who wanted those basic rights that we just talked about: freedoms and liberties.  Our Nation was founded on the idea that every individual is granted three basic rights: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And again, we, as Americans, believe in these inalienable rights. I find it appalling that the Iranian regime is using deadly force in order to deny the Iranian people their basic freedoms.  We are in the 21st century in the world, and you see a clear divide: the Western ideologies that believe in these God-given rights that we have, and then you see the regimes and dictatorships around the world that are suppressing the very innate abilities that we are all born with. They are trying to suppress these innate abilities. By doing that, they do it through intimidation, coercion, torture, death.  The leader of the IRGC came out in a statement, and it is in Ed Royce's resolution that we voted on today, 676, that said they will investigate it, they will bring it to an end, and they will quash these protests and it will be done with. So that is the intent of the Iranian regime, to bring this to an end through force because they fear free-thinking people.  We are so blessed in our country of having the ability to speak out, to be able to protest peacefully, to assemble peacefully; and that is something I think sometimes we, as Americans, take for granted. This is something that all you have to do is look at what is going on around the world to see a despotic regime that is afraid of empowering its people.  The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, must be recognized for what he is: the dictator of an oppressive regime which once again showed the world its true colors by its horrific response to the peaceful and legitimate protests that began on December 28, that saw thousands in prisons, with the leaders being threatened with death, and over two dozen having been killed.  I want to send the message that we, the United States, support the rights of those brave Iranians who are peacefully protesting the oppressive Iranian regime; and they are peacefully protesting, again, for the right to pursue life, liberty, and happiness.

Fearlessly, he went on to not only beat those odds, but, along the way, demonstrated the beginning and the end of our universe as we know it today.  Hawking taught us that, if you dare to dream and work hard, you can succeed; and I know he is responsible for inspiring many of our scientific minds, both young and old alike.  As we celebrate his life, let us remember not only his accomplishments, academic and otherwise, but his fighting spirit. We are grateful for all he taught us and the legacy he left our world. Let us all remember him by embracing his steadfast determination and lead lives of action, as he did.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-15-pt1-PgH1646-4.txt,2115,DIRECTING THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY TO REGAIN,2018.0,15.0,March
1821,topic-id,1775,"Mr.President, in light of the vote later today on the Sanders-Lee-Murphy legislation, or S.54, I rise today to discuss the situation in Yemen and the path forward. As many know, over the last year I have focused persistently on the humanitarian crisis in  My activities have been manyfold. I have issued letters to the administration and the Saudi Government, an administration nomination, hearings, a Senate resolution, and countless meetings, briefings, and phone calls with senior administration officials, Saudi officials, and leaders of the NGO community.  My goal? My goal has been to address impediments to the delivery of humanitarian assistance--food, fuel, and medicine--into the country of  Now, we have seen some progress, and I have been encouraged by this. The USAID-funded World Food Programme cranes have been delivered, and the Red Sea ports have been opened. According to the United Nations, since the ports were open, we have seen more than 884,000 metric tons of food and more than 410,000 metric tons of fuel delivered to the ports of Hodeidah and Saleef alone.  Of course, we understand the importance of the food. But why is the fuel so important? Well, without the fuel, you can't run the water treatment facilities and, therefore, the cholera epidemic that has broken out in Yemen will only get worse. So 884,000 metric tons of food and more than 410,000 metric tons of fuel have resulted in the saving of countless of lives in Yemen.[[Page S1817]]  Look, there is a continued humanitarian crisis in A lot of problems persist, and we need to address those. We have seen progress with respect to the delivery of some of the humanitarian assistance I mentioned, but commercial and humanitarian vessels have been offloading their lifesaving cargo less quickly than we would like. So there is a lot left for us to do.  The National Security Council presidential statement issued on March 15 related to Yemen indicated that there are still over 22 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. This is the world's largest humanitarian disaster. The risk of famine persists for millions of  The Saudi-led coalition continues, unfortunately, to impose unacceptable delays on ships carrying food and fuel into Yemeni ports. According to the U.N., the Saudi-led coalition caused 5.9 days of additional delay in the month of February on ships going to the major ports of Hodeidah and Those delays continue this month.  Now, why does this matter? Well, this matters, of course, because we don't want people to suffer. It is inconsistent with our basic human values. It is inconsistent with what we Americans believe. When people suffer, it also exacerbates a national security crisis. It facilitates radicalization.  In fact, last week I chaired a Foreign Relations Committee subcommittee on this very topic--the connection between food insecurity, specifically, and the instability or radicalization of those who are food insecure. The hearing demonstrated that there is now a strong, evidentiary, and academic basis to conclude that it is in America's clear national security interest to address food insecurity, as well as a lack of fuel and medicine. A retired Marine Corps general testified at that hearing, Lieutenant General I thought he put it succinctly. He said: ``Food crises [can] grow terrorists.'' Well, we have seen a lot of terrorists grown in Yemen in recent years.  The longer the civil war persists in Yemen, the worse the humanitarian crisis will grow. This will radicalize yet more people and provide even further opportunities to Iran to undermine our national security interests and those of our partners.  What are our objectives in Yemen? That is a fair question. It is one that all of us as policymakers and, really, all Americans ought to be asking. Well, consistent with our humanitarian principles and our national security interests, I believe we have to continue to pursue two primary objectives. First, we want to address the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, and, second, we want to press all parties to end the civil war.  The real question here--because I don't think there is agreement on those two primary objectives--is how can we best achieve these two goals? That takes me to the Sanders-Lee-Murphy resolution before us today. We, of course, need to fulfill our article I constitutional responsibilities. Article I, section 8, of the Constitution indicates that it is Congress's responsibility to declare a war, and it is Congress's responsibility to authorize the use of military force. I share Senator Lee's conviction, Senator Sanders' conviction, and Senator Murphy's conviction that we need to take that responsibility very, very seriously. This is why I introduced an authorization for the use of military force last year. It is also why I have been working with Chairman Corker of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Kaine, and other members of the committee to break a logjam in negotiations--some principled disagreements that exist with respect to what the authorization for the use of military force should look like moving forward.  We have finalized an updated AUMF against Islamic terrorist groups like al-Qaida and ISIS that will merit consideration in coming weeks. In fact, we heard from Chairman He has now offered a public assurance that there will be hearings on the issue of authorizing military force and there will be marking-up and reporting of legislation so that this 17-year-old authorization for the use of military force can be re-upped. My own view is that whatever one thinks of the legal merits of this long war under the authorizations given in 2001 and 2002, the further away we get from that point in time, where a past Congress authorized force, the more attenuated that argument is and the less power it has. Moreover, we owe it to the men and women in uniform to consistently debate our involvement in overseas conflicts. So I commend the chairman for agreeing with other members of the committee that we need to have hearings and to pass legislation specifically on this matter through the committee of jurisdiction through what we call regular order.  Let me share with those who are watching my remarks here today what I believe the wrong approach is. I believe S.54 is the wrong approach. That resolution sidesteps the Senate Foreign Relations It doesn't lead to the sort of fulsome debate. It doesn't allow us to hear from professional witnesses and members of the administration the way a formal committee hearing and markup would allow.  Moreover, the legislation is never going to become law. It will never become law. It is an exercise in messaging. Now, messaging is important. We need to make the argument, and I respect my colleagues for making their principled arguments. They are strong in conviction, and they make each of them quite articulately. But the administration has already indicated that the President wouldn't sign this into law. The administration has already indicated that they do not regard, under the law, that we are engaging in hostilities, which is required to trigger the law they have invoked. So this will never become law.  Moreover, we most certainly will not be overriding a Presidential veto should this pass out of the Senate and the House and go to the President, whereupon he would veto it. So this will never become law.  The last reason I think S.54 is the wrong approach is because it will not achieve our shared objectives. It would fail to achieve its stated objective because the administration rejects the premise of the Sanders-Lee legislation related to hostilities, as I have already stated.  So there is a better approach. Rather than just criticizing S.54--and let me be careful to distinguish between criticizing the legislation that we will be voting on later and my colleagues, because I have great respect for my colleagues and their motives. I wanted to play a more constructive role in this debate. So I wanted to introduce legislation that would provide leverage to pressure the Saudis to actually end the civil war in Yemen and to actually improve the humanitarian situation. At the same time, we have to acknowledge and respond to Iran's malign behavior in Yemen, as well as the presence in Yemen of ISIS and AQAP--al-Qaida in the Arabian This is arguably the most aggressive and most dangerous al-Qaida franchise in the world. We also have to recognize Saudi Arabia's legitimate right to not have ballistic missiles launched into their cities. This is our partner.  So I wanted to develop a bipartisan compromise that could actually pass out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, be passed by both Chambers, and signed by the President of the United I think we are well on our way to doing that. I wanted to develop legislation that would actually further its stated purpose and our objectives in Yemen--ending the civil war and addressing the humanitarian crisis.  So that is why I and Senator Shaheen introduced S.55 on March 8. Now, since then, we worked with the committee, we have worked with members of both parties, and we have worked with the administration and outside experts to further refine our legislation, making numerous substantive changes and principled compromises.  The current version of our legislation would require the Department of State to certify in an unclassified and written report that Saudi Arabia is undertaking the following: 1, an urgent and good-faith effort to conduct diplomatic negotiations to end the civil war in Yemen; 2, appropriate measures to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Yemen by increasing access for Yemenis to food, fuel, and medicine, including through Yemen's Red Sea ports, the airport in Sana'a, and external border crossings with Saudi Arabia; and, 3, demonstrable action to reduce the risk of harm to civilians and civilian infrastructure resulting from its[[Page S1818]]military operations in Yemen, including by complying with applicable agreements and laws regulating the use of cluster munitions and other defense articles and services purchased or transferred from the United  Now, if the Department of State can't make that certification, then U.air refueling missions, which are essential to the Saudi coalition's operations, would end. They would be prohibited under our law. Given the humanitarian crisis in Yemen and our national security interests there, I appreciate Chairman Corker's commitment today to mark up Yemen legislation in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when we return from recess in  So based on this reasoning, which I have laid out quite clearly here today, I plan to oppose the Sanders-Lee-Murphy legislation today. Instead, I will support legislation like ours that could actually become law and would provide the administration the leverage they need to result in real change in  Thank you.  I yield the floor.
