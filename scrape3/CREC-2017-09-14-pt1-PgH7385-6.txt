             RECOGNIZING KINGWOOD, NEW JERSEY, RESCUE SQUAD

  (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and thank the 
members of the Kingwood, New Jersey, Rescue Squad for helping a 
community in need recover from Hurricane Harvey.
  After Harvey, many in the Houston area were without cell phone 
service, stranded by the rising waters, and lacking necessary means of 
communications to call authorities for help. One family in Kingwood, 
Texas, without cell reception but with a wireless internet connection 
made the savvy decision to see if they could contact rescue services by 
email. They used an internet search to locate the necessary authorities 
to coordinate their rescue.
  Their internet search yielded the name Kingwood Rescue Squad--not 
their Kingwood, but Kingwood in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. 
Fortunately, the members of the New Jersey Kingwood Rescue Squad acted 
quickly to contact their partners in Texas to ensure that rescue 
services would be able to find and rescue the Texas family. They are 
now safe due to the coordinated efforts between the Kingwood, New 
Jersey, Rescue Squad and their respective partners in Texas.
  I wish to thank the members of the squad for their service and 
express my gratitude that there are such fine and capable first 
responders located in the district I serve.
