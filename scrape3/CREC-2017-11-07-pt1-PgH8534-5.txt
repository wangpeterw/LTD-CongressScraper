                    OPPOSING RYAN-McCONNELL TAX PLAN

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, today, I come to the people's House floor 
in strong opposition to the Ryan-McConnell billionaires-first tax plan, 
a plan that overwhelmingly benefits the superrich and well-connected, 
and scams the middle class and our most vulnerable Americans.
  But don't just take it from me. According to the Institute on 
Taxation and Economic Policy, working families in my home State of Ohio 
would see their taxes increase by $1,000 per year, while the wealthiest 
Americans, people like President Trump, would see their taxes decrease 
by as much as $747,000, according to the Tax Policy Center.
  Not to be overshadowed, the Tax Policy Center also concluded that 
nearly 80 percent of the bill's benefits pad the pockets of the 
wealthiest Americans. At the same time, it eliminates the medical 
expenses deduction, student loan deduction, and the new markets tax 
credit. That does not seem like fair taxes to me.
  Instead of raising taxes on the middle class, what we should be doing 
is allowing for a better future, better opportunities, better jobs, and 
better wages for all Americans.
