 PAYING TRIBUTE TO HABITAT FOR HUMANITY OF LIVINGSTON COUNTY, MICHIGAN

  (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
an inspirational organization in my district, Habitat for Humanity of 
Livingston County, located in the Eighth District of Michigan.
  This July, Livingston County's Habitat for Humanity is celebrating 
its 25th year of transforming lives by building quality homes.
  Habitat for Humanity was incorporated within Livingston County in 
1992, and since then, the organization is dedicated to many community 
and international service projects.
  Over the past 25 years, Habitat for Humanity has made a positive 
impact on Livingston County, constructing and rehabilitating 18 homes 
for families in need within the community.
  Livingston County's Habitat for Humanity also supports the services 
of Habitat International in its fight against homelessness across the 
world, providing monetary donations which funded and constructed an 
additional 15 homes worldwide.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to congratulate Livingston County's Habitat 
for Humanity for its 25 years of service. Thank you, Habitat for 
Humanity, for your commitment to the people you serve and to our entire 
Livingston County community.
