            CELEBRATING CRARY ART GALLERY'S 40TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the 40th anniversary of one of the treasures of the 
Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District, the Crary Art Gallery. The 
Crary Art Gallery was established in 1977 in Warren, Pennsylvania, by 
painter Gene Crary, and featured works by her late husband, the 
photographer, Clare J. Crary.
  In 1988, the gallery expanded to include the Oriental Room and the 
Fountain Room. Its reopening in 2000 brought the addition of the 
Sculpture Court, featuring works by Marion Sanford.
  Today, the Crary Art Gallery is dedicated to enriching the region's 
cultural offerings through noteworthy temporary exhibitions and the 
display of historical works.
  Beginning August 18, the gallery will celebrate its 40th anniversary 
with the Ruby Exhibition, which will fill the entire museum with the 
finest works from its Permanent Collection, much of which has not been 
seen in many years.
  I wish the Crary Art Gallery the best as it celebrates 40 incredible 
years of enriching the lives of those in the community with its 
invaluable cultural impact.
