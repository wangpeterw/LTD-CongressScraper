             COMMEMORATING OFFICER GLENN ANTHONY DOSS, JR.

  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Officer Glenn 
Anthony Doss, a Detroit police officer who died while serving in the 
line of duty.
  Officer Doss, who joined the police force nearly 2 years ago, was 
answering a call when a gunman opened fire and shot Officer Doss in the 
head before he could get out of his patrol car. He was immediately 
rushed to the hospital, but, unfortunately, he died on Sunday, January 
28, 2018.
  Officer Doss is what we call an American hero. He did what any police 
officer does the moment they put on their uniform and go out and serve 
their community with courage and honor, knowing that even the smallest 
interaction may put their life in harm's way.
  Officer Doss followed in his father's footsteps who has been a member 
of the Detroit Police Department for nearly 20 years.
  I want to say God bless his memory, his family, his friends, and the 
Detroit Police Department for the work they do. He had a 9-month-old 
child.
