       HONORING KATHLEEN JIMINO ON THE OCCASION OF HER RETIREMENT

  (Mr. FASO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I rise today to 
recognize and celebrate the career of Mrs. Kathleen Jimino on the 
occasion of her retirement as Rensselaer County executive. Kathy has 
retired after 16 years of dedicated service to the people of Rensselaer 
County.
  Throughout her tenure as county executive, Kathy was a driving force 
for economic growth and fiscal solvency in Rensselaer County, actively 
responding to the needs of her constituency in an effective and 
resourceful manner.
  In addition to the time as county executive, I am grateful for the 
many years Kathy spent loyally serving the people of New York State and 
the city of Troy.
  Kathy has been an esteemed leader of the community, and I thank her 
for her commitment to New York's 19th Congressional District. I wish 
Kathy and her husband, Vince, every happiness as they embark upon this 
new chapter in their lives.
