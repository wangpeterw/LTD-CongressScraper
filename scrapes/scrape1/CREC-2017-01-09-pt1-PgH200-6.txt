                 U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 2334

  (Mr. HOLDING asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, just before Christmas, the U.N. Security 
Council passed a resolution condemning Israel.
  I believe it goes almost without saying that Israel is our most 
trusted ally in the Middle East, which is why I find this so troubling, 
Mr. Speaker. The Obama administration had the power to veto the 
resolution and support one of our only allies in the region, but 
President Obama, less than a month from leaving office, dictated the 
United States would sit on the sidelines.
  Well, Mr. Speaker, I am committed to preserving our alliance with 
Israel and ensuring a lasting peace is found in the region--a position 
that has been expressed multiple times on the floor of this House by my 
colleagues--and I believe we can't afford to sit on the sidelines 
anymore.
  Mr. Speaker, the United States supports Israel. The Obama 
administration is leaving behind a failed foreign policy legacy, but 
our alliance with Israel will endure.
  Former Senator Jesse Helms believed the United Nations required 
fundamental reform to address these kinds of problems. I believe this 
latest action by the Security Council underscores that need.
