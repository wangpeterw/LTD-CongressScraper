                    TAX RELIEF FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES

  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, hardworking families in Michigan have been 
squeezed for far too long under our broken Tax Code. Wages aren't going 
up, yet the cost of living keeps getting more expensive.
  We developed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with those low- and middle-
income families in mind. They need a break.
  For folks in Michigan, in Monroe, Jackson, Charlotte, and all across 
my district, this tax cut plan means bigger paychecks and more money in 
their pocket. At every income level, people will see meaningful tax 
relief.
  Our plan doubles the standard deduction and increases the child tax 
credit to help with the costs of raising a family. It also eases the 
tax burden on small businesses so they can give their workers a raise 
and create more jobs in the community. It brings back jobs from 
overseas and incentivizes job creators to expand and hire here at home.
  Mr. Speaker, this is a progrowth and proworker plan. Let's pass it 
today and help the families we represent get the relief they need.
