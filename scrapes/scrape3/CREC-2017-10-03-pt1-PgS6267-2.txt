                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Hear our prayers, Eternal God, as You bend Your ears toward us. 
Provide for the needs of the high and low, the rich and poor, the just 
and unjust.
  Empower our Senators to love even their enemies, to bless those who 
curse them, and to pray for those who seek to misuse them. Lord, give 
our lawmakers lips that speak wisdom, hearts that love purity, and 
minds that embrace understanding. Deliver them from fear, even in 
calamitous times. May they not trust in wealth or might but put their 
faith in You, the author and finisher of destinies.
  We pray in Your marvelous Name. Amen.
