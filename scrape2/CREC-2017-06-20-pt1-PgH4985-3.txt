                           WORLD REFUGEE DAY

  (Mr. TED LIEU of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of 
World Refugee Day.
  We are facing the worst refugee crisis in history, with over 65 
million refugees; half of them are children.
  When I served on Active Duty in the U.S. Air Force, I participated in 
Operation Pacific Haven. The U.S. military went into northern Iraq. We 
extracted thousands of Kurdish refugees, brought them to Andersen Air 
Force Base in Guam, and then sent most of them to the United States. We 
saved their lives, and, to this day, the Kurds remain one of America's 
strongest allies.
  Helping refugees is not only the moral thing to do; it helps our 
national security. That is why I am honored to introduce bipartisan 
legislation with Representative Ros-Lehtinen to promote the health, 
safety, and well-being of refugees.
