                         PREPARING FOR DISASTER

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, with hurricane season underway, my 
constituents in Florida and all Americans living in coastal regions are 
susceptible to these devastating storms.
  Disaster can strike at any time, often with little warning. It is 
never too early to prepare. Know your evacuation routes and have a 
supply kit ready. Also important, ensure your home is structurally 
sound to withstand intense winds and rain.
  Taking steps now to reinforce a roof covering or protect an exterior 
window could mean the difference between saving money in the long run 
and dealing with major property damage.
  That is why I am introducing the SHELTER Act, to provide tax credits 
to encourage people to stormproof their homes and properties. This 
legislation is about helping our communities be proactive when it comes 
to preparing for hurricane season.
  Our local emergency managers in Pasco, Pinellas, and Hillsborough 
Counties do an incredible job of ensuring our communities are ready. 
But preparedness must also begin at home.
