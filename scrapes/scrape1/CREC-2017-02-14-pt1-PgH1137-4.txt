                     HONORING THE LIFE OF ED MOORE

  (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Ed 
Moore, who was truly a pillar of our community in northern Indiana.
  In 1979, Ed founded the Christian radio station, WFRN, which has been 
a beacon of faith and joy to its family of listeners for nearly 4 
decades. I have had the privilege of visiting the WFRN studio many 
times over the past 5, 6 years. Each time, I saw Ed's passion for 
serving the Lord and helping listeners strengthen their faith. WFRN has 
had such a positive impact on so many lives, and Ed's legacy is that it 
will continue to do so.
  In announcing Ed's passing, his family noted they were saddened, yet 
rejoicing, because Ed is with the Lord.
  Mr. Speaker, I join Ed's children, Doug, Steve, and Rachelle, his 11 
grandchildren, and the entire WFRN family in mourning Ed's passing, 
celebrating his life, and rejoicing that today he is with the Lord.
