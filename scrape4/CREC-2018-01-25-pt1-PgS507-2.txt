                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Lord God, the Giver of every good and perfect gift, thank You 
for this fresh opportunity to do Your will on Earth.
  Guide our lawmakers. Give them consciences void of offense toward You 
and humanity and honesty of conduct. May they bring You their daily 
challenges, casting their cares on You. Lord, help them to draw more 
fully from Your inexhaustible resources, claiming Your promise to 
provide for all their needs. Use them to bring peace, justice, and 
prosperity to our Nation.
  And Lord, bless the members of the illustrious fall 2017 page class 
as they prepare to leave us.
  We pray in Your loving Name. Amen.
