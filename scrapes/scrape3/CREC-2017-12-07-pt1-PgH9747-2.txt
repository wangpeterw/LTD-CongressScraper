 HONORING PEARL HARBOR SURVIVOR AND WORLD WAR II VETERAN CLARENCE VAROS

  (Ms. CHENEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, on this historic day in this Chamber where 
President Roosevelt appeared the day after the Pearl Harbor attack, I 
rise to honor a World War II veteran and Pearl Harbor survivor, Mr. 
Clarence Varos, who will turn 100 this weekend.
  Born on December 10, 1917, Mr. Varos has served our country and State 
in many ways. As a member of the U.S. Navy, Mr. Varos fought through 
and survived the attack on Pearl Harbor. He risked his life in the 
defense of freedom as a gunner on the USS Hyde, transporting marines in 
the Pacific theater. After bravely serving our Nation in uniform, Mr. 
Varos went on to dedicate 30 years of his life to the Union Pacific 
Railroad.
  I want to thank Mr. Varos for all he has contributed to our great 
Nation and State. His sacrifice, bravery, and grit are an example to us 
all. I look forward to congratulating Mr. Varos in person at 
celebrations in his honor this weekend in Cheyenne. I would like to say 
happy birthday to Mr. Varos and thank him for his service.
