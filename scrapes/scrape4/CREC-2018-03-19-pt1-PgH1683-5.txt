            RECOGNIZING FARMERS ON NATIONAL AGRICULTURE DAY

  (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, this National Agriculture Week, I rise to 
recognize the hardworking farmers across this great Nation who get up 
every day and, by the sweat of their brow, grow the food we eat. The 
district I represent in west Texas is home to 14 million acres of 
farmland, making it one of the largest agriculture production regions 
in the world. Our farmers and ranchers feed and clothe the American 
people and help fuel the American economy.
  Agriculture contributes to 20-plus million jobs, and it is our 
country's number one export. But, more importantly, it provides a safe, 
affordable, and abundant supply of food for our citizens, which has 
tremendous national security implications. We can never put ourselves 
in a position where we depend on other countries for our food. That is 
not a vision for a safe, strong, and free America.
  When we sit down with our families to eat dinner this week, let's 
remember to thank God for our food and for the farmers he uses to help 
make it. Mr. Speaker, these folks work hard and take enormous risks so 
this country can maintain its greatness so that America can continue to 
be the most powerful, the most prosperous, and the most generous 
country in the history of the world.
  God bless our farmers. God bless America.
