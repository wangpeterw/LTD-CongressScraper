                        A TRIBUTE TO HALLIE SHAE

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Hallie Shae, an 
intern in my Aberdeen, SD, office for all of the hard work she has done 
for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.
  Hallie is a graduate of Deuel High School in Clear Lake, SD. 
Currently, she is attending Northern State University, where she is 
majoring in sociology, with an emphasis in criminal justice. Hallie is 
a dedicated worker who has been committed to getting the most out of 
her experience.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Hallie Shae for all of 
the fine work she has done and wish her continued success in the years 
to come.
