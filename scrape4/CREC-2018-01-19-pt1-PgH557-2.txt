                                 PRAYER

  Rabbi Mara Nathan, Temple Beth-El, San Antonio, Texas, offered the 
following prayer:
  Holy One of blessing, You are the source of all. Regardless of our 
faith traditions, we recognize a force in the universe calling each of 
us to fulfill our potential.
  We challenge ourselves to compensate for our shortcomings and 
emphasize our talents and energies for the greater good. We dedicate 
ourselves, each in our own way, to a life of service and meaning. 
Committed to the ideals of our great Nation, we are ever working 
towards the promise of what is still yet to be.
  Therefore, we pray that You bestow the blessings of foresight, 
compassion, and patience upon the women and men of our Congress. May 
they be united in working for the good of our Nation, and may they 
recognize the spark of holiness in every human being.
  Bless our leaders with strong minds and open hearts, ever ready to 
serve with integrity, purpose, and honor.
  Amen.
