                          KEEPING OUR PROMISE

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I looked at the calendar today and saw 
there was no Dream Act vote on the floor this week. As we approach 
tomorrow, a potential CR, Republican and Democrats must support this 
bipartisan Dream Act.
  These are hardworking men and women, young people. They are doctors 
and artists, scientists and police officers, mentors and EMTs. These 
are Americans through and through.
  We made a promise that we must keep. We need to protect the rights 
and principles that our country was founded on and thrives upon.
  We demand a vote for a clean Dream Act today. We demand a vote for a 
clean Dream Act tomorrow.
