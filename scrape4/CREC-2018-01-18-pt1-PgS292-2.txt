                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT

  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget 
scorekeeping report for January 2018. The report compares current-law 
levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to 
in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2018, H. Con. Res. 71. This 
information is necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine 
whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. The 
Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional 
Budget Office CBO prepared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of 
the Congressional Budget Act, CBA.
  The enforceable levels included in this report reflect all of the 
numerical adjustments made to the resolution since its passage. These 
adjustments include an update to enforceable levels for legislation 
enacted after the June 2017 CBO baseline was released but before 
enactment of the resolution, October 30, 2017; a revision to aggregates 
and allocations to accommodate legislation fulfilling the budget 
resolution's reconciliation instructions, December 19, 2017; and a 
revision to aggregates and the Appropriations Committee's allocation 
for emergency spending found in Fiscal Year 2018's third continuing 
resolution, H.R. 1370, December 21, 2017.
  The information contained in this report captures legislative 
activity from the passage of the budget resolution through January 11, 
2018.
  Republican Budget Committee staff prepared tables 1 through 4 of this 
report.
  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee 
exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays 
under the most recently adopted budget resolution. This information is 
used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the 
CBA. For this reporting period, 13 of the 16 authorizing committees are 
in compliance with their allocations. First, the Veterans' Affairs and 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committees violated their 
allocations in December 2017, the former with a $2.1 billion extension 
of the Veterans Choice Program and the latter through a package of 
health extenders. Both of these extensions were included as separate 
divisions on the Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 
2018, P.L. 115-96. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee violated 
its allocation earlier this month with the passage of the Western 
Oregon Tribal Fairness Act, P.L. 115-103, which is estimated to 
increase spending by $5 million over the next 10 years. The Armed 
Services Committee, on the other hand, reduced spending over the budget 
window. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, 
P.L. 115-91, produced $16 million in outlay savings over the 
enforceable window.
  Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on 
Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This 
information is used to determine points of order related to the 
spending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of the CBA. While no 
full-year appropriations bills have been enacted for Fiscal Year 2018, 
subcommittees are charged with permanent and advanced appropriations 
that first become available in that year.
  The budget resolution contains two points of order limiting the use 
of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, CHIMPS. 
Tables 3 and 4 show compliance with Fiscal Year 2018 limits for overall 
CHIMPS and the Crime Victims Fund CHIMP, respectively. This information 
is used for determining points of order under section 4102 and section 
4103 of H. Con. Res. 71, respectively. Notably, there have not been any 
full-year bills enacted thus far for Fiscal Year 2018 that include 
CHIMPS.
  In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican 
staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget 
totals approved by the Congress.
  CBO provided a spending and revenue report for Fiscal Year 2018, 
which helps enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions 
under CBA section 311. In its report, CBO annualizes the temporary 
effects of the latest continuing resolution, which provides funding 
through January 19, 2018. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, 
the Budget Committee excludes this temporary funding. As such, the 
committee views current-law levels as being $836.3 billion and $468.6 
billion below budget resolution levels for budget authority and 
outlays, respectively.
  Current-law revenues continue to be in excess of the levels assumed 
by the budget resolution. On-budget revenue levels currently exceed 
assumed levels by $17.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2018, $84.3 billion over 
the Fiscal Year 2018-2022 period, and $135.4 billion over the Fiscal 
Year 2018-2027 period. These figures reflect current enforceable levels 
following the use of the reserve fund found in section 3003 of H. Con. 
Res. 71 for H.R. 1, which is commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act of 2017, P.L. 115-97.
  Social Security outlay levels are consistent with the budget 
resolution's figures for all enforceable periods. Social Security 
revenues, however, are

[[Page S293]]

$500 million below levels assumed for Fiscal Year 2018, $2.8 billion 
greater over the next 5 years and $26.9 billion greater than assumed 
over the next 10 years. These off-budget effects were generated by the 
reconciliation bill but not covered by the reserve fund adjustment 
filed, which pertained only to on-budget enforcement.
  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate 
pay-as-you-go, PAYGO rule. The Senate's PAYGO scorecard currently shows 
deficit reduction of $24 million in Fiscal Year 2018, $14 million over 
the Fiscal Year 2017-2022, and $15 million over Fiscal Year 2017-2027 
periods. For Fiscal Year 2018, legislation has been enacted that would 
reduce outlays by $24 million. Over the Fiscal Year 2017-2022 period, 
legislation has been enacted that CBO estimates will decrease outlays 
by $13 million and increase revenues by $1 million. Over the Fiscal 
Year 2017-2027 period, legislation has been enacted that CBO estimates 
will decrease outlays by $11 million and increase revenues by $4 
million. Notably absent from these amounts are the veterans and health 
extenders from the third continuing resolution discussed earlier. This 
is due to a provision in that measure that mandated the exclusion of 
those budgetary effects from both the Senate and statutory PAYGO 
scorecards. The Senate's PAYGO rule is enforced by section 4106 of H. 
Con. Res. 71, the Fiscal Year 2018 budget resolution.
  Finally, included in this submission is a table tracking the Senate's 
budget enforcement activity on the floor since the adoption of the 
budget resolution. During this reporting period, there were seven 
budgetary points of order raised in the Senate. Six of these points of 
order were raised during consideration of fiscal year 2018 
reconciliation legislation. Votes to waive the CBA with respect to each 
of the points of order, ranging from Byrd Rule violations to committee 
allocation breaches, failed. Senator Rand Paul raised the final 
budgetary point of order, for a violation of the Budget Committee's 
jurisdiction, against H.R. 1370, the third continuing resolution. The 
Senate waived the CBA with respect to this point of order by a vote of 
91-8.
  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.
  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in 
the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

     Hon. Mike Enzi,
     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,
     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of 
     Congressional action on the fiscal year 2018 budget and is 
     current through January 11, 2018. This report is submitted 
     under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the 
     Congressional Budget Act, as amended.
       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues 
     are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of 
     H. Con. Res. 71, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 
     Fiscal Year 2018.
       This is CBO's first current level report for fiscal year 
     2018.
           Sincerely,
                                                       Keith Hall,
                                                         Director.
       Enclosure.

a Emergency funding that was not designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the
  Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 does not count for certain budgetary enforcement
  purposes. These amounts, which are not included in the current level totals, are as follows:


 
                                                                    Budget

b Sections 1001-1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (Public Law 114-255), provided funding for innovation
  projects and state responses to opioid abuse. CBO estimated that for fiscal year 2018, these sections provided
  a combined $866 million in budget authority, which would result in $706 million in outlays. However,
  consistent with sections 1001-1004 of P.L. 114-255, for the purposes of estimating the budgetary effects of
  those provisions under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (Budget Control Act) and
  the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act), those amounts are
  estimated to provide no budget authority or outlays.
c For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as
  approved by the Senate, does not include budget authonty, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a
  result, current level does not include these items.
d Periodically, the Senate Committee on the Budget revises the budgetary levels in H. Con. Res. 71, pursuant to
  various provisions of the resolution:
