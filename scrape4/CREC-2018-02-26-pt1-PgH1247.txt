  MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING THOSE KILLED AT MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS 
                              HIGH SCHOOL

  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of 17 
members of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School community in 
Parkland, Florida, and do so in the presence of some of their 
classmates:
  Alyssa, Chris, Meadow, Scott, Luke, Helena, Martin, Cara, Alex, 
Nicholas, Gina, Carmen, Aaron, Joaquin, Peter, Jaime, and Alaina.
  On February 14, 2018, they were killed in yet another senseless act 
of gun violence.
  As we bow in silence, I ask that we remember those we lost, I ask 
that we lift up the families who are grieving, and I ask that we offer 
prayers of healing for those who were injured and prayers of peace for 
the 3,300 survivors.
  I ask that our quiet contemplation stir courage within the Members of 
this body--the courage to take action to ensure the freedom of our 
students, the freedom to learn without fear, and to take action to 
secure the freedom of all Americans to live in communities without gun 
violence.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members and guests in the gallery, please 
rise for a moment of silence.

                          ____________________
