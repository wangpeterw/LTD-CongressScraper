     the State of Tennessee applying to the United States 
     Congress, under the provisions of Article V of the United

     national debt through improper and imprudent spending; and

     a proper interpretation of the United States Constitution;

     Constitution through a Convention of the States under Article 
     V for the purpose of restraining these and related abuses of
