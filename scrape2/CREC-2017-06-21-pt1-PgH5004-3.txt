                    CONGRATULATING CARLY CLAUCHERTY

  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Carly Claucherty 
for being named a Presidential Scholar in Career and Technical 
Education.
  Carly recently graduated from Springport High School and was 
nominated for her outstanding work in their CTE agriscience program. 
She is one of just 20 students from around the country to receive this 
distinguished award.
  In high school, Carly was active in Springport's Future Farmers of 
America chapter, served as president of the National Honor Society, and 
was involved in student council. This fall, Carly will be attending 
Michigan State University, where she tentatively plans to study crop 
and soil sciences.
  Carly's selection as a CTE Presidential Scholar puts her in an elite 
group, but I suspect it is just a starting point for many more 
exceptional things to come.
  Mr. Speaker, career and technical education provides valuable hands-
on experience, and this week we will be voting for strengthening these 
important programs to help more students find their sweet spot, just 
like Carly did.
