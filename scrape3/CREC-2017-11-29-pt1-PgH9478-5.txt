                                     House of Representatives,

                                Washington, DC, November 28, 2017.
     Hon. Paul Ryan,

       Dear Speaker Ryan: This letter is to inform you that due to 
     my election to the Committee on Homeland Security, I am 
     resigning my seat on the Committee on Small Business. It has 
     been a privilege and an honor to serve with Chairman Chabot 
     and address the issues facing small businesses in our 
     country. I look forward to continuing to serve small 
     businesses and my constituents in other capacities.
           Very Respectfully,
                                                        Don Bacon,
                                               Member of Congress.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the resignation is 
accepted.
  There was no objection.
