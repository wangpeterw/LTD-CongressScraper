              HONORING THE LIFE OF TROOPER TIMOTHY O'NEILL

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. Mitchell) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a fallen hero. Tragically, 
Michigan State Trooper Timothy O'Neill made the ultimate sacrifice in 
an on-duty motorcycle accident.
  I rise to offer my support and love to Trooper O'Neill's friends, 
family, and all who were fortunate enough to know him. As the proud 
parent of a police officer, I can only imagine the pain you must feel. 
Words are inadequate at such a time of sorrow, but please know you are 
in my prayers.
  Trooper O'Neill was known by his friends, fiancee, and family for his 
sense of humor, compassion for animals, and deep love for his family. 
He is also remembered for his commitment to bettering our community and 
our safety.
  I ask my colleagues and all those watching to join me in a prayer for 
Trooper O'Neill; his fiancee, Carli Hicks; parents, Kristine and 
Michael O'Neill; siblings, Sara O'Neill and Brian O'Neill; and his 
entire family.
  May God bless them all.
