                                 PRAYER

  Pastor Becky Tirabassi, Viewpoint Church, Newport Beach, California, 
offered the following prayer:
  Father, I pray for the immediate outpouring of Your Holy Spirit on 
our Nation and leaders.
  I pray that not one of us will miss hearing Your voice today.
  I pray that we would not neglect to ask for Your wisdom.
  I pray that we would not make decisions without asking Your guidance.
  Will You go before and behind us?

[[Page H4517]]

  Will You give us our marching orders?
  In this hour of our great need, begin again to help us, as You have 
in years gone by.
  Father, You are the God who does immeasurably more than all we could 
ask or imagine.
  Today, give us the humility to ask for Your help, and the grand moral 
courage to be agents of change for the good of others and the honor of 
Your name.
  In Your powerful name we ask these things.
  Amen.
