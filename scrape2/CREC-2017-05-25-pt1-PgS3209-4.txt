                       TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH SCHARTZ

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Joseph Schartz, an 
intern in my Washington, DC office for all of the hard work he has done 
for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.
  Joseph is a graduate of South Dakota State University in Brookings, 
SD, having earned a degree in journalism. Currently, he is attending 
the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, where he is 
pursuing his master's in public policy. Joseph is a dedicated worker 
who has been committed to getting the most out of his experience.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Joseph Schartz for all 
of the fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the 
years to come.
