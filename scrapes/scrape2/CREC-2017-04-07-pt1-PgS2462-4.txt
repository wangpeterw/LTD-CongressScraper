         MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 861 AND H.R. 1301

  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I understand that there are two bills at 
the desk due for a second reading en bloc.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bills by title for the 
second time en bloc.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 861) to provide for the compensation of Federal 
     employees affected by lapses in appropriations.
       A bill (H.R. 1301) making appropriations for the Department 
     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and

  Mr. BARRASSO. In order to place the bills on the calendar under the 
provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings en bloc.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bills will be 
placed on the calendar.
