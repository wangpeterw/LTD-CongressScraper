   REMEMBERING CAPTAIN ANDREW BECKER AND FIRST LIEUTENANT FREDERICK 
                           ``DREW'' DELLECKER

  (Mr. DeSANTIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my condolences to the 
families of the three Air Force officers who were killed in a plane 
crash earlier this week in New Mexico. Two of these officers had strong 
ties to the Sixth Congressional District in Florida, and particularly 
Volusia County.
  Captain Andrew Becker graduated from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical 
University in Daytona Beach in 2007. He was a great student, a real 
world beater. He did what many graduates of Riddle do. He served our 
country with honor and distinction, and we are thankful for his service 
to this country. We send our condolences to his wife.
  First Lieutenant Drew Dellecker graduated from the Air Force Academy 
in 2013 after growing up in Volusia County. This special guy dedicated 
his life to serving our country and defending our freedoms. The Volusia 
County community is saddened by his loss; and his parents, Bill and 
Karen, are in our thoughts and prayers.
  May God bless these fine young men, and may God bless their memory in 
the United States of America.
