       RECOGNIZING BUCKS COUNTY FARMER OF THE YEAR, BRIAN BAHNCK

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bucks 
County's Farmer of the Year, Brian Bahnck, of the Pennywell Dairy Farm 
in Ottsville, the winner of this year's Fred Groshens Memorial 
Conservation Farmer Award for his use of conservation-focused 
management on his 77-acre property. By using no-till crop rotation, 
Brian grew crops without disturbing the soil through tillage or 
plowing, a practice that can reduce soil erosion by 85 to 95 percent.
  Brian, along with his two daughters, Anna and Ella, have dedicated 
long hours and hard work to make his conservation farm a success. I am 
proud of the efforts of Brian and his family for their commitment to 
protect the natural resources in Bucks County.
  I also want to thank Gretchen Schatschneider and Rachel Onuska at the 
Bucks County Conservation District and our county commissioners for 
their longstanding support of our natural resources.
  We have a proud tradition in Bucks County, and our farmers have 
contributed so much to our community, and they will always remain an 
indispensable part of Bucks County's future.
