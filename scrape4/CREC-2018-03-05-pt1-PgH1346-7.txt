  COMMUNICATION FROM THE HONORABLE VICKY HARTZLER, MEMBER OF CONGRESS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following 
communication from the Honorable Vicky Hartzler, Member of Congress:

                                    Congress of the United States,


                                     House of Representatives,

                                Washington, DC, February 28, 2018.
     Hon. Paul D. Ryan,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Speaker: This is to notify you formally pursuant 
     to Rule VIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives 
     that I have been served with civil subpoenas for documents 
     and deposition testimony, issued by the United States 
     District Court for the District of Maryland.
       After consultation with the Office of General Counsel, I 
     have determined that compliance with the subpoenas is not 
     consistent with the privileges and rights of the House.
           Sincerely,
                                                   Vicky Hartzler,
                                               Member of Congress.

     

                          ____________________
