  (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, Delila is a graduate student at the 
University of California, Riverside, who exemplifies the American 
spirit. As a young woman, she worked two and three jobs to support her 
family and help her father, who was their sole provider.
  Three years ago, when her father suffered a stroke, Delila stepped up 
and kept the family afloat while he recovered. She went on to take a 
full-time position as a sexual assault advocate in our community. 
Delila says that job allowed her to help those who live in fear and 
live without hope.
  This year, she will graduate with a master's degree, and there is no 
question that she is destined to accomplish great things. The only 
question is where she will accomplish them.
  Delila is a DREAMer, and her future in this country depends on 
whether we pass the Dream Act. Once again, I am asking my colleagues to 
do the right thing. Pass the Dream Act so people like Delila can 
continue to make our communities proud.
