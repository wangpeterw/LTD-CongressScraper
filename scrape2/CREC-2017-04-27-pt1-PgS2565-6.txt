                        THE PRESIDENT'S TAX PLAN

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday, the administration 
introduced a plan to serve as the guideline for modernizing and 
simplifying America's Tax Code. This process is long overdue, and it is 
a priority that is shared by the Republican House, Senate, and the 
administration. By bringing down tax rates for individuals, we can help 
ease the burden on middle-class families, and by lowering taxes for 
American businesses, both small and large, we can foster job creation 
here at home, while making our country more competitive in an 
increasingly competitive international economy. I commend the President 
and his team for taking this critical first step, and I look forward to 
working with the administration and our House colleagues to finally 
overhaul our tax system.
