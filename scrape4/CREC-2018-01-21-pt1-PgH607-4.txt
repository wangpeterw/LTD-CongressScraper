                         THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW

  (Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I want to speak candidly 
and directly to the American people.
  There are many, many issues that we agree upon, Republicans and 
Democrats, coming together to solve big challenges.
  In my district in New Hampshire, people are dying, and they are dying 
from an emergency that did not exist--a continuing resolution will not 
solve their problem--and that is the opioid epidemic that hits 
districts all across this country. People are dying, families are 
suffering, and our communities are hurting.
  We need to come together, and we can. We have a bipartisan task force 
with 100 Members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats. Just this 
week, 50 Members, Republicans and Democrats, came together to ask for 
funding for this emergency crisis.
  We ask the President: Extend the emergency. We need to fund, and now 
is the time.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent, please, together, Republicans 
and Democrats, bring up H.R. 4872, the End the Shutdown Act of 2018, a 
continuing resolution that would immediately reopen the government 
through Tuesday while we continue negotiations on a budget agreement 
that adheres to parity and other critical issues like this opioid 
epidemic. This is urgent. Please, I ask my brothers and sisters on both 
sides of the aisle.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the Chair has previously advised, that 
request cannot be entertained absent appropriate clearance.
