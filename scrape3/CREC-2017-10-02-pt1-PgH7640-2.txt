                       ALL THINGS HAVE THEIR TIME

  (Mr. AL GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, our Nation is in mourning. Many 
hearts are bleeding.
  Mr. Speaker, there is much suffering. Lives have been lost in a 
senseless and needless manner in Las Vegas.
  Mr. Speaker, there is a right time for all things. This is a time for 
our Nation to mourn and for hearts to heal.
  Mr. Speaker, I announce that impeachment is postponed. Let us mourn, 
and let us heal.
