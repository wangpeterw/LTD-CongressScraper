                    CELEBRATING WOMEN HELPING WOMEN

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, as we kick off Women's History Month, I 
want to recognize Women Helping Women, celebrating 40 years of service 
to the people in my district of Maui County.
  Since its founding in 1977, Women Helping Women has been an 
indispensable source of strength and support for survivors of domestic 
violence in Maui County, many of whom have fled courageously away from 
life-threatening situations with nothing more than the clothes on their 
backs, a few dollars in their pockets, and the desire to live without 
fear. Many of these women flee with young children and have no one to 
turn to and nowhere to go.
  Each year, this organization serves more than 1,500 women, men, and 
children on the Islands of Maui and Lanai through a variety of 
programs, projects, and activities focused on direct intervention, 
shelter, advocacy, education, empowerment, and prevention.
  Mahalo to Women Helping Women, and congratulations on reaching this 
40th anniversary year.
