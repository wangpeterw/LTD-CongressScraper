           By Mr. GOSAR:
       H.R. 2022.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       The sale, transport, delivery and storing of cadavers, body 
     parts, human tissues and samples typically involves 
     interstate commerce.
       The power to regulate inter-state commerce is set forth 
     Article I, Section 8 power to ``regulate commerce among the 
     several states.'' If the matter in question is not a purely 
     local matter (intra-state) or if it has an impact on 
     interstate commerce, it falls within the Congressional power 
     to regulate interstate commerce. National Federation of 
     Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012).
