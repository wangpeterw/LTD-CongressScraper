                           AIR TRAFFIC REFORM

  (Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I often hear at home from folks 
who are frustrated with their experiences with air travel and airport 
security.
  We have an opportunity to address part of the problem to reduce 
flight times, prevent involuntary bumping, save fuel, reduce emissions, 
reduce the number of government employees, and save money both in the 
public sector and out of our constituents' pockets.
  The FAA is spending billions of dollars attempting to implement new 
technologies and next generation air traffic control management 
systems. They are failing.
  Right now, we have the 21st Century AIRR Act, which is a step in the 
right direction. It is going to unleash American innovation and allow 
us not just to catch up with other countries but to surpass them.
  It is about American jobs. It is about providing the American public 
with the service they deserve.
  I urge Members to support and advance the 21st Century AIRR Act.
