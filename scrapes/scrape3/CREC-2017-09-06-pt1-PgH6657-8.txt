                          TERMINATION OF DACA

  (Mr. SIRES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the cruel and 
indefensible termination of the DACA program.
  Since its launch in 2012, DACA has helped hundreds of thousands of 
young people come out of the shadows without the fear of being 
separated from

their loved ones and sent away from the only country they call home. 
Many of these children came as infants, growing up in the same 
playgrounds, schools, and neighborhoods as our own kids.
  The President's decision targets millions of young people who 
contribute to our society, economy, and national identity every day. In 
New Jersey alone, there are over 22,000 DACA recipients who pay $66 
million in State and local taxes every year.
  The emotional and economic impact of their deportation will be 
devastating, and New Jersey could lose $1.58 billion annually in GDP.
  America was built on the hard work of immigrants and our diversity is 
part of the foundation of our Nation.
  It is long past due for Congress to step up and protect the millions 
of families that will be torn apart because of this inhumane decision. 
We must protect DACA and pass legislation to fix our broken immigration 
system.
