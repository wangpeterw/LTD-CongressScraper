                     NATIONAL FOREST PRODUCTS WEEK

  (Mr. POLIQUIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join 1.3 million fellow 
Mainers in celebrating National Forest Products Week.
  Mr. Speaker, our great State is 90 percent covered by healthy, 
sustainable forests which support more than 30,000 good-paying jobs. 
Now, nationally, our working forests support 930,000 hardworking 
Americans who manage the forests, who harvest the trees, and who 
transport the wood to paper mills and energy plants across our great 
Nation.
  Every day, products like paper and lumber and pet food bags and 
toothpicks and pencils make our lives better. And the best part, Mr. 
Speaker, is that these trees grow back after we cut them, so this 
entire green, sustainable industry creates good-paying jobs generation 
after generation.
  Now, Democrats and Republicans must do everything humanly possible to 
help make sure our forest products industry is healthy and thrives. And 
to that end, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank everybody in this Chamber to 
make sure that we continue to treat biomass fairly in our regulations, 
make sure biomass is carbon neutral. This will avoid unnecessary and 
costly regulations being imposed on our mills, factories, and energy 
plants.
