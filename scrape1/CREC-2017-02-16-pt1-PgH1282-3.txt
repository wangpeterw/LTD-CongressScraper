             APPLAUDING THE OSCAR DE LE RENTA POSTAGE STAMP

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the United States 
Postal Service for its dedication of the Oscar de la Renta postage 
stamp. This stamp was unveiled today at Grand Central Station in New 
York City in a wonderful ceremony, and it is part of the U.S. Postal 
Service's Forever collection.
  As a lifelong friend, I dearly miss Oscar de la Renta and care about 
honoring his work and his memory.
  To me and so many Americans, particularly immigrants, he was more 
than just a designer, he was a good friend and a pioneer. As a member 
of the Dominican-American community and as a member of the U.S. 
Congress, it is my goal to highlight the achievement of immigrants who 
have contributed to American society and culture.
  Though Oscar was highly regarded by some of the most prominent 
figures of our time, including first ladies, he maintained his humility 
and never cast aside those who were less fortunate.
  His creativity, resourcefulness, and love for life are admirable 
characteristics that made him a true national treasure. Oscar was 
widely known for his love of country and deep affection for the 
Dominican-American community.
  I am proud to see Oscar's legacy honored and hope to keep his memory 
alive. Oscar is still with us. Once someone asked him how he wanted to 
be remembered, and he simply said: As a pretty dress.
