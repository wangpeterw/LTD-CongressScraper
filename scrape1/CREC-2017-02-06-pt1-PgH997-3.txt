                           THE DRIVE FOR FIVE

  (Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the 
Drive for Five is complete. I want to join New England in 
congratulating our New England Patriots on their incredible victory in 
Super Bowl LI. Fans across the Granite State agree that Super Bowl LI 
will go down in history as one of the most amazing comebacks of all 
time, and it cements the legacy of Tom Brady and Bill Belichick as the 
greatest quarterback-coach duo ever.
  The game was remarkable for team effort. After finding themselves 
down by 25 points, the Patriots did not fall victim to despair. They, 
instead, showed true resolve and perseverance as the offense executed 
drive after drive and the defense held the powerful Atlanta offense in 
check.
  Whether it was the record 14 catches by James White, the record 466 
passing yards by Tom Brady, the forced fumble by Dont'a Hightower, the 
mind-boggling catch by Julian Edelman, or the coaching of Bill 
Belichick, everyone did their part.
  So let me take a moment, Mr. Speaker, to say to the New England 
Patriots: Thanks for doing your job.
  Congrats, Pats.
