                  TRAIN DERAILMENT IN WASHINGTON STATE

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, to begin with, all of our thoughts this 
afternoon are with the victims of this morning's tragic train 
derailment in Washington State and with their families as well. Our 
gratitude is with the first responders who answered the call and rushed 
to the scene.
