                            ENOUGH IS ENOUGH

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, in my district, over the past couple of 
days, a baby, 8 years old, has been shot. A baby, 5 years old, has been 
shot. Other individuals have been shot and killed. And, of course, the 
death and the pillage of mass murders continue, and those in Florida 
are still suffering, and no gun action at all, no debate.
  Additionally, young people are in the streets, their families are 
fearful because the DACA fix promised by this President has not been 
done.
  We need to do our work, if we are Americans; we need to do it for 
good for all of those who live within the confines of this Nation.
  Then, finally, we had an election yesterday in Texas full of mistakes 
and closed polls and nonworking machines. Yet, the President of the 
United States has $120 million to safeguard our elections in 2018 and 
he has done absolutely nothing.
  It is a demand that we begin to look at the Russian intrusion, faulty 
voting polls and machines, and begin to address the American people's 
right and civil liberty of voting--one vote, one person--without the 
fear and the apprehension of Russians intruding into an election in 
2018 in order to skew the Federal elections.
  Enough is enough. It is time for us to act.
