        RECOGNIZING NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today during 
National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month.
  Madam Speaker, our Nation's veterans are 22 percent more likely to 
commit suicide than their nonveteran peers. This trend is troubling, 
and we all must work to reverse it.
  The Department of Veterans Affairs started a new campaign this month 
called Be There. The campaign emphasizes small actions, such as calling 
an old friend, checking on a neighbor, or inviting a colleague to go 
for a walk. These small gestures may have a real impact on someone who 
is struggling or feeling alone.
  Suicide rates are especially high in rural areas, where veterans may 
experience isolation or limited access to VA care--often for mental 
health concerns. That is why I introduced the VETS Act, which seeks to 
build on the VA's existing telemedicine program. It allows veterans to 
receive mental healthcare from anywhere. This will give our veterans 
greater access to the care they so desperately need.
  Madam Speaker, our servicemen and -women answered the call of duty. 
When they return home, it is our turn to be there for them.
