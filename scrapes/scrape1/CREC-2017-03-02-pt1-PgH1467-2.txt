                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us another day. We 
ask Your blessing upon our Nation. Bless the work of the Members of the 
people's House. May they toil diligently to bring about solutions to 
the pressing issues of these times.
  Bless all men and women across our country, especially those who work 
in service to others: police, firefighters, healthcare providers, 
teachers, those who work in local, State, and national government, and 
those men and women serving in our Armed Forces.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
