HONORING EASTWOOD ACADEMY AND LYONS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AS 2017 NATIONAL 
                          BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Eastwood Academy and Lyons Elementary School in Houston, Texas, as 
National Blue Ribbon Schools for 2017.
  The U.S. Department of Education selects blue ribbon schools each 
year from across the country based on their overall academic excellence 
and progress in closing the achievement gap. Lyons Elementary and 
Eastwood Academy are 2 of just 342 schools selected nationwide this 
year.
  Lyons Elementary and Eastwood Academy were selected as exemplary 
high-performing schools based on State and national assessments while 
serving the historically disadvantaged communities of Northline and 
Eastwood.
  I thank the parents, teachers, and administrators of Eastwood Academy 
and Lyons Elementary for their hard work and commitment to building a 
brighter future for our children and our community.
  Finally, I wish to recognize the students at Lyons Elementary and 
Eastwood Academy for their diligence and academic excellence and wish 
them best in their future endeavors.
