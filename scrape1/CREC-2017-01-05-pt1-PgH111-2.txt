                          COOL SCIENCE TOPICS

  (Mr. McNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to continue a series of 1-minute 
speeches on cool science topics. Today I recognize the work of 
scientists working in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica to develop 
geological metal maps. Researchers developed a three-dimensional 
electronic mapping system that is being used to detect large precious 
metal deposits in the United States.
  With funding from NSF, researchers mapped out the Nokomis deposit in 
northern Minnesota, which is estimated to contain 10 billion pounds of 
copper, 3.1 billion pounds of nickel, 4 million ounces of platinum, 9 
million ounces of palladium, and 2 million ounces of gold. The value of 
these metal deposits will more than pay for the science investment to 
develop this technology.
  Congress should support research that furthers the understanding of 
our incredible universe, including the ground beneath our feet.
