                CONGRATULATING THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, ``Never stop believing.'' Those words are 
going to be on the front page of The Providence Journal tomorrow 
morning.
  Like all true tests of faith, last night's Super Bowl wasn't easy 
going, and there were times, I have to say, when I was tempted to throw 
up my hands and just go to bed, but I followed the words of our 
quarterback and--oh, boy--was I rewarded.
  What a game.
  If there were any doubts, Mr. Speaker, about who the greatest 
quarterback of all time is, Tom Brady answered them last night; if 
there were any who questioned whether Bill Belichick was the best coach 
on the planet, this morning, they are silent; and I am sure they would 
all admonish me if I didn't say that football is a team sport. So, for 
those who had not yet been satisfied that the amazing string of 
successes my New England Patriots put together makes them the NFL's 
finest team, Super Bowl LI speaks for itself.
  Mr. Speaker, it was truly a team effort, and I offer my heartfelt 
congratulations to Bob Kraft and to the entire Patriots franchise.
  Congratulations, Patriots and Patriots Nation.
