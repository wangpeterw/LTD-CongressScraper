        NATIONAL SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING PREVENTION MONTH

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, January is National Slavery and Human 
Trafficking Prevention Month.
  With as many as 25 million people enslaved worldwide, human 
trafficking is an abhorrent practice that has become one of the most 
important human rights issues of our time.
  Here in the United States, there are an estimated 100,000 minors at 
risk of being trafficked. We have taken positive, bipartisan action on 
a number of bills--18 this past year, Mr. Speaker--to combat 
trafficking, fight child abuse and exploitation, support and protect 
victims, and strengthen law enforcement's ability to go after the 
traffickers.
  While we can be proud of the progress we have made, clearly there is 
more that needs to be done, including cracking down on the demand side 
of the equation and holding websites accountable for advertising sex 
with juveniles.
  Mr. Speaker, I will continue to make this effort a priority and work 
with law enforcement, victims service groups, and other stakeholders to 
end human trafficking.
