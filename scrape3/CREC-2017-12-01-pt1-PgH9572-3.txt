                     SHERIFF HARVEY GJESDAL RETIRES

  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sheriff Harvey 
Gjesdal of Douglas County, Washington, for his significant 
contributions to the safety of the constituents in the Fourth District 
and to congratulate him on his recently announced retirement.
  Sheriff Gjesdal has served in Washington State law enforcement for 
over 30 years. He began his career in 1985, at the Garfield County 
Sheriff's Office, and he spent 8 years in the Bellevue Police 
Department before landing in Douglas County in 1995. He was promoted to 
sergeant in 2000 and elected to his current position in 2006.
  Additionally, he served in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve for 26 years, 
where he was activated four times, including two tours in the Middle 
East.
  For the last 22 years, Sheriff Gjesdal has been promoting safety and 
building strong relationships in central Washington. I am thankful for 
his leadership and compassion, and I urge my colleagues to join me in 
congratulating him on a successful career.
