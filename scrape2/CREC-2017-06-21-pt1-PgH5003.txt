                 DO NOT REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in the last month, Republican 
Senators have worked in secrecy on a bill that will repeal the 
Affordable Care Act. Now they are preparing to vote on that bill next 
week without any public hearings, no debates, no open forums. Instead, 
the Senate Republican majority have failed to be transparent with their 
constituents and the American people. No one knows what is in the bill.
  Based on the last CBO score, we know that TrumpCare will lead to 23 
million more Americans uninsured and gut protections for Americans with 
preexisting conditions and force hardworking Americans to pay higher 
costs for less care.
  Mr. Speaker, in the words of President Trump, this bill is a mean 
bill. Even our former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, has said to 
slow down.
  Why must this bill be so secretive? Because our colleagues across the 
aisle know that the more light that is shed on their true intentions, 
the more people will realize this is not a healthcare bill at all, but 
a massive tax cut for the wealthiest Americans, and it will be paid for 
by our elderly and our poorest constituents.
  Mr. Speaker, that bill is a bad bill.
