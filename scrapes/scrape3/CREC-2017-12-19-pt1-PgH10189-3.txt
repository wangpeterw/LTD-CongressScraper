                    RECOGNIZING JUDGE JIM HENDERSON

  (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my good friend, 
Simpson County Judge Executive Jim Henderson from the First 
Congressional District of Kentucky.
  Judge Henderson has served his community since 1998, when he was 
elected as the youngest county judge executive in Kentucky, and has 
continually devoted himself to organizations which advance the 
development and prosperity of Simpson County.
  Judge Henderson has decided to transition into a new role as deputy 
director of the Kentucky Association of Counties, where he will be 
overseeing their day-to-day operations and working with local 
government officials in all 120 counties throughout the Commonwealth to 
advocate for legislative solutions that best meet the needs of their 
constituencies.
  His previous leadership within KACo, combined with his personal and 
professional networks, and his impeccable record of achievement have 
prepared him to serve Kentucky's local officials in a direct and 
expanded capacity.
  Although he will be missed in his current role, I am grateful for his 
steadfast leadership and tireless contributions to Simpson County, as 
well as his friendship and guidance.
  Mr. Speaker, I join his family, friends, and all those who have 
benefited from his efforts throughout the years in wishing him great 
success in his new role as deputy director of KACo.
