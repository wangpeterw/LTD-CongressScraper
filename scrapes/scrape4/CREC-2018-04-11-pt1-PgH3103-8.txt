      THANKING GEORGE ELLIS FOR DEDICATED SERVICE TO PENNSYLVANIA

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Mr. 
George Ellis for his dedicated service to the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania.
  At the end of March, George retired as the executive director of the 
Appalachian Region Independent Power Producers Association. He served 
in the role since 2015.
  The organization has accomplished much during that time, and a lot of 
credit goes to George for his dedicated efforts and service.
  George started his career in 1974 as a staff member, and shortly 
thereafter, became executive director of the House of Representatives' 
Mines and Energy Management Committee.
  In 1982, George accepted the position of executive vice president of 
government affairs with the Keystone Bituminous Coal Association, which 
in 1988 became the PA Coal Mining Association.
  In 1996, George was appointed president of the Pennsylvania Coal 
Association before joining ARIPPA in 2015.
  Mr. Speaker, George Ellis has been a highly respected resource in the 
Pennsylvania coal industry, and his knowledge and dedication are 
unparalleled. He has had a long and outstanding career, and I wish him 
the best in his well-deserved retirement.
