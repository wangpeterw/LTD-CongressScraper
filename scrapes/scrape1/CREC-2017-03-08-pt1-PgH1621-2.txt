  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
Frelinghuysen) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky) each will 
control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.


                             General Leave

  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1301, and that I may 
include tabular material on the same.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from New Jersey?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present H.R. 1301, the Defense 
Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2017.
  In total, this bill provides $577.9 billion in funding for the 
Department of Defense: $516.1 billion in discretionary funding and 
$61.8 billion in overseas contingency operations and global war on 
terrorism funding.
  When combined with the funding provided in the continuing resolution 
supplemental enacted in December, total defense funding for fiscal year 
2017 equals $584 billion, consistent with the top line provided in the 
National Defense Authorization Act, and $10.9 billion more than fiscal 
year 2016 levels.
  Mr. Speaker, strengthening our national security and rebuilding our 
military starts today, with this agreement,

[[Page H1640]]

the first step after years of cutbacks. Our Armed Forces and 
intelligence community are currently operating under a continuing 
resolution, which denies them stability and predictability, both of 
which they have not had for many years.
  H.R. 1301 provides that stability, removing defense funding from 
under continuing resolution autopilot, preventing further damage to our 
national defense and providing additional support for our men and women 
in uniform and their families.
  Our troops serve with honor in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, South Korea, 
Japan, across the Baltics, the Sinai, and Africa on the ground, in the 
air, and aboard ships across the globe doing the work of freedom.
  Mr. Speaker, this agreement rejects the troop reductions proposed by 
the previous administration, providing for increased end-strength 
levels authorized by the NDAA: 1.3 million Active Duty troops and 
813,000 National Guard and Reserve troops, all of whom work as one 
team.
  Our bill also fully funds the authorized 2.1 percent pay raise and 
provides increased funding for Defense Health Programs to ensure full 
care for all of our warfighters, their families, and military retirees.
  This agreement also ensures that our Armed Forces have the training 
and equipment they need to conduct successful missions. Funding is 
increased for key readiness programs that prepare and train our troops 
and that modernize essential military installations. It reverses the 
previous administration's cuts to procurement, providing for additional 
production of state-of-the-art aircraft and ships.
  In addition, we enhance cyber and ISR programs, or intelligence, 
surveillance and reconnaissance programs, capabilities our combatant 
commanders badly need.
  This reflects congressional priorities. We took into account the 
views of each and every Member who worked with us throughout the 
process. This is a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that deserves the 
support of the House.
  I thank Chairwoman Kay Granger for her efforts in bringing this bill 
to the floor today and for taking over the leadership of the Defense 
Subcommittee in January.
  I also thank the subcommittee's ranking member, Mr. Visclosky, for 
his contributions to this bill and the earlier bill. He has been an 
excellent partner throughout this process, and I am grateful for our 
continued strong working relationship.
  In addition, I commend Nita Lowey, the ranking member of the full 
committee, for her partnership and commitment to completing all of our 
appropriations work.
  Lastly, I thank the staff of the subcommittee that is behind me, both 
minority and majority, as well as our personal offices and the full 
Appropriations Committee for their tireless work putting this bill 
together.
  In particular, I would like to acknowledge Will Smith and David 
Pomerantz, the outgoing staff directors for the Appropriations 
Committee, both majority and minority, in this remarkable committee. 
Both have made immeasurable contributions to the Appropriations 
Committee in this institution, and we are indebted for their service. 
We thank both of them and wish them both the best.
  Mr. Speaker, today our Nation faces a dangerous and unpredictable 
world. At the same time, our Armed Forces are struggling to have our 
soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines fully trained and ready to meet 
every conceivable threat. That important work to address that critical 
situation starts with this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the agreement, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.

     maintenance accounts, for which the term ``program, project, 
     and activity'' is defined as the appropriations accounts 
     contained in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act.
       At the time the President submits the budget request for 
     fiscal year 2018, the Secretary of Defense is directed to 
     transmit to the congressional defense committees budget 
     justification documents to be known as the ``M-1'' and the 
     ``O-1'' which shall identify, at the budget activity, 
     activity group, and sub-activity group level, the amounts 
     requested by the President to be appropriated to the 
     Department of Defense for military personnel and operation 
     and maintenance in any budget request, or amended budget 
     request, for fiscal year 2018.


                         REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow 
     the reprogramming guidance for acquisition accounts as 
     specified in the report accompanying the House version of the 
     Department of Defense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 
     2008 (House Report 110-279). For operation and maintenance 
     accounts, the Secretary of Defense shall continue to follow 
     the reprogramming guidelines specified in the conference 
     report accompanying H.R. 3222, the Department of Defense 
     Appropriations Act, 2008. The dollar threshold for 
     reprogramming funds shall remain at $10,000,000 for military 
     personnel; $15,000,000 for operation and maintenance; 
     $20,000,000 for procurement; and $10,000,000 for research, 
     development, test and evaluation.
       Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is 
     directed to continue to provide the congressional defense 
     committees annual DD Form 1416 reports for titles I and II 
     and quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports for 
     Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of 
     this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with 
     guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying 
     the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The 
     Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior 
     approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified 
     dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or 
     research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is 
     less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for 
     reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. 
     Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of 
     a military personnel (M-1), an operation and maintenance (O-
     1), a procurement (P-1), or a research, development, test and 
     evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the 
     Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval 
     reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In 
     addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval 
     reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest 
     items are established elsewhere in this statement.


                           FUNDING INCREASES

       The funding increases outlined in the tables for each 
     appropriation account shall be provided only for the specific 
     purposes indicated in the tables.


                  CONGRESSIONAL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS

       Items for which additional funds have been provided or 
     items for which funding is specifically reduced as shown in 
     the project level tables or in paragraphs using the phrase 
     ``only for'' or ``only to'' are congressional special 
     interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming 
     (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD 
     Form 1414 at the stated amount, as specifically addressed in 
     the explanatory statement.


                            CLASSIFIED ANNEX

       Adjustments to classified programs are addressed in the 
     accompanying classified annex.


                  BUDGET LIAISON SUPPORT TO THE HOUSE 
                   AND SENATE DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS 
                             SUBCOMMITTEES

       The House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees 
     rely heavily on offices within the Comptroller organizations 
     of the military departments and the Office of the Secretary 
     of Defense to conduct their oversight responsibilities and 
     make funding recommendations for the Department of Defense. 
     Established in the 1970s in accordance with a recommendation 
     of the Blue Ribbon Defense Panel, these offices facilitate 
     the appropriate flow of information between the House and 
     Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees and the 
     Comptroller of the respective department or agency. In the 
     early 1990s, the House and Senate Defense Appropriations 
     Subcommittees restated the

[[Page H1641]]

     support these organizations provide to the Committees and 
     noted that ``while the various offices of legislative affairs 
     offer great assistance to DoD and the Congress, they do not 
     provide the expertise and the direct relationship to the 
     Comptroller organizations which are essential to the 
     effective communication between DoD and the Committees on 
     Appropriations.''
       Further, the explanatory statement accompanying the 
     Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2016 echoed the 
     imperative to maintain the existing liaison structure to 
     achieve the highest level of communication and trust between 
     the Department of Defense and the House and Senate Defense 
     Appropriations Subcommittees.
       The House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees 
     repeat this support for the budget liaison organizations and 
     reiterate previously stated concerns that efforts to 
     incorporate these organizations into the military and Office 
     of the Secretary of Defense legislative affairs offices would 
     be deleterious to the appropriations process and to the 
     utility of the budget liaison operation. Therefore, the 
     agreement retains a provision in title II of this Act from 
     previous years that prohibits the use of funds in this Act to 
     plan or implement the consolidation of a budget or 
     appropriations liaison office of the Office of the Secretary 
     of Defense, the office of the Secretary of a military 
     department, or the Service headquarters of one of the Armed 
     Forces into a legislative affairs or legislative liaison 
     office.


                         CYBERSPACE ACTIVITIES

       The agreement fully funds the fiscal year 2017 base budget 
     requirement of $6,734,000,000 for the Army, Navy, Marine 
     Corps, Air Force, and the defense agencies cyberspace 
     activities, an increase of $992,000,000 over the fiscal year 
     2016 enacted level.
       While the Service and defense-wide budget justification 
     material, as well as the Department of Defense classified 
     cyberspace activities information technology investments 
     budget justification materials, provide some level of detail, 
     much of the funding is encompassed within larger programs and 
     funding lines, which limits visibility and congressional 
     oversight of requested funding for cyberspace activities 
     specifically.
       Beginning in fiscal year 2018, the Department of Defense 
     Chief Information Officer is directed to modify the 
     cyberspace activities exhibit in order to provide increased 
     visibility and clarity into the cyberspace activities funding 
     requirements and changes to funding requirements from the 
     previous fiscal year enacted levels, to segregate civilian 
     and military pay, and to provide a crosswalk between the 
     cyberspace activities justification books and the Services 
     and defense-wide budget justification material.
       Further, in order to provide additional clarity and to 
     enhance oversight, the Department of Defense Chief 
     Information Officer, in coordination with the Under Secretary 
     of Defense (Comptroller) and the Service Secretaries, is 
     directed to conduct a review of the budget justification 
     material and provide a proposal to the House and Senate 
     Appropriations Committees not later than September 1, 2017, 
     for how to clearly delineate the Department of Defense cyber 
     investment activities requested in the operation and 
     maintenance, procurement, and research, development, test and 
     evaluation accounts as part of the budget justification 
     material beginning with the fiscal year 2019 budget 
     submission. The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and 
     the Chief Information Officer are encouraged to consider 
     establishing a unique cyber sub-activity group for operation 
     and maintenance accounts and individual cost codes, projects, 
     or program elements for procurement and research, 
     development, test and evaluation accounts as part of this 
     review.
       The Department of Defense cyberspace activities table 
     provided shows the amount of funding provided to each Service 
     and defense-wide account in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. 
     Funding appropriated therein may be used only for cyberspace 
     activities as defined by the classified cyberspace activities 
     information technology investment budget request for fiscal 
     year 2017. The Secretary of Defense is directed to use normal 
     prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funding 
     out of any operation and maintenance, procurement, or 
     research, development, test and evaluation accounts as 
     identified in the table titled ``Department of Defense 
     Cyberspace Activities'' for any purpose other than cyberspace 
     activities. The Department of Defense Chief Information 
     Officer shall submit to the House and Senate Appropriations 
     Committees two reports not later than May 30, 2017, and 
     November 30, 2017, which provide the mid-year and end of 
     fiscal year financial obligation and execution data for 
     cyberspace activities of each year.
       This language replaces the language included under the 
     heading ``Cyberspace Operations'' in House Report 114-577.

                  QUARTERLY CYBER OPERATIONS BRIEFING

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide quarterly 
     briefings to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees 
     on all offensive and significant defensive military 
     operations in cyberspace carried out by the Department of 
     Defense not later than 30 days after the end of each fiscal 
     quarter.

                      TITLE I--MILITARY PERSONNEL

       The agreement provides $128,725,978,000 in Title I, 
     Military Personnel. The agreement on items addressed by 
     either the House or the Senate is as follows:

                      military personnel overview

       The agreement provides the resources required for an 
     additional 24,000 active forces and 12,000 selected reserve 
     forces, as authorized by current law and above the requested 
     end strength levels, in order to meet operational needs for 
     fiscal year 2017. The agreement also provides the funding 
     necessary to support a 2.1 percent pay raise for all military 
     personnel, as authorized, effective January 1, 2017.


         reprogramming guidance for military personnel accounts

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit the Base for 
     Reprogramming (DD Form 1414) for each of the fiscal year 2017 
     appropriations accounts not later than 60 days after the 
     enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited 
     from executing any reprogramming or transfer of funds for any 
     purpose other than originally appropriated until the 
     aforementioned report is submitted to the House and Senate 
     Appropriations Committees.
       The Secretary of Defense is directed to use the normal 
     prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funds in 
     the Services' military personnel accounts between budget 
     activities in excess of $10,000,000.


               military personnel special interest items

       Items for which additional funds have been provided or have 
     been specifically reduced as shown in the project level 
     tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ``only for'' or 
     ``only to'' in the explanatory statement are congressional 
     special interest items for the purpose of the Base for 
     Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be 
     carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as 
     specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. Below 
     Threshold Reprogrammings may not be used to either restore or 
     reduce funding from congressional special interest items as 
     identified on the DD Form 1414.


                             military bands

       Military bands honor and celebrate warfighters, promote 
     patriotism during community events, inspire servicemembers, 
     and enhance efforts to recruit and retain troops. Band 
     engagements play an important support role for national 
     security and joint operations, opening diplomatic doors for 
     political and military discussions while building trust and 
     confidence with foreign military and civilian authorities. 
     However, the activities of military bands must not detract 
     from the core competencies of the military. The Secretary of 
     Defense should review opportunities to ensure that only the 
     critical functions of military bands are supported while 
     minimizing impacts on funding for essential readiness, 
     military personnel, modernization, and research and 
     development activities.

     REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE ACCOUNTS

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit the Base for 
     Reprogramming (DD Form 1414) for each of the fiscal year 2017 
     appropriation accounts not later than 60 days after the 
     enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited 
     from executing any reprogramming or transfer of funds for any 
     purpose other than originally appropriated until the 
     aforementioned report is submitted to the House and Senate 
     Appropriations Committees.
       The Secretary of Defense is directed to use the normal 
     prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funds in 
     the Services' operation and maintenance accounts between O-1 
     budget activities in excess of $15,000,000. In addition, the 
     Secretary of Defense should follow prior approval 
     reprogramming procedures for transfers in excess of 
     $15,000,000 out of the following budget sub-activities:
       Army:
       Maneuver units
       Modular support brigades
       Land forces operations support
       Force readiness operations support
       Land forces depot maintenance
       Base operations support
       Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization
       Navy:
       Mission and other flight operations
       Aircraft depot maintenance
       Mission and other ship operations
       Ship depot maintenance
       Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization
       Marine Corps:

       Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization
       Air Force:
       Primary combat forces
       Combat enhancement forces
       Operating forces depot maintenance
       Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization
       Mobilization depot maintenance
       Training and recruiting depot maintenance
       Administration and service-wide depot maintenance
       Air Force Reserve:
       Depot maintenance
       Air National Guard:
       Depot maintenance
       Additionally, the Secretary of Defense should follow prior 
     approval reprogramming procedures for transfers in excess of 
     $15,000,000 into the following budget sub-activity:
       Operation and Maintenance, Army National Guard:
       Other personnel support/recruiting and advertising
       With respect to Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide, 
     proposed transfers of funds to or from the levels specified 
     for defense agencies in excess of $15,000,000 shall be 
     subject to prior approval reprogramming procedures.


            OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS

       Items for which additional funds have been provided or have 
     been specifically reduced as shown in the project level 
     tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ``only for'' or 
     ``only to'' in the explanatory statement are congressional 
     special interest items for the purpose of the Base for 
     Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be 
     carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as 
     specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. Below 
     Threshold Reprogrammings may not be used to either restore or 
     reduce funding from congressional special interest items as 
     identified on the DD Form 1414.


                               READINESS

       The agreement provides additional readiness funds for the 
     Services within the operation and maintenance accounts. This 
     funding shall be used only to improve military readiness, 
     including increased training, depot maintenance, and base 
     operations support. None of the funding provided may be used 
     for recruiting, marketing, or advertising programs. The 
     funding provided is a congressional special interest item. 
     The Secretary of Defense and the Service Secretaries are 
     directed to submit a detailed spending plan by sub-activity 
     group to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees not 
     less than 30 days prior to the obligation of these funds. 
     These transfers may be implemented 30 days after 
     congressional notification unless an objection is received 
     from either the House or Senate Appropriations Committees.


                  ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT

       The agreement does not include a provision included in the 
     House-passed version of H.R. 5293 that referenced the Energy 
     Independence and Security Act of 2007. It is noted that the 
     enforcement of section 526 of the Energy Independence and 
     Security Act of 2007 may lead to higher fuel costs for 
     federal fleets in the absence of competitively priced new 
     generation fuels that emit fewer emissions. In carrying out 
     this statute, the Secretary of Defense and the Service 
     Secretaries should work to ensure that costs associated with 
     fuel purchases necessary to carry out their respective 
     missions should be minimized to the greatest extent possible.


                           CIVILIAN PAY RAISE

       Although the agreement does not include additional funds 
     specifically for the civilian pay increase from 1.6 percent 
     to 2.1 percent, sufficient funding is available within the 
     appropriations accounts to fully fund the increase due to 
     assets created by the civilian hiring freeze and the extended 
     length of H.R. 2028, theFurther Continuing and Security 
     Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017.


                       AQUEOUS FILM FORMING FOAM

       The use of the fire-extinguishing agent Aqueous Film 
     Forming Foam (AFFF) by the Department of Defense has been 
     linked to elevated levels of perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) 
     on military bases and in neighboring communities. According 
     to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the 
     National Institutes of Health, PFCs have adverse impacts on 
     human health. The Navy and Air Force have begun remediation 
     of PFC contamination. The Secretary of Defense is encouraged 
     to require all Services to establish procedures for prompt 
     and cost-effective remediation. In addition, the Secretary of 
     Defense is directed to submit a report to the congressional 
     defense committees not later than 120 days after the 
     enactment of this Act that assesses the number of formerly 
     used and current military installations where AFFF was or is 
     currently used and the impact of PFC contaminated drinking 
     water on surrounding communities. The report should also 
     include plans for prompt community notification of such 
     contamination, when the contamination was detected, and the 
     procedures for timely remediation.

     Tool, which is the first phase of the Proficiency 
     Optimization initiative. In lieu of the reporting requirement 
     in House Report 114-577, the Secretary of the Navy is 
     directed to submit a report to the congressional defense 
     committees not later than 60 days after the enactment of this 
     Act that describes the Naval Aviation Enterprise Proficiency 
     Optimization initiative, the current funding profile, and the 
     potential to accelerate or streamline the program strategy.

  NATIONAL GUARD STATE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMLANGUAGE ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM

       For more than twenty years, the National Guard State 
     Partnership Program (SPP) has been successfully building 
     unique security relationships with more than 75 nations 
     around the globe. To build on the success of this program, 
     the agreement recommends that the Chief of the National Guard 
     Bureau encourage the enhancement of individual language 
     skills and prioritize language school appointments of 
     soldiers and airmen within the program to help further 
     strengthen these international relationships. Additionally, 
     servicemembers of the National Guard that participate in, and 
     are from states with units assigned to state partnership 
     activities should strive to attend language schools, both 
     defense-sponsored and otherwise; obtain computer-assisted 
     language-learning software; and use international visits 
     through the SPP as a means of language skill immersion.

            REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow 
     the reprogramming guidance as specified in the report 
     accompanying the House version of the Department of Defense 
     Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110-
     279). Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming 
     funds shall remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and 
     $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation.
       Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is 
     directed to continue to provide the congressional defense 
     committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports 
     for Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of 
     this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with the 
     guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying 
     the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The 
     Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior 
     approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified 
     dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or 
     research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is 
     less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for 
     reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. 
     Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of 
     a procurement (P-1) or research, development, test and 
     evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the 
     Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval 
     reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In 
     addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval 
     reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest 
     items are established elsewhere in this statement.

       The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be 
     provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the 
     tables.


                   PROCUREMENT SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS

       Items for which additional funds have been provided as 
     shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the 
     phrase ``only for'' or ``only to'' in the explanatory 
     statement are congressional special interest items for the 
     purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of 
     these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated 
     amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory 
     statement.


       JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER BUDGET JUSTIFICATIONS AND CONTRACTING

       Throughout the fiscal year 2017 budget review process, the 
     Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Joint Program Office provided 
     insufficient justification and incomplete information in an 
     untimely manner. It is imperative that requested information 
     is received promptly for proper congressional oversight of 
     this major defense acquisition program.
       It is understood that the Secretary of Defense is reviewing 
     potential alternative management structures for the JSF 
     program as directed by the National Defense Authorization Act 
     for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328). This review will 
     provide an opportunity to improve communication between the 
     JSF Program Executive Officer (PEO), the Services, and the 
     congressional defense committees to ensure the program's 
     funding requirements are fully understood, communicated, and 
     justified.
       Additionally, there is concern that the number of F-35s 
     enacted in annual Department of Defense Appropriations Acts 
     are not being placed on contract by the JSF PEO in a timely 
     manner. Four F-35s included in the Department of Defense 
     Appropriations Act, 2015 and 13 F-35s included in the 
     Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2016 were not part 
     of their respective low rate initial production (LRIP) 
     contracts due to the PEO's contracting strategy. 
     Specifically, only four F-35Cs were included on LRIPs 9 and 
     10, rather than the ten F-35Cs enacted in the Department of 
     Defense Appropriations Acts, 2015 and 2016, impeding 
     production efficiencies. The agreement directs the JSF PEO to 
     use a contracting approach that would award all aircraft 
     included in each Department of Defense Appropriations Act on 
     the respective production contract for that fiscal year. The 
     agreement includes funding for 74 F-35 aircraft. The JSF PEO 
     is directed to brief the congressional defense committees not 
     later than 45 days after the enactment of this Act on the 
     contracting strategy for these aircraft.

                 UH-72 LAKOTA LIGHT UTILITY HELICOPTER

       The agreement provides $187,000,000 to procure 28 UH-72 
     Lakota Light Utility Helicopters for the Army in support of 
     ongoing mission requirements at the Army Aviation Center of 
     Excellence at Fort Rucker, the Combat Training Centers, and 
     the Army Test and Evaluation Center. The agreement notes that 
     this investment is consistent with previous appropriations 
     and was included in the Army's unfunded priority list. The 
     Secretary of the Army is encouraged to request funding for 
     UH-72 Lakota Light Utility Helicopters to address ongoing 
     mission requirements in future budget submissions.

                      ddg-51 flight IIa destroyers

       The Navy currently is procuring DDG-51 Flight IIA 
     destroyers under a fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2017 
     multi-year procurement shipbuilding contract awarded in June 
     2013, as authorized by section 8010 of Public Law 113-6. 
     Additionally, the Navy is addressing increasing ballistic and 
     cruise missile threats through the development and 
     acquisition of an Air and Missile Defense Radar, which is 
     planned for integration on the DDG-51 class of ships through 
     an engineering change proposal, resulting in a new Flight III 
     configuration. However, a recent Government Accountability 
     Office report (GAO 16-613) details concerns regarding a lack 
     of sufficient acquisition and limited detail design knowledge 
     to support the Navy's current Flight III procurement 
     strategy. Further concerns remain regarding the full costs of 
     DDG-51 Flight III destroyers. Therefore, the Secretary of the 
     Navy should award and complete the additional DDG-51 ship, 
     fully funded in fiscal years 2016 and 2017, as an additional 
     DDG-51 Flight IIA ship. The Secretary of the Navy is directed 
     to expeditiously award this ship construction contract.


               polar icebreaker recapitalization project

       The Navy and the Coast Guard are collaborating to refine 
     requirements and an acquisition strategy for procurement of 
     an affordable polar icebreaker. This collaboration continues 
     to refine program costs and requirements in an effort to 
     award a detailed design and construction contract for the 
     lead ship in fiscal year 2019. The agreement supports this 
     effort and provides $150,000,000 in advance procurement 
     funding to buy long-lead time material for the program's 
     initial ship. The Coast Guard is encouraged to budget for 
     follow-on efforts.

            REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow 
     the reprogramming guidance as specified in the report 
     accompanying the House version of the Department of Defense 
     Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110-
     279). Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming 
     funds shall remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and 
     $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation.
       Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is 
     directed to continue to provide the congressional defense 
     committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports 
     for Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of 
     this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with the 
     guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying 
     the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The 
     Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior 
     approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified 
     dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or 
     research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is 
     less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for 
     reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. 
     Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of 
     a procurement (P-1) or research, development, test and 
     evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the 
     Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval 
     reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In 
     addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval 
     reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest 
     items are established elsewhere in this statement.


                           FUNDING INCREASES

       The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be 
     provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the 
     tables.


   RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS

       Items for which additional funds have been provided as 
     shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the 
     phrase ``only for'' or ``only to'' in the explanatory 
     statement are congressional special interest items for the 
     purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of 
     these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated 
     amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory 
     statement.


              JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER FOLLOW-ON MODERNIZATION

       The Joint Strike Fighter Program Executive Officer is 
     directed to comply with the reporting requirement included 
     under the heading ``Joint Strike Fighter Follow-on 
     Modernization'' in Senate Report 114-263. The Secretary of 
     Defense is not required to comply with the reporting 
     requirement included under the heading ``Joint Strike Fighter 
     Follow-on Development'' in House Report 114-577.

         REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR THE DEFENSE HEALTH PROGRAM

       Concerns remain regarding the transfer of funds from the 
     In-House Care budget sub-activity to pay for contractor-
     provided medical care. To limit such transfers and improve 
     oversight within the Defense Health Program operation and 
     maintenance account, the agreement includes a provision which 
     caps the funds available for Private Sector Care under the 
     TRICARE program subject to prior approval reprogramming 
     procedures. The provision and accompanying explanatory 
     statement language should not be interpreted as limiting the 
     amount of funds that may be transferred to the In-House Care 
     budget sub-activity from other budget sub-activities within 
     the Defense Health Program. In addition, funding for the In-
     House Care budget sub-activity continues to be designated as 
     a congressional special interest item. Any transfer of funds 
     from the In-House Care budget sub-activity into the Private 
     Sector Care budget sub-activity or any other budget sub-
     activity requires the Secretary of Defense to follow prior 
     approval reprogramming procedures for operation and 
     maintenance funds.
       The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide written 
     notification to the congressional defense committees of 
     cumulative transfers in excess of $10,000,000 out of the 
     Private Sector Care budget sub-activity not later than 
     fifteen days after such a transfer. Furthermore, the 
     Secretary of Defense is directed to provide a report to the 
     congressional defense committees not later than 30 days after 
     the enactment of this Act that delineates transfers of funds 
     in excess of $10,000,000, and the dates any transfers 
     occurred, from the Private Sector Care budget sub-activity to 
     any other budget sub-activity groups for fiscal year 2016.
       The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) is 
     directed to provide quarterly reports to the congressional 
     defense committees on budget execution data for all of the 
     Defense Health Program budget activities and to adequately 
     reflect changes to the budget activities requested by the 
     Services in future budget submissions.


                 PEER-REVIEWED CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM

       The agreement provides $60,000,000 for the peer-reviewed 
     cancer research program to research cancers not addressed in 
     the breast, prostate, ovarian, kidney, and lung cancer 
     research programs.
       The funds provided in the peer-reviewed cancer research 
     program are directed to be used to conduct research in the 
     following areas: bladder cancer, brain cancer, colorectal 
     cancer, immunotherapy, listeria-based regimens for cancer, 
     liver cancer, lymphoma, melanoma and other skin cancers, 
     mesothelioma, neuroblastoma, pancreatic cancer, pediatric 
     brain tumors, stomach cancer, and cancer in children, 
     adolescents, and young adults.
       The reports directed under this heading in House Report 
     114-577 and Senate Report 114-263 are still required.


                 PEER-REVIEWED MEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM

       The agreement provides $300,000,000 for a peer-reviewed 
     medical research program. The Secretary of Defense, in 
     conjunction with the Service Surgeons General, is directed to 
     select medical research projects of clear scientific merit 
     and direct relevance to military health. Research areas 
     considered under this funding are restricted to the following 
     areas: acute lung injury, antimicrobial resistance, 
     arthritis, burn pit exposure, chronic migraine and post-
     traumatic headache, congenital heart disease, constrictive 
     bronchiolitis, diabetes, diarrheal diseases, dystonia, early 
     trauma thermal regulation, eating disorders, emerging 
     infectious diseases, epidermolysis bullosa, focal segmental 
     glomerulosclerosis, Fragile X, Guillain-Barre syndrome, 
     hepatitis B and C, hereditary angioedema, hydrocephalus, 
     immunomonitoring of intestinal transplants, inflammatory 
     bowel diseases, influenza, integrative medicine, interstitial 
     cystitis, malaria, metals toxicology, mitochondrial disease, 
     musculoskeletal disorders, nanomaterials for bone 
     regeneration, non-opioid pain management, pancreatitis, 
     pathogen-inactivated dried cryoprecipitate, polycystic kidney 
     disease, post-traumatic osteoarthritis, pulmonary fibrosis, 
     respiratory health, Rett syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, 
     scleroderma, sleep disorders, spinal muscular atrophy, 
     sustained-release drug delivery, tinnitus, tuberculosis, 
     vaccine development for infectious disease, vascular 
     malformations, and women's heart disease. The additional 
     funding provided under the peer-reviewed medical research 
     program shall be devoted only to the purposes listed above.


                    ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM

       Concerns remain with the progress being made by the 
     Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to fully develop, 
     procure, and deploy an interoperable electronic health record 
     solution. The two systems must be completely and meaningfully 
     interoperable, and the Under Secretary of Defense 
     (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) is encouraged to 
     focus on the overall goal of seamless compatibility between 
     the two Departments' electronic health record systems.
       For the necessary oversight of this important program, the 
     Program Executive Officer (PEO) for the Defense Healthcare 
     Management Systems (DHMS) is directed to provide quarterly 
     reports to the congressional defense committees and the 
     Government Accountability Office on the cost and schedule of 
     the program, to include milestones, knowledge points, and 
     acquisition timelines, as well as quarterly obligation 
     reports. These reports should also include any changes to the 
     deployment timeline, including benchmarks, for full operating 
     capability; any refinements to the cost estimate for full 
     operating capability and the total lifecycle cost of the 
     program; an assurance that the acquisition strategy will 
     comply with the acquisition rules, requirements, guidelines, 
     and systems acquisition management practices of the federal 
     government; the status of the effort to achieve 
     interoperability between the electronic health record systems 
     of the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, including 
     the scope, cost, schedule, mapping to health data standards, 
     and performance benchmarks of the interoperable record; and 
     the progress toward developing, implementing, and fielding 
     the interoperable electronic health record throughout the two 
     Departments' medical facilities.
       The PEO DHMS is directed to continue briefing the House and 
     Senate Appropriations Committees on a quarterly basis, 
     coinciding with the report submission. Given that full 
     deployment of the new electronic health record is not 
     scheduled until fiscal year 2022, the Department of Defense 
     is expected to continue working on interim modifications and 
     enhancements to the current system to improve 
     interoperability in the near-term. Additionally, the PEO DHMS 
     is directed to provide written notification to the House and 
     Senate Appropriations Committees prior to obligating any 
     contract, or combination of contracts, for electronic health 
     record systems in excess of $5,000,000.
       Additionally, the Director of the Interagency Program 
     Office is directed to continue to provide quarterly briefings 
     on standards development, how those standards are being 
     incorporated by the two Departments, and the progress of 
     interoperability to the House and Senate Appropriations 
     Subcommittees for Defense and Military Construction, Veterans 
     Affairs, and Related Agencies. In an effort to ensure 
     government-wide accountability, the PEO DHMS, in coordination 
     with the appropriate personnel of the Department of Veterans 
     Affairs, is directed to provide the Federal Chief Information 
     Officer of the United States with monthly updates on progress 
     made by the two Departments to reach interoperability and 
     modernize their respective electronic health records.

                  joint improvised-threat defeat fund

       The fiscal year 2017 budget request includes $408,272,000 
     in Overseas Contingency Operations funding for the Joint 
     Improvised-Threat Defeat Fund. To preserve the essential 
     joint capabilities of the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat 
     Organization (JIDO) and eliminate any duplication with 
     Service capabilities, the agreement recommends transferring 
     $62,800,000 to the Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide 
     account in title IX.
       The budget request proposed consolidating the sub-accounts 
     under the appropriation into a single account titled Rapid 
     Acquisition and Threat Response. This flexibility would allow 
     for quick reaction changes in spending; however, it would 
     prevent the congressional defense committees from having any 
     insight into why or when these funding changes occur. 
     Therefore, the agreement provides the following funding 
     levels for JIDO programs: $101,286,000 for Rapid Capability 
     Delivery; $200,886,000 for Assist Situational Understanding; 
     and $37,300,000 for Enable Department of Defense 
     Responsiveness. The Director of the JIDO is directed to 
     provide quarterly reports to the congressional defense 
     committees should funding be shifted between the accounts not 
     later than 15 days after the end of the fiscal quarter.

                    OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

       The agreement provides $22,062,000 for the Office of the 
     Inspector General.

                     GENERAL PROVISIONS--THIS TITLE

       The agreement for title IX incorporates general provisions 
     from the House and Senate versions of the bill which were not 
     amended. Those general provisions that were addressed in the

  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by congratulating Chairman 
Frelinghuysen on bringing his first full bill to the House floor as 
chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I have greatly appreciated 
his friendship and steady leadership of the Defense Subcommittee.
  Further, I also thank our new subcommittee chairwoman, Kay Granger. 
She has been a great partner in completing the work on the fiscal year 
2017 conference report, and I look forward to working with her as we 
proceed.
  Finally, I thank the members of the subcommittee and our 
extraordinary staff for their wisdom and for their long hours that they 
have logged in putting this product together.
  The chairman has well described H.R. 1301. I would add that this bill 
includes strong positions countering Russian aggression, building 
partnership capacity, and supporting readiness. Because it is a product 
of bipartisan negotiation, this is a good bill, and I intend to support 
it.
  Despite my support for this legislation, I am extremely troubled that 
we are still working on the fiscal year 2017 Defense bill 5 months and 
8 days into the fiscal year.
  For nearly 6 months, the Department of Defense has been operating 
under two separate continuing resolutions, which wastes the time of 
people's lives and leads to inefficiencies in spending. I would 
emphasize this is not the fault of the committee. All that has been 
absent is the lack of political will on behalf of the majority party.
  Even more disconcerting is the fact that the Defense Appropriations 
Act is just one of 11 fiscal year 2017 appropriations bills that need 
to be completed by the end of next month. There is no excuse for them 
remaining unfinished. The investments made through these bills are 
vital to so many in our country, and they need equal attention from 
Congress and the administration.
  It is imperative that we strive every day to prioritize keeping 
America safe and supporting our brave servicemembers, but we must also 
prioritize educating our workforce, making improvements in public 
health, in science, and in our economic and transportation 
infrastructure.
  If we neglect these investments in our future and in the well-being 
and success of current families and future generations, then I am 
deeply concerned that we will not have a country worth defending.
  Confounding a confused fiscal situation, there is a $30 billion 
supplemental request for fiscal year 2017 recently submitted to the 
Office of Management and Budget by the Department of Defense, which 
should make its way to Congress in the next few weeks. Additionally, as 
the administration modifies its fiscal year 2018 budget request, they 
are without a predictable base on which to build.
  There is very little margin of error, given the few legislative days 
remaining before the continuing resolution expires on April 28. I, and 
I believe the chairman, do not view that date as another point for 
negotiation. It is an absolute deadline, and the value of this bill and 
every other appropriations bill diminishes the day they are not 
enacted.

                              {time}  1545

  In closing, I again appreciate the leadership and the management of 
this wonderful work by our chairman, Mr. Frelinghuysen. Going forward, 
I will work hard with the chairman. I will work hard with Chairwoman 
Granger, with Ranking Member Lowey, and the other members of our full 
committee to return the appropriations process to its normal schedule.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume 
to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger), chairwoman of the Defense 
Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1301, the 
FY17 Department of Defense Appropriations Act. The world is more 
dangerous and unstable than any time in recent history. The U.S. and 
our allies face constant threats from countries including Iran, Russia, 
China, and North Korea. ISIS and other global terrorists threaten our 
very way of life.
  Our number one responsibility as Members of Congress is to provide 
for the defense of this Nation. I commend Chairman Frelinghuysen for 
the outstanding job he did drafting the FY17 bill. He deserves our 
thanks for producing such a significant and meaningful bill.
  Since becoming the chairwoman of the Defense Subcommittee of the 
Committee on Appropriations, I have spent a lot of time talking to 
senior defense leaders to find out what they need to combat these 
threats. They have unanimously stated that the only thing our 
adversaries respect is strength, and they need this bill passed to 
ensure our military is as strong and effective as possible.
  Sequestration and reduced budget requests have caused the military to 
be underfunded for too long. This bill begins a process of rebuilding 
our military and giving our warfighters the resources they need to 
counter the numerous complex threats around the world. This bill 
reverses the drawdown of end strength and instead increases it by 
36,000 troops above the FY17 budget request. This bill reverses steep 
cuts to procurement by funding additional ships and aircraft to 
modernize our weapons systems and address shortfalls. This is important 
because we have the smallest number of ships in the Navy since 1916, 
and the average age of an Air Force aircraft is 27 years old. Marine 
aviation squadrons have been forced to salvage parts from museums in 
order to keep our planes flying.
  In every meeting I have had with defense leadership, they emphasize 
the devastating impact both sequestration and operating under a 
continuing resolution have on our security. When asked about the impact 
of a full year CR, General Goldfein, chief of staff of the Air Force, 
said: ``There is no enemy on the planet that can do more damage to the 
United States Air Force than us not getting a budget.''
  Our military is counting on us to pass this bill now. It is the only 
way to ensure the United States will be strong and able to lead in this 
very dangerous world. I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. Lowey), the ranking member of the full committee.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen, 
Chairwoman Granger, and Ranking Member Visclosky for their hard work 
and cooperation. Today's bill is the product of good faith bipartisan 
and bicameral negotiation.
  Each Member of this body will need to determine whether positive 
aspects of this bill outweigh uncertainty about the prospects of 10 
other critical funding bills languishing without a clear path forward. 
Unlike the Defense Appropriations bill passed by the House last June, 
this bill keeps faith with existing caps on discretionary spending. It 
does not use a budget gimmick to create a mid-year shortfall in 
funding, which would have affected salaries and mission support for men 
and women serving bravely in harm's way.
  I thank the chairman for increasing cybersecurity operations by 
nearly $1 billion; fully funding the European Reassurance Initiative in 
response to Russian aggression; investing in the intelligence, 
surveillance, and reconnaissance resources combatant commanders clamor 
for; and assisting men and women in uniform by increasing pay by 2.1 
percent, adding $25 million for sexual assault prevention and response, 
and providing $33.8 billion for the Defense Health Program.
  Despite these positive attributes, I would be remiss not to remind 
this body that the 2017 appropriations process can be described as 
nothing but a failure that continues to this day, more than 5 months 
into the fiscal year. The Defense bill that we consider today could 
have and should have been finished in September 2016. The majority 
chose to punt the deadline for this and 10 other appropriations bills 
until April for entirely political reasons.
  All Americans know we must ensure our Armed Forces are staffed, 
trained, and equipped to meet the challenges they face. We must fulfill 
that responsibility without neglecting the critical services and 
investments funded through the 10 other unfinished appropriations 
bills.
  I am very concerned that the House Republican leadership is proposing 
to

[[Page H1937]]

move one bill forward without any indication that the other 10 will see 
the light of day.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry), the chairman of the 
Committee on Armed Services.
  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman for 
yielding time and commend him for his continuing leadership on national 
security. I also thank the chairwoman of this subcommittee, Ms. 
Granger, and the ranking member, Mr. Visclosky, for their continuing 
work on national security.
  Mr. Speaker, it is important that we pass this bill now. The 
Department of Defense is currently operating under a continuing 
resolution, which means you have got to spend the same money this year 
that you spent last year, and you have to spend it on the same things. 
Even if you don't need to spend money on something this year that you 
spent last year, you have to. So it is wasteful. But you also can't 
spend money on new things, even though new threats arise. It is not 
good for any part of government. It is particularly bad for the 
Department of Defense. It is important to pass this bill now to remove 
this continuing resolution and have a regular appropriation bill.

  Secondly, this bill is consistent with the Defense Authorization 
Conference Report which passed this House in December. All but four 
Republicans and all but 30 Democrats in the House voted for that 
measure in December. This is very consistent with that, and I hope it 
gets at least as much support as that bill did in December.
  There are a few differences. We are further into the fiscal year, so 
the committee was able to fund some additional priorities that were in 
the House-passed authorization bill that we were not able to put in the 
conference report. I just think it is important for all of us to 
remember, Mr. Speaker, that the only answer to some of the readiness 
problems we are facing is modernization. We have had testimony that it 
takes twice as long to maintain an old F-18 aircraft, for example, as 
it does a new one. Well, this bill has some additional F-18s, and that 
is good for the pilots, good for the services that receive them. It 
also frees up maintenance to work on other things.
  Finally, it is important also to remember that this bill is just a 
first step in repairing and rebuilding the military. I am afraid all of 
us have underestimated the deep damage that has been done through 
sequestration, budget cuts, and a high tempo of operations. Just 
yesterday, I was out at Fort Campbell to see some of this and hear 
about some of this firsthand from the Army.
  This is an important essential first step, but shortly we should 
receive a supplemental appropriation to do more of the work of repair, 
and then we need to move toward an FY18 bill that really begins the 
rebuilding that, I think, on a bipartisan basis, most all of us in this 
Chamber would support. Remember, Mr. Speaker, the first job of the 
Federal Government is to defend the country. This is an important first 
step to help us fulfill that responsibility.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), who is a member of the Subcommittee on 
Defense.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Department of 
Defense Appropriations Act of 2017. Last year, I was unable to vote for 
this legislation, but the bill before us today is improved, and it is 
one that I can support.
  I was unable to vote for the previous bill because it included budget 
gimmicks that would have jeopardized a full year of funding for our 
troops and threatened readiness. I am very pleased to see this problem 
has been resolved. This bill provides the funding for the remainder of 
the 2017 fiscal year without breaking the budget caps. It also includes 
a much-needed pay raise for our servicemembers and ensures that they 
will have the equipment that they need to complete their missions and 
come home.
  What is disappointing is that we are voting on this legislation 
today, halfway through the fiscal year. This work should have been 
finished months ago. Instead, a stalled appropriations process has left 
the Defense Department and our troops operating under a damaging 
continuing resolution. Right now it doesn't appear that the FY18 
process will go any smoother.
  President Trump's proposed $54 billion increase for defense will come 
at the expense of essential domestic programs that our servicemen and -
women and their families depend upon: education for their children, 
quality healthcare for their families, safe roads to drive on, 
protection of our clean air and drinking water. The list goes on and 
on.
  Mr. Speaker, I am voting for this bill today, but I want to make it 
clear that I am very concerned about President Trump's proposed cuts 
that would pit our national security against the domestic needs of all 
Americans.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), my predecessor. He is a 
member of the Subcommittee on Defense of the Committee on 
Appropriations and a chairman in his own right.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the chairman on 
his assumption of the chairmanship of the full committee and for 
putting this bill together when he chaired the Subcommittee on Defense.
  This bill certainly represents the outcome of many hard choices. It 
prioritizes funding where our troops need it the most. It wisely 
invests in readiness, training, maintenance, and procurement, and 
ensures that our troops are prepared for the tasks before them. This 
bill also supports our efforts to defeat ISIL alongside our allies in 
the region as well as our continued focus on deterring Russian 
aggression.
  I am also pleased, Mr. Speaker, that this bill takes care of the 
troops and their families, granting them a long-awaited 2.1 percent pay 
raise. Time and again, our servicemembers put themselves in harm's way 
and respond to the myriad threats facing the Nation. This pay raise is 
one small way for us to honor their dedication and willingness to 
serve.
  As the threats we face continue to become more unpredictable, we must 
provide our troops with the tools that they need to win in uncertain 
times. This bill goes a long way toward restoring the shortfalls in 
manpower and readiness that our military has endured in recent years.
  In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me call attention again to Will Smith, 
who has been a clerk of this committee for 6 years and served as my 
chief of staff in my private office for many years before. This is 
likely his last appropriations bill on the floor to help manage and put 
together, and so I want to say to Will and all of you in behalf of 
saying something good about Will, what a great amount of service he 
rendered the Nation with a true Kentucky attitude, which he has.
  Will, we owe you a lot. Thank you for your service. You have been 
great. We wish you Godspeed.

                              {time}  1600

  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I would simply follow up on the 
chairman's remarks, and I also want to congratulate Mr. Smith on his 
life of service to his country. Mr. Pomerantz on our side was also 
mentioned. Again, both gentlemen and their service to this country are 
a reflection on public service, and I appreciate it very much on behalf 
of all of us in this Chamber.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
Ruppersberger), who is also a member of the Defense Subcommittee.
  Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the 
Department of Defense Appropriations Act.
  I thank Chairwoman Granger and Ranking Member Visclosky for bringing 
this bill to the floor.
  This bill helps to close gaps in readiness while making investments 
in research and development. These investments are critically important 
because I guarantee our adversaries know where we have work to do.
  Mr. Speaker, I represent a congressional district home to two Army 
bases, the NSA, several National Guard facilities, and dozens of our 
private sector partners. I serve on the board of the United States 
Naval Academy, and I co-chair the Army Caucus.
  My experience tells me we are living in a world that has changed 
since our Armed Forces entered the Middle East 16 years ago. While our 
men and women

[[Page H1938]]

in uniform fought asymmetric foes, our near-peer adversaries such as 
Russia and China made advancements in technology that threaten to 
degrade our military qualitative advantage.
  This appropriations bill ensures our troops are ready and that we 
have enough of them to get the job done. It fully funds the new end 
strength number and allows for a 2.1 percent pay raise for our troops. 
This is the least we can do for the brave men and women who sacrifice 
for our country.
  This bill also deters Russian aggression by fully funding the 
European Reassurance Initiative, and makes critical investments in 
missile defense technology.
  This bill is a solid start, and I encourage all of my colleagues to 
support it, but there is still work to be done. Our troops should trust 
that elected officials will support them and do their job to fund the 
government, just as we trust them to accomplish the mission assigned to 
them. Band-Aid budgets are bad for everyone--our partners in industry, 
the American taxpayers, and especially our Armed Forces.
  Now is not the time to argue over partisan issues. Congress should 
create a frontline of support for our Armed Forces that is just as 
strong as the frontline our soldiers have created to protect us.
  I call on all of my colleagues to work in a bipartisan fashion to 
pass this and the other FY17 appropriation bills as quickly as 
possible.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter).
  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that we are here 
hoping to end the continuing resolution on the Department of Defense, 
and I rise in support of the bill we are debating today.
  We all know too well that continuing resolutions are unacceptable 
burdens on the least and the greatest of our DOD assets, our Members, 
and civilians at a time of unprecedented threats to our Nation. I thank 
Chairman Frelinghuysen and Chairwoman Granger for bringing this bill to 
the floor and for their unwavering commitment to the men and women in 
uniform, which will continue under their leadership in the future.
  I also thank this committee for fully funding an increase of Active, 
Guard, and Reserve soldiers. I am also co-chair of the Army Caucus, and 
providing them with the modern equipment and training necessary to keep 
them alive and the greatest fighting force on Earth is very important 
to the defense of our Nation.
  We have more that we need to consider.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. McClintock). The time of the gentleman 
has expired.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to 
the gentleman.
  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Army Vice Chief of Staff Daniel Allyn recently 
told the House Armed Services Committee that our Army requires 
modernization equipment to win decisively, but today we are outraged, 
outgunned, and outdated. At the present time, he says that only three 
of the Army's 58 brigade combat teams are ready to fight. It is 
crucial, and I urge my colleagues to support this appropriations bill 
and fully fund our armed services.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Lee), who is a member of the full Appropriations 
Committee.
  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank Mr. Visclosky for yielding. 
I also thank him for his tremendous leadership as our ranking member, 
and giving us all an opportunity to really voice our opinions and put 
our points of view forward in a very fair way.
  I rise in opposition to this bill, however.
  I offered two amendments to this bill, the fiscal year 2017 Defense 
Appropriations bill, and I am really disappointed to once again see 
that my amendments were not made in order. I want to explain these two 
amendments because this is the only chance that we will have to talk 
about this.
  The first amendment, which I have offered several times on a 
bipartisan basis, would prohibit the funding for the 2001 Authorization 
for Use of Military Force, the AUMF, beginning on September 30, 2017. 
And mind you, that 6-month window provides Congress ample opportunity 
to draft and debate a new AUMF and to vote it up or down.
  Clearly, Congress is required to act. This amendment would require 
Congress to finally debate and vote on nearly a 3-year-long war that is 
raging in the Middle East, a war that has already claimed the lives of 
several brave servicemembers. The House simply cannot continue to 
abdicate its constitutional responsibility to give the American people 
a voice in matters of war and peace.
  I offered another amendment, which would prohibit funding for United 
States combat troops in Syria.
  Mr. Speaker, this amendment was really simple, but, once again, I am 
sad to say that it was not made in order. This amendment would use the 
power of the purse to prevent funding for combat operations in Syria, 
unless the purpose is to rescue or protect members of the Armed Forces 
from danger.

  We can all agree that ISIL must be degraded and dismantled, but 
Congress continues to be missing in action from this debate.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman.
  Ms. LEE. We know that the 2001 authorization was specific to 9/11. 
And I voted against it because I knew it would be broadly interpreted, 
which it has been. Sadly, it is a blank check for war. Actually, the 
Congressional Research Service provided us a declassified report 
saying--and this was last year--it had been used over 35 times. Nothing 
related to 9/11. So this blank check needs to be repealed.
  We also know that ISIL didn't even exist in 2001. Every day, more 
bombs fall and the battlefield expands. We have already spent billions 
of dollars against this unauthorized war.
  Congress needs to show up for work, muster its courage, exercise its 
constitutional responsibility for debate, and vote on the ongoing war 
in Iraq and Syria. We owe nothing less to our brave men and women who 
are in harm's way. It is past time to force a debate and vote on this 
issue. Hopefully, one day we will make these amendments in order and, 
hopefully, we will have bipartisan support to just move forward and do 
our job as Members of Congress, which is what the Constitution 
requires.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), and thank him for his 
service on the Defense Appropriations Committee.
  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill. 
I want to first start by commending the chairman of the full committee 
and the former chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Frelinghuysen, for his 
unwavering commitment to the men and women in uniform, and also for 
bringing this great bill forward.
  I also want to recognize the good work and leadership of the new 
subcommittee chairwoman, that titanium Texan, Ms. Granger.
  Mr. Speaker, I have to also mention the ranking members, Mrs. Lowey 
and Mr. Visclosky, because this, frankly, is a partnership in allowing 
this bill to come forward.
  Mr. Speaker, with this bill, Congress fulfills what I believe is an 
essential part of what we are here to do and what government's 
essential role is--to provide for the common defense.
  This bill is essential for the men and women who serve our Nation 
with distinction in the military.
  This bill funds a 2.1 percent pay raise for the military, something 
that they so deserve.
  It also targets resources for the health care for our servicemembers 
and their family members.
  Throughout the year--and you have already heard it--we have heard 
testimony time and time again from our service chiefs about the 
necessity to address our military's alarming readiness shortfalls. This 
bill, Mr. Speaker, addresses the readiness problems that are making it 
more and more difficult for our troops. We devote resources to prepare 
our troops both for combat and peacetime missions, including flight 
time and training, to ensure that we maintain our military superiority.
  Lastly, this bill provides the necessary essential equipment, weapon 
systems, and platforms needed to

[[Page H1939]]

maintain and sustain our essential military superiority, whether it is 
in the air, in the sea, or on the ground.
  Mr. Speaker, I would just end with what I mentioned before: I believe 
the principal job of the Federal Government is to defend and protect 
our country. The Defense Appropriations bill before us does just that, 
and it deserves all of our support.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Visclosky very much.
  Mr. Speaker, every year, our top responsibility as appropriators is 
to finish the 12 spending bills that keep our government running by 
October 1 of the year before that fiscal year is supposed to start. But 
here we are today, March 8, halfway into fiscal year 2017, finally 
voting on a compromise bill that closely reflects the request the last 
administration delivered to us 1 year ago February.
  Our service chiefs and Secretaries present a consistent, clear 
message to Congress. They have pleaded for stability and predictability 
in the budget so they could ensure complete readiness of America's 
forces. Force readiness remains the defense community's top priority. 
Funding the capabilities to provide this responsibility must remain our 
top priority. We must approach Congress' appropriations responsibility 
from the historic bipartisan process that has broken down once too many 
times in recent years.
  This political infighting harms the stability and predictability 
necessary for our Armed Forces to properly plan. It left both our 
adversaries and allies questioning our ability to defend or support the 
multiple conflicts we are currently engaged with abroad.

  This compromise worked out by our responsible colleagues, Chairwoman 
Granger, Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Visclosky, Ranking 
Member Lowey; and their Senate counterparts are strong glimmers of hope 
that we might actually finish the 2017 appropriations responsibilities. 
But we have ten additional subcommittee bills that are equally 
important and account for nearly half of our budget.
  When will we vote on those compromised bills?
  I could think of little that would be more irresponsible than to only 
move this defense bill and leave the remaining departments and agencies 
operating under a continuing resolution.
  I have always supported our troops and our national defense. However, 
we know the safety and well-being of the American people does not 
merely rely on defense funding. It is rooted in the stability of the 
Republic they are sworn to protect and defend. We have a responsibility 
there, equally important.
  Our financial commitments to energy independence, critical 
infrastructure, homeland security, funding for first responders, 
teachers, and healthcare programs are equally necessary to increase 
America's security at home and abroad. I hope my colleagues alleviate 
this concern and quickly package the remaining bills for a vote, as the 
American people so richly deserve.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Womack), and I thank him for his great 
contributions to the Defense Subcommittee on Appropriations.

                              {time}  1615

  Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I consider it one of the great honors in 
Congress to serve on the Defense Appropriations Committee with some 
real champions for national security: guys like Rodney Frelinghuysen, 
the overall chairman; Chairwoman Kay Granger from the Defense 
Subcommittee; my friend Pete Visclosky, the ranking member. These are 
all people that have a heart and a soul for what we are trying to do 
here today, and that is to provide for the common defense. It is our 
constitutional duty. And guys like Mac Thornberry, the chairman of the 
House Armed Services Committee. A lot of champions here that believe in 
a strong national defense.
  Mr. Speaker, not only does this bill rebuild readiness by giving our 
troops the equipment they need, but it also reverses Obama-era cuts to 
the developing defense platforms, stops troop drawdowns, and perhaps 
most importantly, gives our warfighters a much-deserved pay raise.
  As a 30-year veteran of the Arkansas Army National Guard, I am 
particularly pleased that this bill provides the funding necessary to 
ensure the National Guard remains a fully operational force.
  It is a good bill, Mr. Speaker, and with a willing partner in the 
White House and a pledge to rebuild our military, it marks the first 
step, an important first step our Congress has to take to complete our 
business from last year; and it gives our defenders what they need and 
deserve, and that is certainty.
  Threats are growing. America must project strength. That starts with 
creating a military so strong that we never send our men and women 
downrange in a fair fight.
  I call on my colleagues to stand strong against our enemies. Take 
this first step today in projecting power with our financial 
commitment.
  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby), a new member of the Defense 
Subcommittee on Appropriations.
  Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the leadership of Chairman 
Frelinghuysen at the full committee and Chairwoman Granger at the 
Defense Subcommittee on this bill.
  Providing for the common defense of our Nation is one of the most 
fundamental duties of Congress under the Constitution.
  Last week I appreciated the message that President Trump delivered in 
his joint session address, and I was particularly encouraged by his 
call to properly fund our military. For the last 6 years, we have been 
in almost constant tension with an administration whose sequestration 
policy threatened to hollow out our military.
  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, 
I stand ready to work with the President and Secretary Mattis to make 
sure our military is properly funded, well equipped, and ready for the 
fight. That is why I am so proud to support this Defense Appropriations 
bill.
  Our bill rejects the Obama administration's proposed troop level 
reductions that would have amounted to as many as 36,000 servicemen and 
-women cut from the ranks. Instead, our bill provides funding for an 
additional 1,000 Active-Duty Army soldiers, 1,000 Army National Guard 
soldiers, 1,000 Army Reserve soldiers, and 1,000 Active-Duty marines. 
The bill also fully funds a much-deserved 2.1 percent pay raise for 
military personnel.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent a district that is home to both 
Fort Rucker, the home of Army aviation, and Maxwell-Gunter Air Force 
Base, the intellectual center of the Air Force.
  I am pleased to report that this bill contains a strong budget for 
Army aviation, including $187 million for the 28 Lakota helicopters, 
which are the primary aircraft used for training at Fort Rucker.
  It also contains an increase of almost $450 million for the Air 
Force's cybersecurity efforts. Maxwell's Air Force Cyber College at Air 
University plays a key part in cybersecurity, serving as an 
intellectual hub for the Air Force in the emerging battlefield for 
cyber warfare.
  This appropriations bill also contains funding for the procurement of 
74 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. The Montgomery-based 187th Fighter Wing 
is on the short list for being assigned this next generation fighter 
jet, and our Alabama congressional delegation is working together to 
make the case to the Air Force why this special unit is an ideal fit.
  Mr. Speaker, I take our responsibility to craft sound military 
spending plans very seriously. I am pleased the House is moving the 
fiscal year 2017 Defense Appropriations bill this week, and I urge my 
colleagues to support its passage.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins). He is a great member of 
the full committee.
  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I want to say thank you to

[[Page H1940]]

Mr. Frelinghuysen for the outstanding work and effort that he has put 
into this critically important piece of legislation, and I thank 
Chairwoman Granger for her strong support in advancing this much-needed 
legislation.
  The people before me have talked so eloquently about our 
responsibility as Members of Congress to defend and protect our Nation. 
We have talked about national security. We have talked about troops. We 
have talked about battling terrorism. And that is what this bill does.
  I want to take a slightly different approach and say something about 
what this bill does in all of our communities, not just distant lands 
around the world, but in our home communities. I want to highlight one 
area that will make a real difference in all of our communities, and 
that is the National Guard's Counterdrug Program.
  This program is essential in detecting, disrupting, and curtailing 
drug trafficking. It provides resources to almost every State and 
territory to help train personnel and run counterdrug missions. The 
National Guard supports almost 60,000 requests a year for assistance 
from local law enforcement agencies.

  In fiscal year 2014, National Guard counterdrug programs took almost 
$12 billion in illegal drugs off the street. This minor investment is 
paying major dividends. During NDAA consideration, I helped secure an 
amendment to increase funding for this account by $30 million because 
this program works.
  This legislation under consideration today also increases funding for 
this vital program by $135 million more than the amount requested by 
then-President Obama. This is a critical moment in combating the drug 
crisis, and we must fully fund every program that will help us solve 
it.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo), a great member of the 
full committee.
  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen for the 
time.
  I rise today in strong support of the fiscal year 2017 Defense 
Appropriations bill. I have long said that the number one 
constitutional responsibility of this body is the common defense of 
this Nation, and today, the Appropriations Committee, under the 
leadership of Chairman Frelinghuysen, has once again shown the 
importance that we place on this most sacred duty.
  After years of weak budget requests from our prior administration, 
this bill contains over $5.2 billion over the 2016 level and $1.5 
billion more than the Obama administration's request.
  Included in this appropriations bill is the funding of 10 new ships 
for our Navy, including an LPD, essential to our Marine Corps mission, 
as well as 3 destroyers, 2 Virginia class submarines, 3 LCSs, and an 
LHA, all ships desperately needed by our Navy and Marine Corps.
  Funding these ships steadily is not only a key to keeping our 
military strong, but also keeps our industrial base healthy and keeps 
these ships affordable in the long run.
  Finally, this appropriations bill takes the first steps toward 
rebuilding our military, showing our allies that they can trust us, and 
showing our enemies they should fear us.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his work and his staff's work 
on this fine bill, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this 
important legislation.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  I will end where I began, and that is because I think this will be 
the last time that the chair and I manage a Defense Appropriations bill 
together on the floor. It has been a delightful relationship, and I 
look forward to it continuing as you are chairman of the full 
committee.
  Again, I thank the staff and look forward to working with Chairwoman 
Granger, and I also ask my colleagues to support the bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support the bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the FY2017 
Defense Appropriations bill. I commend Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking 
Member Lowey, our new Chairwoman Granger and Ranking Member Visclosky 
for their leadership on this bill. I would also like to thank our 
dedicated professional staff who have tirelessly worked on this 
agreement.
  I have served on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee for 
many years and providing for our men and women in uniform is a 
privilege and an honor. This bill provides vital funding for our Armed 
Services, including a 2.1 percent pay raise and additional funding for 
increased end strength.
  As many of us have noted, our military is in a precarious position, 
and this bill is an important first step to rebuild and restore our 
military strength. It provides funding for necessary shipbuilding; 
aircraft and vehicle procurement; and important research and 
development to maintain our technological superiority. The bill also 
provides vital Operations and Maintenance funding for facility 
sustainment, restoration, and modernization programs.
  I look forward to working with the new Administration and providing 
the resources our military needs to maintain our position in the world 
as well as continue to invest in our most important asset--the men and 
women our United States Armed Forces.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.
  Pursuant to House Resolution 174, the previous question is ordered on 
the bill.
  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.
  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was 
read the third time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.
  Pursuant to clause 10 of rule XX, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.
