                AMERICANS DESERVE BIPARTISAN TAX REFORM

  (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, the tax bill put forth today by 
congressional Republicans is a gift to the wealthiest 1 percent and 
multinational corporations at the expense of our students, homeowners, 
and seniors.
  It eliminates critical deductions that help central coast families, 
including deductions for State and local taxes, mortgage interest, 
student loans, and medical expenses.
  With wildfire season in California growing longer each year, this 
bill callously eliminates tax relief for personal casualty losses 
resulting from wildfires as well as earthquakes. In fact, this bill 
would raise taxes on 36 million working and middle class taxpayers by 
an average of $1,130 a year.
  With a national debt that has now surpassed $20 trillion, the 
American people cannot afford this tax bill that adds $1.5 trillion to 
the deficit and leaves our children stuck with the bill. Americans 
deserve bipartisan tax reform that simplifies our Tax Code and puts the 
middle class first.
