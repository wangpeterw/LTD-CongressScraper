                      FRUIT OF THE POISONOUS TREE

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, there is a legal term called ``fruit 
of the poisonous tree.''
  If the evidence, or tree, is tainted, then anything gained from the 
evidence, the fruit, is tainted as well.
  A former FBI Director intentionally leaked questionable memos about 
President Trump, hoping it would lead to the appointment of a special 
prosecutor. It did. Since the evidence for a special prosecutor was 
tainted, the appointment of the special prosecutor was tainted, too. If 
the premise is faulty, the conclusion is faulty.
  To continue the investigation is to violate a legal principle and 
dishonor our system of justice. The process is poisoned. The special 
prosecutor should cease and desist.
