                       CONGRATULATING BEAU ALLEN

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Beau Allen, a 
Minnetonka High School graduate and defensive tackle for the 
Philadelphia Eagles, who is now on his way to play in the Super Bowl 
after a strong performance in the NFC Championship Game just a week 
ago.
  Beau graduated from Minnetonka High School in 2010, and he is the 
only Minnetonka student in history to start all 4 years. After 
graduating, he went on to play for Wisconsin and didn't miss a game in 
his 4 years on that team. And then, in 2014, Beau was a seventh-round 
NFL pick and joined the Philadelphia Eagles.
  He is a key member of the team's defensive line rotation. The Eagles' 
defense is now ranked first against the run, the fourth in the points 
allowed, and fourth overall.
  As a Vikings fan, I was crushed that our season ended the way that it 
did, but it is exciting to see someone from our community now being 
able to play in the Super Bowl. I look forward to seeing Minnetonka 
represented on the field this Sunday.
  Good luck, Beau.
