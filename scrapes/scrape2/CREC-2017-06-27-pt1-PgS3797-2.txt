          RECOGNIZING THE HUNTLEY PROJECT IRRIGATION DISTRICT

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 
Huntley Project Irrigation District for its 110th anniversary and for 
its impact on Montana. The district originated from an irrigation 
project in southern Montana that was completed by the Bureau of 
Reclamation in 1907. The Huntley Project was one of the first 
Reclamation projects in Montana and led to the development and success 
of agricultural land in much of the surrounding area. As agriculture is 
Montana's No. 1 industry, it is critical that farmers and ranchers have 
irrigation projects set in place that are able to provide a reliable 
supply of water for their crops.
  Leading by example is the way we do things in Montana, and this 
project shows how the dedication and ingenuity of our farmers and 
ranchers works. It has led to economic development for the area and 
beyond and transformed farming areas to be even more fruitful for our 
farmers and ranchers.
  Our farmers and ranchers have made it through the tough times because 
of determination and have overcome many challenges. This anniversary 
celebrates more than an irrigation project but honors the determination 
and ambition of the Montana farmer and rancher. Congratulations again 
for the 110th anniversary of the Huntley Project, and thank you to 
everyone who has made it a success.
