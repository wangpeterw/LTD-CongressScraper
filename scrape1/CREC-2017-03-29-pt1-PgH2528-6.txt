Russia is interfering with the democracies of Europe, we hear crickets.

our democracy and the Putin regime.
  Mr. Speaker, there is smoke; there is fire. Our Republic is being 
threatened. We are the first responders, and we can only put this fire 
out with the truth. We need to establish an independent commission to 
investigate the Trump-Russian ties and find our way to the truth.
