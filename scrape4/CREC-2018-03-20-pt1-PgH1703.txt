           CONGRATULATING THE BELLEVILLE WEST BASKETBALL TEAM

  (Mr. BOST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, today I proudly honor the Belleville West 
basketball team for winning the 2018 4A State tournament.
  It was truly a ``March Madness'' in Peoria, Illinois, this weekend as 
the Maroons played in a back-and-forth State title game against Whitney 
Young Dolphins. It took overtime, but Belleville West held off Whitney 
Young for a 60 to 56 victory to take home the championship trophy. This 
is the first basketball State title in school history.
  I extend a heartfelt congratulations to the players, coaches, staff, 
school officials, families, and friends who supported these young men 
on this incredible journey. Illinois 12th is proud of you.
  Go, Maroons.
