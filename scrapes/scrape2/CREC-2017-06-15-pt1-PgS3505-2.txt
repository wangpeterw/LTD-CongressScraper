                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Holy God, in whose presence dark nights of challenges are dispelled 
by the dawn of Your love, You know our needs before we express them. 
Thank You for daily providing our lawmakers with guidance and strength.
  Lord, we pause to thank You for the courage and sacrificial service 
of our Capitol Police. Forgive us when we take their daily courageous 
service for granted. Lord, forgive us, also, when we seem to forget 
that words matter and can become seeds that will bring a bitter 
harvest.
  Bring speedy healing to all those injured in yesterday's shooting and 
solace for all of us affected by this tragedy.
  Today, use our Senators as instruments of Your peace, bringing unity 
from division, light from darkness, joy from sadness, and hope from 
despair.
  We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.
