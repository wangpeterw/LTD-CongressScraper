   SENATE RESOLUTION 218--CELEBRATING AND REAFFIRMING THE STRATEGIC 
  PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND ROMANIA ON THE TWENTIETH 
                      ANNIVERSARY OF ITS INCEPTION

  Mr. JOHNSON (for himself and Mr. Murphy) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:

                              S. Res. 218

       Whereas, in 1997, the Governments of the United States and 
     Romania embarked upon a strategic partnership rooted in our 
     mutual embrace of popular sovereignty, individual rights, 
     free markets, and the rule of law, and our commitment to 
     transatlantic security and prosperity;
       Whereas the Government of Romania has striven to advance 
     security and democratic principles in Southeast Europe, and 
     has participated actively in building a Europe whole, free, 
     and at peace;
       Whereas the strategic partnership between the United States 
     and Romania has helped forge durable economic and cultural 
     bonds between our two countries;
       Whereas the Government of Romania recently announced that 
     it will raise defense spending to two percent of its gross 
     domestic product (GDP) in 2017 in order to meet the minimum 
     level of defense expenditures pledged at the 2014 NATO Wales 
     Summit;
       Whereas NATO's first ``Aegis Ashore'' missile defense 
     installation became operational on May 12, 2016, at Deveselu 
     Base in Romania, representing a significant increase in 
     NATO's capacity to defend against ballistic missile threats 
     outside the Euro-Atlantic zone;
       Whereas the Romanian Armed Forces have supported NATO and 
     United States operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other 
     theatres for over a decade, contributing more than 30,000 
     total combat and support personnel to those missions;
       Whereas Romania maintains the fifth largest contingent in 
     NATO's Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, with over 600 
     troops helping to train, advise, and assist the Afghan 
     National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) and Afghan 
     security institutions;
       Whereas Romania is a member of the Global Coalition to 
     Defeat ISIS and has deployed military trainers to Iraq to 
     train Iraqi Security Forces and provided humanitarian 
     assistance to the people of Iraq and Syria;
       Whereas the people and Governments of the United States and 
     Romania share a common interest in deepening our economic 
     relationship through increased bilateral trade and investment 
     and projecting economic stability and prosperity across 
     Southeast Europe;
       Whereas, in October 2017, Romania will host the tenth 
     annual United States Commercial Service Trade Winds Forum and 
     Trade Mission, helping United States companies explore new 
     opportunities in Romania and across Southeast Europe;
       Whereas the Governments of the United States and Romania 
     are working closely together to develop an ambitious 
     bilateral economic, trade, and investment agenda, including 
     through a record attendance this year by Romanian companies 
     to the United States SelectUSA Summit;

       Whereas the talent, energy, and creativity of the Romanian 
     people have nurtured a vibrant society, embracing innovation 
     and entrepreneurship, and inspiring new generations of young 
     Romanian leaders in business, technology and advanced 
     sciences;
       Whereas the Government of Romania is setting a positive 
     example through its continued efforts to defend the rule of 
     law, to strengthen judicial independence, and to fight 
     against corruption, notably through the work of Romania's 
     National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA);
       Whereas the rich heritage of many generations of Romanian-
     Americans have made indelible contributions to America's 
     cultural tapestry; and
       Whereas 2018 will mark the Centennial Anniversary of 
     Romanian unification, a milestone to be lauded and 
     celebrated: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) celebrates 20 years of close, strategic partnership 
     between the United States and Romania and applauds Romania's 
     significant contributions and commitment to transatlantic 
     security and prosperity;
       (2) commends the Government of Romania for its advancements 
     in democratic governance, the rule of law, and a principled 
     and inclusive society which provides opportunities for 
     development and growth, and urges continued progress in these 
     areas; and
       (3) affirms the desire of the Senate to continue 
     strengthening the strategic partnership between the United 
     States and Romania and to inspire future generations of young 
     leaders to cherish, preserve, and develop the friendship 
     between our two nations.
