            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time 
to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the 
Democratic leader, on January 3, 2018, the Senate proceed to executive 
session for the consideration of the following nomination: Executive 
Calendar No. 508. I ask consent that there be 30 minutes of debate, 
equally divided in the usual form; that following the use or yielding 
back of time, the Senate vote on the nomination with no intervening 
action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the table; that the President be 
immediately notified of the Senate's action; that no further motions be 
in order; and that any statements relating to the nomination be printed 
in the Record. I further ask that notwithstanding rule XXXI, the 
nomination be held in status quo into the second session of the 115th 
Congress.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
