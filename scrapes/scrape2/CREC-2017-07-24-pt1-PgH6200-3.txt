           REMEMBERING HEROES JACOB CHESTNUT AND JOHN GIBSON

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, every day on Capitol Hill, we have heroes 
among us, our Capitol Police. Five weeks ago, three of these heroes 
saved lives. They killed a deranged man who opened fire on the 
Republican baseball team. Two heroes were wounded, Crystal Griner and 
David Bailey. Our brave Capitol Police prevented a massacre.
  Another massacre was prevented by the Capitol Police on June 24 of 
1998, 19 years ago today. My hometown of Sugar Land, Texas, still hurts 
over a hero we knew well, Detective John Gibson. He was killed a few 
feet from where I am standing.
  Like Crystal and David, Detective Gibson was assigned to protect a 
member of House leadership, my neighbor, and my predecessor, Majority 
Leader Tom DeLay. Gibson heard Officer Jacob Chestnut being killed by 
an intruder. He shot the attacker, despite being mortally wounded.
  Our Capitol Police are true heroes. May we always remember two 
special heroes, Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson.
