               HONORING INDIANA STATE SENATOR DAVID LONG

  (Mr. BANKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, the 2018 session of the 
Indiana General Assembly will draw to a close, and with it, so will the 
career of one of the Hoosier State's most distinguished legislators.
  Senate President Pro Tempore Senator David Long recently announced 
that, after 22 years of public service, he will retire later this year. 
Under his transformational leadership, our State enacted sweeping 
education reforms, balanced the budget, delivered historic tax cuts, 
advanced the cause of life, and passed right-to-work legislation.
  Senator Long played a pivotal role in our State's progress over the 
last decade and a half, and his impact in Indiana will be felt for 
generations to come.
  My wife, Amanda, and I both had the honor of serving with David in 
the State Senate, and we are proud to call him a mentor and friend. 
During my time at the statehouse, I learned so much from Senator Long; 
and in my work here in the Congress, I am constantly reminded of 
lessons I learned from him when we served together.
  Hoosiers deeply appreciate Senator Long's incredible record of 
accomplishment during his time in office. I wish him; his wife, 
Melissa; and his family the very best in the years to come.
