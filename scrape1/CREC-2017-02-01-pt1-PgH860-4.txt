            GET AMERICA MOVING BY INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT

  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, the clock is ticking. Not that clock, but 
the new clock that I put up on the Democratic side of the 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which is the cost of 
congestion clock.
  The President has proposed $1 trillion investment in infrastructure. 
He went to the Republican Conference last week and said: Fix it first, 
and we want it in the first 100 days. I am with him on that, we should 
do that, and I have proposals to actually fund a way to get there. Not 
to $1 trillion, but a good part of the way.
  So this clock indicates, from the day he was sworn in, noon a week 
ago Friday to today, the cost of congestion for American commerce, the 
movement of goods, and the American people. It is $438 million per day.
  So the clock is ticking. Let's get America moving again, and let's 
invest in our infrastructure.
