                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.

[[Page H7228]]

  As Members of the people's House return to Washington, delayed by the 
storms that have blown through the Southeast, we ask Your blessing upon 
them that they might be all the more focused in their work and, as 
modeled by so many Americans in their efforts these past days in 
helping their neighbors, prepared to work together to address our 
Nation's most pressing needs.
  Continue to bless those who are recovering from hurricane destruction 
and those fighting, still, the storms of wildfire that plague our 
Western States.
  Blanket those who fight to overcome these national disasters with 
Your spirit of strength and endurance, and preserve them all from harm.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
