                         HONORING TRUCKER DUKES

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, today let us honor and recognize a young 
Maui boy whose life touched hearts around the world and whose legacy 
will live on through the millions that he inspired.
  Trucker Dukes was not quite 4 years old when he took his last breath 
this past Friday after a painful battle with stage IV neuroblastoma and 
2 years of intense treatment.
  Trucker's dad is a firefighter, and like father, like son, Trucker 
loved fire trucks. When Trucker went to New York for treatment, the New 
York Fire Department coordinated a very special third birthday party 
celebration and swore him in as an honorary firefighter.
  After Trucker passed away, his parents, Shauna and Joshua, shared 
this message: ``If there's one thing I hope, it is that you love a 
little harder . . . a little better. Go home, stop the craziness in 
your life, and just kiss your loved ones more, tell them you love them 
more. None of us are promised tomorrow.''
