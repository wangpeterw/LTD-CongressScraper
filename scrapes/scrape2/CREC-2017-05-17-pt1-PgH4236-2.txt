                     FOCUSING ON OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

  (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, on the first day of this month, President 
Trump promised an infrastructure package ``in the next 2 to 3 weeks, 
maybe sooner.''
  Here we are into week three and in the middle of National 
Infrastructure Week. So, Mr. President, where is the plan?
  I wish we were spending today working together to create jobs by 
making meaningful investments in our roads, our bridges, our rail, and 
our airports. That is what the hardworking men and women I represent 
wish Washington would focus on, too. But, instead, at breakfast tables 
all over the country, moms and dads turn on the morning news and have 
to explain to their kids what is an obstruction of justice before 
putting their kids on the school bus and traverse our bumpy and 
potholed roads.
  This is a dark moment in our Nation's history. History demands that 
we rise to the occasion. Nobody is above the law, not even the 
President of the United States of America.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing for the good 
of our country. Join us in demanding a true and independent 
investigation to get to the bottom of the President's ties to Vladimir 
Putin and any possible attempted coverup.
