                        REMEMBERING TIM MITCHELL

  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I wish to express my deep sorrow 
on the passing of Tim Mitchell. Through his absolute dedication to this 
institution and the special kind of person he was, Tim made the Senate 
a better place.
  Tim served as the assistant secretary for the minority. As Senator 
Reid shared during his September remarks in celebration of Tim's 25 
years of exemplary service, Tim began his career in the Senate working 
for Senator Don Riegle, Jr., of Michigan.
  He later worked for Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota and the 
Democratic Policy & Communications Committee before joining the 
Democratic floor staff in 2001. Tim also took night classes at Catholic 
University of America Columbus School of Law--an impressive feat.
  The Senate often calls for long days and longer nights. Debates on 
the floor may get heated, rollcall votes may drag on for hours, but Tim 
always kept a calm temperament and kind demeanor. He was soft spoken, 
but firm--not an easy feat while juggling the Members of this body's 
unique needs and passions.
  He was simply the best at what he did, and he made a real difference 
in how the Senate worked. The value of his service is incalculable.
  To Tim's family--his wife, Alicia, and his 11-year-old son, Ben--I am 
so sorry for your loss. I am forever grateful that you shared Tim with 
us for so many years.
  I echo Senator Reid's previous remarks: Tim's time here changed the 
Senate and this country for the better.
