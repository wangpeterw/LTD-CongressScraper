                      BEST BUDDIES FRIENDSHIP WALK

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Best 
Buddies International for a successful 5K walk in downtown Miami this 
past Saturday, March 17.
  Best Buddies International was founded in 1989 by one of my 
constituents, Anthony K. Shriver, and it promotes the idea that every 
person has a gift and that every person can contribute. This message is 
emblematic of what makes America successful, and it has made Best 
Buddies a thriving global organization serving thousands of individuals 
with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
  The Best Buddies Friendship Walk allows those who are often excluded 
because of their differences the opportunity to create one-on-one 
friendships that last a lifetime. It is that model that has allowed 
Best Buddies to make extraordinary advancements in the autism community 
to increase understanding and acceptance of the disability.
  I would like to extend my congratulations for a successful Best 
Buddies Friendship Walk. I am so delighted to see my constituents 
giving the gift of friendship to individuals in south Florida with 
intellectual and developmental disabilities.
