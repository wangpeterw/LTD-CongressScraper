                      RECOGNIZING ROBERTS, MONTANA

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, with Veterans Day approaching this 
weekend, I would like to recognize and express my gratitude for the 
patriotism, selfless service, and community spirit of a small community 
in southern Montana. The town of Roberts, in Carbon County, is honoring 
military veterans by lining Highway 212 with crosses and dogtags to 
represent servicemembers who have lived in Roberts. The crosses signify 
veterans who have passed away, while the dogtags symbolize living 
veterans.
  The breadth of service in this scenic town north of Yellowstone Park 
is evident in the 133 dogtags on display this year. The depth of 
service to our great county is rooted in the 308 crosses, some of which 
date back to service in the Civil War. A total of 441 individuals, with 
service spanning over a century and a half, is an impressive display of 
patriotism for any small community. The record of service among the 
people of Roberts is even more awe-inspiring when you consider that, 
during the last census, the town had just 361 residents.
  As we gather to celebrate Veterans Day, let us be encouraged by the 
example of the folks in Roberts and take time to remember the 
accumulated sacrifices and ongoing commitment that allow so many to 
live in freedom. To the people of Roberts, thank you for punching above 
your weight class for our Nation.
