                     DESIGNATING MANUFACTURING DAY

  (Mr. MARSHALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support designating the 
first Friday in October as Manufacturing Day.
  Across our country, manufacturing provides over 12 million jobs and 
contributes over $2 trillion to our economy. In Kansas, manufacturing 
accounts for nearly one-fifth of the State's economy and directly 
employs over 160,000 people.
  The industry has a long and successful history in Kansas, and this 
Friday, I plan to help a small manufacturing company, Superior Boiler 
Works in Hutchinson, Kansas, celebrate 100 years of being in business, 
as part of our Manufacturing Day tour.
  These small businesses have a substantial impact on local communities 
by providing good-paying jobs in places like Atwood, Sharon Springs, 
and Hutchinson, Kansas.
  I look forward to celebrating National Manufacturing Day in Kansas 
this Friday and ask my colleagues to support designating the first 
Friday in October as National Manufacturing Day.
