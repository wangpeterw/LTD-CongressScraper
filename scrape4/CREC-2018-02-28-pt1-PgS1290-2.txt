SENATE RESOLUTION 418--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF MARCH 
             21, 2018 AS ``NATIONAL ROSIE THE RIVETER DAY''

  Mr. CASEY (for himself, Mrs. Capito, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Coons, Mr. 
Isakson, and Mr. Manchin) submitted the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 418

       Whereas National Rosie the Riveter Day is a collective 
     national effort to raise awareness of the 16,000,000 women 
     who worked during World War II;
       Whereas the people of the United States have chosen to 
     honor women workers who contributed from the home front 
     during World War II;
       Whereas those women left their homes to work or volunteer 
     full-time in factories, farms, shipyards, airplane factories, 
     banks, and other institutions in support of the Armed Forces 
     overseas;
       Whereas those women worked with the United Service 
     Organizations and the American Red Cross, drove trucks, 
     riveted airplane parts, collected critical materials, rolled 
     bandages, and served on rationing boards;
       Whereas it is fitting and proper to recognize and preserve 
     the history and legacy of working women, including volunteer 
     women, during World War II to promote cooperation and 
     fellowship among those women and their descendants;
       Whereas those women and their descendants wish to further 
     the advancement of patriotic ideas, excellence in the 
     workplace, and loyalty to the United States; and
       Whereas March 21, 2018, during Women's History Month, is an 
     appropriate day to designate as ``National Rosie the Riveter 
     Day'': Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) supports the designation of March 21, 2018 as 
     ``National Rosie the Riveter Day''; and
       (2) acknowledges the important role played by women during 
     World War II.
