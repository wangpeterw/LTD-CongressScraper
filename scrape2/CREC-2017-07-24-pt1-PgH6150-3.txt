                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Lord, our God, thank You for giving us another day.
  As they are returning to the Capitol, please be with the Members of 
this people's House in all their undertakings today. You know them 
through and through. You know how they relate with one another and know 
them as the American people do, as the 115th Congress of the United 
States.
  Lord, help them to know You. As ultimate truth, send Your spirit upon 
them, that You might find a dwelling place among them, so that all Your 
people can place trust in them as leaders as well as their 
representatives.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
