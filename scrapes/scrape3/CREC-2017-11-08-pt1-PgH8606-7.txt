                  HONORING THE LIFE OF CARRIE BARNETTE

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Carrie 
Barnette, a woman who was known for her love of pickles, hummingbirds, 
and willingness to help others.
  Carrie loved country music, and she grew up listening to it at her 
grandparents' house. She frequently went to country music concerts and 
had traveled to the Route 91 Harvest music festival with her childhood 
friend, Jenn.

  Carrie was a lifelong Californian who had just celebrated her 10th 
anniversary as a culinary team member at Disney California Adventure in 
Anaheim.
  Carrie loved the children of her relatives and friends like her own, 
and friends say that she would have made a great mother. She also had 
the nickname of Aunt Carrie because all the children loved her.
  I would also like to extend my condolences to Carrie's family and 
friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, 
and the whole country grieve with you.
