                        TRIBUTE TO SARAH MILLER

 Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I would like to take the 
opportunity to express my appreciation to Sarah Miller for her hard 
work as an intern in my Washington, DC, office. I recognize her efforts 
and contributions to my office as well as to the State of Wyoming.
  Sarah is a native of Pennsylvania. She recently graduated from 
American University, where she received a degree in international 
studies. She has demonstrated a strong work ethic, which has made her 
an invaluable asset to our office. The quality of her work is reflected 
in her great efforts over the last several months.
  I want to thank Sarah for the dedication she has shown while working 
for me and my staff. It was a pleasure to have her as part of our team. 
I know she will have continued success with all of her future 
endeavors. I wish her all my best on her next journey.
