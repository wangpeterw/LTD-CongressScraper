                              VETERANS DAY

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of Veterans Day, which we 
will observe this Saturday, November 11.
  Each Veterans Day, we celebrate America's veterans for their 
unwavering patriotism and willingness to serve and sacrifice above 
self. How noble for liberty's cause, yet too many veterans, upon their 
return from service, endure long wait-times at VA health facilities.
  That is why I have developed a bill that would reduce the VA 
physician shortage, which is estimated to be about 5,000.
  Our VET MD Act would address this by allowing pre-med students to 
participate in organized clinical observations at VA medical centers. 
Future physicians will have exposure to the VA healthcare system, and 
the VA will create potential medical professionals.
  This is just one solution Congress should implement to address the VA 
physician shortage. It will help lead to decreased wait-times, better 
care, and healthier outcomes.
  Our veterans dedicated their lives for our country. We owe these 
honorable men and women better basic healthcare.
  Mr. Speaker, on this Veterans Day, I urge my colleagues to please 
join me. Let us affirm a commitment to action for the men and women who 
have defended our liberty and have lived the words duty, honor, and 
country.
