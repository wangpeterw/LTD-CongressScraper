                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK

  (Mr. MITCHELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Police 
Week, an opportunity to recognize the brave men and women in blue.
  This week is meaningful to me and my family, for my oldest son is a 
police officer in Michigan, and I could not be more proud of him and 
his service.
  Too often, we take for granted those who every day put on a badge and 
a vest to protect us and our communities. Events across this country 
have been politicized and stretch the relationship between law 
enforcement and their community. Let us not have politics overwhelm the 
dedication and commitment of our men and women in blue. Our lives, and 
indeed our freedoms, are safeguarded by the thin blue line. We owe the 
men and women in uniform, those who put themselves at risk every day, a 
simple thank you and simply our respect.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to give the police officers at our doors here, 
the officers throughout our communities, and my son, a simple thank 
you.
