                     THE SUPREME COURT CAN SAVE US

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, why run for Congress when a single 
Federal judge can write a new law without having to get any votes for 
it?
  Another Federal court recently decided that President Trump cannot 
set immigration policy, despite his having the clear authority to do 
so.
  It is hard to believe this is happening in the United States of 
America where judges are supposed to interpret the law, not engage in 
partisan politics.
  Our last hope now is with the Supreme Court. Surely they will remind 
other courts that their ruling should rest on the plain meaning of 
statutes, not on their personal views of the President.
  That some judges ignore precedent and the Constitution is a clear and 
present danger to our democracy. If the Supreme Court does not strongly 
affirm that President Trump has the same rights as other Presidents, we 
will be witnessing the slow unraveling of our democratic form of 
government.
  Based on their preliminary actions today, though, let us have 
confidence that the Supreme Court has the collective wisdom to guard 
and guide our great Nation.
