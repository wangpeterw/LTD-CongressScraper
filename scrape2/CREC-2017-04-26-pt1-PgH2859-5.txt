            PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS AND HEALTH CARE

  (Mr. NADLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, for 7 years, Republicans have talked about 
repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with something 
better.
  And then in the first 100 days of the Trump administration, 
Republicans offered a plan that would have raised premiums, raised 
deductibles, and taken away health care from 24 million Americans.
  The Trump-Republican proposal was a cowardly cynical effort to lower 
taxes on the richest Americans, strip away insurance protections from 
hardworking families, and to dismantle Medicare and Medicaid. Their 
plan would make Americans pay more to get much less.
  When this horrible deal failed, President Trump did what he does 
best: he lashed out. He lashed out at the American people, threatening 
to stop critical cost-sharing health insurance subsidies that ensure 
the sickest and some of the poorest Americans can afford health care.
  Health care, Mr. Speaker, is not a game. It is a matter of life and 
death for millions of Americans. On health care and every other issue, 
President Trump's first 100 days have been nothing more than a string 
of broken promises, empty words, and extravagant lies.
