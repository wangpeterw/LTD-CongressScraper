                       IN HONOR OF LILLIE BIGGINS

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my neighbor in east 
Fort Worth and my friend, Lillie Biggins, who will soon be retiring 
from the Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital after 45 years of 
service.
  Lillie joined the Texas Health Fort Worth family back in 1997, 
serving as vice president of operations. Her role was critical in 
overseeing major departments, such as emergency services, trauma 
services, and restorative services.
  During her tenure, she helped cultivate a vision of success for the 
Texas Health Fort Worth community. Not only did Lillie dedicate her 
time in the health community, but she also volunteers all around the 
city of Fort Worth. Lillie often mentors and helps others in the area 
of health, education, youth, senior citizen services, businesses, and 
so many areas in our city that are underserved.
  For her dedicated service to the community, she has been awarded so 
many awards, including her induction into the Texas Women's Hall of 
Fame in 2014.
  Mr. Speaker, I wish Lillie all the best as she moves on into her 
relaxing retirement, but I know that she probably won't be that relaxed 
and that she is going to be very active in the community. I wish her 
the best in the future.
