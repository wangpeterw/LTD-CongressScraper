                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Immortal, invisible God only wise, we praise Your Name. Lord, You are 
our strength and our hope for years to come.
  Today, may our lawmakers make Your joy their strength. Awaken in them 
a desire to be guided by You so that their lives and labors will 
honorably represent Your purposes. Lord, give them wisdom to trust You 
to finish the work You have started in our lives, our Nation, and 
world. May they exercise self-discipline in all things, resolving to 
stay on the path of integrity. Remove from their lives anything that 
would hinder them from fulfilling Your purposes.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
