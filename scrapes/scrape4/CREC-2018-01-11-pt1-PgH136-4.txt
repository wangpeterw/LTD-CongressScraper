                     THE BLANK CHECK OF SECTION 702

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, since 2001, the civil liberties of the 
American people have been trampled on under the blank check of section 
702, a program that exists to allow our government to surveil 
foreigners on foreign soil, but which also allows our government to 
collect, retain, and search communications of everyday Americans 
without a warrant and with blatant disregard for our Fourth Amendment 
constitutional rights.
  Now, we have a very important responsibility here in Congress to 
strike a balance between national security and keeping the American 
people safe while also protecting our constitutionally protected 
freedoms.
  I urge my colleagues to vote for our bipartisan USA Rights amendment 
today, which maintains necessary authorities to keep the American 
people safe while also, simultaneously, protecting our civil liberties.
  Now, unfortunately, opponents of this USA Rights amendment are 
pushing fear tactics and misinformation. Don't fall for it. Let us make 
this critical choice. Vote to keep our country safe. Vote to uphold our 
constitutional rights that so many have fought and died to protect.
