        LET'S START FOCUSING ON MAIN STREET AND AMERICAN WORKERS

  (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, President Trump 
campaigned throughout this country, including my home State of 
Pennsylvania, as a great populist, as a champion of the working class.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank President Trump and his administration 
for revealing their true intentions yesterday when they revealed their 
Wall Street written and designed tax plan--a giveaway for millionaires 
and billionaires. And not one thing--not one--for 99.9 percent of the 
working American people.
  Mr. Speaker, we do need tax reform, and you would see broad 
bipartisan support for that. But it has to be real. It has to be paid 
for. And it must include relief for those three-quarters of the 
American people who pay more in payroll taxes than they ever do in 
individual income taxes.
  Enough of focusing on Wall Street and the corporate income tax rate, 
and let's start focusing on Main Street and American workers.
