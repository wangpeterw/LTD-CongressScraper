                 ECONOMIC COST OF A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

House refuse to work out a bipartisan compromise to keep the Federal 
Government open. This not only disrupts the lives of millions of 
Americans, but it may have real harmful economic consequences.
  The Trump shutdown sends exactly the wrong message. It projects 
chaos. It can hurt business confidence, tapping the brakes of economic 
growth.
  In 2013, the last time the congressional leaders shut down the 
government, the economy took a real hit. The nonpartisan Bureau of 
Economic Analysis found that the shutdown lowered GDP growth by 0.3 
percentage points on an annualized basis. Economic analysts at Moody's, 
Standard & Poor's, and Goldman Sachs estimated it may have cost our 
economy $24 billion, about $1.5 billion per day.
  Our economy depends on faith in our government institutions. Let's 
not do anything to jeopardize it. Let's stop this dangerous game. Open 
the government. Fund the government.
