                     NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WEEK

  (Mr. COFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my sincere thanks 
to all of the men and women who serve and have served in law 
enforcement in the State of Colorado. These men and women put 
themselves in harm's way to protect the citizens of our great State.
  I would like to especially recognize the Aurora, Littleton, Greenwood 
Village, and Brighton Police Departments, as well as the Arapahoe, 
Douglas, and Adams County Sheriff's Departments for their tireless work 
in doing their best to keep our communities safe.
  I am proud to say that these municipal police and county sheriff's 
departments within the Sixth Congressional District of Colorado are 
exceptional and should be recognized for their extraordinary public 
service.
  These men and women of law enforcement are dedicated to public 
safety. In honor of National Law Enforcement Week, I would like to 
thank not only those who serve in law enforcement in the State of 
Colorado but all those who serve across our country.
