   HONORING THE LIFE OF KAREN DELANEY SHIDELEFF IN HER FIGHT WITH ALS

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of my 
constituent, Karen Delaney Shideleff of Ottsville, who passed away this 
January after a courageous fight with ALS.
  During her 6 years with ALS, Karen did everything to make a 
difference and serve as an advocate for individuals and families living 
with ALS. She participated in the Ride to Defeat ALS; the Phillies 
Phestival benefiting research efforts; served as a board member for the 
Greater Philadelphia ALS Association Chapter; and she lobbied her 
representatives both in Washington and in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, all 
the while undergoing numerous drug and other research trials.
  The strength, compassion, and zest for life exhibited by Karen is an 
inspiration for those dealing with the diagnosis of ALS and those 
individuals and community members committed to defeating this 
uncompromising disease. It is with Karen's legacy in our minds that the 
fight against ALS continues, and must continue.
  Our thoughts and our prayers as a nation and in this Chamber go out 
to Karen's husband, Bob, and her family and friends.
