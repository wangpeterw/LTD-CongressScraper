                      VOTE TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, some Americans have not heard the truth about 
why we have the Schumer shutdown. The simple truth is that it is 
because the Republicans believe in the rule of law, want to fund our 
troops and the CHIP program.
  Democrats are advocating for illegal aliens. President Obama violated 
the Constitution when he signed an executive order allowing illegal 
aliens to reside here as legal residents. The court ruled his action 
unconstitutional.
  To President Trump's credit, he agreed with the court and asked 
Congress to find a solution to that issue and our broken immigration 
system.
  House Republicans are working on a solution and doing our job in 
passing appropriations bills and continuing resolutions to fund troops 
and our government.
  Senate Democrats saw an opening for their zeal to make these illegal 
aliens legal and have chosen to shut down the government. It is time 
for the Democrats to give priority to national security and legal 
people in our country.
  Vote to fund the government, and come to the table to find a law-
respecting solution to immigration. Stop the Schumer shutdown.
