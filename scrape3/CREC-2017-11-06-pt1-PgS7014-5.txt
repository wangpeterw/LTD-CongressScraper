To the Congress of the United States:
  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
within 90 days before the anniversary date of its declaration, the 
President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the 
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect 
beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have 
sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice 
stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran that was 
declared in Executive Order 12170 of November 14, 1979, is to continue 
in effect beyond November 14, 2017.
  Our relations with Iran have not yet normalized, and the process of 
implementing the agreements with Iran, dated January 19, 1981, is 
ongoing. For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to 
continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170 with 
respect to Iran.
                                                     Donald J. Trump.  
The White House, November 6, 2017.
