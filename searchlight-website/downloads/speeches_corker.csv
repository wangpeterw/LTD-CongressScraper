TRANSMITTAL 16-66  Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section                 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                           Annex Item vii       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:       1. Components considered to contain sensitive technology in      the proposed sale are as follows:       a. M1A2 Thermal Imaging System (TIS)--The TIS constitutes a      target acquisition system which, when operated with other      tank systems gives the tank crew a substantial advantage over      the potential threat. The TIS provides the crew with the      ability to effectively aim and fire the tank main armament      system under a broad range of adverse battlefield conditions.      The hardware itself is The engineering design      and manufacturing data associated with the detector and      infrared (IR) optics and coatings are considered sensitive.      The technical data package is UNCLASSIFIED with the exception      of the specifications for target acquisition range which is      CONFIDENTIAL and hardening data is classified up to      The consequences of such compromise would increase potential      enemy capabilities to neutralize effectiveness of the tank      main armament system by denying the crew ability to acquire      targets.       b. Special Armor--Major components of special armor are      fabricated in sealed modules and in serialized removable      subassemblies. Special armor vulnerability data for both      chemical and kinetic energy rounds are classified      Engineering design and manufacturing data related to special      armor are also classified The consequences of such      compromise of classified information would be the capability      to neutralize or defeat the armor. The sale or transfer of      armor modules are done on a government-to-government basis.      This serves to minimize, but not eliminate, the danger of      compromise.       c. 120mm Gun--the gun is composed of a 120mm smoothbore gun      (cannon) manufactured at Watervliet Arsenal; ``long rod''      APFSDS warheads; and combustible cartridge case ammunition.      There may be a need to procure/produce new gun cannon tubes      from Watervliet New cannons inducted at Anniston      Army Depot would be inspected according to established      criteria and shipped to Lima Army Tank Plant for tank upgrade      process. Gun production and technology are generally known.      Disclosure of gun production and technology specific to the      120mm (advance materials and tolerances) would degrade the      advantage.       d. AGT-1500 Gas Turbine Propulsion System--The use of a gas      turbine propulsion system in the M1A2 is a unique application      of armored vehicle power pack technology. The hardware is      composed of the AGT-1500 engine and transmission and is not      Manufacturing processes associated with the      production of turbine blades, recuperator, bearings and      shafts, and hydrostatic pump and motor are propriety and      therefore commercially competition sensitive. Unauthorized      release and exploitation of sensitive propulsion information      would adversely impact U.commercial interests. Acquisition      of production data by a potential enemy could enhance its      ability to design and produce gas turbine engine propulsion      system with application to land vehicles.       e. Compartmentation--A major survivability feature of the      MI tank is the compartmentation of fuel and ammunition.      Compartmentation is the positive separation of the crew and      critical components from combustible materials such that in      the event that the fuel or ammunition is ignited or      deteriorated by an incoming threat round, the crew is fully      protected. Sensitive information includes the performance of      the ammunition compartments as well as the compartment design      parameters. The design of the compartments cannot be      protected, however the guidelines, parametric inductions and      test data used to develop the compartments do not have to be      disclosed to permit a sale.       f. Common Remotely Operated Weapons Station--Low Profile      (CROWS-LP)--The CROWS-LP (M153A2E1) is a commanders' weapon      station. It allows for under armor operation of weapons--     M2HB, M2A1, M250B, and The CROWS-LP is an updated      version of the M153A2 CROWS that is approximately 10 inches      shorter; the CROWS-LP M153A2E1 increases visibility over the      weapon station. The fire control system of the CROWS-LP      allows the ``first-burst'' on target capability from      stationary and moving platforms. The CROWS-LP ingratiates a      day camera (VIM-C), thermal camera (TIM 1500), and laser      range finder (STORM/STORM-PI). Engineering design and      manufacturing data would provide potential enemy with the      means to increase small arms fire control from under armor.      The consequences of this would be improved enemy equipment in      the field and decrease technological fire control advantages.       2. The Ml tank will include the following communications      suite: Defense Advanced Global Positioning System (GPS)      Receiver (DAGR); AN/VAS-5 Driver's Vision Enhancer (DVE) and      Rear View Sensor System (RVSS); and Single Channel Ground and      Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS).       a. Defense Advanced Global Positioning System (GPS)      Receiver (DAGR)--DAGR is a lightweight (less than two pounds)      hand-held or host platform-mounted, dual frequency, Selective      Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) based, Precise      Positioning Service (PPS) device. The DAGR provides real-time      positioning, velocity (ground speed), navigation, and timing      (PVNT) information, in standalone (dismounted) and mounted      (ground facilities, sea, air, and land vehicles)      configurations. The DAGR can support missions involving land-     based war-fighting and non-war fighting operations. The DAGR      can also be used as a secondary or supplemental aid to      aviation-based missions which involve operations in low-     dynamic aircraft, and as an aid to navigation in water-borne      operations. DAGR AN/PSN-13(A) is fitted with the Selective      Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) 3.7 and can accept      cryptographic keys for increased PVNT accuracy and protection      from intentional false or spoofed satellite signals. The AN/     PSN-13(A) DAGR does not output classified information. If a      technology advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the      specific hardware and software elements, the information      could be used to identify ways of countering the detection      capabilities of the DAGR or improve the performance of their      GPS receivers; however, information available for the SAASM      would not be obtainable. SAASM is a tamper-resistant security      module. The remaining hardware used in the DAGR is considered      mature and available in other industrial nation's comparable      performance thresholds.       b. Drivers Vision Enhancer (DVE) AN/VAS-5 and Rear View      Sensor System (RVSS)--The AN/VAS-5 and RVSS are un-cooled      thermal imaging systems developed for use while driving      Combat Vehicles and Tactical Wheeled DVE and RVSS      allow for tactical vehicle movement in support of operational      missions in all environment conditions (day/night and all      weather) and provides enhanced driving capability during      limited visibility conditions (darkness, smoke, dust, fog,      etc.). The DVE program provides night vision targeting      capabilities for armored vehicles and long-range night vision      reconnaissance capability to the warfighter. Engineering      design and manufacturing data would provide a potential enemy      with the means to upgrade the quality of efficiency of      thermal devices production. The consequences of this would be      improved enemy equipment of the field. Technical information      regarding DVE and RVSS, including UNCLASSIFIED information,      should generally not be considered for release.       The highest level of information that must be disclosed for      production, operation or sale of the end item is      UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE       c. Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System      (SINCGARS)--The AN/VRC-92E and RT-1702 SINCGARS provides war-     fighting commanders and troops with a highly reliable,      secure, easily maintained Combat Net Radio (CNR) that has      both voice and data handling capability in support of command      and control operations. SINCGARS, with the Internet      Controller, provides the communications link for the      digitized force. SINCGARS is a radio fielded to tactical      field elements. It facilitates the transmission of voice and/     or data information, which allows for the conducting of a      myriad of missions across the operational continuum. SINCGARS      is available for the dismounted soldier, ground and aviation      platforms. Training will vary for the radio (RT-1702) and      spare and repair parts for the RT-1702 model are not      supported by the Standard Army Supply There is      sensitive or restricted information contained in the AN/[[Page S18]]     VRC-92E or software. There would be adverse consequences of      the AN/VRC-92E and software were to be lost to a technically      advanced adversary. If a technology advances adversary were      to obtain knowledge of the specific hardware and software      elements, the information could be used to identify ways of      countering the Electronic Counter-Counter Measures (ECCM).      The hardware used in the AN/VRC-92E and RT-1702 is considered      mature.       3. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.     foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in      the Policy Moreover, the benefits to be      derived from this sale, as outlined in the Policy      Justification, outweigh the potential damage that could      result if the sensitive technology were revealed to      unauthorized persons.       4. All defense articles and services listed in this      transmittal have been authorized for release and export to      the Government of                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-03-pt1-PgS14.txt,HELPING ANGELS LEAD OUR STARTUPS ACT,2017,3,January
