SENATE RESOLUTION 339--DESIGNATING NOVEMBER 2017 AS ``NATIONAL RUNAWAY 
                           PREVENTION MONTH''

  Ms. DUCKWORTH (for herself, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Collins, Mr. 
Leahy, and Mr. Reed) submitted the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 339

       Whereas the prevalence of runaway youth and homelessness 
     among youth is staggering, with studies suggesting that every 
     year, between 1,600,000 and 2,800,000 youth live on the 
     streets of the United States;
       Whereas runaway youth most often are youth who have been 
     expelled from their homes by their families, have experienced 
     abuse and trauma, are involved in the foster care system, are 
     too poor to secure their own basic needs, and may be 
     ineligible or unable to access medical or mental health 
     resources;
       Whereas youth who run away are at an increased risk for 
     exploitation and exposure to criminal networks, such as 
     domestic sex trafficking;
       Whereas youth who run away are more likely to be recruited 
     or coerced into participating in criminal acts, such as gangs 
     and illegal substance abuse, that lead to a higher likelihood 
     of involvement in the criminal justice system;
       Whereas preventing youth from running away from home or 
     from foster care and supporting youth in high-risk situations 
     is a family, community, and national responsibility;
       Whereas the future well-being of the Nation is dependent on 
     the value placed on youth and the opportunities provided for 
     youth to acquire the knowledge, skills, and abilities 
     necessary to help youth successfully develop into safe, 
     healthy, and productive adults;
       Whereas effective programs supporting runaway youth and 
     assisting youth and their families in providing safe and 
     stable homes succeed because of partnerships created among 
     families, youth-based advocacy organizations, community-based 
     human service agencies, law enforcement, schools, faith-based 
     organizations, and businesses; and
       Whereas the National Network for Youth and National Runaway 
     Safeline are cosponsoring National Runaway Prevention Month 
     in November to increase public awareness of the issues facing 
     runaway and homeless youth and to educate the public about 
     solutions and the role the public can play in ending youth 
     homelessness: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates November 2017 as ``National Runaway 
     Prevention Month''; and
       (2) recognizes and supports the goals and ideals of 
     National Runaway Prevention Month.
