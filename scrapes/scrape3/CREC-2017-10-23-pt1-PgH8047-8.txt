                     HOUSTON ASTROS MAKE IT HAPPEN

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is the seventh game of the American 
League Championship Series. After being down three games to two, the 
Astros, who dedicated their season to the people of Houston, had tied 
the ALCS three to three against the powerful New York Yankees.
  The winner goes to the World Series against the mighty Dodgers.
  It is the top of the ninth inning in Houston. The Astros are up 4 to 
0. The Astros take the field. Pitcher Lance McCullers is on the mound 
throwing curveballs. He strikes out Yankees shortstop Didi Gregorius. 
One out. McCullers attacks the plate with a dirt-diving curveball. 
Sanchez strikes out. Two down.
  The fans are standing. They are screaming. Bases are empty. One out 
remains. McCullers throws another curveball to batter Greg Bird, and 
the Yankees, Mr. Speaker, have trouble with the curve. It is a fly 
ball, center field.
  Springer catches the ball. Third out. The fans go wild. Astros win, 
Astros win, Astros win. The city of Houston starts singing and dancing 
in the streets. American League Champs.
  And that is just the way it is.
