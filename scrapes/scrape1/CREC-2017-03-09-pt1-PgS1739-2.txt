                  REMEMBERING WILLIAM ``BILL'' HOLEMAN

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of 
William Holeman. Preacher Bill, as he was known, came to eastern 
Kentucky in 1953 and almost immediately made a lasting impact.
  For over 60 years, Bill travelled throughout eastern Kentucky, 
teaching around 40,000 schoolchildren each year about bullying, drug 
abuse, and his Christian faith with the Youth Haven Bible Camp. 
Although his family described him as a humble man, Bill had a real 
passion for his vocation.
  To help teach the kids, Bill employed ventriloquist dummies named 
Henry and Homer. He developed their personalities and spread his 
message with laughter and fun.
  Bill dearly loved eastern Kentucky and its people. He devoted his 
life to them, and many children were forever changed by his work.
  Preacher Bill will surely be missed, and Elaine and I send our 
condolences to his wife, Joyce, and their children Susan, Gail, Gary, 
and Eddie.
