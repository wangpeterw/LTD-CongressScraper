                              GUN VIOLENCE

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, although many in my constituency are 
still recovering from Hurricane Harvey--and I wear a ``Houston Strong'' 
pin--we are working on getting housing rebuilt and seniors back in 
their homes, I can tell you that, throughout my district, as I was 
there this past week, they spoke in quiet tones about Douglas, the high 
school, and the tragedy in Florida.
  And none of them seemed to agree--and, in particular, young men, who 
I will talk about in the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order on 
guns. None of them seemed to agree to arming teachers. All of them had 
ideas about gun violence and handguns, as well as weapons of war. And I 
believe the young people should be listened to, and we should not leave 
until we do constructive, sensible gun safety legislation, and it 
should be done now.
  I ask the American people to rise up and speak in tones of 
nonpartisanship, bipartisanship, to save and secure our children and 
our teachers.
