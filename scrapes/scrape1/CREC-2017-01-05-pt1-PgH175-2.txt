                   STEMMING AVALANCHE OF REGULATIONS

  (Mr. MITCHELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I am proud that, in my first week as a 
Representative of Michigan's 10th Congressional District, we have 
passed two important pieces of legislation to stem the avalanche of 
Federal regulations.
  The top concern I hear from employers of all sizes across my district 
is that regulation from Washington is making it harder for them to do 
business. I spent my career in business, so I have firsthand knowledge 
of the damage caused by excessive Federal regulations.
  The Midnight Rules Act and the REINS Act will provide much-needed 
regulatory relief to families and businesses alike. Both pieces of 
legislation will make unelected bureaucrats accountable to Congress.
  The American Dream is achievable, and, as the son of a General Motors 
line worker, my life is proof of it. But that dream is only possible 
when we give Americans the freedom they need to be successful and 
unleash their capabilities in our economy.
