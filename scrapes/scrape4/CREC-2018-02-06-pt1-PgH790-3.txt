 RECOGNIZING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM OF BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, February is African American History 
Month, and I rise today to recognize the African American Museum of 
Bucks County, Pennsylvania, in my district, for the work that they do 
in our community.
  With the mission of promoting an understanding and appreciation for 
the African-American experience by focusing on history, education, 
inspiration, and building up the community, they are already having a 
huge impact.
  I had the opportunity to meet with many of the women and men who are 
responsible for the museum when they came down to Washington, D.C., in 
December, and I would like to recognize them now:
  President Linda Salley; Vice President Bill Reed; Secretary Nancy 
Bell; Correspondence Secretary Robyn Johnson; Treasurer Nicole Brown; 
Assistant Treasurer Alonzo Salley; and the founders: Harvey Spencer, 
Sr.; Millard Mitchel; Natalie Kaye; Merian Frieberg; Carole Johnson; 
Mechelle Connors; and Deal Wright.
  Mr. Speaker, the mission of the African American Museum of Bucks 
County is an extremely important one. I commend all those involved, and 
I wish them continued success and continued growth.
  I encourage everyone in our community to get involved and to support 
this outstanding organization.
