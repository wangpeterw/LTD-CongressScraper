        HONORING LIEUTENANT DEBRA CLAYTON AND DEPUTY NORM LEWIS

  (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)

[[Page H65]]

  

  Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the lives of 
Lieutenant Debra Clayton of the Orlando Police Department and Deputy 
Norm Lewis of the Orange County Sheriff's Office.
  Lieutenant Clayton was an outstanding officer, a loving wife, mother, 
and friend. One year ago today, she was shot and killed while 
attempting to apprehend a murder suspect.
  Deputy Lewis was killed the same day while searching for Lieutenant 
Clayton's killer. Deputy Lewis was deeply admired by all of his 
colleagues: a man described as a ``gentle giant,'' who played for the 
UCF Knights and went on to be a true public servant.
  Mr. Speaker, it has been said that when a law enforcement officer 
falls, a part of America dies.
  Today we recognize these two public servants and pay tribute to them 
for paying the ultimate sacrifice. Today we also take a moment on Law 
Enforcement Appreciation Day to thank law enforcement officers 
throughout our Nation who serve and protect us and our families.
