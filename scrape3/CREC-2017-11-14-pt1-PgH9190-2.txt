                          REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN

  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise for the people of North 
Carolina's 12th Congressional District, to stand up for the 
opportunities our community needs, and to reject the ``billionaires 
first'' Republican tax plan.
  This tax plan fails to hear the American people. It gives tax cuts to 
corporations on the backs of the middle class.
  Last week, I sent a letter to the Ways and Means chair and to Speaker 
Ryan outlining the 12th District's tax priorities and urging the 
inclusion of education-related deductions.
  Republicans refused to hear the call, so this week I announced my 
education tax package. This series of amendments includes reinstating 
the tax-exempt status of private-use bonds used to build infrastructure 
and affordable housing; reinstating the State and local tax deduction, 
protecting the funds used to pay for schools, community development, 
and public safety; reinstating the student loan interest tax deduction; 
repealing the tax on tuition waivers and student stipends; and 
incentivizing investments in STEM education.
  Communities across the Nation need the increased access to upward 
mobility, and education, the great equalizer, is the place to start.
  I urge my colleagues to support my amendments to make education 
accessible for all students.
