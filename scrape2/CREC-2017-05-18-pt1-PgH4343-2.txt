                         REMEMBERING AL KARNIG

  (Mr. AGUILAR asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Al Karnig, a 
dedicated and passionate member of the San Bernardino community who 
served as president for California State University, San Bernardino, 
for 15 years.
  Dr. Karnig was a fierce advocate for our students, overseeing record 
numbers of enrollment, diversity, and faculty, as well as raising tens 
of millions of dollars for the university.
  When Al wasn't working on improving access to higher education in our 
community, he was investing his personal time to make the inland empire 
a better place to live and raise a family. He served on the board for 
KVCR Educational Foundation, Inland Empire Economic Partnership, and 
the Community Hospital of San Bernardino.
  Just last month, Al was in my office touting his latest philanthropic 
venture to help children, the Infant-Toddler Success program, working 
with parents and caregivers of children from birth to 36 months to help 
them to be ready for school and life.
  I thank Dr. Karnig for his tireless efforts to make our region home 
to a world-class institution through Cal State, San Bernardino, as well 
as his advocacy on behalf of San Bernardino County families. As we 
mourn his loss, we give thanks for his contributions to our community, 
which will live on in his family, colleagues, graduates, students, 
children, and parents he helped through so many years of service.
