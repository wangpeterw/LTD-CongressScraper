                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Dr. Christopher Girata, Saint Michael and All Angels 
Episcopal Church, Dallas, Texas, offered the following prayer:
  Gracious God, we thank You for the gift of this life and ask Your 
blessing upon the world You have made. Have compassion on those who 
suffer from any grief or trouble.
  Give to the people of our country a zeal for justice and the strength 
of forbearance that we may use our liberty in accordance with Your 
gracious will. Guide all who govern and hold authority in this Nation, 
and kindle in every heart that true love of peace.
  Make our lives a sign of Your love to this broken world, that unity 
may overcome estrangement, forgiveness, heal guilt, and joy conquer 
despair. Grant that the bonds of our common humanity, by which all Your 
children are united one to another, may be so transformed by Your grace 
that Your will may be done on Earth as it is in heaven.
  All this, we ask in the name of God, our creator, redeemer, and 
sustainer.
  Amen.
