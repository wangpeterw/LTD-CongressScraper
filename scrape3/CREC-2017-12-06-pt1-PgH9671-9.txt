                        THE REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN

  (Mr. SIRES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in continued opposition to the 
Republican tax plan.
  Earlier this week, the House of Representatives agreed to go to 
conference with the Senate on H.R. 1, which gives breaks to the wealthy 
and corporations at the expense of the needs of the American family. 
This bill eliminates deductions used by those who need it most: 
students, teachers, veterans, the

sick, and families that are struggling to make ends meet.
  Yet, despite this elimination of numerous vital deductions that 
millions of families across this country rely on, the House and the 
Senate bill retained a deduction for golf course owners. If you own a 
golf course in America, your deductions are kept; but if you are a 
student and you get a scholarship, you are going to have to pay taxes 
on that.
  So if I were a student, I get it twice. We are looking at cutting the 
Pell grants and we are looking at taxing what students get, yet if you 
own a golf course where this game is played, you get a deduction.
  I am sorry, but I don't think that is fair.
