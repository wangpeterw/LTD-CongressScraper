Derek. Derek had planned to propose to Andrea that night.
  She had a passion for makeup and hoped to use this passion to help 
cancer patients feel beautiful. Andrea will always be remembered for 
her free spirit and positive outlook.
  I would like to extend my condolences to Andrea's family and friends. 
Please note that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the 
whole country grieve with you.
