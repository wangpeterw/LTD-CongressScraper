              WELCOMING REVEREND DR. CHRISTOPHER D. GIRATA

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. Hensarling) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, it is my true honor to introduce and 
recognize our guest chaplain today, Father Chris Girata. I am honored 
because he is my rector, the rector of Saint Michael and All Angels 
Episcopal Church in Dallas, Texas, where my family and I have 
worshipped for over 20 years.
  Although he has been our rector for only a little over a year, Father 
Girata has brought a renewed spirituality and passion to our parish. 
His enthusiasm for God's Word and will is infectious to us all. His 
sense of humor always brightens our day, and he leads by example.
  As one parishioner put it, Mr. Speaker: ``He is a true voice for the 
powerless and poor and is constantly challenging us to even better walk 
as Christ did.'' And whether it is through our service at the Jubilee 
Park and Community Center in South Dallas, the millions in charity 
provided through the St. Michael's Woman's Exchange, or any of the 
other ministries or outreach projects of our parish, under Father Chris 
Girata, Saint Michael is more humbly and effectively serving God's 
children.
  And as we do, Father Girata leads us not to just serve our neighbors' 
physical needs, but to serve their spiritual needs as well. I am 
grateful that his prayer and his example could be shared with the House 
today.
