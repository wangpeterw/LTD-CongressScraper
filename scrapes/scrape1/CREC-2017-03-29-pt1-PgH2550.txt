        CONGRATULATING AND HONORING ANGELINA M. PENNISI STEINER

  (Mr. GAETZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I come from the State of Florida, where we 
have many of our citizens who live in nursing homes. Despite the views 
of some, those residents can live remarkable, productive, and 
fulfilling lives.
  One such resident is Angelina Steiner. Mrs. Steiner lives in the 
Plant City Senior Center. She shares her talents in weekly poetry 
readings. She became a member of the Florida Writers Association. In 
2014, she published her first book: ``Chasing Dreams.'' Now, her second 
book: ``Beautiful Words Coming My Way'' is being published and archived 
in the Library of Congress.
  A loving wife and a mother of four children, Mrs. Steiner is inspired 
by everyday events. She has the talent to paint beautiful pictures 
through her poetry, and I am incredibly proud of her.
