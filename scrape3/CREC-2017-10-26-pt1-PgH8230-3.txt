     being sustained, such material contained in such conference 
     report shall be stricken, and the Senate shall proceed to 
     consider the question of whether the Senate shall recede from 
     its amendment and concur with a further amendment, or concur 
     in the House amendment with a further amendment, as the case 
     may be, which further amendment shall consist of only that 
     portion of the conference report or House amendment, as the 
     case may be, not so stricken. Any such motion in the Senate 
     shall be debatable. In any case in which such point of order

     subsection), no further amendment shall be in order.
       (f) Criteria.--

     Res. 13 (111th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the 
     budget for fiscal year 2010, shall no longer apply.

                            Motion to Concur

  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the motion.
  The text of the motion is as follows:

       Mrs. Black moves that the House concur in the Senate 
     amendment to House Concurrent Resolution 71.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the motion 
shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget.
  The gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black) and the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.

[[Page H8243]]

  

  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Senate amendment to H. 
Con. Res. 71, the budget resolution for fiscal year 2018.
  Passing a budget is never easy, and it has, once again, been a 
challenge this year. But I am encouraged with where we are now, and I 
am pleased that the Senate did its work by approving a budget, one that 
we can support in order to unlock tax reform for the American people.
  Without question, there are plenty of things that I wish were 
included in what the Senate passed, ideas that the House put forward 
earlier this month when we approved our budget. For example, I still 
feel strongly about addressing unsustainable mandatory spending, and 
that hasn't changed. The growing burden of debt caused by mandatory 
spending is a real problem that cannot be ignored.
  We owe it to the American people to do something, to offer serious 
reforms that ensure government programs are financially sustainable and 
working well for generations to come, and I think we will tackle this 
important issue in the future. Really, we don't have a choice.
  But despite any shortcomings of the Senate-passed budget, I am 
encouraged that it does reflect the shared priorities of both Chambers. 
Moving forward with this budget is also supported by our President.
  I want to remind my colleagues that before final passage last week, 
the Senate did include numerous provisions previously passed by the 
House, and I was proud to be involved in those negotiations with the 
leaders of the House, the Senate, and the White House.
  For example, the Senate-passed budget creates a mechanism that would 
permit the Budget Committee chairman to adjust the budget allocations 
if there is future legislation signed into law that revises the BCA 
spending caps.
  The Senate-passed budget also includes numerous improvements to the 
House budget's enforcement that are designed to strengthen fiscal 
discipline. Because we worked together to find a common ground, we can 
move ahead toward tax reform and expand upon the ideas in the 
conservative framework unveiled last month.
  Throughout my nearly 7 years as a Member of the House, Republicans 
have talked about modernizing our outdated and overly complicated tax 
system, and today, we have the opportunity to take that next big step 
to unlock tax reform for the American people, fulfilling the promise 
that we made long ago to our constituents.
  By advancing tax reform, we can help Americans keep more of their 
hard-earned paychecks; we can make it possible for most Americans to 
file their taxes on a simple postcard; we can level the playing field 
for business and help them compete better globally; and we can empower 
entrepreneurs and small businesses, encouraging them to create more 
jobs.
  This budget acknowledges that our economy is in desperate need of a 
jolt, and the tax cuts included in the Senate-passed budget hold that 
promise of doing just that. Put simply, we have the opportunity to make 
history by reforming our tax system for the first time in nearly three 
decades.
  President Trump is with us on this, and I agree that we must move 
quickly, and that is why I urge my colleagues to pass this budget 
today.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  0915

  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, the bill we are debating today is not a real effort at 
responsible budgeting. It is a means to an end: a single-minded plan to 
make it easier to enact tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations, 
regardless of the consequences for everyone else.
  If approved by the House today, an irresponsible $1.5 trillion tax 
bill will come to the floor in a matter of weeks. It is being rushed 
because Republicans don't want the American people to know what is in 
it. They don't want you to find out that it overwhelmingly benefits the 
wealthy while increasing taxes on millions of middle class families.
  Rushing through legislation that impacts nearly every American family 
and business is reckless, and voting on a bill that rewrites our 
Nation's Tax Code a week or two after it is introduced without any real 
input from the people who will be impacted is negligent. But that is 
what you do when you can't defend your own policy.
  And there are a lot of unjustifiable provisions in this budget. On 
top of massive tax cuts for the rich, it cuts vital national 
investments, threatening our economic progress and our national 
security. It cuts more than $4 trillion in mandatory spending, 
including nearly $2 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid alone.
  The enormity of these cuts and the severity of the consequences for 
American families cannot be overstated. But more cuts will be coming 
once the Republican tax cuts blow an enormous hole in the budget. We 
will see a tax on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, nutrition 
assistance--on important benefits that help American families get 
ahead.
  I know my Republican colleagues desperately want to believe that the 
tax cuts in their budget will pay for themselves and usher in a new era 
of economic growth--or at least they want the American people to 
believe that. But the record is clear, this approach has failed time 
and time again.
  And now, even though the evidence and experts have concluded that 
these tax cuts will not create an economic boom but will, instead, lead 
to a higher concentration of wealth among the rich while dramatically 
increasing deficits and debt, my Republican colleagues are trying to do 
it again.
  Everything we do in Congress should be about making the lives of 
American families better and more secure. We owe them a budget that 
invests in their future, a Tax Code that is fair, and a full and honest 
debate on both. This budget and the tax cuts that will follow are a 
failure on all fronts.
  I, therefore, urge my Republican colleagues to abandon this dangerous 
budget and start addressing the needs and priorities of the American 
people.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.


                             General Leave

  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on the Senate amendment to H. Con. Res. 71.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from Tennessee?
  There was no objection.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith).
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the 
chairwoman of the Budget Committee for yielding me time.
  Mr. Speaker, we need to pass this budget not only to rein in out-of-
control spending, but also to give Congress the go-ahead on much-needed 
tax reform.
  We need to reduce the tax burden on hardworking Americans. The 
typical household in the 21st Congressional District of Texas pays over 
$15,700 in Federal taxes. Past experience shows that tax relief 
generates strong economic growth. It enables Americans to save, invest, 
create jobs, and spend more of their income.
  Our vision of tax reform benefits families across America. For 
example, in my congressional district, one-sixth of households utilize 
the child tax credit. Increasing the child tax credit will help 
families keep more of their hard-earned money to use on child care or 
parental leave, school supplies, college savings, and other expenses 
associated with raising a child.
  Let's help American families enjoy a more prosperous future rather 
than pay more of their hard-earned dollars to the Federal Government.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene), a distinguished Member of 
the House Budget Committee and Ways and Means Committee.
  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this budget 
proposal.
  With many working families and businesses still struggling to adapt 
to a rapidly changing economy, our top priority in Congress should be 
helping expand opportunities, opportunities to sustain long-term 
economic growth

[[Page H8244]]

and security so no American is left behind.
  Unfortunately, the bill we are voting on today is not a serious 
budget designed to help middle class families. Instead, this budget is 
simply a vehicle to rush through a partisan tax proposal using a 
process known as reconciliation.
  And what is worse, the Ryan-McConnell tax plan would add trillions of 
dollars to the deficit, making our children foot the bill for tax cuts 
that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest. In fact, the Tax Policy 
Center has estimated that the Ryan-McConnell tax plan could raise taxes 
by an average of $1,209 a year on families earning between $50,000 and 
$150,000 a year. This is moving in the wrong direction.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman).
  Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the fiscal 
year 2018 budget resolution, which is a critical first step to 
achieving comprehensive tax reform and making the American economy 
great again. I also applaud Chairwoman Diane Black for her leadership 
in producing this budget.

  Our Nation has not significantly reformed our Tax Code in more than 
three decades, which has allowed the Tax Code to explode in complexity 
and unnecessary burden on hardworking American families and businesses. 
Moreover, while the United States is a world leader in innovation and 
entrepreneurship, we have failed to reduce our corporate tax rate, 
which stands at 35 percent, the highest in the developed world. And I 
would add, corporations don't pay tax; the American people pay tax.
  The unified framework unveiled earlier this year will simplify the 
Tax Code for everyone, eliminate wasteful tax loopholes, and reduce 
taxes on businesses. I am also pleased to see that the plan eliminates 
the death tax on farmers and moves to full expensing. Under this plan, 
the average family will see an increase in income between $4,000 and 
$9,000, annually.
  While I believe this budget is necessary to spur economic growth and 
increase wages, I am extremely disappointed that the Senate removed the 
$203 billion of mandatory spending cuts, given the challenge the 
national debt poses to our great United States. However, we should not 
make the perfect the enemy of the good, and I understand that issues as 
complex as the budget and tax reform require compromise.
  I appreciate the leadership of Speaker Ryan, Chairman Brady, and the 
rest of the leadership team for their hard work on tax reform, and I 
look forward to working with my colleagues to moving tax reform over 
the finish line and to President Trump's desk.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), a distinguished member of 
the Budget Committee.
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Yarmuth for yielding me time.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this fiscal year 2018 
budget resolution for a number of reasons, not the least of which is 
that the underlying assumptions are grossly misleading. It assumes 
fictions like hundreds of billions of dollars from the repeal of the 
Affordable Care Act, and it assumes an economic growth rate of 3 
percent, which most economists on both sides do not believe is 
possible.
  This budget is merely a vehicle for Republicans to fast-track tax 
cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and large corporations. Any 
assertion of cuts for working families is debunked by experts like 
Leonard Burman, cofounder of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, who has 
called this ``utterly implausible.''
  Mr. Speaker, the facts are these: 80 percent of the Republican tax 
cuts go to the top 1 percent by 2027; the average tax cut for the top 1 
percent in 2027 will be $207,000; and 42 million middle class 
households will face a tax increase, including those earning between 
$50,000 and $150,000, who will see a tax increase of one-third. That is 
what this budget lays the path for.
  If we want to see where this will lead, let's just look at Kansas, a 
place where the Republican legislature has rolled back the tax cuts 
that they passed from several years ago because they simply didn't work 
and put Kansas' economy into a downward spiral.
  We know who wins under this budget resolution. It simply paves the 
way for a huge tax cut for the wealthiest millionaires, billionaires, 
and corporations. That is wrong, and I urge a ``no'' vote on this 
budget.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock), a member of the Budget 
Committee.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, unsustainable government spending drives both taxes and 
debt.
  The budget resolution sets the spending architecture for the fiscal 
year. The House version provided for $200 billion of enforceable 
mandatory spending reductions over 10 years and balanced within the 
decade. The Senate amendments gut these provisions, squandering the one 
opportunity Congress has each year to bring mandatory spending under 
control, taking us another year closer to a sovereign debt crisis. This 
is tragic, and I condemn it in the strongest terms.
  The Senate, though, has retained just one key provision from the 
House budget. It makes tax reform possible this year. Tax reform is 
essential to economic growth, and economic growth is essential to 
confront our debt.
  Many are alarmed that it provides for $1.5 trillion of additional 
debt, but this is due solely to the Senate's rules that require tax 
cuts to be scored only as revenue losses without taking into account 
economic expansion.
  During the Obama years, our economy grew at an average of 1\1/2\ 
percent, annually. That is about half the average rate since World War 
II. Reagan averaged 3\1/2\ percent. Reagan did this by reducing the tax 
burdens that were crushing our economy. He slashed the top income tax 
rate from 70 percent down to 28 percent, and income tax receipts nearly 
doubled because of the economic expansion he unleashed.
  Taxes driven by spending are the greatest threat to our economy 
today, and debt driven by spending is the greatest threat to our 
future. Controlling spending is currently impossible in the Senate. So 
it is obvious that we can't balance the budget and reduce our debt 
without significantly increasing economic growth; we can't increase 
economic growth without tax relief; and we can't get tax relief without 
the provisions in the Senate budget.
  Arthur Laffer, the architect of the Reagan tax policy, forecasts that 
the corporate tax reform alone will increase GDP growth at a rate that 
should generate a temporary bump of 5 percent, settling down to an 
average of 2.6 percent over the decade. This will add $5 trillion to 
the American economy and directly increase revenues to all levels of 
government between $1.8 trillion and $2 trillion.
  We have tried a static approach to tax policy during the Obama years. 
The economy stagnated and the debt doubled.
  I remember what it was like in the Reagan era. Wages were rising and 
opportunities for better jobs were everywhere. There was a sense of 
optimism that comes with prosperity and abundance. When we abandoned 
these policies, we lost that prosperity to a decade of despair.
  I want my kids to know what that sense of relief and optimism was 
like, what it feels like when morning dawns again on the American 
economy. This resolution starts that transformation, and I urge its 
adoption.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I remind the prior speaker, my friend from 
California, that Arthur Laffer was also the architect of the Kansas 
plan, which was disastrous for that State. So citing him as a source, I 
would be a little bit careful.
  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. Lee), a distinguished member of the Budget 
Committee and the Appropriations Committee.
  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his 
tremendous leadership.
  And also, just very briefly, I want to mention to my colleague from 
California on the other side, I remember the Reagan-era tax cut period 
also, and there was a huge rise in homeless veterans as a result, 
unfortunately.

[[Page H8245]]

  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the so-called budget 
plan.
  I know that our budget shapes our national priorities and values, but 
the Republicans have put forward a budget that I think is downright 
sinister. This budget is morally bankrupt. It is a Trojan horse that 
steals healthcare from children and rips food from the hungry just to 
fast-track $1.5 trillion in tax breaks to billionaires and 
corporations.
  Budgets are moral documents. They should not be rigged in favor of 
special interests and the wealthy few, but the cruel and crooked 
Republican budget does just that. Our Nation's budget should prioritize 
working families and the middle class, too many of whom are making low 
wages and living below the poverty line.

                              {time}  0930

  It should assist those struggling to find a job. It should invest in 
workforce training, education, job creation and job training. Instead, 
this Republican budget creates tax cuts for billionaires, millionaires, 
and corporations.
  Our budget should expand to protect healthcare for all. Instead, this 
budget steals nearly $2 trillion from lifesaving Medicaid and Medicare.
  With nearly 40 million Americans living in poverty, our budget should 
invest in communities of color and rural communities, which have higher 
rates of poverty.
  Simply put, the House Republican budget would push more people into 
poverty. It slashes programs that help create good paying jobs for 
struggling families. It is a shame, it is immoral, it is un-American, 
and I hope we defeat it.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I just must make a comment on what went on 
in Kansas and the attribution that this was Mr. Laffer's idea.
  I know Mr. Laffer personally and have had a conversation with him 
about his plan and suggestion. It was not followed. So I do want to 
lift up his good name and say that his plan was not followed.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. 
Allen).
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Chairman Black on the 
markup of this important piece of legislation out of the Budget 
Committee.
  As we all know, tax season is the worst. It evokes images of stress, 
accountants, lawyers, and American families sending hard-earned money 
to the Federal Government.
  I, for one, have never been excited when it is tax season, and as a 
businessowner, it took on a whole new meaning.
  Taxes affect all Americans, but tax season shouldn't include months 
and months of preparation, often required to hire tax professionals.
  Our Tax Code is broken, and millions of Americans are looking to us 
to fix it. That is why Republicans have released the Unified Tax Reform 
Framework to provide relief for hardworking Americans and jump-start 
our economy.
  First, it lowers taxes at every income level, allowing Americans to 
keep more of their hard-earned paychecks. It delivers the lowest tax 
rates in modern history for job creators, allowing them to invest in 
growing their business. I will remind you that the small business 
community is responsible for 70 percent of all new jobs created.
  The vast majority of taxpayers will no longer have to deal with the 
complexity of itemizing due to the increased standard deduction. Small 
businesses will no longer be taxed under the individual side of the 
code. Families will no longer be penalized for inheriting family 
property or businesses, when the death tax is removed. Finally, we will 
cut tax rates on personal savings and investment in half.
  Americans should invest in their local economies and build towards a 
more financially secure future without exorbitant taxes.
  Now is the time for tax reform, and today we take a big step towards 
action. We must pass this budget. Hardworking Americans across the 
Nation will have the same April 15 they always have if we don't, and 
that is unacceptable.
  We cannot miss this opportunity. President Trump is with us on tax 
reform, and we must act for the American people. I urge all my 
colleagues to support this budget. It is critical to the American 
people.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle), a distinguished member of the 
Budget Committee.
  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose 
the billionaires' budget. That is exactly what the Republican budget 
is. 79.7 percent of it goes to the richest 1 percent.
  On top of that, who pays for it? The middle class and working class 
families of my district. Some 50 million Americans will be paying more 
in taxes, not less, as a result of this tax plan.
  Now, I have nothing against the billionaires that my friends on the 
other side are so eager to help. I just don't think the working class 
and middle class families of my district should be paying for their tax 
cuts.
  We should instead have a budget that focuses on building the middle 
class out, on lifting up those who have been working for the last 15 
years and not getting a pay increase. This budget does absolutely 
nothing for those families, zero.
  On top of all of this, it adds $1.5 trillion to our national debt. It 
is wrong. It does not do anything to help the great American middle 
class, and it must be rejected.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. Johnson), a member of the Budget Committee.
  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Black for yielding 
time.
  Mr. Speaker, I hear it all the time, and it is just a false 
narrative. This idea that the tax reform package presented by 
Republicans is only a tax relief for the wealthy and that the middle 
class and low-income families are not going to benefit from it is just 
absolutely untrue.
  We are talking about doubling the standard deduction. Millions of 
Americans aren't even going to pay any taxes. That is particularly 
important in rural areas like I represent in Ohio.
  So I would urge my colleagues, let's stop this false narrative that 
says that this is just a tax cut for the wealthy, because that is not 
true.
  By the way, when you cut taxes on businesses and corporations, who 
pays those taxes, Mr. Speaker?
  It is the American people who buy the products that pay those taxes. 
When they get a break, everybody wins.
  Look, the adoption of the Senate amendment to the House-passed budget 
that we are going to vote on today paves the way for tax reform. It is 
going to establish a path of balance through restrained spending, 
reduced taxes, and economic growth. It is going to allow for higher 
defense spending contingent on future adjustments to discretionary 
spending caps for defense and national security, but it begins to 
address our national debt.

  It reduces nondefense discretionary spending by over $600 billion 
over 10 years. It assumes more than $4 trillion in mandatory savings 
over 10 years. And it provides for budget enforcement in the House in 
order to strengthen fiscal discipline.
  Mr. Speaker, this is a responsible path forward. The American people 
are screaming for a simpler, fairer, flatter Tax Code, one that makes 
American workers competitive, one that let's the American people keep 
more of what they earn in their pockets.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support today's vote, pass this 
budget amendment, and let's get on to tax reform.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the assistant Democratic leader.
  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me the time.
  Mr. Speaker, the document before us is a partisan exercise to deliver 
large tax cuts to the wealthy. Working Americans will see their taxes 
go up, and our children and grandchildren will have to pay back the 
debt Republicans will create to finance these tax cuts.
  While they promise the American people revenue neutral tax reform 
that will simplify the Tax Code and close costly loopholes, the budget 
they are ramming through will borrow $1.5 trillion to finance these 
cuts. It will precipitate cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and other safety 
net programs upon which middle-income families depend.

[[Page H8246]]

  It proposes to eliminate the deduction for State and local taxes, 
increasing the tax burden on over 500,000 people in my home State of 
South Carolina.
  This document threatens the earned income tax credit; lowers the 
ceiling on middle-income savings; and eliminates the inheritance tax, 
which only affects those with estates valued over $11 million.
  It creates a pass-through for businesses that pay zero corporate 
taxes, effectively giving the owners of these companies a lower 
individual rate than the people they employ.
  If the Republicans would engage us, we could produce a bipartisan tax 
plan that would expand the earned income tax credit for single 
individuals and the child tax credit for working families.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Flores). The time of the gentleman has 
expired.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman.
  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, we could produce a bipartisan tax plan that 
would end the preferential treatment of investment income, which 
undermines working Americans while enriching wealthy investors.
  We stand ready to engage with the other side. Until then, we will be 
resolute in our opposition to this unfair, immoral document.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), a member of both our Budget Committee and 
the Appropriations Committee.
  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank the chairwoman 
for a phenomenal job.
  Look, our current fiscal environment, according to the CBO, they 
project that the growth of our economy will be 2 percent or less for 
the next decade.
  I am reminded of what a good friend and Democratic colleague in the 
Budget Committee said one day: That 3 percent growth, that is just a 
dream, that is unrealistic.
  Yet, before the storms hit, what did we see as far as our economic 
growth of the country: 3.1 percent economic growth, something that one 
of our colleagues, Democratic colleagues, said was a pipe dream.
  This is, in large part, because excessive regulations have been 
curtailed by both the administration and by Congress; but to keep that 
momentum, we need to pass tax reform.
  It will lead to a sustained strong economy. It will again lower the 
tax burden to our families. It will lead to increased wages for 
families, for the middle class, for individuals for the first time in 
such a long time, allowing the American people to keep more of their 
hard-earned money. It would make small-, mid-, and large-sized 
businesses more competitive so they can create millions of additional 
jobs here in the United States.
  Mr. Speaker, this legislation will allow us to do real tax reform to 
keep the economy growing, to get the economy going, to get the American 
people working again, and this is an essential part.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone's support.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. Carbajal), a distinguished member of the Budget 
Committee.
  Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Yarmuth for 
yielding me time.
  Mr. Speaker, snake oil is all that this Republican budget will give 
to the American middle class and working families.
  This Republican budget before Congress is squarely aimed at ramming 
through a tax plan without bipartisan consensus or input. This proposed 
tax plan will increase our deficit, adding $1.5 trillion over the next 
decade, and it leaves the middle class stuck footing the bill, with an 
increase in their annual Federal taxes.
  In fact, 80 percent of the tax cuts in this plan benefits only the 
wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. That means those benefits are geared 
towards those earning $900,000 a year or more.
  One in three middle class families making between $50,000 and 
$150,000 will see their taxes go up.
  One proposal that Republicans have put forth to pay for their plan is 
eliminating the State and local tax deduction. This will cost central 
coast homeowners and families in my district over $15,000 a year on 
average.
  As a member of the Budget Committee, I encourage my colleagues to 
reject this plan and to get to work on bipartisan negotiations for 
lasting tax reform that benefits middle class families.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, there is an old saying that the Devil is in 
the details. And those details have not been released yet, so it is 
difficult for me to understand how my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle make assumptions on just what this tax plan will do, calling 
it things such as snake oil, when I can assure you that, as a member of 
the Ways and Means Committee, it is our goal and intent that the people 
in the middle- and low-income categories will see tax relief.
  I also want to remind them that what we know was the Devil in the 
details is the details given to the American people a number of years 
ago on the Affordable Care Act--which is neither affordable nor caring, 
in my opinion--was that people would see a return of about $2,500 on 
the average in their pocket as a result of the Affordable Care Act's 
policies, and what we saw and what we are seeing now is a big increase 
in those premiums. Certainly they have not received $2,500 in their 
pocket.
  They were told they could keep their doctor, which we knew wasn't 
true, and the other kinds of things that were done that caused people 
to lose their insurance in my very own State, because we had a plan the 
people liked and people wanted to keep but could not because of the 
mandates that were put on by the Affordable Care Act.

                              {time}  0945

  I want to remind my friends from the other side of the aisle that 
maybe the thing to do is to wait and see what really is in the plan, 
because the devil is in the detail, and I think you may like it enough 
that you perhaps will even vote for this tax plan that does give a jolt 
to the economy and does help the American people, especially in the 
lower- and middle-income, to keep more of their hard-earned dollars in 
their pockets.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), a distinguished member of the 
Budget Committee.
  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding me time.
  Mr. Speaker, to my friend on the other side of the aisle, the 
gentlewoman from Tennessee, the reality is that the truth hurts. This 
budget resolution totally abandons America's most cherished values and 
betrays its highest ideals.
  This extreme budget not only threatens programs for our veterans and 
hungry children, it makes drastic cuts to the Medicare and Medicaid 
programs that our seniors count on for survival.
  As it doles out that budgetary cruelty, this resolution hands massive 
tax cuts to millionaires and powerful corporations all while adding 
$2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.
  It also fails to protect our environment, neglects our children's 
education, and once more targets women's healthcare for severe cuts.
  In short, the wealthy win, the middle class is ignored, and we all 
get saddled with more debt. Those are not values that this House should 
stand for. It is certainly not what veterans, children, seniors, or 
hardworking Americans deserve. This irresponsible budget rewards the 
rich and powerful and punishes everyone else, and that is the best 
thing that I can say about it.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. Jeffries), a distinguished member of the Budget 
Committee.
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, while House Democrats are focused on 
delivering better jobs, better wages, and a better future for the 
American people, House Republicans have once again presented a budget 
that is reckless, regressive, and reprehensible.
  It is a ``billionaire-first, middle class-last tax plan.'' It will 
not help the middle class. The House Republican budget and tax proposal 
will hurt the middle

[[Page H8247]]

class by raising taxes on working families and middle-income Americans.
  The House Republican budget and tax plan is nothing more than a wolf 
in sheep's clothing. It will benefit the wealthiest and the well-off 
here in this country. Eighty percent of the tax cuts proposed in the 
Ryan-McConnell plan will go to the wealthiest 1 percent in America, to 
millionaires and billionaires, to the privileged few, to special 
interest corporations. It will not lead to economic growth. It will 
saddle this country with trillions of dollars in additional debt and 
deficit.
  It is based on a phony, fraudulent, and failed theory of trickle-down 
economics, which I finally figured out what it relates to in terms of 
the middle class. You may get a trickle, but you are guaranteed to stay 
down. Stay down because they are going to undermine your Medicare, stay 
down because they are going to undermine Social Security, and stay down 
because they are going to saddle your children with trillions of 
dollars of additional debt.
  Mr. Speaker, reject this plan. It is a bad deal for the American 
people. They deserve a better deal.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam), a member of the Ways and Means 
Committee.
  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I am almost tempted to continue to yield 
time to my friend from the other side of the aisle. Just keep driving 
the expectations of any tax relief further and further into the ground, 
and I think people are going to be surprised and delighted with 
ultimately what the House ends up considering.
  Mr. Speaker, this is why I am here. This is a prelude to tax reform. 
We vote on this. We then make it so that no single political party is 
able to deny a vote on tax reform, and both parties can come to the 
table and try and negotiate something that is thoughtful, because here 
is what we know: it is the current Tax Code that is benefiting people 
that everybody is scandalized that they are benefiting. It is the 
current Tax Code that allows corporations to lock trillions of dollars 
offshore. It is the current Tax Code that is really stifling and so 
difficult. And it is the current Tax Code that nobody can defend. There 
is not a single person on this floor that is going to say: Oh, the 
Internal Revenue Code? I love that, Mr. Speaker. Just leave it the way 
it is. It is a disaster, and nobody likes the IRS.
  So rather than moaning and groaning and having posters and this and 
that, let's do this: let's dump the current Tax Code and let's have a 
transformational moment. Mr. Speaker, that is what our country and our 
constituents are yearning for, not old bumper stickers, not old shabby 
phrases from the past, but they are looking for us to lead and to bring 
people together, and that is what we are trying to do.
  There is a meddlesome issue that affects my district as a high tax 
State, and it affects a lot of other folks, and that is how we deal 
with State and local tax deductibility. I am of the view that tax 
reform does not mean simply the redistribution of a tax liability from 
one part of the country to another, but it means tax relief for 
everybody.
  Mr. Speaker, I think what we are looking for is to create middle 
class tax relief. And if the gentleman's expectations are that low, I 
think he is going to be pleased with what we ultimately are able to 
come up with.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote. I thank the gentlewoman for the 
time, and I look forward to passing this resolution and moving forward 
to changing our Tax Code.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. Levin), a distinguished member of the Ways and Means 
Committee.
  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, the Republican budget politically paving the 
way for their tax reform proposals can best be described as an elixir 
of growth, a magic cure-all. Instead, it is a fake, indeed dangerous, 
potion.
  History has shown that a huge tax cut, primarily for the very wealthy 
and large corporations, does not promote growth, and will make life 
harder for the middle class and everyone else.
  This budget calls dangerously for raising our debt by $1.5 trillion, 
creating a future deficit tax for middle-income families; cutting 
Medicare by nearly $500 billion; cutting Medicaid and other health 
programs by $1.3 trillion; and assuming $4 trillion in cuts to a broad 
range of programs, which could include education and health research.
  Mr. Speaker, vote ``no'' on this budget.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. Walker), who is the chair of our RSC.
  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I am torn as I rise today. First, there is 
no question I will vote in favor of the budget and encourage my 
colleagues to do so because there is no doubt this is the best way 
forward to achieve tax reform and unlock the promise of bigger 
paychecks, more jobs, and the return of investing in America.
  However, I must also include that the Senate did not do its work. 
After months of hard work by Chairwoman Black and the Budget Committee, 
the House was able to get it done. Even acknowledging the difficult 
position of our country, they put us on a path to balance the budget in 
less than a decade.
  The House's budget included reconciliation instructions to speed up 
the enactment of $203 billion in mandatory savings, and the House 
budget included instructions that allowed us for the first time to stay 
on the path to repeal ObamaCare, to help those who continue to suffer 
with rising premiums in the individual market.
  I would guess that nearly every Republican in the Chamber agrees that 
the House's budget is superior.
  So why are we voting on the Senate's?
  Because our Senate colleagues seem allergic sometimes to making tough 
choices.
  But why will the Senate's budget pass?
  Because the American people need tax relief. Families and small 
businesses wrestle with an outdated and complicated Tax Code every 
year. It is true, we do have a once-in-a-generation opportunity.
  The specter of the IRS and devastating corporate rate mean that 
capital and resources are held outside of the United States and not 
invested here. Making our Tax Code fairer and simpler will bring this 
capital back to the market and jump-start investment and growth like we 
have rarely seen in the United States.
  Despite my ongoing and deep frustration sometimes with the Senate, I 
encourage my colleagues to pass this budget and bring the promise of 
more jobs and bigger paychecks closer to reality.
  I am pleased by the Speaker's commitment that the House will vote on 
important fiscal legislation in the form of balanced budget amendments, 
the Default Prevention Act, or some other deficit-reducing legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, the bottom line? It is vital that the House fulfill its 
promise to the American people.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished member of the 
Budget Committee.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me 
time.
  Mr. Speaker, the American people will look forward to a Thanksgiving 
and a Christmas of which families come together, but they will also see 
a Halloween.
  Today, on the floor of the House, the Republicans will vote for the 
worst Halloween of hobgoblins and ghosts and monsters that you can ever 
imagine. Monsters scare children, so today we will be voting on that 
monster that will scare children.
  Let me let you listen to Senator Sykes from Kansas, her State 
offering a Republican tax cut that was going to boost the economy. Her 
words are: ``With the benefit of hindsight, we can say with certainty 
this promise was unfulfilled. In the following 5 years, Kansas 
experienced nine rounds of budget cuts, stress on State agencies, and 
the inability to effectively provide the core functions of government 
for our citizens.''
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record Senator Sykes' message to 
Congress.

  A Message to Congress: Don't Make the Same Mistake We Did in Kansas

    (By Dinah Sykes, a Republican member of the Kansas State Senate)

       Americans want efficient government, responsible spending 
     and reasonable taxes. This is not difficult. Yet sometimes 
     what

[[Page H8248]]

     seems so simple becomes complicated when these concepts are 
     turned into buzzwords and used as weapons for political gain.
       In 2012, Republicans in Kansas enacted a ``revolutionary'' 
     tax overhaul promised to be a ``shot of adrenaline to the 
     heart of the Kansas economy.'' With the benefit of hindsight, 
     we can say with certainty this promise was unfulfilled. In 
     the following five years, Kansas experienced nine rounds of 
     budget cuts, stress on state agencies and the inability to 
     effectively provide the core functions of government for our 
     citizens.
       As Republicans in Congress begin working to modify the 
     federal tax code, I worry that tax reform done poorly could 
     lead to similar failure. I hope federal lawmakers learn from 
     mistakes made at the state level.
       This year, the Kansas legislature--including many 
     Republicans like me--voted to partially restore income-tax 
     rates and to repeal a provision that allowed independent 
     business owners to pay almost no state taxes on their income. 
     We also overrode our governor's veto, who opposed rolling 
     back the tax cuts he championed.
       Critics of our vote claim that Kansas didn't cut spending 
     enough to accompany the tax cuts. In reality, we cut our 
     budget through across-the-board cuts, targeted cuts, 
     rescission bills and allotments. Roughly 3,000 state employee 
     positions were cut, salaries were frozen, and road projects 
     canceled. We delayed payments to the state employee 
     retirement system and emptied our savings accounts. Even as 
     we issued more than $2 billion in new bonds to float our 
     debt, Kansas received three credit downgrades, making that 
     debt costlier.
       In Kansas, we understand the allure of tax-cut promises. We 
     want to believe promises of amazing growth or outcomes. In 
     2012, traditional budget forecast models accurately predicted 
     the devastating effect the tax breaks would have on state 
     revenue. Proponents of the plan used dynamic scoring 
     predicting incredible economic growth and supporting their 
     own preconceived ideas. Today, we know which forecasts were 
     correct.
       Across the state, citizens may have been paying less in 
     income taxes, but those decreases were offset by increases in 
     sales taxes, property taxes and fees. These changes alone 
     were not enough to put the state on the right path. Education 
     and infrastructure, key investments necessary for strong 
     economic growth, were treated as the enemy. As we went 
     through our 2017 legislative session, the ``shot of economic 
     adrenaline'' still showed no signs of materializing. Our 
     state functioned as though the Great Recession had never 
     ended.
       Kansas should serve as a cautionary tale illustrating the 
     damage done when the normal order is shortchanged. America's 
     founders and countless generations of leaders embedded 
     deliberative procedures into our legislative process for a 
     reason. But in 2012, the governor's tax proposal looked very 
     different from the package he signed. A dispute between House 
     and Senate versions should have gone to conference committee; 
     however, the House cut short debate and rammed through a 
     motion to concur with the Senate instead. I watch now as 
     lawmakers in Congress use similar tactics, and I worry that 
     backroom dealing and circumvention of process will lead to 
     similar results.
       I never anticipated entering public service. I was content 
     raising my family, participating in the PTA and operating my 
     business. However, I saw the impact that bad tax policy was 
     having on the state. I felt the results of growing class 
     sizes and shrinking programs in the schools my children 
     attended. I witnessed a gradual erosion of the quality of 
     life that makes Kansas such a great place to live.
       There is a real temptation to let our frustration turn into 
     anger. In our increasingly polarized world, we see what 
     happens when we retreat to our ideological trenches. The 
     antidote, it would seem to me, is listening carefully to 
     those we disagree with and seeking common ground as a 
     starting point. (We should also note that failing to listen 
     to constituents while blindly holding to ideology can have 
     consequences: About a third of Kansas legislators became ex-
     legislators in 2016.)
       As our country looks at the key issues ahead of us, 
     including tax policy and health-care reform, we face 
     important questions: How can we as Americans work together to 
     improve our tax policy? How can we work together to provide 
     core government functions? Answering those questions requires 
     having civil conversations, learning from our neighbors and 
     sharing our experiences. We are better when we can work 
     together to find compromise.

  Ms. JACKSON LEE. What do you think will happen to this Nation if we 
vote for this budget plan, this Halloween of a plan?
  The latest Republican budget mandates $4.9 trillion in budget cuts.
  Mr. Speaker, I cannot vote for this. I cannot vote for it because of 
the people in Texas after Hurricane Harvey; the people in Louisiana 
after Hurricane Nate; the people in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, 
and Florida after Hurricanes Maria and Irma. I cannot vote for this. 
This will gut disaster relief, education, infrastructure, research, 
veterans benefits, and it will clearly provide tax cuts for the rich.
  The Republican budget provides $1.6 trillion in tax cuts to 
millionaires, billionaires, wealthy corporations. It doesn't give any 
money to the middle class.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Mitchell). The time of the gentlewoman 
has expired.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentlewoman.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it explodes the deficit.
  How could this happen?
  It demands higher cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and education. 
This is a Halloween that America will not tolerate.
  My good friend from North Carolina, there will be over a million 
people that will lose benefits under this plan and the tax plan that 
they are planning. They will pay higher taxes. This is a bad bill. Vote 
it down.
  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Budget Committee, I rise in strong 
and unyielding opposition to the Senate Amendment to H. Con. Res. 71, 
the Congressional Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2018.
  As senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, the Ranking 
Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland 
Security, and Investigations, I oppose this phony budget resolution, 
which is in reality nothing more than a smoke screen designed to pave 
the way for massive tax cuts for the top 1 percent, while exploding the 
debt and deficit by $1.5 trillion over ten years.
  Here are five reasons why every Member of this House should vote 
against this Republican budget resolution:
  1. This Republican budget cuts nearly $1.3 trillion from Medicaid and 
nearly $500 million from Medicaid;
  2. This Republican budget includes massive spending cuts to the 
priorities of the American people;
  3. This Republican budget guts investment in areas critical to 
expanding economic opportunity;
  4. This latest Republican budget uses fast track procedures to 
increase the debt and deficits by $1.5 trillion, while showering tax 
cuts on billionaires, millionaires, and the wealthiest corporations; 
and
  5. As we have learned from bitter and painful experience, tax cuts do 
not pay for themselves, notwithstanding the supply-side fairy tale 
claims that they do.
   This latest Republican budget mandates $4.9 trillion in spending 
cuts to top priorities like disaster relief, education, infrastructure, 
research, veteran benefits, and programs that expand opportunities for 
American families.
  This Republican budget provides $1.6 trillion in tax cuts to 
millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations, while raising 
taxes on working and middle class families by $470 billion.
  Mr. Speaker, let us be very clear and direct: the resolution before 
us is not intended to reconcile tax and spending priorities to reflect 
the priorities of the American people or to reduce the deficit and 
national debt or to put our fiscal house on a sustainable path to 
economic growth.
  Rather the sole purpose of Republicans bringing this job-killing 
budget to the floor today is to fast-track their ``Billionaires First'' 
tax plan, which will cause significant harm to working and middle class 
families, especially to my constituents in the Eighteenth Congressional 
District of Texas.
  The McConnell-Ryan tax plan, which this budget resolution is designed 
to grease the skids for, would raise taxes on about 1.5 million Texas 
households, or 12.4 percent of households next year.
  On average, families earning up to $86,000 annually would see a $794 
increase in their tax liability, a significant burden on families 
struggling to afford child care and balance their checkbook.
  An estimated 2.8 million Texas households deduct state and local 
taxes with an average deduction of $7,823 in 2015.
  The Ryan-McConnell plan eliminates this deduction, which would lower 
home values and put pressure on states and towns to collect revenues 
they depend on to fund schools, roads, and vital public resources.
  The proposed elimination of the personal exemption will harm millions 
of Texans by taking away the $4,050 deduction for each taxpayer and 
claimed dependent; in 2015, roughly 9.3 million dependent exemptions 
were claimed in the Lone Star State.
  Equally terrible is that the McConnell-Ryan tax plan drastically 
reduces the Earned Income Tax Credit, which encourages work for 2.7 
million low-income individuals in Texas, helping them make ends meet 
with an average credit of $2,689.
  The EITC and the Child Tax Credit lift about 1.2 million Texans, 
including 663,000 children, out of poverty each year.
  This reckless and irresponsible GOP tax plan is made all the more 
obscene by the fact that 80 percent of the GOP's tax cuts go to the 
wealthiest 1 percent.

[[Page H8249]]

  To achieve this goal of giving more and more to the haves and the 
``have mores,'' the GOP budget betrays seniors, children, the most 
vulnerable, and needy, and working and middle-class families.
  The steep reductions in program investments proposed in this 
Republican budget fall most heavily on low-income families, students 
struggling to afford college, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
  This Republican budget immediately guts investment critical to 
expanding economic opportunity by lowering the already inadequate 
austerity-level spending caps by an additional $5 billion in 2018 and 
by even more in subsequent years.
  Republican budget adopts Trumpcare but does even more damage because 
in addition to depriving more than 20 million Americans of healthcare, 
denying protection to persons with preexisting conditions, and raising 
costs for older and low-income adults, cuts more than $1.8 trillion 
from Medicaid and Medicare.
  Republican budget ends the Medicare guarantee and calls for replacing 
Medicare's guaranteed benefits with fixed payments for the purchase of 
health insurance, shifting costs and financial risks onto seniors and 
disabled workers; this represents a $500 billion cut to Medicare over 
ten years.
  The Republican budget focuses too narrowly on the military, 
shortchanging American soft-power and other essential elements of 
national security by increasing defense spending by $72 billion above 
the cap and hollowing out the State Department and foreign aid agencies 
with cuts of $11 billion and environmental and natural resource 
protection by more than $6 billion.
  Mr. Speaker, the federal budget is more than a financial document; it 
is an expression of our values and priorities as a nation.
  Sadly, this latest Republican budget, just like the previous one and 
the President's ``skinny budget,'' fails this moral test of government.
  America will not be made great by stealing another $1.8 trillion from 
Medicare and Medicaid, abandoning seniors and families in need, 
depriving students of realizing a dream to attend college without 
drowning in debt, or disinvesting in the working families just to give 
unwanted tax breaks to wealthy corporations and the top 1 percent.
  America will not be positioned to compete and win in the global, 
interconnected, and digital economy by slashing funding for scientific 
research, the arts and humanities, job retraining, and clean energy.
  Even a cursory review leaves the inescapable conclusion that this 
budget represents a betrayal--of our values as a nation, and of the 
promises made by the President during the election campaign.
  This Republican budget is not a budget for the real world that real 
Americans live in but is as much a fantasy budget as the Trump ``Skinny 
Budget'' in that it pretends to achieve balance by assuming that 
painless spending cuts can and will be made by the Congress.
  To put this reckless, irresponsible, and draconian budget in 
perspective, it is useful to examine what the proposed cuts mean when 
applied to the programs depended upon by Americans to rise up the 
economic ladder, plan for the future, provide for their families, and 
strive to achieve the American Dream.
  The elimination of funding for Community Development Block Grants 
(CDBG) drains resources from communities, even in times of disaster 
because CDBG provides flexible grants to local communities for a wide 
range of unique needs, including Meals on Wheels, housing programs, and 
community infrastructure improvements.
  The Republican budget targets disaster grants made by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, which help families and businesses when 
their disaster-related property losses are not covered by insurance.
  The Republican budget makes higher education more expensive by 
cutting at least $211 billion from student financial aid programs, like 
Pell Grants, over ten years.
  The Republican budget also eliminates subsidized loans, making it 
difficult for students, particularly low-income students, to afford 
college and compounds the damage by making it more difficult to repay 
student loans by eliminating the Public Sector Loan Forgiveness and 
Teacher Loan Forgiveness programs.
  The Republican budget's solution to the affordable housing crisis 
currently facing cities large and small all across the country is to 
convert all discretionary spending on affordable housing into a block 
grant, which means there will be even less assistance to help the 71 
percent of extremely low income renter households who spend more than 
half their income on housing.
  The Republican budget cuts at least $150 billion from the 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) over the next ten 
years by essentially converting it to a block grant, cutting off 
funding for eligible individuals and requiring cash-strapped states to 
either fill in the gap or take away food assistance from millions of 
working families, children, and seniors.
  Mr. Speaker, as economists and policy experts have documented time 
and again, immigration reform would expand the size of the U.S. 
workforce, and in turn would increase the size of the economy and 
reduce deficits.
  The Republican budget, however, again rejects comprehensive 
immigration reform that would bring clear and just rules for those 
seeking citizenship and help secure the nation's borders.
  In doing so, the Republican budget squanders an opportunity to reduce 
deficits by an estimated $900 billion over the next two decades, boost 
the economy by 5.4 percent, and extend the solvency of Social Security.
  The Republican budget continues to target federal employees by 
cutting their compensation and benefits by at least another $163 
billion over ten years, which comes on top of the $182 billion in cuts 
federal employees have already absorbed in the form of higher 
retirement contributions, pay freezes, and furloughs.
  The Republican budget cuts hurts veterans by cutting veterans 
benefits by nearly $50 billion over the next ten years, with newly 
eligible veterans experiencing cuts in programs that pay for education 
benefits as well as loan guarantees.
  Finally, Mr. Speaker, it must be pointed out that the Republican 
budget's pretension to balance is based on reliance on trillions of 
dollars in budget games and gimmicks to rig the numbers.
  The Republican budget counts a dubious $1.4 trillion ``economic 
dividend'' from cutting taxes and taking away consumer protections that 
is not backed up by any credible analysis or historical experience.
  The Republican budget assumes, despite all precedent and evidence to 
the contrary, that tax reform will be revenue neutral, even though 
Republican tax plans are projected to lose between $3 trillion and $7 
trillion.
  Given these budgetary shenanigans, never could it more truly be said 
that ``figures don't lie, but liars figure.''
  In evaluating the merits of a budget resolution, it is not enough to 
subject it only to the test of fiscal responsibility.
  To keep faith with the nation's past, to be fair to the nation's 
present, and to safeguard the nation's future, the budget must also 
pass a ``moral test.''
  The Republican budget resolution fails both of these standards.
  I strongly oppose the Senate Amendment to H. Con. Res. 71 and urge 
all Members to join me in voting against this reckless, cruel, and 
heartless budget resolution that will do nothing to improve the lives 
or well-being of middle and working class families, and the poor and 
vulnerable `caught in the tentacles of circumstance.'
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Flores).
  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Black and her committee 
for all the great work that they have done in putting forth a budget 
that moves America in the right direction.
  Mr. Speaker, I have been astounded by the rhetoric that we have heard 
from the other side for a plan that they haven't really seen. They are 
making up their facts as they go along to suit their wishes.
  Mr. Speaker, I support the fiscal year 2018 budget resolution. While 
I think the Senate's version falls far short of the great work we did 
in the House and our budget, it is still the key thing that we need to 
have to move forward with tax reform for the American people.
  Our tax reform plan includes tax cuts for the working class Americans 
who have been struggling for the last several years under a broken Tax 
Code.
  It also makes America's businesses the most competitive in the world 
instead of having to struggle with the world's least competitive tax 
system.
  Mr. Speaker, in summary, this budget provides a way for a tax plan 
that provides for bigger paychecks, more jobs, a stronger economy, and 
a balanced budget. I strongly urge our colleagues to support this 
budget.

                              {time}  1000

  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Kentucky has 12\3/4\ 
minutes remaining.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ half minutes to the 
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the ranking member of the Ways 
and Means Committee.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, it is getting time for Halloween, so they have 
put on the disguise on the other side. So what we are hearing today is, 
from the last two Republican speakers: This is a bad budget. Let's vote 
``yes.''

[[Page H8250]]

  The gentleman from Ohio said a while ago, this is all about the 
middle class. The middle class does not pay an estate tax. The middle 
class, because of our efforts--and, I think, mine in particular--no 
longer pay the alternative minimum tax. And the people in the middle 
class are not locked into the 39.6 top rate in the Tax Code. This is a 
disguise.
  They are adding $1.5 trillion to the debt and, actually, over 10 
years, when you borrow the money, they are adding $2.3 trillion to the 
debt, all for a tax cut for people at the very top.
  Now, let me say this: I am happy to negotiate a tax reform package 
that we can all live with. I am happy to sit down with the other side 
and acknowledge some parts of the Code that clearly don't work any 
longer for the American people.
  This is being done by one party, exclusively. They have not 
negotiated with us. They have not given us the opening. They have not 
said to us: ``Where do you want to proceed on this?''
  Instead, if you pass this budget today, they suggest you are going to 
see their plan on November 1, and you are going to vote for it sometime 
around November 6. That is not negotiation.
  The Congress I signed up for actually negotiated these agreements, 
and if you couldn't love the final passage, at least you could like it 
because you had sufficient input. That is not what has happened, Mr. 
Speaker, in this process.
  This process is one-sided. It is one-dimensional. They 
interchangeably use the words ``tax cut'' and ``tax reform.'' This is 
about a tax cut.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.
  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I have been here--this is my 37th year. This 
is the most reckless and irresponsible budget that I have seen in the 
37 years that I have been here.
  Today, we are considering the Senate's budget resolution, not because 
the House supports it, but because it is just a vehicle to get partisan 
tax reform--strike that--tax cuts.
  On an issue as consequential as tax reform, the Congress should not 
be rushing to meet self-imposed political deadlines without enough time 
to read and analyze the effects.
  More importantly, we should not be considering a bill to cut taxes 
that is partisan and that is as terrible as we are hearing the 
majority's proposal will be. I say that because we still haven't seen 
the full details of a bill that this resolution provides for 
Republicans to jam through on an expedited process; one they will 
reportedly introduce, mark up, and bring to the floor in the few 
legislative days we have left before Thanksgiving.
  Is the sunshine too bright for you?
  Even my friends on the other side of the aisle don't know exactly how 
bad it will be for their constituents. When asked about the details of 
the Republican bill, Representative Chris Collins, a Republican from 
New York, said: ``We don't know, we don't know, we don't know, we don't 
know, we don't know.''
  That is a Republican Member of Congress who is saying he has no idea 
what this bill is empowering.
  But we do know that, based on a nonpartisan analysis of their 
framework, it will raise taxes on 47 million Americans.
  We know that 80 percent of the tax cuts--80 percent of the tax cuts--
will go to the top 1 percent.
  And we know, as well, that nearly half of all taxpayers with 
children, 44.5 percent, will see their taxes go up. Those same children 
will be on the hook for a $2.4 trillion cost. This is the biggest debt 
explosion of any bill that I have seen.
  Republican Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida summed up today's 
vote as being for a budget--hear this, my friends on both sides of the 
aisle. This is Matt Gaetz, Republican, Florida, summed up today's vote 
as being for a budget that ``nobody believes in so that we have a 
chance to vote for a tax bill that nobody's read.''
  That is not what we should be doing. We ought to be working together 
to craft a bipartisan tax reform package that is revenue neutral.
  It will be the height of hypocrisy to say that you are for fiscal 
discipline and to vote for this budget. Let's not risk our fiscal 
future and the economic security of our people. Defeat this resolution.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. Ferguson), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.
  Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the FY18 
budget. I think that this is a very important step in doing something 
that this Nation needs, and that is for the United States Congress and 
the President to pass tax reform.
  For way too long, our national economy has languished at a GDP growth 
that is far below historical averages. One of the most important things 
that we have got to do is to grow our economy because that leads to 
families being successful, rising wages, being able to have careers for 
themselves and their family members, and I believe that tax reform 
unlocks the American economy in a way that we haven't seen in decades.
  For far too long, we have looked at our Tax Code only through a set 
of domestic lenses and only looked at the rates; and we get into these 
ridiculous debates about the top bracket versus the lowest bracket, and 
we divide our Nation. But, for the first time, we are approaching our 
Tax Code through a set of global lenses that really give our American 
economy a chance to be competitive on the world stage.

  It is not simply about cutting rates. It is not simply about giving a 
break to one group or another and to get away from this rhetoric. It is 
about creating the most vibrant place in the world to do business by 
reforming the Code and creating fairness.
  If we do that and our American families succeed, and we see people 
moving from poverty into the middle class, and from the middle class 
up, and we see entrepreneurs, and we see new businesses and innovation, 
we are going to see growth in our economy like we have not seen in a 
generation.
  The importance of that is it will give us the tools that we need to 
address the single biggest driver of our debt, and that is mandatory 
spending. And this body must have the political courage and integrity, 
along with the Senate, to address mandatory spending, to have an honest 
conversation about Social Security, about Medicare, about Medicaid, 
and, most importantly, about welfare entitlement reform, because we can 
no longer trap generation after generation in poverty. We must create 
pathways out of poverty into the middle class for our fellow Americans.
  We can do this. We can be committed to it.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), a distinguished member of the Budget 
Committee.
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, regardless of what the Republicans say, 
their budget paves the way for trillions of dollars in tax cuts for 
millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations.
  And who would pay for it?
  It would be the middle class families, children, seniors, and people 
with disabilities. It would slash Medicaid by $1 trillion, threaten 
healthcare for one in four Americans. It would slash Medicare by $470 
billion. And this budget proposes, yet again, to repeal the Affordable 
Care Act.
  Under the Republican tax plan, 1.9 million Illinoisans would no 
longer be able to claim State and local tax deductions; and nationwide, 
47 million people in middle class households making between $50,000 and 
$150,000 a year would pay more in taxes.
  So I ask my colleagues: Did you really come to Congress to take away 
healthcare and reduce income for middle class families?
  If you care about anyone other than millionaires and billionaires, 
you need to vote ``no.''
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from Vermont (Mr. Welch), a distinguished member of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee.
  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I want to say three things about this budget:
  First, deficits matter. Deficits matter. This budget explicitly 
raises the deficit. It admits to $1.5 trillion, more likely $2.5 
trillion. That means that

[[Page H8251]]

our children and our grandchildren are going to be the ones paying for 
the deficit that is added.
  Second, process matters. We are hearing a lot of talk about tax 
reform, but there has been no process. There is no bill, and we are 
about to vote on a so-called tax reform package that has not been 
explicitly printed to paper. This is no way to do any business. We are 
making it up as we go along, and it is the same process that was used 
on healthcare. We went into committee with no bill and came out, 27 
hours later, with 24 million people losing healthcare. There has been 
no process on this.
  And third, details matter, and the details that are leaking out are 
very punishing to the middle class. Anybody who is an income tax payer 
in a State, a property tax payer in a State, is going to lose that 
deduction.
  It is very tough on middle class efforts to save for retirement. That 
is in play. Folks' deductions on their Keogh plans, their 401(k) plans, 
are very much a part of the process that is going to lower this.
  Reject this plan.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I almost can't sit here and not make a comment on my colleagues' 
budget on the other side of the aisle. All of a sudden, they seem to be 
very concerned about deficits when, as a matter of fact, their budget 
assumed almost $1 trillion worth of deficits in their budget.
  I want to also say that our committee did a really good job in having 
a balanced budget, and we are, obviously, looking at a budget from the 
Senate that we are going to be taking up so that we can do tax reform.
  But they also, in addition to that, had $2 trillion worth of new 
taxes that they placed on the American people. So all of a sudden, this 
purity of worrying about these deficits just makes me scratch my head, 
and about raising taxes on the people when their own plan did the very 
opposite of what we are trying to do is cut taxes. They added $2 
trillion worth of taxes.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time we have 
remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Kentucky has 5\3/4\ 
minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 5\1/4\ minutes 
remaining.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  As we wind down our arguments here, once again, we have had a very 
fascinating discussion and, once again, we seem to disagree on 
virtually everything.
  For instance, I have heard from the other side many times over the 
last few days and today that we really can't say what the impact is, 
the claims that we are making about whether this bill will help the 
rich or help the middle class or help lower income individuals, because 
we don't have the details. Well, that is absolutely correct; we don't 
have the details.
  But then, if we don't have the details, how can the other side talk 
about the huge benefits that this proposal, this tax proposal that is 
yet unwritten, will provide for the middle class? And how can they deny 
that it will benefit the wealthy disproportionately?
  We know from the outline that was released by the other side in 
recent weeks that they intend to eliminate the estate tax. The estate 
tax only benefits wealthy Americans, people with estates over $11 
million for a couple.
  They want to eliminate the alternative minimum tax. We know the 
alternative minimum tax only affects wealthy individuals. There was one 
estimate that the one year of President Trump's tax return that we 
have, that in that year alone, the alternative minimum tax, if it were 
repealed, would have saved him $30 million. So we know that affects 
very wealthy people.

                              {time}  1015

  We know that if you reduce the top rate from 39.6 percent to 35 
percent, that benefits very high-income people. So we do have enough 
information to draw some pretty definite conclusions about the impact 
that the released outline, at least, will have on wealthy Americans, 
and we can draw some of the same conclusions about how it will hurt 
middle class Americans.
  If, in fact, the Republican tax bill repeals the deduction for State 
and local taxes. In my State, there will be half a million people who 
will lose an average of $9,900 of deductions every year. So we 
absolutely know the impact that the proposal, as we know it now, will 
have, and I think it is fair--given that there will be no hearings on 
this bill--it is fair to raise the alarms about what the potential for 
this bill is.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, it is my extreme honor to yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), our majority whip, who is a 
wonderful member of our Conference.
  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman Black for her 
leadership on this budget. It is important that we do a budget--and it 
is always difficult to bring a budget forward because it represents the 
views that we have, and, of course, we in the House passed a budget 
that shows the country how we can get back to a balanced Federal 
budget, how we can get our economy moving again, and how we can finally 
rebuild the middle class.
  Mr. Speaker, that is really what is at heart with this budget vote. 
This budget starts the process of actually going out and cutting taxes 
across the board so that middle class families can have a better 
opportunity for the American Dream. If you look over the last 10 years, 
we have seen our middle class evaporate in this country.
  So many times, we have seen company after company move jobs overseas. 
And anybody who has complained about that--and I sure have been angry 
about it--the first thing you do is you go ask them: Why did you move 
the jobs overseas? And they say: Because America is not competitive 
again.
  We have the highest corporate tax rate in the world, in the entire 
industrial world. And what it means is, middle class jobs are being 
shipped to other countries. We can complain about it all day, Mr. 
Speaker, but how about we actually do something about it? This bill 
starts that process--working with President Trump who wants to bring 
those middle class jobs back to America.
  We are talking about high-paying jobs, $60,000- to $150,000-a-year 
jobs that left our country. We can bring those jobs back. That is what 
this vote is about. That is what this budget is about: starting the 
process to finally rebuild our middle class, to finally bring those 
jobs back, and to finally give a tax break to families who have been 
struggling for so long under slow economic growth.
  Let's actually grow our economy. Growing our economy is not just good 
for rebuilding the middle class and for those hardworking taxpayers who 
will get real relief under this bill, but also to our ability to reduce 
the deficit and finally get back to balanced Federal budgets so that we 
can create a healthier economy and a healthier America.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge everybody to vote ``yes'' on this budget.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I now have the distinct honor of yielding 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic 
leader.
  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for 
yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I particularly want to recognize Mr. Yarmuth's 
extraordinary leadership as the ranking member on the Budget Committee. 
As we all know, budget should be a statement of our national values. 
What is important to us as a nation should be reflected in how we 
allocate our resources.
  Again, it is a statement of values, and who better to manage all of 
that in this Congress of the United States than Mr. Yarmuth, who brings 
his values and his heartland priorities to the budget process, and I 
thank him for the leadership he has provided.
  Sadly though, I rise in opposition to what the Republicans have 
proposed which is a devastating Republican budget. The first step in 
the GOP's dangerous plan to fast track their immoral tax framework is 
to hand trillions of dollars to the wealthy while raising taxes on 
working American families.
  The Republican budget and tax plan cruelly rig an unfair system even 
further against hardworking Americans. It cuts a raw deal for families 
in every corner of our country. Democrats have a better deal, better 
jobs, better pay, better future.

[[Page H8252]]

  But right here, before our eyes in this House, Republicans are 
replacing the great American ladders of opportunity with the silver 
spoons of plutocracy and aristocracy. Their agenda raises taxes on the 
middle class. That is a fact. Tens of millions of middle class families 
will pay higher taxes, including a heavier burden for State and local 
taxes.
  It might be interesting to our distinguished colleague, Mr. Scalise--
and isn't it a joy to see him in debate on the floor--in his State of 
Louisiana, 458,000 people will pay an average of nearly $7,000 more by 
losing their deduction.
  And Congresswoman Black, from the great State of Tennessee, in her 
State, 573,960 people will lose their deduction, around $5,600 a filer.
  Not only that, if that isn't bad enough for assaulting the dream of 
homeownership in our country by attacking the deduction, this plan that 
the Republicans propose has been estimated to reduce the value of 
people's homes by 10 percent. You not only are paying more money in 
order to give a tax break to the wealthy and to big corporations, you 
are reducing the value of your home, and, by the way, your neighbors' 
homes as well.
  So with all of the unfairness in it, the one that is most 
understandable to people directly is how it affects them. And in that 
case, 44 million Americans will pay more because of what the 
Republicans have in their plan.

  So it raises taxes on middle class, particularly with the State and 
local tax deduction removed. And by the way--another by the way--if you 
are a corporation, your deduction is not removed, just if you are an 
individual filer, so again, an advantage to corporate America at the 
expense of America's working families.
  Next, it borrows trillions from the future to give tax cuts to the 
wealthiest. Eighty percent of the tax cuts in this Republican proposal 
goes to the wealthiest 1 percent; 80 percent goes to the wealthiest 1 
percent at the expense of America's working families and children. The 
budget on the floor today reveals the true cruelty behind the 
Republican's tax plan. What words would be best to use it? It is 
looting the middle class, massive looting of the middle class; rip-off 
of the middle class, because there are many middle class people.
  So you take some money from all of those middle class people and 
those who aspire to it so that you can give a lot of money to the few. 
That is a big sucking up of assets from the middle class to the 
wealthy. That is what they are here for. It is in their DNA: trickle-
down economics. It is in their DNA. That is what the Republicans come 
here to do, and that causes a deep addition to the national debt.
  They are supposed to be deficit hawks, but I think they have become 
an endangered species because they don't seem to care that, with the 
cuts that they are taking, the tax breaks they are giving to corporate 
and wealthy America will cost over $2 trillion--not counting service on 
the national debt which would take it closer to $3 trillion additional.
  That is a very hard road to come back from. And as our distinguished 
ranking member has pointed out, the opportunity cost in the budget, 
whether it is a trillion dollars from Medicaid, half a trillion dollars 
from Medicare, funds taken from education, the seed corn of America's 
preeminence in the world. Why? To give a tax cut to the high end.
  And they will say: Oh, well, the growth will come from this. We will 
pay for that.
  It never has; never has. Don't take it from me. Bruce Bartlett, who 
was one of the orchestrators of the supply-side economics said: We 
never said it paid for itself. Anyone who says it does, it is not true. 
It is nonsense.
  He went even further to call it BS.
  As I said, it ransacks Medicare and Medicaid, adding trillions to the 
debt in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy, looting the middle 
class, shaking down the middle class, ripping off the middle class, 
increasing the taxes of the middle class.
  It devastates vital investments, as our distinguished ranking member 
said, in good-paying jobs with higher wages for working families, the 
education of our children, the health of our working families. It 
really is a good example of what they say that Medicare should wither 
on the vine. In keeping with their trickle-down economics, Medicare 
should wither on the vine because they will take half a trillion 
dollars from Medicare in their budget that will follow.
  So Republicans will harm veterans, rural America, seniors, and 
children, again, all in the name of fast-tracking trillion-dollar tax 
breaks for the wealthiest 1 percent. What more do you need to know? 
Eighty percent goes to the wealthiest 1 percent.
  Again and again on the floor, the Republicans have tried to tilt the 
playing field against hardworking families. This is really quite 
remarkable though. This is a great transformative moment for America 
where we can reject this assault on the middle class, this addition to 
the national debt, and instead, say: Let's go to the table and work in 
a bipartisan way to truly reform our Tax Code so that we can be 
competitive in the world; so that families can thrive, and that they 
can have the deductions that are fair for them and needed, and not 
taken away from them, but not taken away from corporate America. So we 
stand ready to go in a bipartisan way to work to do this.
  Any tax cuts, because this isn't just tax cuts to the rich--that is 
not tax reform--any tax cuts, any agenda like that has to be bipartisan 
in order for it to be sustainable. So let's come to our senses here. 
Common sense says--well, mathematics says, if you take a lot of money 
from many people to give it to a few, you are exacerbating the 
disparity of opportunity equity income in our country.
  This is the wrong thing to do. It is not what our values are about. 
It is really a shame that they would even bring such a document to the 
floor. Anybody who lives in a district where their deductions, the tax 
deductions for State and local taxes, are taken away from individual 
filers, but not for corporations, as the bill determines, to the tune--
and I can read you all of the statistics across the country about how 
devastating this is--as our own Governor said: How could they do that 
to our State or any State without the department of finance of our 
States saying: Wait a minute. Understand what this does to the economy 
of our State. Understand what this does to our individual filers in our 
State.
  Who said that this document that came over from the Senate should 
have such a devastating impact on States and Members coming to the 
floor and endorsing it. Some say: Oh, I am just voting for the budget, 
but it really isn't what it--no. No. You are putting your name next to 
taking the deduction of homeownership and of State and local taxes away 
from your constituents. They are going to know that. I would rather you 
reject this. We don't want a political argument. We want to protect the 
American people.
  That is why I hope everyone here would come down in favor of the 
middle class and reject this assault, this rip-off, this shakedown of 
the middle class that the Republicans have on the floor.

                              {time}  1030

  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mooney).
  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, we had a Democratic 
President, John F. Kennedy, who cut taxes when he was President. I 
think he would take issue with a lot of the things that have been said 
by his own party.
  It has been 30 years since we addressed taxes in this country. 
President Ronald Reagan addressed it 30 years ago. We are way overdue 
for tax cuts in the United States of America.
  Everybody knows that the 35 percent tax rate on corporations has 
driven companies overseas. West Virginia saw, just a couple of years 
ago, one of our largest remaining corporate headquarters, Mylan 
Pharmaceuticals, relocate overseas to avoid the taxes that are too high 
in this country. We all know that is a problem. We have a plan we are 
putting forward to try to solve it.
  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle: Where is your 
plan?
  You have no plan. This is all political. All you do is make political 
attacks. You have had meetings recently and said: Don't offer a plan. 
Let's just attack the Republicans for their plan.

[[Page H8253]]

  At least we have a plan to address this because hardworking taxpayers 
in West Virginia and America need and expect us to deliver on these tax 
cuts. So I rise in strong support of the budget today so we can move 
forward with our tax cut plan.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, it is now my delight to yield 2 minutes to 
the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), who is the chairman 
of the Ways and Means Committee.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, with this budget, we have an 
opportunity to move forward on a major priority for the American 
people, which is delivering the first overhaul of America's broken Tax 
Code in more than three decades.
  When you look, today, at the way America is taxed, it doesn't take 
long to recognize this is completely and utterly broken. You can see 
that it is so complex it forces millions of families and job creators 
to spend billions of hours and dollars each year just filing their 
taxes.
  It is unfair. It gives wasteful Washington lobbyists loopholes and 
carve-outs to special interests by giving hardworking Americans nothing 
but frustration.
  You can see that our Tax Code is miserably uncompetitive. That is why 
more and more of our American businesses and good-paying jobs are going 
overseas to countries with more modern and more competitive tax 
systems.
  By passing this budget today, we can send a clear message to the 
American people: real tax reform is on the way. A ``no'' vote, as we 
heard from our Democratic colleagues, is to block tax reform and defend 
the status quo.
  We are all working closely with President Trump as he leads this 
charge. Together, we have bold ideas to deliver more jobs, fairer 
taxes, and bigger paychecks for all Americans this year.
  I want to thank Chairman Black and the Budget Committee for all their 
hard work. I want to encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes''--vote 
``yes''--on tax reform, and join me in taking an important historic 
step forward to deliver on our tax reform promise.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would just like to say that, for anyone 
watching this debate or watching any of our discussions out there in 
the country, I know it often appears that we don't get along, that we 
hate each other, and that we are at each other's throat, but nothing 
could be further from the truth.
  It has been such an honor to work with Chairman Black as a member of 
the Budget Committee and all the Members. We do all respect each other 
and get along. We just have some very serious disagreements about 
policy. That is fair. That is what this country is about.
  Once again, since I may not get to do it again as Chairman Black 
pursues another office and probably won't appear with me on the same 
program anymore, I just want to wish her the best and say what a joy it 
has been to work with her.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is 
remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 30 
seconds remaining.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, in 30 seconds, I want to once again say 
thank you to my colleague from the other side. I have enjoyed working 
with him. This is history. We are going to make history.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in their support of the 
budget because doing so means that we can truly benefit the American 
people, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.
  Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the previous question is ordered.
  The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from 
Tennessee (Mrs. Black).
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15-
minute vote on the motion to concur will be followed by a 5-minute vote 
on the motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 1698.
  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 216, 
nays 212, not voting 5, as follows:

                             [Roll No. 589]

                               YEAS--216
