                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, the fountain of wisdom, thank You for hearing and 
answering our prayers.
  Lord, You have given us so much, blessing us in immeasurable ways. 
You have exceeded our own expectations. For that, God, we are grateful. 
We thank You for this great country, for our leadership, and for the 
women and men who serve in this body. Help them to remember, God, that 
this is Your country and they are Your stewards but for a moment in 
time. We pray that You will help us move forward with faith in 
tomorrow, knowing You will transform our thoughts, words, and actions 
according to Your divine will.
  We pray in Your heavenly Name. Amen.
