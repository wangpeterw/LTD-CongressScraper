               PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ``ART OF THE DEAL'' BOOK

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, those who are fair-minded and want 
to understand President Trump better should read his best-selling book 
from 30 years ago, which is as timely today as it was then. It is 
called ``The Art of the Deal'' and reveals these characteristics.
  Donald Trump usually makes decisions quickly based on knowledge, 
experience, and intuition, rather than waiting for consultants' 
studies. He is a tough but practical negotiator willing to compromise 
to achieve a goal. He gets a deal done sooner or later, even if it 
sometimes takes years.
  He is a counterpuncher who doesn't like to start a fight but will 
give more than he receives. He is loyal to friends who are loyal to 
him.
  Most of the President's actions should be of no surprise to anyone 
who has read his book. In fact, those who are objective are likely to 
appreciate him more.
