                              S. Res. 375

       Whereas the University of Alabama Crimson Tide football 
     team won the 2018 National Collegiate Athletic Association 
     College Football Playoff National Championship, defeating the 
     University of Georgia Bulldogs by a score of 26 to 23 at the 
     Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 10, 
     2018;
       Whereas this victory marks the fifth College Football 
     National Championship in the last 9 years for the University 
     of Alabama and the 17th National Championship overall;
       Whereas the 2018 National Collegiate Athletic Association 
     College Football Playoff National Championship was the 69th 
     postseason football bowl appearance and the 39th football 
     bowl victory for the University of Alabama;
       Whereas the 2017-2018 Crimson Tide football team 
     consistently showed perseverance in the midst of adversity, 
     including overcoming a 13-point deficit in the second half of 
     the National Championship game;
       Whereas the 2018 National Collegiate Athletic Association 
     College Football Playoff National Championship game was the 
     first National Championship game to extend into overtime;
       Whereas head coach Nick Saban has now won 6 College 
     Football National Championships, equaling the modern-era 
     record of former University of Alabama football head coach 
     Paul ``Bear'' Bryant;
       Whereas this victory extends the record of Coach Saban to 
     127 wins and 20 losses in a decade of dominance;
       Whereas ``The Process'', as outlined by Coach Saban, has 
     produced not only quality student-athletes, but well-rounded 
     young men;
       Whereas members of the 2017-2018 Crimson Tide football team 
     have been honored by various awards throughout the season and 
     during the postseason;
       Whereas Chancellor Ray Hayes, President Stuart Bell, and 
     Athletic Director Greg Byrne have emphasized the importance 
     of academic success to the Crimson Tide football team and to 
     all student-athletes at the University of Alabama; and
       Whereas the 2017-2018 Crimson Tide football team has 
     brought great pride and honor to the University of Alabama, 
     the loyal fans of the Crimson Tide, and the entire State of 
     Alabama: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
