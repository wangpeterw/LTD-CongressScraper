     the 8th grade, many girls were dropping out of school, had 
     low self-esteem, and lacked confidence;
       Whereas, in 2003, the name of the program was changed to 
     ``Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work'' so that boys who face 
     many of the same challenges as girls could also be involved 
     in the program;
       Whereas, in 2017, the mission of the program, to develop 
     ``innovative strategies that empower girls and boys to 
     overcome societal barriers to reach their full potential'',

     participants annually in more than 3,000,000 organizations 
     and workplaces representing each State;
       Whereas, in 2007, the Take Our Daughters To Work program 
     transitioned to Elizabeth City, North Carolina, became known 
     as the Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work Foundation, and 
     received national recognition for its dedication to future 
     generations;
       Whereas, every year, mayors, governors, and other private 
     and public officials sign proclamations and lend support to 
     Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work Day;
       Whereas the fame of the Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work 
     program has spread overseas, with requests and inquiries 
     being made from around the world on how to operate the 
     program;
       Whereas 2017 marks the 24th anniversary of the Take Our 
     Daughters And Sons To Work program;
       Whereas Take Our Daughters And Sons to Work Day will be 
     observed on Thursday, April 27, 2017; and
       Whereas, by offering opportunities for children to 
     experience activities and events, Take Our Daughters And Sons 
     To Work Day is intended to continue helping millions of girls 
     and boys on an annual basis to examine their opportunities 
     and strive to reach their fullest potential: Now, therefore, 
     be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) recognizes the goals of introducing our daughters and 
     sons to the workplace; and
       (2) commends all participants of Take Our Daughters And 
     Sons To Work Day for the--
       (A) ongoing contributions that the participants make to 
     education; and
       (B) vital role that the participants play in promoting and 
     ensuring a brighter, stronger future for the United States.
