                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Almighty God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We pray for the gift of wisdom to all with great responsibility in 
this people's House for the leadership of our Nation.
  With the inception of debates and consideration of a tax bill, send 
Your spirit of honesty, clarity, and respect upon the Members of the 
people's House. The issue at hand is monumental, and the differences 
that are apparent will need addressing so that a bill that benefits the 
Nation might be produced.
  May all Members, with Your grace, rise to the importance of this 
great challenge with integrity and professional excellence.
  May all their efforts in the days and weeks to come redound to the 
benefit of all Americans, and inspire all to proclaim Your greater 
honor and glory.
  Amen.
