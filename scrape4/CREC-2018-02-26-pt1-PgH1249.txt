           EXPANSION OF CHICAGO O'HARE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, the city of Chicago and Chicago's 
airline carriers are finalizing their negotiations for an $8.5 billion 
expansion of Chicago O'Hare International Airport. This will provide it 
with a state-of-the-art global terminal. This plan will bring more 
tourism, more economic activity, and more jobs to the Chicago area, 
while making it more necessary than ever to complete the Elgin O'Hare 
Western Access Project.
  This project has won support from every faction: Chicago and the 
suburbs, Republicans and Democrats, business and labor, and even Cubs 
and Sox fans. It is clear why. Western Access would create nearly 
20,000 jobs: 7,400 in direct construction and more than 3,000 in 
engineering; another 6,000 indirect jobs would be created for equipment 
suppliers and contractors.
  Once the project is completed, our region would realize 65,000 
permanent jobs: 44,000 in Cook County, and nearly half that many in 
DuPage.
  With the O'Hare of the future in development, it is time we complete 
Western Access and allow our region to reap the rewards.
