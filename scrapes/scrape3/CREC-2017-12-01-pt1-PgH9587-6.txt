                         OPPOSE SENATE TAX BILL

  (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against the 
Senate's version of the tax reform bill because this bill will hurt the 
central coast in California.
  By fully repealing the State and local tax deduction, 177,000 
households in my district that deduct an average of $23,000 each year 
will be hurt.
  By repealing the student loan interest deduction, low- and middle-
income students in my district will find college further out of reach 
and will be hurt.
  By allowing individual tax cuts to expire on people earning less than 
$75,000, over 140,000 households in my district will see their taxes go 
up and they will be hurt.
  Now, with confirmation that the tax cuts will not pay for themselves 
but will add over $1 trillion to our debt, this tax reform bill will be 
a tax burden bill not only for my constituents in my district, but for 
all of our constituents in our Nation. Worse, this bill will hurt

not only my two daughters, but all of our sons and daughters.
  That is why I oppose the Senate bill, and I urge my colleagues to do 
the same.
