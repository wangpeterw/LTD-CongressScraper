                    LET'S ACT NOW ON CLIMATE CHANGE

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, my constituents and I are so blessed 
to live, to work, and to play in the paradise that is south Florida. 
But for our kids and our grandchildren to enjoy the same positive 
experiences that we have had, it is vital that we act now to combat 
climate change.
  Creating a thoughtful dialogue on Capitol Hill about the harmful 
impact of climate change is essential for us to be able to take 
proactive action toward solving the challenges brought about by this 
real and growing threat.
  Congress can no longer dispute the fact that sea level rise has been 
occurring steadily over the last 100 years. I have seen firsthand how 
our streets keep flooding from king tides, which impacts our 
constituents, businesses, tourism, and our economic livelihood.
  There is positive progress emerging from south Florida. We have led 
on sea level rise proposals with the Miami-Dade County Sea Level Rise 
Task Force and the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that we put partisan politics aside and tackle the 
inevitable threat of climate change.
