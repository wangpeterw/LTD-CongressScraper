                  VIRGINIA INSTITUTE FOR PASTORAL CARE

  (Mr. McEACHIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. McEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the 50th 
anniversary of the Virginia Institute for Pastoral Care, also known as 
VIPCare.
  In 1967, 12 concerned citizens founded VIPCare and built a unique, 
unprecedented organization that continues to serve our community, and 
several Virginians, today.
  VIPCare is a not-for-profit, interfaith institution that provides 
marriage, family, and substance abuse counseling, as well as training 
and support for the clergy. They are the oldest pastoral counseling 
center in the United States.
  VIPCare proudly serves more than 900 children, teenagers, adults, 
older Americans, families, and couples every year at their two 
locations in Richmond and the six other locations throughout Virginia. 
VIPCare does not turn people away, regardless of the cost. For 50 
years, they have provided thousands with a community space for 
compassion, hope, and comfort.
  Madam Speaker, today, and every day, I am so proud of VIPCare and the 
work they do to care for Virginians.
