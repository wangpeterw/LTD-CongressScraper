                HONORING THE LIFE OF WILLIAM PULTE, SR.

  (Mr. TROTT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of William 
Pulte, Sr. He passed away earlier this month at the age of 85.
  In 1950, at the age of 18, Bill Pulte started building and selling 
homes in southeast Michigan. In 1956, he founded Pulte Homes, known 
today as the Pulte Group. Over the next 50 years, he grew the company 
into the largest homebuilder in the United States.
  Bill Pulte was a legend in the business world, but his legacy is one 
of great devotion to his family and community. He was involved with the 
Angel Fund, a group which anonymously provides families in Detroit with 
shelter. His philanthropy helped Cornerstone Schools provide thousands 
of young people in Detroit with a great education, and his passion for 
homebuilding took him all the way to Central America to help its 
poorest communities.
  So it is most appropriate that we pause today from our Nation's 
business to remember and celebrate the life of Bill Pulte. His hard 
work, devotion, and vision changed the world for the better, and for 
that, we thank him.
