                   LIBERATION OF MARAWI, PHILIPPINES

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, sadly, radical Islamic 
terrorists continue their assault on innocent victims across the world.
  This month, there were ISIS-inspired knife attacks in France and 
Canada, as well as the surprise attack in Niger, with mass murders of 
worshippers at mosques in Kabul.
  Gratefully, there are victories over the terrorists, such as the 
recent liberation of Raqqa, Syria, and now in the Philippines.
  Congratulations to the people of the Philippines, successfully led by 
President Rodrigo Duterte and their courageous military, on the recent 
liberation of Marawi from ISIS militants.
  Marawi is the capital city of over 200,000 citizens in the province 
of Lanao del Sur on the island of Mindanao, which has been under ISIS 
control since the end of May. Innocent families were persecuted in this 
murderous occupation.
  While liberating Marawi from ISIS control is a milestone in 
combatting global terrorism, this fight is far from finished. We must 
be successful to defeat the terrorists overseas to protect American 
families at home.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
