 CHANGES TO AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT DO NOT REMEDY BILL'S SHORTCOMINGS

  (Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise because evidently, in the House 
of Representatives, we will be taking up the possible passage of a 
revised but, as yet, unseen American Health Care Act.
  I rise to urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote 
against this. The CBO has not scored it, so we don't know how much it 
will cost. We don't know how many Americans will be thrown off their 
health care.
  I want to quote Dr. Andrew Gurman, who is the president of the 
American Medical Association, who said this today:
  ``Not only would the AHCA eliminate health insurance coverage for 
millions of Americans, the legislation would, in many cases, eliminate 
the ban against charging those with underlying medical conditions 
vastly more for their coverage.''
  This is a bad bill that has gotten worse with time. We haven't seen 
it. It hasn't been scored for money or how many patients will be thrown 
off their health care. It will hurt patients, it will hurt medical 
providers, it will hurt hospitals, and it will hurt this country.
  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.
