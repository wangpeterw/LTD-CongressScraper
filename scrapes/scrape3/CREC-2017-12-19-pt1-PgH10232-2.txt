                       IN MEMORY OF AGNES DOSTER

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life 
of Mrs. Agnes Doster, who passed away on Monday, December 4, at the age 
of 79.
  Originally from Forsyth, Georgia, Mrs. Doster worked for 40 years in 
the Secretary of the Senate's office in the Georgia State Capitol. She 
served in a number of different capacities there with dedication since 
1968, always making the Georgia State Capitol run more efficiently, 
while promoting good government.
  Outside of her time working as a civil servant, Mrs. Doster was very 
active in the First Baptist Church of Snellville for over 45 years. 
There, she sang in the choir, played hand bells, directed weddings, and 
taught the 2-year-old Sunday school class.
  She is survived by family all over the State of Georgia, including 
her husband, sister, children, grandchildren, and 30 nieces and 
nephews.
  Mrs. Doster's bright spirit will surely be missed by everyone around 
the Georgia State Capitol.
