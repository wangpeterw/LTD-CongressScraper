                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Spirit of God, descend on our hearts. For apart from You, we live our 
lives in vain. May our Senators walk in Your ways, keeping Your 
precepts with such integrity that they will never be ashamed. Lord, 
incline their hearts to Your wisdom, providing them with the 
understanding they need to accomplish Your purposes in our world. Let 
Your mercy protect them from the dangers of this life, as they learn to 
find delight in Your guidance. Keep them ever mindful of the fewness of 
their days and the greatness of their work. Remove from them any 
bitterness or resentment that corrodes their peace. Deliver them from 
the tyranny of trifles, as they strive to accomplish Your work on 
Earth.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
