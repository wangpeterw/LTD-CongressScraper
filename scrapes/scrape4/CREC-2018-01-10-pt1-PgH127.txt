                                  DACA

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, Congress must stop deferring the American 
Dream for bright young people simply because they were brought here as 
children.
  DACA recipients represent the best of our Nation. These are young 
people who are in school, got their education, or served in our Armed 
Forces. These are people who never committed a felony offense or 
significant misdemeanor. These are people who pose no threat to public 
safety. These are people who just want to live the American Dream, and 
each day that passes without Congress voting on the Dream Act darkens 
their futures.
  Mr. Speaker, if it is numbers my esteemed colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle want, I have got them. Deporting DACA recipients 
would cost the U.S. economy $400 billion. Deporting the 5,300 eligible 
people for DACA in my district alone would cost the economy $140 
million.
  Aren't we supposed to be growing the economy, not shrinking it?
