           RECOGNIZING FLO FABRIZIO ON A LIFETIME OF SERVICE

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a 
true public servant, State representative Flo Fabrizio.
  Representative Fabrizio has served the Erie region for nearly 45 
years. He announced last week that he would not seek reelection to a 
ninth term representing the State's second legislative district.
  Mr. Speaker, there are probably few issues that Representative 
Fabrizio and I agree on politically, but he has always been a gentleman 
and someone who truly represents his constituents.
  Representative Fabrizio began his service in 2002 in the Pennsylvania 
House of Representatives. Prior to that election, he served for 20 
years as Erie County clerk.
  He is a lifelong resident of Erie and has been active in the 
community serving as a charter member for the Erie Museum Authority, 
board member for Pleasant Ridge Manor, and as a member of many other 
philanthropic and charitable organizations.
  Mr. Speaker, Representative Fabrizio has been diligent and dedicated, 
and he has served his hometown and the Commonwealth with distinction. I 
wish him the best in his retirement, and I hope he will enjoy spending 
time with his wife, Victoria, and his children.
