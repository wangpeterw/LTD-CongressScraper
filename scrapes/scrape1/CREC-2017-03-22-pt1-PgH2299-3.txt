                                 PRAYER

  Dr. Tom Smiley, Lakewood Baptist Church, Gainesville, Georgia, 
offered the following prayer:
  In the name that is above every name, in the name of the One by whom 
all things were created and by whom all things created are sustained, 
in the name of the One who was crucified for the sins of all people, 
raised on the third day, and who, upon His return, every knee will bow 
and every tongue confess is Lord, in the name of Jesus, my Savior and 
my Lord, today, I ask:
  Draw near unto thyself the heart of any in this body who still remain 
far from You.
  Give confidence and courage to all who govern from this House, to be 
unashamed of the Judeo-Christian ethic, which has led this Nation to 
prominence and prosperity above all other nations.
  And Father, remind all, who by faith trust You that Your love wants 
what is best for us, Your wisdom knows what is best for us, and Your 
power will accomplish what is best for us.
  In Jesus' name and God's people.
  Amen.
