 SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 16--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR STRENGTHENING 
  ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE ASIA-PACIFIC ECONOMIC 
                              COOPERATION

  Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following 
concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations:

                            S. Con. Res. 16

       Whereas the United States and the other members of the 
     Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (in this preamble referred 
     to as ``APEC'') have, since 1989, worked collaboratively to 
     advance commercial and trade interests in the Asia-Pacific 
     region;
       Whereas the Asia-Pacific region accounts for 41 percent of 
     the world's population, 54 percent of the world's gross 
     domestic product, and 44 percent of the world's trade;
       Whereas expanding trade and investment between the United 
     States and the Asia-Pacific region has created new commercial 
     opportunities and jobs in the United States;
       Whereas United States businesses in the Asia-Pacific region 
     face obstacles to doing business in the region as a result of 
     tariff and nontariff barriers, including discriminatory 
     policies and regulations;
       Whereas strengthening trade and investment between the 
     United States and other APEC members and addressing tariff 
     and nontariff barriers to United States exports has the 
     potential to benefit United States businesses, manufacturers, 
     farmers, ranchers, workers, and consumers;
       Whereas APEC was established as a regional economic forum 
     to leverage the growing interdependence of the Asia-Pacific 
     region to create greater prosperity for the people of the 
     region and serves as a forum for the United States to address 
     business concerns, promote high standards, and facilitate 
     economic growth in the region;
       Whereas APEC contributes to United States economic policies 
     that promote fairness, due process, and the rule of law by 
     supporting trade rules embodied in the World Trade 
     Organization (in this preamble referred to as the ``WTO'') 
     and the establishment of new WTO commitments, developing 
     model measures for high quality trade agreements in the Asia-
     Pacific region, encouraging coherence in regulations and 
     standards in the region, and encouraging policies to promote 
     development of the digital economy; and
       Whereas the APEC Leaders' Meeting in November 2017 in Da 
     Nang, Vietnam, and preparatory meetings at the ministerial 
     level, including the meeting in May 2017 of the APEC 
     Ministers Responsible for Trade, provide important 
     opportunities to demonstrate to the world the commitment of 
     the United States to increasing prosperity and security in 
     the Asia-Pacific region: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives 
     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) the continuing success of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
     Cooperation (in this resolution referred to as ``APEC'') is 
     in the national economic interest of the United States;
       (2) APEC should be a part of the diplomatic and economic 
     strategy of the United States for the Asia-Pacific region; 
     and
       (3) the United States should continue to engage APEC in 
     promoting economic growth through the adoption of rules-based 
     policies to strengthen trade and investment between the 
     United States and other APEC members.
