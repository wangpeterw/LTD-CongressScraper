            MILK IS A CORNERSTONE OF STUDENTS' SCHOOL LUNCH

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about 
a cornerstone of a student school lunch: milk.
  Milk is the number one source of nine essential nutrients in the diet 
of many young Americans, and it provides significant health benefits. 
But over the past few years, milk consumption has been on the decline 
in school lunch programs. That is why, together with Representative Joe 
Courtney, I introduced the School Milk Nutrition Act of 2017.
  Our bill would ease unnecessary regulations preventing milk 
consumption

in school lunch programs. The bipartisan bill recognizes the importance 
of milk to the health and well-being of school children. It also works 
to improve the variety and availability of milk offered in schools, 
which was supported by U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny 
Purdue earlier this year. In May, Secretary Purdue directed USDA to 
begin the process of allowing schools to serve 1 percent flavored milk 
through the school meals program.
  When schoolchildren don't drink milk, they are missing out on 
essential nutrients. I urge my colleagues to support this bill so 
another generation of children can fall in love with milk.
