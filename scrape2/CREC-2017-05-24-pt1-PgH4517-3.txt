                    WELCOMING PASTOR BECKY TIRABASSI

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Rohrabacher) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor today to introduce 
to the House our guest chaplain, Becky Tirabassi, co-pastor of the 
Viewpoint Church in Newport Beach, California.
  Becky became a licensed pastor in 2014, when she and her husband, Dr. 
Roger Tirabassi, founded the Viewpoint Church. Today, she and her 
husband give spiritual guidance and personal counseling to members of 
the Viewpoint Church, but also to people throughout Orange County 
needing personal and spiritual encouragement.
  Becky was helping others even before she became a pastor. She is best 
known as an author of over 15 books, including the best-selling books, 
``Change Your Life'' and ``Little Changes Big Results for Crazy, Busy 
Couples.'' She has appeared many times on national television and 
radio, and for over three decades has spoken before groups in nearly 
all 50 States, as well as internationally. In addition to her co-
pastorate, she is president of the Becky Tirabassi Change Your Life, 
Incorporated.
  Becky and Roger have one married son, who is a grown man, and he has 
just completed a tour as a missionary in Uganda. For that safe return, 
we are all grateful.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming Pastor Becky 
Tirabassi, and thank her for offering today's opening prayer in the 
U.S. House of Representatives.
