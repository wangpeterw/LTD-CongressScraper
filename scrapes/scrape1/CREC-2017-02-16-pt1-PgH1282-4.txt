              LAUDING MANUFACTURING EXTENSION PARTNERSHIPS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak 
about the important role the Manufacturing Extension Partnership plays 
in strengthening U.S. manufacturing. This public-private partnership 
consists of a nationwide system of centers located throughout the 
United States.
  Manufacturers can receive several services by visiting a designated 
MEP center, including workforce development, supply chain development, 
commercialization, exporting, and many other helpful strategies.
  I recently had the opportunity to meet with the Innovative 
Manufacturers' Center in my home district. The IMC works to increase 
the innovation, productivity, and growth for manufacturers in central 
Pennsylvania. Over the past 25 years, IMC has helped more than 600 
manufacturing companies in its 12-county region of the Keystone State.
  Mr. Speaker, American manufacturing is a critical part of our 
economy. I am pleased to see that public-private partnership is working 
to help support small and midsized manufacturers.
  These are the businesses that employ our neighbors and produce 
quality made in America products. I look forward to seeing their 
continued growth, and I salute the centers nationwide that help them do 
just that.
