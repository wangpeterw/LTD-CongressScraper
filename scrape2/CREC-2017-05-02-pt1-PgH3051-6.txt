                     NATIONAL CHARTER SCHOOLS WEEK

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, this week is National Charter Schools Week, 
and I rise to recognize Arizona's leadership amongst the charter school 
community.
  Over this past school year, a record number of students attended 547 
charter schools in Arizona; and last week, a new survey found that five 
of the country's top seven high schools were Arizona charter schools, 
including one from my own district, Arizona's Fifth Congressional 
District. I am extremely proud of our charter schools.
  Arizona charter schools are thriving because of two decades of 
tireless work from advocates to give thousands of students more 
educational choices and opportunities to succeed. These leaders have 
fostered a culture that balances autonomy and accountability to prepare 
their students for higher education and the workforce.
  As the rankings prove, Arizona's policies are drastically improving 
student achievement and should be emulated by the rest of the Nation.
