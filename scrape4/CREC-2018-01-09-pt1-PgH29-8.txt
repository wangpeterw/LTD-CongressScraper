              OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING IS A RISKY PROPOSITION

  (Ms. CASTOR of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, last week, the Trump 
administration proposed opening up all of the coast of the United 
States of America to offshore oil drilling. This is a very risky 
proposition for my home State of Florida. Our economy depends on 
tourism, clean water, a strong fishing economy, and we have a military 
mission line off of the West Coast of Florida that has to be protected 
from drilling.
  We are not that far removed from the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster 
that caused loss of life, billions of dollars in economic damage, and 
significant environmental damage as well. Why would we put our economy, 
our environment, our military missions at risk for such a risky 
proposition?
  There may be appropriate places to drill for oil, but it is not off 
of the coast of the State of Florida.
  My Republican colleague Francis Rooney and I have cosponsored a 
bipartisan bill, the Florida Coastal Protection Act, H.R. 2002. I urge 
the support of the Congress in turning back this very risky proposal 
for offshore oil drilling by the Trump administration.
