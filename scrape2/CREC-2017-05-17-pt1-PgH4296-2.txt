             LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS DESERVE OUR GRATITUDE

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Police Week to 
pay tribute to the Nation's law enforcement men and women.
  Established in 1962 by President Kennedy, National Police Week serves 
as a reminder of the incredible sacrifice our police officers make 
every day to serve and protect the people in our States and 
communities.
  Just last week, Lieutenant Kevin Mainhart of the Yell County 
Sheriff's Department was killed in the line of duty during a traffic 
stop in Dardanelle, Arkansas. This tragedy reminds us of the danger 
that all of our men and women who police our streets have to face.
  Every American should be proud of our neighbors and fellow citizens 
who get up every morning, put on their uniform and badge, leave their 
families, and serve us all, keeping our cities and towns safe and 
trying to build the trust and faith among our citizens.
  I respect and appreciate the important work of our police and our law 
enforcement men and women in Arkansas and throughout the Nation. They 
deserve our gratitude.
