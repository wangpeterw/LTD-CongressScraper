             WORKING TOGETHER TO BUILD A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

  (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, late last night, Senate Republicans failed 
in their latest attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but today is 
not a day for celebration. It is a day for solutions.
  Over the past 7 years, the Affordable Care Act has expanded access to 
healthcare for millions of Americans; but the law's imperfections, 
combined with politically motivated opposition, have created a system 
that falls short of the goals we all share.
  In many communities across the country, there is not enough 
competition in the individual marketplaces, there is not enough support 
for middle class families and small businesses, and there is not nearly 
enough being done to curb the prescription drug prices that are 
swallowing family budgets.
  The good news is that we know how to solve these challenges. Now is 
the time for us to work together, Democrats and Republicans, to build a 
healthcare system that is worthy of this great Nation.
