                       REMEMBERING KATE O'BEIRNE

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, over the weekend, we 
lost one of conservatism's most insightful journalists with the passing 
of Kate O'Beirne.
  Kate was long a leading voice for conservative principles, and she 
served as mentor to so many all along the way. In a town full of class 
presidents and big shots, Kate never hesitated to help someone who was 
new to Washington or down on his luck.
  She was fiercely devoted to her country, to her faith, and to her 
family, including her husband, Jim, her two sons Phil and John, her 
sisters, and her grandchildren. Beyond her immediate family, Kate 
helped to foster a family at National Review with her wit, warmth, and 
compassion.
  As her family, friends, and many others across the Nation mourn her 
loss today, we wish them comfort in this trying time.
  As anyone who knew Kate can attest, her impact will not soon be 
forgotten.
