         GOOD LUCK TO OLYMPIANS FROM MINNESOTA'S THIRD DISTRICT

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize four athletes from 
Minnesota's Third District who will be competing in the 2018 Winter 
Olympics.
  Three are representing the United States on the women's ice hockey 
team: forward Kelly Pannek, from Plymouth, graduated from Benilde-St. 
Margaret's and is a senior now at the University of Minnesota; forward 
Dani Cameranesi, also from Plymouth, graduated from Blake and is also 
from the U of M; defender Sidney Morin, from Minnetonka, graduated from 
Minnetonka High School and also the University of Minnesota Duluth.
  On the men's side, forward Ryan Stoa is representing the United 
States on the men's ice hockey team. He graduated from Bloomington 
Kennedy and, also, the University of Minnesota.
  These four athletes join 16 other Minnesotans and the 238 other 
United States athletes as they compete in Pyeongchang, South Korea, 
later this week. Mr. Speaker, these athletes go day in and day out with 
dedication, hard work, and commitment to achieve their dreams of 
competing in the Olympics and bringing home a medal.
  So, to Kelly, Dani, Sidney, Ryan, and all of our Olympians, we wish 
you good luck, and we are cheering you on.
