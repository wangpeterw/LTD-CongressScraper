       RALPH P. AVERY TO BE AWARDED FRENCH LEGION OF HONOR MEDAL

  (Mr. FASO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate Mr. 
Ralph P. Avery of Claverack, New York, who will soon be awarded the 
French Legion of Honor Medal.
  Mr. Avery served in the U.S. Navy during World War II as a crew 
member of an LCT-571 landing craft built in upstate New York. He 
bravely stormed Omaha Beach on D-day in defense of our freedoms and in 
service of European liberation.
  On that historic day, he courageously manned a 20-millimeter gun, 
firing upon enemy positions. For his heroic actions in combat and their 
importance to our French allies, next month Mr. Avery will be formally 
awarded the French Legion of Honor Medal, France's highest honor.
  Mr. Avery has been awarded the American Campaign Medal, the European 
African Middle East Campaign Medal with a Campaign Star for the 
invasion of Normandy, the Navy Combat Action Ribbon, and the World War 
II Victory Medal.
  Mr. Speaker, we thank Ralph P. Avery and his fellow veterans for 
their outstanding service to America and the cause of liberty.
