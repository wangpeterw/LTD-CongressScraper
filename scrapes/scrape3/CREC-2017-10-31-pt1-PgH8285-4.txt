  Mr. MEADOWS changed his vote from ``nay'' to ``yea.''
  So (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and 
the bill was passed.
  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
  Stated for:
  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Madam Speaker, I had a family commitment 
and could not attend votes. Had I been present, I would have voted 
``Yea'' on rollcall No. 591.
  Mr. HURD. Madam Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been 
present, I would have voted ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 591.
