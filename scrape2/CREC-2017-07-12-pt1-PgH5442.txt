     REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS OF THE NEWARK REBELLION AND OCCUPATION

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, on July 12, 1967, a fire of rebellion sparked 
in my hometown and led to 5 days of conflict. Today we acknowledge the 
50th anniversary of the Newark riots, or as the citizens called it, the 
Newark Rebellion and Occupation, and we memorialize the 26 people who 
lost their lives in those turbulent 5 days:
  Rose Abraham,
  Elizabeth Artis,
  Mary Helen Campbell,
  Eloise Spellman,
  Eddie Moss,
  Captain Michael Moran,
  Isaac Harrison,
  Frederick Toto,
  Robert Martin,
  Albert Mersier, Jr.,
  Rufus Hawk,
  William Furr,
  Oscar Hill,
  Tedock Bell,
  Michael Pugh,
  Jessie Mae Jones,
  James Rutledge,
  Leroy Boyd,
  Rebecca Brown,
  Hattie Gainer,
  Raymond Gilmer,
  Cornelius Murray,
  Victor Louis Smith,
  James Sanders,
  Richard Taliaferro, and
  Rufus Council.
  Mr. Speaker, those were turbulent days in the city's history, but we 
have not forgotten and we have learned great lessons from that time. 
May we also never forget these lives that perished in those 5 days.
