           RECOGNIZING LIEUTENANT COMMANDER ANDREW PATTERSON

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lieutenant 
Commander Andrew Patterson, a native of Chittenango, New York, who 
currently serves as the Chief of Intelligence, Surveillance, and 
Reconnaissance Plans/Operations for the military in Afghanistan. He is 
the son of Marlene A. Patterson and the late commander, Kenneth F. 
Patterson, U.S. Navy.
  Lieutenant Commander Patterson has served in the U.S. Navy Reserves 
for 12 years, as well as serving with the U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection agency for 13 years. Stationed in Afghanistan, Lieutenant 
Commander Andrew Patterson is leading the charge on the intelligence 
collection operations against the Taliban, working closely with joint 
regional U.S. military personnel.
  In today's era of combat, the role of intelligence plays an 
especially important role in the success of our military. Lieutenant 
Commander Andrew Patterson is a true hometown hero. He is an 
inspiration to all of us and is an exceptional community leader.
  I would like to extend my gratitude to him for his answer to the call 
to serve, his bravery, and his dedication to our Nation. I wish him the 
best of luck as he continues to serve our country.
  Go Navy.
