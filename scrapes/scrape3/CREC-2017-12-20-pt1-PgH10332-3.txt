            GOP TAX BILL IS THE GREATEST TRANSFER OF WEALTH

  (Mr. BEYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, the tax bill we passed today has little in 
common with what Speaker Ryan described to us yesterday. Putting more 
money into the pockets of working people would be great, but that is 
not what they wrote this bill to do.
  I have grown a business, made payroll every 2 weeks for more than 40 
years, and invested many millions of dollars in plant and equipment. I 
still voted ``no,'' though, because I was just wise enough to realize 
that without our people, our employees, we have nothing. I would be 
enthusiastic about a tax bill that actually put more money into their 
pockets instead of mine.
  We have 381 hardworking men and women on our payroll today. Not a 
single one will benefit from the doubling

of the estate tax exclusion, but every one will be affected by the 
medical insurance premium rates, which this bill will drive up.
  Every one will be at risk when their minimal so-called tax cuts 
expire in just a few years. Mine, by the way, are permanent. Our 
children and grandchildren will suffer ever more greatly as we continue 
to balloon the Federal debt.
  This tax bill may be the greatest transfer of wealth from working 
Americans to the idle rich in the history of our country. Mr. Speaker, 
this is a very sad day for the country I love.
